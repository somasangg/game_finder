A few of the game mechanics and open world design can be a bit janky by today’s standards but it’s easy to overlook that with how much the game has to offer. The DLCs are great and add a massive amount of content to the game. \n\nThe only real downside is that you pretty much HAVE to mod the game (4gb patch, NVAC, NVTF) to get it to run smoothly/not crash every 15 mins.

      "review": "First play through finished. \n\nInitial Thoughts: \n\n1st play through: NCR ending\n\nFallout: New Vegas is one of the best RPG games I have had the pleasure of playing. With most actions having consequences, a robust cast of characters and questing to go for as long as you can take it, this really delivers an amazing experience. I have been playing through all the Fallout games in 2025, and so far this is 2nd only to Fallout 2, only for my personal opinion though. Opposed to Fallout 3, this game continues the legacy that The Chosen One had left behind in the Mojave, but with a new degree of freedom.\n\nStory & Questing: It took a while for me to really lock in with the story here, it often has an issue to me where there are so many different things to do, it is hard to just pick a route. Each route that the game offers has their own rewards, and their own downsides which makes for very good replay-ability. I Will be coming back for another play through just to see how the other choices change the characters that I grew to love. 10/10 experience for me, with amazing lore and engaging story beats that leave you wanting more. My favorite part is that this game makes your input feel valued in the story it is telling, and how every choice has been thought of and rewards the player for being curious. The Questing at times can still feel tedious as it goes for these 3D RPG's, but the majority of the time the environment is so malleable that it doesn't feel like a chore. Your cave dungeon run to grab a special item is accompanied by fun enemies, rewarding loot, and good music on the radio. The quest to quest progression in towns like Novak is extremely engaging, making you really want to figure out the secrets, help allies, or make enemies.\n\nRoleplaying: Man, this game offers everything I want in an RPG. Usually my first play through I enjoy being the good guy, and this game makes that a very fun experience, with the player actually feeling good about what they've done. Every conversation has great choices, where you can increase or decrease your karma instantly by saying the wrong thing, getting rid of the mindless pressing A just to get through it. (I don't, some people do) I also enjoy how the game isn't afraid to have you make mistakes by trying to do the right thing. Too many games now really make it just so easy to be the perfect good guy, but if you actually don't know what will happen in some of these quests you could very well kill your companion, or worse.\n\nGameplay: While this is still another clunky 3D Fallout game, it has less issues for my personal play style. The combat feels better, along with the difficulty scaling of the enemies. Deathclaws are feared, and so are the Legionaries with their fists of steel. The linear world progression is fun, giving you all the time to 100% each town you go through and grow your relationships as the courier, whether you want to be disliked or liked.\n\nDLC: This game delivers a narrative that makes you want to keep chasing The Flagbearer all day. I couldn't get enough of Elijah and Courier 5. I read every log, hacked every terminal, expended every ounce of dialogue I could and I still was left wanting more. Learning the past of your character is such a grounding experience, especially after everything you have done feels like a facade after lonesome road. This collection of DLC has been my favorite out of any game ever to play back to back, and I can't get enough. The gameplay for each suggested their own challenges like Sierra Madre being more sneak focused, and that was something I really enjoyed! I think it is fun to divvy up your gameplay styles in DLC like these in order to make sure the player really gets to try it all out.\n\nOverall: This game was an absolute blast, I would love to play it again right now but I'm saving all my replays after I finish the franchise. I cannot recommend it enough, and I really do think this is a top 20 game of all time for me. The only downside is the crashing, and some fast travel areas, but I really am just nitpicking.\n\n Fantastic game, 10/10.",

Just when I thought I've seen it all, throughout my travels I've encountered: An NCR soldier typing on an invisible terminal, a legendary variant of the common radscorpion that seems to be able to conceal its whole body underground (except for the tail), a fiend that was able to soar through the sky after I *maybe* shot him in the dome (I get that these guys love their jet, but they ain't supposed to become one!), a Boomer child that was able to bend the fabric of reality by becoming a moving statue, & a rather strange encounter in Zion Valley in which a giant yao guai practiced its special 'stuck-in-the-wall' jutsu while simultaneously charging at my friend Waking Cloud. She took this as a challenge & began to charge at the yao guai, the result being the two of them charging at each other but unable to attack. I'm still rather unfamiliar with the customs of the Sorrows Tribe (apart from their ongoing feud with yao guai), so I simply crouched down & observed. Seemingly taking this as inspiration, Waking Cloud crouched down as well & smacked the bear with her bear glove straight through the wall it was stuck in, dealing the finishing blow. After that I definitely made the right decision to take the war to the White Legs.\r\n\r\nOh, I also encountered the dreaded infinite loading screen & had to restart my computer because ALT + TAB wasn't working.

An oppressively immersive role-playing game, set not in a fantasy kingdom or a science fiction colony, but in a land of cynicism and alcohol; a place where your ability to play blackjack is often more important than your ability to shoot a rifle. No two factions share the same ideology, and not a single one is even close to being completely moral. There are no happy endings, no easy decisions, no motivations other than more excuses to walk and walk and see and see. Like a ghost. You do have a bullet in your head, after all. The game is uncomfortably cohesive, and at times the details of its player freedom are unnervingly intricate. The vision is too big, of course. The game barely functions at times. Plotlines flicker out as desperate developers reach a deadline far too close and far too cruel. Yes, in some ways, the game is a failure. Yes, its scope often serves to disappoint.

Unlike Fallout 3 or even Fallout 4 this game *feels* like an RPG instead of an FPS with dialogue trees. Unlike other entries in the 3D era of this franchise, New Vegas feels like it gives the player agency in ways that the other entries do not. The characters are well written, the questlines are interesting. Something that Bethesda has struggled with for a long time. I may just hate Bethesda, but I feel like until they can release something at or above New Vegas in quality it's deserved to a degree... especially since Obsidian didn't get their bonus for this game due to it's Metacritic score being one point off.\n\nThere is one caveat for the whole thing though... well... two. Despite being made by Obsidian, Bethesda gave them one hell of a tight deadline to work with... and with something as expansive as New Vegas... it's no wonder the game isn't actually finished. I'm not talking about story or quests or anything like that. I'm talking about it from a mechanical standpoint. The underlying codebase for the game is... bugged to hell and back. This leads into the second caveat, it's still the same horrid engine Bethesda has used from Morrorwind to Starfield. What's even worse is that New Vegas came out in 2010, right around the turn of 64-bit multithreaded processors becoming more common... but New Vegas still runs on the 32-bit version of Gamebryo. I talk down on Gamebryo often, and to be honest the engine itself IS capable... but Bethesda has retooled the hell out of their version of it and broke it in so many ways.... so when they handed it off to Obsidian to create New Vegas the tools and assets and internal logic they were working with, combined with it being the 32-bit version of the engine... means that on modern hardware it's almost impossible to play without mods, and mods still can't fix *everything*. Memory leaks, random crashes, it's unstable at it's core. It's a house of cards.\n\n\nTLDR: I absolutely recommend it, but it's unstable on more modern hardware.",

While i to am sick of the \"mods, mods, mods\" when it comes to fallout it's mostly for the bethesda ones since those suck, mods for vegas add to an already great experience instead of being replacements for content. i personally recommend going through vanilla at least once to experience the story as written without additions and the system/gameplay as we were. know how this game was and how despite the flaws became an all time classic. a word of warning for new modders recently nvse 6.4.1 was somehow scuffed and wouldn't let me get to the main menu. Don't know if it was something specific on my part but i just downloaded the older version and everything worked fine again except bad touch [a mod that adds damage sources to stuff like barbed wire and cactus]. if this has been fixed yet or if it was an issue of other mods not have been updated yet i do not know at this time. oh and to anyone new to this game farm NCR and Legion assassins to be rolling in caps, prioritize selling to the gun runners vendatron and that guy at 188 they always have the most caps, don't fall for the silver rush trap since you can't bring your guns in to sell. also be wary of casinos when with companions, back on 360 and here on PC companions lost their guns and there was no getting them back. Leave them outside unless it's a mod companion that has an assigned weapon that can't be lost like niner with his 9mm SMG or his eventual tommy gun.",

The fate of the wastelands is entirely in your hands. Every faction has its own logical reasons, beliefs, and paths, and in this sense, the game pushes you into a philosophical reflection beyond your own worldview.",

The story is well-written and fairly addictive once you start to get a feeling for the controls.\r\n\r\n6,5/10",

      "review": "There is a reason this game is considered one of the best RPG’s of all time when it came out.\n\nThe majority of my experience with this game unmodded is from playing it on the Xbox 360. Yet on another steam account I have exponentially morehours than I do on this one with modded content.\n\nYes, this game is dated, but man for it’s time it was a masterpiece.\n\nYou know the drill, positives, negatives, modding potential than overall score.\n\nWhere to begin for positives, for a game that came out in 2010 it was extraordinary. New Vegas, in my opinion, and many people will agree, has the best writing, dialogue, storytelling, lore drops, characters, companions, themes, in the entire franchise. Almost every character in this game responses and talks like a real person would. Characters have personalities and depth to them for a game that came out in 2010 that make you actually interested in them, especially the companions which are a highlight of this game. The RPG system in this game is classic with the point by system going all the way back to the 1980s. The factions have very interesting lore that are not just characters, but feel like actual living organizations with proper structure that havebenefits and faults of their own.\n\nThe guns and the gun designs in this game are wacky and fun. There are tons of memorable side characters, even one character that you made at the beginning of the game that gives you sort of the rundown of what’s going on and the starting location is memorable and you only talk to him for less than like three minutes! The writing for this game is that good for a game that came out in 2010.\n\nThe themes and how this game explores American exceptionalism and unregulated free market capitalisms consequences with how to react to them in a post apocalyptic world are exceptionally shown. Especially through the characters! \n\nThe quests are very well designed with tons of different ways on tackling them there always feels like you have a choice in this game on how you want to handle a problem. That is extremely awesome! Choice is good!  \n\nFaction leaders are multi faceted and extremely well conceptualized. The implementation of the bad karma faction in this game has probably one of the best and most intriguing faction leader in an open world rpg for that generation of games. Maybe even one of the best characters in that generation. \n\nThe themes in this game are advanced for the time, everything from Trade contract corruption, the illusion of the grandeur democracy in some cases, Hegelian dialectics, the benefits and consequences of capitalism, understanding the root causes of tribal identity versus civilization.  All and more fantastically executed in immersive dialogue and storytelling.\n\nSomewhat raunchy and racy the characters feel like they’ve been through or are in the post apocalypse. Most characters which you encounter in this game and there’s a decent amount for a game that came out in 2010.\n\nThe companions are extremely memorable in this game, all with great arcs, deep back stories, and ideas on how to benefit the wasteland or live in it. \n\nQuest design is detailed and you feel like your RPG stats  in the game progresses actually matter in terms of tackling problems!\n\nMany memorable side quests that can end up completely different given how you choose handle them. Lots of RP potential in this game.\n\nNew Vegas has a great feel to it. The locations in the game you can tell we’re made with love and passion I’ll be at there is the feeling that they were slightly rushed even for a game that came out in 2010.  There are multiple ways to handle dialogue situations a good portion of the time in the game when they matter that relate to your skill set. \n\nThe Mojave is fun to explore, the radio host is exceptionally memorable, despite not even being a real person who doesn’t talk that much. \n\nThe factions that you decide with in this game, all four of them feel like you’re engaging in a specific philosophy on how to actually handle the Mojave and the situation you find yourself in.\n\nThe antagonist for the first act of the game is memorable and insightful to how the Mojave just is in this game. The minor factions have interesting lore, good, and sometimes great quest lines and play important roles at the end of the story if you do their quests. \n\nThe art design is neat and unique. You get the Vegas feel with the opening of casinos and all of that sort of stuff, but you also get the fallout feel a little bit with the whines yet also, this game has a realism to it that many of the other fallout games post fallout three don’t have that the older titles sort of did.\n\nAll the DLC’s for this game are exceptional well written and have worlds that are unique to the Mojave that feel like actual breathing world with characters and storylines that are entertaining! Themes explored include technological advancement, religion, philosophy, ideology, isolation, redemption, acceptance,  all masterfully told. In the DLC this game made me view a robot that doesn’t even speak English has been one of the best companions in the game, that same DLC Lonesome Road, just so happens to have one of the best companions in an RPG ever with a complex grey moral compass, and interesting backstory.\n\nGet the DLCs for this game. They’re worth every single cent.\n\nObsidian knocked it out out of the park with this one. There are tons of more positives to mention but I’m running out of space.\n\nNow onto the negatives. This game is not perfect. No game is, it’s dated. Especially graphically, and the graphical improvements for this game don’t really surpass anything that fallout three the game before it offered. The gunplay is lackluster, and customization is kinda there to be there. The Mojave kinda looks ugly, but ugly in a way that looks like you’re truly in the post apocalypse desert with a touch of 50s Vegas flair. \n\nThis game on PC is terribly optimized extremely glitchy and buggy, if you don’t touch mods, get this game on console instead it’s much more stable! \nThis game is also buggy on PC, you’re gonna wanna mod up on this one. Get golfers functioning collection for the vanilla pc experience.\n\nSpeaking of mods this Games community was one of the four runners in building Nexusgames.com with Oblivion, Morrowind and other titles.\n\nThere are loads of good companion, mods and story quest mods that are out there yet I’d argue you’d have to search for them more then you you would later Bethesda titles modding community. \n\nLoads of mods that add new mechanics that can progress with you and money, sink mods that make the procrastination even more enjoyable.\n\nMod this game and if you’re new, get one of the more recommended collections for this game.\n\n\nFor the time that this game came out with its DLC’s i’m giving it a 9.1 out of 10. It would be a 9.5 if the gun play and attachment system was better.\n\nNowadays, I’d give this a 7.1 if you can tolerate bad graphics and kind of an ugly design in comparison to modern stuff\n\nWith mods nowadays, I would score it to an 8.8 out of 10. If you’re willing to go crazy, maybe an 8.9  Out of 10, you can make this game look really good with mods, and add some pretty good flushed out mechanics that work well with progress progressing through the Mojave! \n\nPost game functional ending Mojave squads and conquer the Mojave all have compatibility patches and after thinking about these three mods working together I’m bumping up the mod score to 9.1 out of 10!\n\nGet this game and mod it on pc! Or if you don’t like mods, get it cheap at the Xbox or PlayStation  store.",

Most Fallout fans will nostalgically come back to New Vegas one way or  another. Whether it's because of its branching story and quest lines which have actual consequences. Dialogue options which are tailored to your characters unique build. Or immersive world which draws you in as the hours tick by. \n\nLike with most bethesda titles, all can agree it is a buggy mess. And you will need community mods to stabilise it lest you be subject to repeat crashes or frozen loading screens. I am by no means a seasoned modder and It took me the best part of a day watching youtube tutorials to get them all working. \n\nBut once you do get it working, boy is it worth it.

In the case of New Vegas, this reliance is mandatory, and the fact that even these dedicated community fixes fail to address core issues is infuriating.The Unfixed Steam Version: The base Steam version is functionally broken. It crashes frequently, struggles with infinite loading screens, and has massive performance dips. It's appalling that Bethesda/Obsidian has allowed this masterpiece to remain in such a pathetic state on its main distribution platform.\r\nThe Vicious Cycle of Fixes: I've spent more time troubleshooting this game than actually playing it. When a major bug occurs—specifically, the one that renders certain critical areas like a \"glitched black hole\" of instability—the common advice is to install mods, run specific loaders, or perform file edits. The ultimate frustration is that none of these common, time-consuming fixes work for the worst bugs.\r\nProgress Lost to Code: The worst part is the persistent, game-breaking failure: quest triggers that stall, NPCs that vanish, or entire locations that instantly crash the game. This isn't quirky fun; it's active sabotage of the gameplay loop. Losing hours of progress because the game's flawed engine simply gives up is an unacceptable failure of product maintenance.\r\nThe Bottom Line: Pure Frustration\r\nFallout: New Vegas has all the makings of a 10/10 game, but I rate it a frustrating 6/10 because its technical instability actively prevents me from enjoying it. Unless you have the patience of a saint and don't mind the constant, heart-breaking prospect of losing your save file, wait for a truly stable remaster. The brilliance of the writing simply isn't worth the sheer anger caused by the broken code.",

In short Dialogue hell, bad main story.\n\nWith all of these issues stacked up at a certain point I just wanted the game to end but it kept dragging on to the point where I had to quit.\n\n“Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away.”",

Why the fuck is the enclave in this game out of all the games this game and fallout 4 did not need them they add nothing to both games hell the side quest isnt even good u fuck with some guy and then do a ton of dialogue and gg thats it i guess they back now. the only legitimately good parts about this game is the in game characters/npc's and factions 60% of witch they took from the first 2 games but ill give them a pass because they are so close they could have made kaiser's caesars more interesting though I heard they were rushed so they couldn't finish it tragic. would have been cool to learn a little bit more about a massive faction other than we do slaves and **** tribes over.\r\n\r\nDont play this game just read up on the lore it adds or watch someone play it \r\n\r\nfinal thing the modding community for this game is really good thanks for fixing crashes and bugs witch should be fixed \r\nplease stop deep throating this game thanks",

Despite being a 32bit application capable of 4Gb of ram usage, it allocates only 2Gb instead of 4Gb, and seems to have an additional buffer of 2-3Gb, which..... I'm even unsure why... It's never actually used.... Whenever the games RAM climbs above 1Gb it will crash.... It's unfortunate, and not really known why, other than it's an old 32Gb game for consoles and PC from older times...\r\n\r\nThis means: You will need a mod to increase the allocation size of the memory to 4Gb and manually adjust it's allocations, as well as other gross and disgusting hacks and mods to open up the memory (Do not disable DEP or you could corrupt Windows), and EVEN with these stability fixes, it will still crash.... \r\n\r\nOntop of all of this the game is setup with a grotesque ini file for both FalloutPref.ini and Fallout.ini that expunges important substrings, such as bBorderless, and bMouseAcceleration... \r\n\r\nThe game includes a horrifying mouse acceleration that will absolute annoy you, there is no such thing as aim so you will be using VATS a lot unless you add bMouseAcceleration=0, and a series of other configuration edits that were never included in the games files....\r\n\r\nOntop of this, the games settings and preferences do not actually work, you cannot go Borderless, Windowed, or set resolutions higher than 1480p in the settings, or both the ini configuration files, and this will require, yes.... Another mod..... \r\n\r\nUnfortunately... Fallout4 is very much the same where it requires tweaking ini configuration files and adding substrings inside to get borderless windowed 1920p \r\n\r\nSo:\r\nMajor Instability\r\nLots of crashing\r\nLots of saving the game every time you kill or harvest\r\nForced mouse acceleration that is extremely aggressive and requires VATs\r\nPossibly mods or \"tips/tricks/memory hacks\" that could even corrupt windows itself if you are not careful\r\nNo Windowed mode\r\nNo Borderless\r\nNo 1920 resolution\r\nOh also inventory bugs that cause you to lose items out of the inventory oddly. Especially during a cell buffer... Which seems to also be the cause of memory leaking\r\n\r\nGreat work Bethesda.... Great work Obsidian....",
