Buying Catan versions/expansions was confusing at first, but I managed. I play only with the AI. I don't play with other people.\n\nI regularly try to make the AI agree to my 2:1 offer, and sometimes I have success, so I don't experience the bug with AI always denying offers mentioned in other comments.\n\nThere is one bug that is slightly annoying, although not game-breaking. If the AI has a list of actions it is doing and one of them (not the last one) is requesting a trade, and you click to make your own offer when it is still doing things, the trade window is opened and immediately closed when the next AI action is done. After this window is closed in this way, the bot stops and the game does not progress.\nWorkaround: exit the game and load it again from the autosave. Then, wait for the bot to finish its actions and only then react to the trade offer.\n\nMy other complaint is that there are no \"Starfarers\" available, there is no \"Dawn of Humankind\" available, and there is no option to make roads removable as in some house rules. My biggest complaint about traditional Catan is that roads, unlike ships, cannot be moved or removed once they are placed, which sometimes leads to frustrating situations.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with this game, but I would be even happier once the things I mentioned above are addressed.",

The core game is all here: trading, building, and trying to get to 10 victory points before your friends (or sneaky AI).\n\nIt's a faithful adaptation with clean visuals and a functional interface. It's the best way to play Catan online without setting up a physical board. However, be prepared for a somewhat clunky menu navigation and a monetization model that requires separate purchases for almost every expansion and visual extra. The game can also feel a bit slow at times.",

I payed the full version of the game and even talked few friends and my girlfriend in to buying the game. We did play for a few months.. Laggy, buggy but it was working so and so. But for the last year and a half, or even longer, it is simply not working. When I log in, game tries to load last party on which it stuck, more than a year ago. My GF is stuck in the same party. I can't exit that party. Tried reinstalling, updating game, steam.. Nothing helps. So, BIG and honest DISLIKE for this game.",
