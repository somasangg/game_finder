Just watching all the students is really funny. But well, of course I played the game to 100 percent and I really have to say that the game is very repetitive from a certain point and that's the only and also huge negative point of the game. But hey it's a tycoon, what can you expect. Anyway, the dlcs were very good. You had to fulfill certain things to unlock more properties in the level, which was not done in the base game, which I found very disappointing. You could just unlock everything with money.

      "review": "Two Point Campus takes the same charm and humor from Two Point Hospital and moves it into a full college management setup. Instead of running a hospital, you are building a university from the ground up, designing classrooms, placing decorations, hiring staff, and keeping students happy enough to actually pass their classes.\n\nThe presentation is bright and friendly, with that same Two Point County humor. The courses are over the top in the best way. You can run a Knight School where students learn sword fighting, a Wizardry program, Virtual Normality, Archaeology digs, or even a full Gastronomy course where students make giant cupcakes and massive pizzas. The animations give each class personality and make the campus feel alive without turning chaotic.\n\nThe gameplay is smooth and easy to learn. You build lecture halls, libraries, dorms, clubs, and student lounges. You hire teachers, assistants, and janitors, and each one has skills that help or hurt your campus. Training staff matters a lot in this game, and it is straightforward to manage. Clicking around feels natural, and the menus are clean and simple to follow.\n\nStudent life is the heart of the game. You are not just running buildings. You have to manage friendships, clubs, dorm quality, hygiene, entertainment, relationships, and events like parties or concerts. Students have personalities, needs, and requests, and keeping them happy directly affects their grades and your campus rating. It adds a layer of strategy that feels different from the hospital version but still just as easy to understand.\n\nMoney management stays important. You need to balance tuition, building upgrades, staff salaries, and course expansions as your campus grows. Each year has its own setup phase before students arrive, so you get time to build and prepare before the pace picks up.\n\nEvery campus in the game has its own challenges. Some focus on research, others on sports, others on strict academic performance. As you earn one star at a campus, you can keep going for two and three stars if you want a bigger challenge, or move on to the next campus to unlock more buildings and courses.\n\nOverall, Two Point Campus keeps the humor and style of Two Point Hospital but adds deeper management around students and school life. It is smooth, colorful, and full of personality. A great pick if you like building games, management sims, or anything with a relaxed but engaging pace.",

I know that a lot of people think that Hospital is better because it is fairly hard to fail at Campus, and Hospital in turn requires a lot more strategy, but I found the much more casual Campus to be more enjoyable as I'm not great at this sort of game. Felt like a lot less time being wasted on failed maps and such. \r\n\r\nIt took just over 50 hours to both 100% the achievements and also get 3 stars in every map, and I didn't touch the challenge maps so there's likely even more playtime there if you wanted it. I think there was also a sandbox mode but I didn't touch it if there was one, as it felt like the campaign is just the right length to stay enjoyable without getting too stale.\r\n\r\nRan very well, with I think only one crash, and only a little bit of lagginess when you've got 300+ students and 100+ staff all romping around, most of which would happen upon editing the building or moving rooms around (as I assume it has to re-pathfind everyone).\r\n\r\nSolid game really.

      "review": "My assumption is that most people will either really enjoy this game, or they won't, with very little in between. Perfect low-effort management/building sim to sink literal tens of hours at a time into if you, like me, are afflicted by the type of anxious-obsessive personality that both craves order and control, and yet is easily overwhelmed by the endless optimization spirals of even traditionally \"cozy\" games like Stardew Valley. The nature of the gameplay is admittedly repetitious, and at its core, it's basically a room-building floorplan simulator with a pretty forgiving business management sim overlaid on top- which is exactly the type of gameplay I've been craving since the death of flash, but I'm sure isn't for everyone. I also can't speak to it is an entry into the Two Points series, since this is the only game by the developers that I've played. How it might stand in comparison to the rest of the franchise, or whether it will meet the expectations of otherwise established fans, I wouldn't know. \n\nThis game is sort of a tycoon sim, sort of a management sim, but the core resource you're managing is really physical space more than it is money. That lends to it an almost puzzle-esque style of play; you're trying to figure out the most efficient layout to fit as much as possible onto limited plots of campus land, while still maintaining functional and efficacious pathing that allows the members of your school to move around freely, attend classes, and consistently access facilities to help keep their needs met. That means bathrooms, dorms, break rooms, lecture halls, showers, vending machines, so on and on. To that end, you can tweak and restructure and move things around more or less to your hearts content, without resource limits on how many or how much of any one thing you can have. Everything also maintains value without any sort of depreciation mechanic, including the room walls and buildings themselves, so there's no consequences for changing your mind or continuously readjusting. For me, this utter leniency is *the* major draw of the game; more than any other business/management sim that I've played, this game satisfies some of my most obsessive, indecisive, and scatterbrained tendencies, without getting bogged down in min-maxing minutia or making me feel punished for not having an encyclopedic knowledge of how the game runs. In combination with the low skill floor and an apparent lack of both time limits and permanent fail states, it comes out to be something that I would affectionately term as idiot-proof, in the sense that you can more or less barely know what you're doing and as long as you follow the guiding campaign prompts of the game, you'll be successful. While this leads to a gameplay loop that a lot of people will find boring, since it denies them the satisfaction of challenge, I appreciate how it enables the player to pretty indulgently fixate on whatever part of the game they find most engaging without being a straight-up sandbox, which would be missing the sense of structure and direction that I personally find necessary to retain my interest. The overall effect is kind of soothing and about as mindless as you want it to be, like an adult coloring book or what I assume other people enjoy about building Lego sets.\n\nThink somewhere between Prison Architect and one of the mainstream Tycoon franchise games, except easier to learn, easier to play generally, and with a somewhat tighter focus mechanically. Like a city builder game's baby brother.\n\nThis doesn't fulfill the niche of a decorating or dollhouse game, and there's no options to customize the look of the buildings themselves- each of the several base game campuses has its own predetermined theme and associated architectural style- but the outdoor object catalogue specifically is surprisingly fleshed out, and I found myself a lot more drawn to the process of designing the campus grounds than I would have initially expected. Buildings, walls, windows, doors, and entire rooms can be picked up, copied, saved as templates, and altered at will. There's also an element of human resource, wherein the staff and student body is fully populated by what are technically individuals with their own names, appearances, skills, needs, and desires, who can be minimally managed. For faculty, this involves hiring, firing, assigning job responsibilities, and training skills. Students can be expelled or assigned tutoring, and will independently form both friendships and romances between one another, which you can encourage by placing appropriate objects for them to use. There's no means of directly orchestrating interactions, however, and none of it rises to the level of what I would describe as being an actual life simulator. I also really enjoy the blocky, bright, stylized cartoon look of the graphics, especially compared to the pretty realistic look most modern 3D sims opt for, and I imagine it's part of what makes the game so performance-friendly while running what feels like a pretty expansive real-time simulation. Controls are simple and intuitive once learned, and the game can be played entirely with a mouse if you so choose, which I appreciate and mostly do.\n\nThis also isn't really a strategy game; it's just too simple. If you're looking for the more challenging, exponentially progressing, detailed and mechanic-dense style of micromanaging you see in popular factory and colony-themed management sims like Factorio or Rimworld, you'll almost certainly be disappointed by the easy difficulty and relatively limited scope. By the same token, if you're a player who's driven by narrative and characterization, you'll be left wanting by the limited customizability and interactivity of your digital populace, as well as the lack of verisimilitude for roleplaying purposes. A Sims game, this is not, aside from mild tonal similarities. That said, if you love, say, recreating floorplans for houses you found online in The Sims and repeatedly loading up the Stardew Valley Farm Planner, it's a great game. It doesn't bite off more than it can chew, in my opinion, and executes on pretty much everything you expect it to. Other than just having a kind of limited aesthetic and object catalogue which does, granted, contribute to the previously mentioned sense of repetitiveness, I have yet to find myself really wanting for something that it feels like should be there, but isn't, or like there's an element of the gameplay that isn't working like it should. For the simulation genre in particular, this is not remotely a given, whether or not one thinks it should be, and thus earns itself some pretty significant brownie points in my eyes for that alone. I think it's just plain well-made, even if it's not for everyone.\n\nI grabbed this game on a super-deep discount, and to be completely honest, I don't know if I'd recommend it at full price (although that might just be me being very much a cheapskate), but for the five bucks or whatever I paid for it, it was so, absolutely worth it. You can probably tell from the description alone whether or not this game is for you, and if it is, I definitely would recommend at least putting it on your wishlist to be notified of the next time it's on sale. This game is like the perfect distillation of all my favorite parts of planning builds in other simulation games that I never end up executing on, so for me, it does a great job of satisfying a very particular urge. I liked it enough that I felt compelled to yap about it, at least, and that's gotta count for something, right?",

For example, one of the campus levels have students attend your university for free (meaning no constant stream of tuition fees to fill your wallet), instead you get paid a small fee by a 3rd party for every time a student \"levels up\". The first year of that I was maxed out on loans and still going deeper into the red, unsure if I could ever get out...2 or 3 years later, I was raking in MILLIONS within a single school year.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay itself at a surface level is indeed very simple. Create a building on this piece of land here, design room layouts inside, give everyone the education requirements and basic needs, click the button to start the next school year and watch it all work itself out. But at the same time, there is so much detail and so many events that require your attention, and by the time your campus really and truly is a \"self sustaining\" powerhouse, it means you are moments away from getting that final \"star\" and completing the level, so prepare for the next campus challenge lol. Its brilliant.\r\n\r\nI actually feel somewhat bad that I picked this wonderful gem up for pennies on the dollar. I am now a big fan of this studio, and plan to purchase their other products after I complete this game. Honestly, I give this game the rare 10/10. I seriously cannot think of a single aspect of playing this game that is an issue. It is a perfect game for exactly what it is.",

And I actually wouldn’t have minded starting over if the game kept track of all my unlocks. But no. It’s a complete fresh start and I can’t even skip the tutorial the second time round. Cloud save is corrupted too. Im sorry but this is unforgivable. Can’t even remember the last time this happened to a save file in a game. Maybe on the original PlayStation with a damaged memory card? \n\nSucks cause I was really enjoying the game until this.",
