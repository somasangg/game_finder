However, it is simply not my style so I can't recommend it.\n\nIn general, the structure of this idler is quite solid. The systems are introduced well (albeit too early in my opinion for some cases since the milestones are too close to each other) and they have great synergy. There is a ton of complexity for people who want to min-max this game and it's easy to experiment with how the systems work together. The monetisation is also not predatory. You mostly buy AI points (which you can earn through achievements as well) and skins. AI points are helpful but not mandatory (you can buy the mandatory upgrades with what you earn for free and still have plenty to spare). It also has a good offline system and the UI/graphics is nice and easy to understand. It's also still getting constant updates so props to the developer for that although I feel like it's quite solid already at its current state.\n\nMy gripes with it is that progress is quite slow. You hit wall after wall constantly. This is both a good thing and a bad thing. It's good because this is a great opportunity for puzzle solving and experimentation. It's bad because if you're like me and you weren't really enjoying the game much at this point, it can be a reason to feel like you're not getting anywhere and it won't make you want to play further. And that leads me to why this game is not for me. It has a lot of what I like in idlers but it lacks a certain charm or pull that makes it interesting for me or makes me want to invest time into learning its systems in more depth. Again, this is just personal taste. From an objective view, this idler is great. Maybe a quirky story could make it more interesting but I don't think it's necessary for its target audience.\n\nMy final thoughts is to give this game a go if you like idle games. If this game appeals to you and pulls you in, I believe you'll have a very rewarding time. It's just not for me.\n\nEDIT for Dev: Don't stress about my review.

I played NGU Idle enough that I think I see what the systems are and what's happening, but it's explained so poorly that I can just tell the rest of the game will be the same way. Feels like you need a wiki or an interpreter to understand the systems and how they correlate right off the bat. \n\nDev if you're reading this - I recommend taking your time at the start and explain things more clearly if you can. I spent too much time looking around the screen going, where does it track this resource?? It should be easily seen, for example have all resources show in the top right and when you go to a new screen it shows the new resource in the top right also. Everything needs to be clear and easy to understand. Just one example.\n\nI hope to come back at some point and give glowing reviews, I actually really like idle games so I'm hoping further development goes well.",

      "review": "Let me preface by saying this: I understand why people like this idler and I can see why it appeals to a lot of people. However, it is simply not my style so I can't recommend it.\n\nIn general, the structure of this idler is quite solid. The systems are introduced well (albeit too early in my opinion for some cases since the milestones are too close to each other) and they have great synergy. There is a ton of complexity for people who want to min-max this game and it's easy to experiment with how the systems work together. The monetisation is also not predatory. You mostly buy AI points (which you can earn through achievements as well) and skins. AI points are helpful but not mandatory (you can buy the mandatory upgrades with what you earn for free and still have plenty to spare). It also has a good offline system and the UI/graphics is nice and easy to understand. It's also still getting constant updates so props to the developer for that although I feel like it's quite solid already at its current state.\n\nMy gripes with it is that progress is quite slow. You hit wall after wall constantly. This is both a good thing and a bad thing. It's good because this is a great opportunity for puzzle solving and experimentation. It's bad because if you're like me and you weren't really enjoying the game much at this point, it can be a reason to feel like you're not getting anywhere and it won't make you want to play further. And that leads me to why this game is not for me. It has a lot of what I like in idlers but it lacks a certain charm or pull that makes it interesting for me or makes me want to invest time into learning its systems in more depth. Again, this is just personal taste. From an objective view, this idler is great. Maybe a quirky story could make it more interesting but I don't think it's necessary for its target audience.\n\nMy final thoughts is to give this game a go if you like idle games. If this game appeals to you and pulls you in, I believe you'll have a very rewarding time. It's just not for me.\n\nEDIT for Dev: Don't stress about my review. As I said, I don't really think a story or that extra charm is necessary since what you already have here is good and it works for your target audience.",
