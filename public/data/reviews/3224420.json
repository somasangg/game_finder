      "review": "This is an okay game, but there are quite a few things I think it's missing or need improvement on. Despite this, I still play the game and enjoy it and am looking forward to future updates that will hopefully fix these issues.\n\nCONS: \nMelee classes are highly neglected with half the amount of abilities when compared to ranged and magic. Out of the 3 melee types to choose from, two have 4 abilities and one has 5, whereas each magic type and ranged have 8. Although abilities in general are very lacking. There aren't a lot, especially at high levels so everyone in that class normally has the same 2 or 3 abilities equipped. There are special abilities and buffs but only a couple that really help each class and if you're solo there are even less.\n\nThis game doesn't really give you a lot of freedom when it comes to creating builds. It has about one equipment option for each class at each level threshold. As in, there's not a lot of room for creating unique and custom builds. Everyone is just copies of each other with the same equipment of varying qualities. \n\nGuilds are pretty useless. It's simply a social feature that gives you access to another chat and can sometimes make it easier to find parties. Other than that, guilds have no features or anything that makes them worth joining. \n\nDespite having a seemingly player run economy, the devs actually partially control it and will punish or ban members for not following specific pricing, despite the fact that they allow players to choose their own pricing. As in, if you see a really good deal on an item and buy it, the devs will just take the item and return your money, and may sometimes ban you or the person who sold it. I'm assuming this is to prevent boosting/funneling wealth but first off, you can only have one character that can access the market. The only way to get around that is to have an alt account which is already against the rules. I don't understand why they feel the need to control the market prices like they do instead of allowing players their freedom to price things as they wish. If they can not handle a market in which player choose their own prices, the feature shouldn't exist. It reminds me of a worse version of albion online's market system.\n\nThe game is SLOW. Upgrades take forever and don't really offer a lot of improvement.\n\nI have heard many people complain about the devs not listening to feedback and not adding features they said they would, however, I haven't been playing long enough to be able to personally confirm this. \n\nPROS:\nThe community is generally nice and helpful. \n\nThere are a lot of skill options to choose from\n\nThe consumables feature is nice. There are a decent amount of different effects to choose from depending on what you need.",

What started as a simple clicker (almost farming) idle game, quickly turns into a progression system that keeps pulling me back in. The pacing is great for me, there’s always another upgrade, another system, another layer to unlock. I think my favorite part is actually playing a multiplayer idle game with a living community. It makes you want to specialize in DPS, Tank, or Healer for 1-5 player dungeons. Don't get me wrong, the crafting is cool, but the idle combat keeps this game running in the background.\n\nI’ve been playing for weeks straight, and it still feels fresh. The balance between short-term goals and long-term progression is addictive, and the sense of scale makes every reset feel meaningful. The visuals are clean, the systems interlock smoothly, and it has that perfect “just one more upgrade” loop that makes time fly. If you enjoy leveling up in a more idle way, this is an easy recommendation.",

      "review": "If you've played Melvor Idle or any idle combat game, you've played this before.\n\nMost of the hours I have in the game wasn't even used to play the game, it's just me leaving it on so I don't have to deal with the actual idle limit. I will mention that you can spend premium currency to increase the limit, but that's a new issue on its own.\n\nSo how's the game? Compared to Melvor, it's significantly slower and less satisfying to manage. The skills take forever to level, like I only managed to get 2 skills over level 100. This also includes all the experience bonuses I had, from the global boosts (which is almost guaranteed maxed out at level 20) and individual boosts like consumables (in this game, it's tea and coffee that you either buy from the market or brew yourself). It's not even satisfying getting it to 100+ 'cause you don't get anything out of it other than having everything unlocked (which is usually around level 85 other than skills that make endgame gear which goes up to level 106) and basically bragging rights on the leaderboards. Note that there's separate leadeboards that includes all players or just Steam players. Other than that, the only skill worth levelling would be enhancing since that increases your enhancing chance, which is arguably the most interesting skill to figure out.\n\nSo non-combat skills isn't that great How about combat? It's also quite lacking. There was a rework which changed how combat works, forcing you to basically play melee to make range and magic even useful. Most of the time you won't even think about the battles especially if you're trying to farm high rarity items, just leave them running forever and refill your consumables every now and then. This game does have MMO features like partying up and doing dungeons together, but you can't even help out your lower level friends AND the loot has to be shared between the party members. It's just not very fun that way.\n\nThe two biggest issues with this game that everyone seems to agree with is the monetization and the community itself. I barely interact with the people in the chat and from what I've seen, I don't even want to. In the early days of the release, chat was actually pretty chill but it seems to have gotten worse with the mods and veteran members basically having authority on what you can say and not say. Not exactly nice for an open MMO space, huh? As for the monetization... yes, you can buy the premium currency (cowbells) with real money or from the market with your hard earned coins. But you see the issue with that statement, right? You can indirectly buy coins by buying cowbells and then selling those cowbells in the market. That means you can ultimately buy anything even if you barely play the game if you have the money to spare. Cowbells are also used to buy quality-of-life upgrades like longer idle hours, more market listings, etc. There is a way to get cowbells without spending a dime or buying in the market by grinding tasks that refill every few hours or so, but it takes forever to even get 100 because of the low chances. At the very least the subscription pass is nowhere near as unfair as it could be, and it's relatively cheap considering you can save up cowbells to buy it.\n\nIn the end, it's one of those games that gets really tedious after you've gotten past a dozen hours or so. Every gain becomes minimal or marginal, and the payoff isn't even that great in the long run.",

This game does have MMO features like partying up and doing dungeons together, but you can't even help out your lower level friends AND the loot has to be shared between the party members. It's just not very fun that way.\n\nThe two biggest issues with this game that everyone seems to agree with is the monetization and the community itself. I barely interact with the people in the chat and from what I've seen, I don't even want to. In the early days of the release, chat was actually pretty chill but it seems to have gotten worse with the mods and veteran members basically having authority on what you can say and not say. Not exactly nice for an open MMO space, huh? As for the monetization... yes, you can buy the premium currency (cowbells) with real money or from the market with your hard earned coins. But you see the issue with that statement, right? You can indirectly buy coins by buying cowbells and then selling those cowbells in the market. That means you can ultimately buy anything even if you barely play the game if you have the money to spare. Cowbells are also used to buy quality-of-life upgrades like longer idle hours, more market listings, etc. There is a way to get cowbells without spending a dime or buying in the market by grinding tasks that refill every few hours or so, but it takes forever to even get 100 because of the low chances. At the very least the subscription pass is nowhere near as unfair as it could be, and it's relatively cheap considering you can save up cowbells to buy it.\n\nIn the end, it's one of those games that gets really tedious after you've gotten past a dozen hours or so.

      "review": "If you've played Melvor Idle or any idle combat game, you've played this before.\n\nMost of the hours I have in the game wasn't even used to play the game, it's just me leaving it on so I don't have to deal with the actual idle limit. I will mention that you can spend premium currency to increase the limit, but that's a new issue on its own.\n\nSo how's the game? Compared to Melvor, it's significantly slower and less satisfying to manage. The skills take forever to level, like I only managed to get 2 skills over level 100. This also includes all the experience bonuses I had, from the global boosts (which is almost guaranteed maxed out at level 20) and individual boosts like consumables (in this game, it's tea and coffee that you either buy from the market or brew yourself). It's not even satisfying getting it to 100+ 'cause you don't get anything out of it other than having everything unlocked (which is usually around level 85 other than skills that make endgame gear which goes up to level 106) and basically bragging rights on the leaderboards. Note that there's separate leadeboards that includes all players or just Steam players. Other than that, the only skill worth levelling would be enhancing since that increases your enhancing chance, which is arguably the most interesting skill to figure out.\n\nSo non-combat skills isn't that great How about combat? It's also quite lacking. There was a rework which changed how combat works, forcing you to basically play melee to make range and magic even useful. Most of the time you won't even think about the battles especially if you're trying to farm high rarity items, just leave them running forever and refill your consumables every now and then. This game does have MMO features like partying up and doing dungeons together, but you can't even help out your lower level friends AND the loot has to be shared between the party members. It's just not very fun that way.\n\nThe two biggest issues with this game that everyone seems to agree with is the monetization and the community itself. I barely interact with the people in the chat and from what I've seen, I don't even want to. In the early days of the release, chat was actually pretty chill but it seems to have gotten worse with the mods and veteran members basically having authority on what you can say and not say. Not exactly nice for an open MMO space, huh? As for the monetization... yes, you can buy the premium currency (cowbells) with real money or from the market with your hard earned coins. But you see the issue with that statement, right? You can indirectly buy coins by buying cowbells and then selling those cowbells in the market. That means you can ultimately buy anything even if you barely play the game if you have the money to spare. Cowbells are also used to buy quality-of-life upgrades like longer idle hours, more market listings, etc. There is a way to get cowbells without spending a dime or buying in the market by grinding tasks that refill every few hours or so, but it takes forever to even get 100 because of the low chances. At the very least the subscription pass is nowhere near as unfair as it could be, and it's relatively cheap considering you can save up cowbells to buy it.\n\nIn the end, it's one of those games that gets really tedious after you've gotten past a dozen hours or so. Every gain becomes minimal or marginal, and the payoff isn't even that great in the long run.",

Whoever has the longest account age is in the right in discussions, moderation is based on popularity, etc. The entire beginner chat is flooded with losers who were too lgbt/furry to fit in with normal humans, and they have a real chip on their shoulder. I was banned for multiple days for calling out active grooming of a 15 year old in chat. It's a shit show. Might as well be a single player game. Mods are personal friends with the devs, too. It's just a chat room for about 50 friends that is filled out with about 48,000 chinese bots. Fun game, but reality check. Anyone could make this game and not staff it with pedophiles and power mad jerk offs.",

People can surmount that wall in marketcow by whaling cowbells, but not in ironcow. its just a loading bar simulator with space cow themed graphics.\r\nThere's very little interactivity with features, like almost every mmo it encourages combat and neglects skilling for the most part. Which is a non issue. combuff is eternal. but its a loading bar simulator. you load up infinite genocide task and check back once a day for the rest of your life. maybe buy a gear upgrade and refill your consumables. rinse and repeat. worse for skilling. less to upgrade.\r\n\r\nSo uh yeah, wouldn't recommend. there's not much to it, but its simple and low maintenance. the graphics are funny and theres a chat full of drama.",
