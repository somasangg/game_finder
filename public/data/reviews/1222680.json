      "review": "💬I can't understand why Electronic Arts, when reviewing player reviews and opinions, is going all out, serving us another NfS™ installment in the series with the same atmosphere that turned so many people off after Payback. I don't expect to ever play NfS™: Underground 3, but I'd like to see at least its spiritual successor. On the other hand, this doesn't mean that NfS™ Heat should be written off right away, because after all, Ghost Games not only eliminated microtransactions and randomized Speed Cards, the biggest problem we had playing NfS™ Payback, but also added an interesting element that could make Heat a truly great game.\n\n🎮NfS™ Heat does remind one of the incredible Dying Light to some extent, as the new chapter of the legendary racing game series provides a day and night cycle. However, the nightfall is not a condition, as the time of day in the game can be adjusted through the menu. Daytime is when we are engaged in legal races to make money which is then spent on car parts and performance adaptations of the car. But this is not like in NfS™ Payback as in Heat the player decides what parts of his/her car to improve. Similar to the previous one, before racing, the car's required level to participate has to be checked and compared with that of the player's vehicle. NfS™ Heat, however, is hardly a grinding game. This doesn't change the fact that to unlock individual story missions and side quests, we must first complete a series of different races.\n\nParticipating in the various competitions held after dark doesn't reward us financially, but rather rewards us with special reputation points that allows us to advance to new experience levels (to gain them faster, it's worth teasing the cops and increasing your Heat level, which is the equivalent of police stars in GTA). The new story missions become available and at the same time it's possible to get new cars and tuning parts. Still, it doesn't come easy as the police will be after you (law enforcement officers also do their rounds in the city during the day but do not interfere). It is not surprising, anyway, as we are selling illegal night races, and a special squad has been created to tackle crime. Therefore, just like in the aforementioned Dying Light, we have to be constantly on our guard. While on easy difficulty, the cops practically crash into other cars, on medium, not to mention hard, they can be incredibly persistent. We can eliminate them in various ways, by repeatedly crashing into police cars or using gadgets acquired during the campaign.\n\nNfS™ Heat doesn't return to the winter atmosphere of 2015's NfS™, but we still encounter heavily exaggerated characters and a terribly childish story. The action takes place in Palm City (the name obliges, so it's a bit like Miami), and our task, first and foremost is to prove our skills in various competitions (classic races, time trials, drifts...). This is the only way to gain entry into the League, whose members have significantly better cars and parts to modify their performance. All this to ultimately become a master driver... The story is clearly forced, although I must admit that the course of events can be a bit surprising at times. I quickly stopped caring about the characters' fates and focused solely on what NfS™ Heat is best at: the races.\n\nI've mentioned that NfS™ Heat also offers side missions in addition to the main missions. However, it's very common for the story related stages to be essentially... I have no clue. Following the reaching of a marker, there occurs a slight interaction regarding nothing, and next, a npc takes you to your goal where a race starts, and needless to say, winning is the only option for you. Once you reach the finish line, a few seconds of cutscene triggers, and that's it... The game's moments of more story focused gameplay are actually few and far between. But maybe that's for the best, since many people believe that story and racing gameplay are a perfect match?\n\nHowever, when we forget about the story dedicated to who knows who and start exploring the city, we notice that Palm City is a particularly deserted place. Already in 2011's Driver: San Francisco, we encountered a bustling metropolis (and by the way, I hope Ghost Games learns from Ubisoft how to craft an engaging story in a racing game, because in that Driver, the story kept me glued to the screen until the very end), where people strolled on the sidewalks, while a wide variety of cars drove along the streets... I think the only place with less traffic is at the Mataveri International Airport\n\nMentioning of traffic, it's worth noting that in NfS™ Heat ironically I had no sense of speed... Even though I saw my car clocked at 186 miles per hour, it actually behaved as if it was trying to stay within the speed limit on the expressway. What more can I say? That's not how it should be, right?.\n\nEach of the nearly 130 cars handles completely differently. Interestingly, despite the arcade style driving model, you can still feel even the slightest change in parts. This is the reason behind the engagement of NfS™ Heat even with its numerous flaws since it has the notion that it is not simply unlocking new skins of the car but rather unlocking stronger and more powerful cars. Moreover, those people who like tinkering with the hood of a digital car would definitely be happy.\n\nNfS™ Heat is a multiplayer game but you can still play the campaign alone. Like in DriveClub, you join a crew (here referred to simply as a Crew) that can have up to 32 members. To start with, a crew is randomly assigned to you, but you can freely choose any crew or even create your own. Individual points are awarded to each player, but they are transferred to the team's account, which enables every team member to get many benefits, such as, of course, cash and reputation points being accumulated faster. Moreover, gradually, Crew Time Trials will be also unlocked which are special time trials that let you compete with other players from your crew.\n\n👍Pros.\n- Excellent car models\n- Well executed driving model\n- Campaign progression system\n- Gameplay divided into day and night\n- Decent graphics\n\n👎Cons.\n- Lack of a sense of speed\n- Plot? Who needs it?\n- Awfully written dialogue\n- Desolate city\n- Many missions are done in one go\n- Tracklist is too small. It gets repetitive.\n\n🏁Conclusion.\nWhile playing NfS™ Heat, I was eager to play more competitions so I could eventually test drive the best vehicles, but the production's flaws, less mentioned above, effectively discouraged me from having fun. Difficult to grasp dialogue, a lackluster cityscape, and poorly chosen music made Heat, in my opinion, even worse than Payback. The fact that the individual cars were phenomenally executed, and the campaign's tuning and progression system didn't evoke the same negative impressions as the previous installment.\n🎯6.5/10\n💬How else can we explain that NfS™ Heat is just an exploration of what was previously presented in NfS™ Payback?",

      "review": "\"Not great, not terrible.\" The meme from the Chernobyl series perfectly describes NFS Heat, which isn't bad overall, but it's not particularly great either. If you have low expectations for this type of game, and simply want to drive and tune your favorite cars, you should find everything you need in NFS Heat.\n\n🧠Heat primarily addresses a few of the weaknesses of the two previous installments and, tentatively took cues from Forza Horizon. So, regular tuning parts have returned instead of lootbox cards, the story is a bit more bearable, and the game world has opened up thanks to the near-complete destruction of environmental elements. The ability to outfit your driver in countless combinations of hipster outfits has also been borrowed from Forza. The biggest draw of this installment, however, is the clear division between day and night racing a mechanic that could be truly fantastic if only it were properly refined.\n\nIn NFS Heat, every time you are faced with the decision to leave the city during the day or at night, legal racing during the day is nothing like the excitement of going out at night, as you can probably guess. However, since you need to earn money during the day and build your reputation at night to advance the story and unlock faster and faster cars, you'll likely find yourself wanting to divide your time between both. \n\nDuring the day, you basically just admire the surroundings and earn cash for further purchases of upgraded parts and new cars. The race tracks are surrounded by barriers, traffic is limited, and the police don't interfere it's simply a sporting event in the city, although I wouldn't expect it to have the atmosphere of NFS ProStreet.\n\nWhat happens after dark, however, is a completely different story. Illegal races take place among other road users, lack any sporting flair, and police cars lurk along the route. But that's nothing new in the Need for Speed series... So where is the excitement that I previously mentioned coming from? It's from mechanics similar to those in the new Tom Clancy's The Division.\nRacing at night is like entering the \"Twilight Zone.\" The more we break the law and increase the level of police \"heat\" around us (the titular \"heat\"), the more reputation we can gain, but it's also easy to lose everything in an instant when we can't get back to the garage. Because in NFS Heat the cops are like a pit bull, when they sniff out a pirate breaking the road code in a tuned Golf, they won't let up, and we'll lose both our time and our points.\n\nIf in recent NFS games, the police acted like city guards carrying parking barriers, now they resemble an anti-terrorist squad, swiftly sweeping us off the pavement. Essentially, from a heat level of \"3\" and above, it's a done deal. You can only escape with some luck or by cheating the system. The police cars act like battering rams in a gymkhana - fast, nimble, hard to destroy, and when one is eliminated another shows up.\n\nBecause of these small AI shenanigans, NFS Heat at Night became my first ever stealth car game! With a lot of reputation points to collect, I opted to drive at a snail's pace and stare at the minimap to avoid the red police car icons. I don't mind a greater challenge, but the main issue here was the lack of balance.\n\nNFS Heat also boasts a pretty beautiful environment and game world. It's clear that things are slow, but adapting the Frostbite engine to a racing game is progressing. It's still not as beautiful as Forza Horizon, but Palm City, modeled after Miami, and its rural setting are certainly appealing. The skyscrapers and the incredibly detailed port and gravel pit structures look particularly impressive. Scattered throughout the city are also original graffiti and murals, discovering which provides a welcome stimulus to explore the game's world.\n\nIt's a shame, however, that despite all this grandeur and detail, Palm City is a completely dead city. The number of cars on the streets evokes associations with New Year's Eve traffic at 8 a.m. - there are no people on the sidewalks, no trains running, and no signs that anyone lives here. Need for Speed remains relegated to its backwardness, despite games like Midnight Club: Los Angeles, which demonstrated back in 2008 that a metropolis can be vibrant in a racing game. The most active element on the streets of Palm City is the rain, which falls several times a day, as if the developers wanted to boast only about the reflections on the puddles.\n\nFor those who enjoy visual tuning, you can not only replace the sills, hood, rims, mirrors, and bumpers in almost thirty categories, but you can also change the exhaust sound and put your own graffiti, which can be found all over the city. You can also customize yourself—your character, that is. With almost 700 different hats, hairstyles, sweatshirts and shoes—many with the Three Stripes and just one pair with a cat.\n\nEvery time I heard about a publisher taking a break from its annual cycle to create a truly excellent Need for Speed, to return to its roots and reboot the series, I envisioned a modern game that would once again set standards in its genre. I dreamed of a game with Hollywood-style street chases, a cockpit view that could be customized for the first time, a bustling city, and a decent driving model. And while competing titles have offered most of these things for years and are experimenting with new features like changing seasons, Need for Speed unfortunately stagnates, serving up the same old story every time.\n\n✅Pros.\n+ Finally, a beautiful, detailed city and its surroundings\n+ Extensive car tuning options\n+ Varied missions during the story campaign\n+ Environmental destruction allows for a lot of freedom while driving\n+ Concept of risking your performance during nighttime escapades...\n\n❌Cons.\n- Overly aggressive and powerful police\n- Little variety in race modes\n- A completely dead, almost empty city\n- Lack of new features and solutions long-present in the competition\n\n🧾Summary.\nIt's been a while since i've experienced this kind of stagnation, staying true to our premise, but being stuck in outdated solutions. It's high time for a small revolution. Heat is undoubtedly the best NFS game of the eight generation, but compared to previous installments in the series, it's no mean feat. This is the title with which the series should have launched on the ninth generation of gaming devices. Perhaps today it would be in a completely different, better form? For now, this is the acceptable minimum...neither completely bad nor too good. \"Not great, not terrible.\"\n7.5/10🔚",

The customisation is no where near what Underground 2 had but they half-assed some customisation. The map is somewhat to my liking, lots of mountain roads and drifting possibilities which is a shame since drifting feels like trying to steer a 3 year old around a glass door. The day/night sequence is acceptable even though imo all the races should be at night. Good collection of cars but I prefer the casual more realistically attainable cars in comparison to the super cars or hyper cars. Also the OST is shite. Overall not too bad. On a scale of Unbound to Underground 2 it gets a flimsy 5/10.",

Actually these are the studios by which I became familiar with the franchise and they made me explore the earlier titles. To me, Hot Pursuit 2010 is a godfather which received a refined version known as Rivals, developed by Criterion and Ghost. Heat is a game in which I see a fragment of every earlier NFS title. The day-time races resemble Pro Street tracks while at night, you can feel the vibe of Carbon canyons and Bayview city. So yes... I do recommend NFS Heat.",

The city looks lively and stylish, the music matches the pace of the race, and overall, the visuals and vibe are commendable.\r\n\r\nThe idea of dividing the game into day and night is interesting: during the day you earn money, at night you earn reputation. But the police often spoil all the fun at night. They are too aggressive, and even when you are about to win, they can suddenly destroy your car — which is more annoying than adrenaline-pumping.\r\n\r\nThe plot is mediocre and quickly forgotten, and the characters are not memorable. In addition, the game feels overly repetitive: to unlock new cars or upgrades, you have to spend a lot of time repeating the same races. This quickly becomes tedious, especially if you just want to enjoy the races.\r\n\r\nDespite all the drawbacks, Heat has its charms — beautiful graphics, cool music, and enjoyable tuning. If you approach it without high expectations, you can get some enjoyment out of it. Ultimately, it's just a solid but ordinary arcade racing game that doesn't deserve a negative review.",

For me is NFS HEAT my favourite modern  NFS of all time. \r\n\r\nProgresion and story mode is good but sometimes can be boring. I will not talk about day and night cycle bcs what i saw everyone is mentioning in their own review. Day races can be anoying, from the start you will enjoying racing again really competetiv AI (hard difficulty) and over time it will become boring. I do like this game from my prespective and police at night is i guess all right.\r\n\r\n Only think i do hate a most is that you have to install EA launcher and save files are not working properly as well. I did lost twice my progress and I have still not gave up but almost everyone will do. It is kinda sad but thats not fault of game but in time when game came up.  And if you want to buy wait when the game is in sale for abou 7 euro instead of 70. I did bought it back in october 2022 when it was for 3.50euro but as it looks like it was special price or something like that. \r\n\r\n\r\nCars\r\n\r\nNFS HEAT has over 100+ cars, which is amazing but in the end you will end up a few of them. For example Porsche 911 RSR, which is a meta car and for me is a toxic car. I do not say that you dont have to enjoy this car but overall if you want have in online 100% WR you will end up with this car. Tuning as well is very rich and community wraps are + too.\r\n\r\nMap and collectibles\r\n\r\nWhen we talk about map is quite big you have so many option from drift zones to speed and offroad section. \r\nAhhh collectibles, it is nightmare but in a good way. Thera are too many of them in total over 200+ collectibles so kinda grind for achievments, if you are achievment type guy.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conclucion the game is not that bad but not good anyway, but in modern era of NFS it is one of the best one. And it has great communtiy as well. My final rating is 7,5/10. I hope that this review help you in some way and have a nice day. (sorry for my english grammar)",

      "review": "[b]Review by [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33369540-Abrix/]Abrix\n Gaming[/url] – 4K quality gameplay reviews and recommendations.[/b]\n\n[b]Need for Speed Heat – A Fiery Comeback Filled with Style, Speed, and Underground Soul[/b]\n\n[i]Need for Speed Heat[/i] is the game that reminded everyone why the franchise became iconic in the first place. It blends everything fans love — outlaw street racing, deep car customization, high-risk police chases, and a stylish urban atmosphere — into one of the most satisfying NFS experiences in years.\n\nPalm City is the star of the show. By day, it’s a playful festival of legal racing events, crowds, celebrations, and pure competitive fun. But by night, the city transforms into a neon-drenched battlefield where every race brings tension, danger, and the promise of huge rewards. The day vs. night mechanic isn’t just visual — it’s the entire heartbeat of the game. Earn cash in the daytime, risk it all for REP at night, and decide how far you’re willing to push luck before the cops shut everything down.\n\nThe police chases are the best the series has seen in a long time. If you want safety, stick to daylight. If you want adrenaline, venture into the midnight chaos. The heat level rising as you win races creates true pressure — do you go for one more event to maximize rewards, or bank what you’ve earned before the police swarms become unstoppable? Every decision matters, and it makes nighttime racing feel thrilling every single time.\n\nDriving feels fantastic. Cars are fast, loud, and full of character. Drifting around corners, hitting perfect boosts, and fighting for every inch of track make races intense from start to finish. Every update and upgrade you apply actually transforms the way a car behaves — turning junkyard starters into beasts with the right tuning and parts. Customization is deep, stylish, and creative, giving every player the chance to build a garage that represents their personality.\n\nThe story, while not groundbreaking, has enough attitude and energy to make the campaign enjoyable. It focuses on rebellion against a corrupt task force, but more importantly, it’s about belonging, passion, and proving yourself in Palm City’s underground scene. The characters feel modern and upbeat without slipping into parody, and the narrative adds momentum without overstaying its welcome.\n\nVisually, [i]Heat[/i] is striking — neon reflections on wet streets, roaring flames from exhausts, colorful particle trails, and cinematic lighting transform night racing into a visual feast. Pair that with a powerful soundtrack of hip-hop, EDM, and Latin influences, and every race feels like a music-driven adrenaline trip.\n\nMultiplayer integrates seamlessly with the open world. You can switch between solo and online instantly, cruise with friends, show off builds, compete in events, and turn Palm City into your shared playground. It captures the social spirit of street racing without complicating gameplay.\n\n[i]Need for Speed Heat[/i] isn’t just a return — it’s a revival. It remembers everything that made the franchise legendary and delivers it with modern polish, explosive style, and a huge heart for car culture. Whether you’re chasing the perfect drift, escaping cops by inches, or building your dream garage one victory at a time, Heat keeps the excitement alive from the first race to the last.\n\nA bold, stylish, and unforgettable chapter in the NFS legacy — and one of the best street racers of the generation.\n\nYou can check my gameplay video [b][url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxvWbrDkSJsDuyNhj2vbLYVmfsfDxiv8V]here[/url][/b]\n\nSubscribe To My Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1ZOvQERjGtRkl7ImTcDzdw?sub_confirmation=1\nJoin My Discord - https://discord.gg/uM94ehT7hv",

      "review": "Need for Speed: Heat is one of those racing games that immediately pulls you in with style. From the neon-soaked nights to the thundering engine roars, the whole experience feels fast, loud, and aggressively stylish in the best way possible. And the customization? Absolutely top-tier. This is the kind of game where you’ll spend 40 minutes tuning your car’s appearance and only 10 minutes actually racing it. Paint jobs, decals, body kits, exhaust notes — it’s all there, and it all feels personal.\n\nThe day-and-night system adds a fun rhythm to the gameplay. Daytime racing is cleaner, more structured, and good for making legal money. Nighttime, meanwhile, turns the whole game into an adrenaline rush where reputation climbs fast and cops become… very determined. It’s a great loop that sucks you in and makes progression feel rewarding.\n\nThe story is short — like, blink and you’ll miss it short — but surprisingly enjoyable. It’s not groundbreaking narrative art, but it’s tight, stylish, and just long enough not to overstay its welcome. A simple, punchy tale that fits the NFS vibe well.\n\nThe driving itself feels good once you adapt to the drifting-heavy handling, and the city is fun to tear through at high speed. The cops can be a headache at times, especially at night when they seem to spawn out of thin air just to ruin your day, but it adds to the tension.\n\nIt’s not the deepest racing game ever made, but it is one of the most fun and expressive NFS titles in years. Heat delivers a compact, flashy experience that knows exactly what it wants to be: fast, stylish, customizable, and loud.\n\nPersonal scores:\n\nGameplay: 8/10 (fast, fun, and responsive once you get used to the drifting)\nCustomization: 10/10 (one of the strongest aspects of the entire game)\nWorld & Atmosphere: 8.5/10 (vibrant neon nights and energetic city design)\nStory: 7.5/10 (short but surprisingly enjoyable and well-paced)\nPolice AI: 6.5/10 (intense but often too aggressive and inconsistent)\n\nOverall: 8.1/10 — A stylish, high-energy racing game with incredible customization and a short but satisfying story, perfect for players who want speed with personality.",

AND also thanks to the pink-haired trans women for the ugliest female characters, such a contrast in the game between male and female characters. its definitely worth buying with a 90% discount, but if its less than that, then dont. oh btw i forgot about the EA launcher XDXDDXD i wont comment on that",

      "review": "Tier: S (Purchased)\r\n\r\nNeed for Speed Heat is, without exaggeration, one of the finest entries in the entire Need for Speed franchise. Visually, the game is stunning. The effects aren’t overly flashy, but the overall detail is extremely high, even in small objects and environments. What impressed me the most is how real everything looks. Using Photo Mode, I often captured shots that looked like real-life photography rather than a video game. The visual realism is genuinely top-tier.\r\n\r\nHowever, when it comes to mechanics, I feel the game misses the mark in a few areas. The gameplay systems are complete, but the control scheme -especially on keyboard- feels limiting. For example, the game forces the use of WASD with one hand, when it could easily allow players to use two-handed controls (W/S + arrow keys). Not all keys can be remapped either, especially NumPad keys. Laptop users, who don’t have a NumPad, will find this frustrating.\r\n\r\nFrom the storytelling side, the delivery is decent. The opening even includes a road-safety disclaimer, which is a nice touch. The story is short and clearly not the main focus, the game leans heavily toward gameplay over narrative.\r\n\r\nIssues I Experienced\r\n- Driver update warnings\r\n   When launching the game, it often forces you to update drivers or warns about compatibility. Even after updating, nothing changes except the cutscenes, which remain extremely choppy and glitchy. This seriously breaks immersion. Unfortunately, there seems to be no further patches; the game feels abandoned by the developers.\r\n\r\n- Limited keybinding options\r\n   Many keys cannot be remapped, especially NumPad keys. This heavily affects laptop users. The game is clearly designed with gamepads in mind, leaving keyboard players at a disadvantage.\r\n\r\n- Weak tutorials\r\n   A good example is the drifting tutorial. It’s confusing enough that thousands of players turned to YouTube guides instead. A sign that the in-game tutorial just isn’t good.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nDespite its flaws, Need for Speed Heat is still absolutely worth buying and playing. The shortcomings never outweigh the excitement of the core racing experience, which remains fantastic from start to finish.\r\n\r\nThe world itself is beautiful, with plenty of landmarks and photo spots that make exploration enjoyable and memorable.\r\n\r\nIn the end, even with its many drawbacks, this game is still very much worth your money—especially if you enjoy high-speed racing paired with gorgeous visuals.",

      "review": "For me, NFS Heat definetly had its highs and lows, but overall it was solid.\nLet's start with the highs:\nif you are looking for an \"underground era\" style vibe, then this is the game for you! Its really similar to underground which is probably the main selling point of this game which i totally valid. The car selection is solid aswell, from production cars to offroad to hypercars, you will find everything. The tuning and customization reminds me of underground aswell, they nailed the \"street racing\" vibe perfectly.\n\nAnd now, for the lows:\nI think the handling is somewhat strange, not as bad as nfs 2015 but not as good as hot pursuit either, sometimes its snappy but sometimes its unresponsive, but overall it's fine.\nLet's countinue with the story, its not the main point of the game sadly which is understandable but in my opinion a longer and more in depth story would have suited this game. \nAnd the collectibles.. if you are thinking about earning max achievements or 100%-ing the game, be prepared for 300+ collectibles, its really unnecessary to add this many in my opinion..\n\nBut Overall I Do recommend this game especially when it's on sale! It is if not the best modern NFS game to date.",

The day–night system adds a nice rhythm: daylight races feel more relaxed and clean, while nighttime runs give that “high risk, high reward” adrenaline hit. The car customization is another strong point — you can tune both performance and style until your ride feels genuinely unique. The city itself is surprisingly fun to explore, with just enough secrets and side activities to make free roaming enjoyable.\n\nCops also add a good layer of tension, especially at night. Escaping a heated chase can be more memorable than winning a regular race. The soundtrack fits the vibe too, keeping the energy up without being overwhelming.\n\nIf I have to point out a flaw, it’s that some races can feel a bit repetitive after a while, especially if you’re grinding reputation.

      "review": "**Need for Speed™ Heat – A Thrilling Return to Form**\n\nNeed for Speed™ Heat feels like the series finally remembered what made it iconic — fast cars, high stakes, and that late-night street-racing energy.\n\nThe dual-world concept of *Day vs Night* is fantastic. Daytime races let you earn money legitimately, while nighttime brings out the underground scene, reputation points, and cops that actually make your pulse race. The risk-and-reward system keeps every session exciting — you decide how long to stay out before the police heat gets too high.\n\nVisually, Heat is stunning. The city of Palm City lights up beautifully after dark — neon reflections, wet roads, roaring engines — it’s pure automotive eye candy. The soundtrack complements the vibe perfectly, switching from chill daytime beats to intense electronic tracks at night.\n\nCustomization is another high point. You can tweak almost everything — body kits, wraps, exhaust sounds, stance — making every car truly yours. Performance tuning is simple but satisfying, letting you find your ideal balance between grip and drift.\n\nIf there’s one drawback, it’s that the story is light and the AI can be inconsistent. But once you’re on the road, none of that really matters. The feeling of dodging cops at 200 km/h under neon lights is pure adrenaline.\n\n**Verdict:**\nNeed for Speed Heat nails the thrill of street racing and car culture better than any NFS in years. It’s stylish, fast, and fun — the kind of game that makes you fall in love with racing all over again.\n\n⭐ **9/10 – A beautiful comeback for the franchise.**",

It’s not the best in the series obviously, but it’s got its own charm.\nStarting with the story: yeah, it’s pretty cliché, but it does its job of setting up those wild, adrenaline-filled races. The day and night modes are a nice touch too, with the day focused on earning money and the night on building reputation. The drifting, which many people criticize, actually feels great once you get the hang of it. Those two things already make NFS Heat a solid entry.\nBut the real highlight, without a doubt, is the graphics. They’re absolutely stunning, especially at night when it’s raining. You can also take pictures using its photo mode. It’s basic, sure, but it gets the job done. And let’s not forget the community customization, which adds a fresh and really fun wrap when tuning a new car.\nOn the downside, and it’s a big one, the soundtrack. It has a few good tracks, but most of them just don’t fit a Need for Speed game at all. I’d honestly recommend turning it off and playing your own Spotify or YouTube playlist instead.\nOn the brighter side, there are some nice achievements that boost replayability, and the online mode is still active so you can flex your customized car wraps.\n\nAll in all, it’s a 7 out of 10.\nP.S. The best song in the game is “Worryin’ Bout Me” by BJ The Chicago Kid ft. Offset.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3594286771",

To me, it felt completely natural and I was able to get used to it and do well pretty quickly. Drifting in particular is made very simple and reproducible for even casual players, while still having a ton of depth if you want to pursue mastery of it. Each car behaves differently and you can fine tune them to handle the way you want them to. The graphics are incredibly crisp and beautiful and don't show the tiniest bit of age. Love the tiny details like the cars shaking when you rev them. Performance is pretty good and I encountered no bugs whatsoever in all my playtime. To my absolute shock, there were no microtransactions or pay-to-win anywhere to be seen! Just a very standard, well designed progression system that allows you to unlock everything at a steady pace just by playing. Honestly, I have no idea how EA let this one slip! The Ubislop style side objectives are kind of a hassle though and don't really add much, but the good thing is you can just ignore them. The only major criticism I can offer here is that the soundtrack is utterly dreadful. Just unlistenable most of the time. I legit had to just turn the music volume off completely and I'd either just enjoy the sounds of the engines roaring or blast my own music selections. Including ones just lifted from older, superior NFS games.\n\nBesides the handling, a racing game lives and dies by its roster of cars and this has to be one of the best in the franchise! There's quite literally a little bit of everything here - simple everyday sh!tboxes, executive luxury cars, exotic sports cars, ultra rare hypercars, badass JDM cars both old and new, offroad vehicles, classic retro vehicles, full on racecars and so so much more. And Ferraris too! Some of the coolest ones ever to boot, including the eyewatering LaFerrari! Seriously, this entire game is any car enthusiast's wet dream! And to make it a proper NFS game, we have a super in-depth and well made customization system that allows you to make these beautiful vehicles look exactly how you want them to, styling them all the way down to the sound of the exhaust. You also get a super deep performance tuning system that allows you to not only squeeze every last drop of performance out of these cars, but fine tune them for the specific behaviour you want them to have. Do you want a more loose and street savvy oldschool NFS style that can race and drift and drive cops mad? Sure! Do you want a more grounded GranTurismo style handling for true motorsport realism? Go for it! You want a pure drift machine that spends more time sideways than forward? You got it! You want an unstoppable off-road beast that can plow through any terrain like it's nothing? Absolutely! Combine this vast garage and versatility of performance with a solid map containing all kinds of tracks and options and fitted with races that allow every tier and class of car to shine and you have an absolute banger on your hands!\n\nI wasn't sure how I'd feel about the day/night mechanic, but it's honestly brilliant! You get two similar, yet distinctly different experiences and it allows you to choose whether you want to level up to unlock new options and advance the campaign or if you want to earn cash to buy and upgrade cars. The tracks and style of races differ in both and bring new challenges that keep things exciting. The cop chases get pretty wild here and I would be lying if I said I didn't have at least a little fun there. However, I'm also happy that if you choose to race during the day, you just don't have to deal with cops! That's just wonderful.\n\nLastly, the campaign is...fine. A perfectly serviceable and simple story of street racers fighting against the law with a big bad crooked cop at the helm. It felt a lot more satirical and the cops are intentionally designed to act like exaggerated caricatures. It's something different for sure. Other than that, it's basically an above average Fast&Furious plot, but neither The C0ck or Din Benzin showed up, so that automatically makes it better. The campaign did its job of helping you get to know the city, the world as a whole and the major game mechanics and it didn't overstay its welcome. Can't complain really.\n\nOverall, Need for Speed Heat really surprised me! This game overdelivers on every front and is genuinely one of the best made racing games we've gotten in recent years, especially in this kind of style. The excellent handling, the awesome graphics and the terrific selection of cars have solidified this as my new go-to racer for whenever I want to burn some rubber. It's a dream come true for any motorsports fan and it truly lets you indulge in all of your deepest desires. Asking for a good Need for Speed game these days is like asking for unicorn poop, so cherish this! It's not like the true classics of old, but damn does it ever come close! Just do yourself a favour, don't buy this at the ridiculous full price. Wait for a steep discount and get this cheap, then you'll be getting an absolutely sick deal!  Catch you on the road!",

From the get-go, it immediately struck me as an echo of Midnight Club: LA, where the focus is on getting a cool car and upgrading it both with cool decals you find/earn through the missions and with new parts to make your car faster. Each vehicle also behaves differently, so depending on what you find intuitive the \"correct\" parts to choose will change which made for a lot of fun exploring what would make each car handle best.\n\nThe gimmick of \"earn money during the daytime, earn new parts to buy at night\" is also really fun. Daytime is like a practice mode and then at night things get real with the cops chasing you down and taking your lunch money.\n\nGreat game for my goblin brain and its been a return to form with the arcade style racing games.

      "review": "In short upfront: Amazing addictive fun, one of the best NFS titles.\n\nStunning look (with graphics maxed out), very intense races and chases (esp. on \"hard\" difficulty and at night during illegal races with traffic), fun race track outlines and challenges (including all kinds of extra terrain specializations like rallye/off-road, pure drifting etc.), fun vibe and soundtrack, motivational progression through the story - perfect to get back into the NFS franchise again.\n\nDrawbacks:\n- No people other than the story characters and the spectators during races so the city could feel a bit empty if you care (but the story/character banter now and then and everything else the game offers makes up for it imo)\n- At rare times seemingly invisible little bumps your car might hit although there's nothing on the road. It won't stop you but it'll look like your car bumps into something with sparks flying and it'll slow you down a little bit for a just sec. Can be irritating when it happens but luckily that's rare and at high speeds it almost won't impact you at all.\n\nAnthing else that comes to mind, I'll add it to this list.\n\n\nLonger version after first impressions:\n\nBeen playing NFS games since the very first ones in the 90s, loved the \"HotPursuit\"s, \"Underground\"s and the first \"MostWanted\" back in 2005 (which felt to me like the peak of the franchise). After that I had a long break (Carbon, although I heard it's good, didn't feel like something new back then and ProStreet totally put me off) until recently when I wanted to pick up the latest NFS games again per discount on Steam.\nAnd I have to say that I enjoy HEAT thoroughly as it combines so much good fun stuff from previous games and is even better in a lot of ways:\n\n- an open world city where you can switch between day and night mode. During the day you participate in legal races for cash without cops getting involved - they will chase you though when you provoke them in the city outside the races - whilst at night you race in illegal ones for reputation with a higher and increasing probability to get chased by cops. When you got the rig to max out the graphics, the city, the street reflections and skyline look absolutely stunning, esp. during sunsets, rainy weather and at night when you speed down from the hillsides towards it.\n\n- a lot of car tuning and modding choices that remind me of the Underground and MostWanted games. And the way you direct your inner car parts choices towards 4 styles - on-road vs. off-road, racing vs. drifting - actually matters and influences your driving style (e.g. as long as you're on tarmac you accelerate way better but off-road you might suddenly become a sitting duck with the wrong suspension, tire and differential setup).\n\n- driving/feeling/realism: You get to choose from 3 cars at the start and can buy new ones with the cash you earn from races. The driving feels very arcade-style-intuitive and simple as you initiate drifts whenever needed, both with and without the handbrake, with ease while it always remains a challenge to master extra-long ones for drift-spots and -competitions. As mentioned before, your tuning/parts choices actually impact the driving style so you do feel the little adjustments and improvements. The game also gives you the perfect amount of NFS non-realism: traffic remains loose (which is adrenaline-inducing enough when driving downhill with 250+ kph, trust me); in order for your car to get damaged there needs to be some at least major collision that stops you and driving through a gas station repairs that damage magically-instantly; and almost anything is destructible when you drive towards it (even full grown trees snap away like twigs) - but the best thing is you don't care because it just amplifies the action, esp. during cop chases when you're just happy you're getting away.\n\n- track designs: not only are the track outlines very well designed - from curvy up- and downhill countrysides to tight Monaco-like inner city tracks - but once you progressed further to when you can also race on specific off-road tracks, you basically even get a little \"Flatout\"-mode in your NFS game on top, with varying rallye-ike terrain and sometimes crazy jumps, breaking all kinds of obstacles in your path to cut corners... it's just more insane fun stacked on top.\n\n- cop chases: compared to previous MostWanted and HotPursuit titles, the cops are waaay harder to get rid of, keep up with you for longer and are more powerful, relentless and aggressive (they used to be merely annoying boxes on wheels that got instantly totalled by you like a bulldozer, which was also fun in its own way) plus they even have a pissy, personal attitude, exchanging plans and comments on comms, which makes you feel like you're not chased by some bots with the same comms and routines over and over but by equally capable, dirty-playing drivers - just on the other side of the law. And I absolutely love it; every cop chase is intense, personal and gets you to lock in. Not only because you don't want to lose your hard-earned cash from the day and - more devastatingly - almost all of your accumulated reputation from the night if you get busted, but also because the magically-repairing gas stations only do that for a limited amount of times each night - so getting into a chase actually feels like a big deal as its always tough on you and more consequential.\n\n- music: the soundtrack is full of latin-infused bangers, ranging from chilled-out reggaeton and house to hiphop/rap and intense drum 'n bass which always seems to fit the current situation (cruising vs. racing, day vs. night, cinematic action soundtrack during cop chases). The soundtrack has always been one of the best parts of any NFS game and this one is no exception. No rock/metal tracks apparently but it all fits the beach city vibe.\n\n- campaign/story/characters/dialogue: I've only played the first few missions so I can't say much about the main storyline yet, but imho the characters and acting/dialogue (so far, from the first impressions) are decent enough. I also like that you can choose a set character for yourself with their own voice, changeable appearance etc. and the story cutscenes happen with in-game models instead of live-action film actors. A few cliche and corny moments at times (e.g. when a cop behaves like some unhinged wannabe-psycho over a car he's impounding) but hey, it's a game and story about illegal street racing crews and at least it for sure hasn't inflicted that enormous cringe-feeling (again, so far) as the 2015 Need For Speed did - those live-action cut-scenes there instantly put me off and made me uninstall it.\n\n\n\nSo all in all, even as an NFS veteran, I can heavily recommend this title. If you ignore or embrace the sometimes cliched dialogue/acting, the campaign lends the game some variety and a good motivation for progression; there's tons to do with little open-world extras like beating speed-cams, drift- and time-challenges, jump stunts etc.; it looks stunning (the quality i.e. lighting, reflections and esp. at night actually reminded me a bit of Night City in Cyberpunk - just missing people and more traffic); the driving feels intuitively-simple but can still be challenging to master as it benefits from subtle and necessary adjustments; the great latin soundtrack is blasting on full volume constantly; the races (esp. the sprint races), after about 200+ kph, feel very fast and intense and the cop chases - esp. on \"hard\" difficulty - even moreso. Perfect recent NFS title that I'm happy to 100% at some point and made me fall in love with the franchise again.",

      "review": "TL;DR - LITERALLY ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN THIS GAME - including watching pain dry. \r\n\r\nThe NFS franchise has ALWAYS been my go to racing franchise. I wish they actually cared about the game and development as much as I do. I can't recommend this game, even for the 90% discount they slap on it. It's not worth the harddrive space used. This game is far too numerous in bugs, limitations. Graphically its a pretty. \r\n\r\nThe day music is incredibly limited. It's divided into a day list and a night list. You can not change, add, shuffle. You have to listen to the same songs on repeat, so if you play for more than half an hour, you're already repeating the music. The day has a lot of Latin artists. Latin artists aren't the issue, its the fact there is NO variety between even those 12 songs, let alone ANY other genre. No rock, no pop, dance, R&B. The night is similar - its house and club beats but again, limited list and NO other genre's. The whole sound track is about an hour, so playing for more than an hour it gets stale.. real quick. \r\n\r\nThe options and settings are incredibly lacking. Can't even reduce brightness or glare or anything. Visually its nice, but when the rain last for 75% of the day/night cycle (I assume to give it the wet road difficulty). When the sun comes out, during the rain, the glare is so bad you genuinely can't see. The glare does not change based on angle of the road or anything.. facing the sun going up hill or down hill is rediculously bright. \r\n\r\nThe day cops are pathetic, like shooting fish in a bucket. AI is bad, you hit them to start a day persuit, but regardless of heat, you total one cop, and the chase ends. The night is the opposite in everyway. They difficulty is static, it does not change with driver/car skill. Heat 5 is like god mod, and good luck escaping it you reach it. Literally had to retire as asoon as i hit Heat 4 and then reset and go till 4 again. Even with no heat, and being 3rd or 4th in a race, if they see you, you become priority 1. No balance to it.\r\n\r\nThe online is limited to the few players that afk in game. \r\n\r\nThe game keeps pushing \"keys to the city\" which unlocks all map nodes - even though I have them all already.\r\n\r\ntips, hints, guides are unclear and need to be googled for better understanding.\r\n\r\nthe story is 10 hours tops if you're good at it. The plot is copy and paste from every other race movie. lost a parent to the racing scene, out in the world to make a name for yourself in the racing scene - meet you, race with you, save the day. GG. \r\n\r\nCrash damage is a joke. I'll total the hell out of my car and flip 4 times before hitting a wall and take no damage, but if i clip a car, i lose 20% of the health bar. \r\n\r\nI could go on and on ... and on, but I got better things to do than detail the colossal gaffe that is EA's NFS franchise, like lay in bed and stare at my ceiling for hours till i fall asleep. \r\n\r\nPLEASE consider better developers and games before throwing money away.",

But put it on hard and all you get added is an almost impossibly fast AI that the only way you can beat it is by having a car with about a 100 higher rating. the skills of the AI don't improve, the car only gets faster. So basicly you start the game on easy, laugh your way thru it and then when your done with all of it, you can replay it with all of your all ready good cars and beat them again. maby its gesta harder to catch up to the AI but nof bacause of skill, it just gtot faser again.",

That being said the game gets really frustrating at times. \r\n\r\nThe heat is straight up reta****, for a lack of better words. Even at level 2 heat you'll had 3 cops that took turns at 250 km/h, with no slowdown, slamming into your car dealing massive damage, and get this, no matter how much you build your car they are somehow faster than you. \r\n\r\nPersonally I've been overtaken by the cops at 300+ km/h with the acceleration similar to a bullet. While they have this godly acceleration they also phase through other cars (fun fact, you obviously cant do that yourself).\r\n  \r\nLast encounter before writing this review this happened; I got away from the first two waves of getting chased by the entire police department, while just trying to go back to the garage. As soon as I get away from the first two waves then two more cops spawns in both the only other directions there are to go, while I have the two I just lost right behind me. I end up getting rammed, almost one shot from full health, and caught with no way to escape within 10 seconds. Now that is annoying, but what is straight up infuriating is the fact the punishment of getting caught isn't losing some reputation, but all you've gained that night. Meaning the 3 long races I did, earned me, to be frank, f*ck all. I've now just wasted 15 min of my time for nothing. If you end up playing this game, you'll experience this too, a lot, like almost consistently every time. This hinders progress from being made, and makes the game straight up boring and frustrating.\r\n\r\nI don't enjoy, nor do I see anyone enjoy the police being straight up unbeatable at higher heat levels. (3+)\r\n\r\nThe punishment is way to harsh too, the fact that u can lose every single bit of reputation after several races and get left with nothing but a waste of time is insane.

Not only did EA fire ghost far before this game was even ready to be on the market, but the game is so full of horrible bugs, that it gives unbound a run for it's money, if you fall into the water in online, guess you'll have to sit there and wait for the game to figure out how to reset a freaking car, because it will always try to put your car on the ground underneath the water, so basically, it resets your car somewhere you literally cannot drive because it resets you down there too, and it does this every single time too, the ground is one of the most important aspects of a racing game, so you would expect it to function well, NOPE, the ground was likely the biggest after thought in this game, I bet good money if any playtesting even occured for this game, it was done without any ground. how in the world are you meant to drive on the ground in this game without it flipping your car over randomly, if you dare to look in at the grass or dirt, your car flips, if you dare to drive in a straight line for too long, your car flips, if you dare to turn when you want to, your car flips, clipping is insanely common, and because of that you'd think that you can restart a race whenever you need to, NOPE, these freaking mega geniuses decided that they would put a crash cam in the game, without it technically being a crash cam, basically, everytime your car is in a \"tumbling state\", the UI goes away and it puts a vignette around the screen, and there are a bunch of params setup that determine when it THINKS you aren't in a \"tumbling state\" any longer, the problem, is the params are horribly setup, so you basically have to slow to a stop, or continue driving without ever touching anything else or drifting too much etc etc, otherwise it will reset your car, the thing is, while in this tumbling state, even if that just means your car loses grip slightly from hitting a wall, you CANNOT PAUSE THE GAME, it simply doesn't let you open any menus, and if it's a situation where your car is in the middle of flipping, that can then in turn make you wait even LONGER, since it may let the car flip enough to get stuck on it's roof, at that point you then need to wait for it to start the reset sequence, and the resetting in this game is the WORST of any game ever, it can take anywhere between 10 seconds, to 10 business days for it to reset your car, and often times it does what I said before, reset you in a totally stupid place, and then has to reset you a SECOND time, this entire time you just want to restart the run and are already angry from the ground and it's stupid physics effing you over, and then they need to find any excuse to add salt to the wound, maybe this is a conspiracy to help controller manufacturers more money by making us so angry we destroy tons of controllers with their terrible game, if you don't mod games, maybe it won't be UNBEARABLE, but it will still be stupid, along with their insistence on making drifting as unfun as possible, but for a modder, this game is a nightmare, it's garbage physics, lack of cohesion, mixed with it's tactics to ragebait you intentionally, make it the ultimate game for wanting to give up on life, everything about this game became visuals, even all the mods became visuals, because there is no fun to be had modding it in any other way, or the gameplay either, they assumed that even though the physics and quality was not even ready as a beta, it was still released by covering it with glitter, this ended up being the same tactic for unbound as well, but that game actually got updates, even though the \"bug fixes\" broke more than fixed, this game was never given a chance to be fixed, and could've been fun if it had been, mind you I have 1,000 hours on this game between my two accounts, that doesn't mean I have to give the game a glazing like everyone else, no other game has made me genuinely rage so much in my life, because the game does everything in it's power to piss you off, and I swear I'm not joking, the physics behaves even worse while doing a race, because everytime I drive on the same route when not actually in the race, I have far less issues, this game is the culmination of years of EA greed and no care for the game but only the money, and people eat it up like it's frosted flakes, but it's nothing but a steaming pile.

At night, cops will actively chase you once you hit the first Heat level(which increases when you finish activities and races), and you earn Rep points, game's EXP, to increase your level and unlock parts and cars. It's a bit exhausting to constantly alternate between two, and it does feel like a cheap way to double the playtime. The game also has a level cap of 50, making REPs past that point completely meaningless. Really, a reward ratio of 70/30 would've sufficed to incentivize the players. \n\nI am sure nobody cares, but the story, as always, is nothing to write home about. NFS 2015 was just famous people saying their hi's and in Payback we had a direct to DVD movie plot. This one too has a story some underpaid intern wrote 3 hours before the deadline. But at least it is about street racing and coppers, which is an improvement from their previous entity. My main complaint with it is that they shoehorned iconic cars from their older games into missions with no actual explanations or meaningful references. All this while the cover car, Polestar 1 is not mentioned at all.\n\nTechnical issues, several are present. Load times are atrocious, and player decals are noticeably low fidelity for some reason. Prerendered cutscenes run at an impressive 2 or 3 fps because of wacky glitch in newer hardware, and I never was able to solve this problem despite trying all the fixes online, limiting CPU cores and setting up compatibility modes.\n\nThe strength of the Need For Speed games that other games don't have has to be a cop chase and its urban setting, with the arcade racing genre yet to recover from its death and with clout chasing lowlifes staging street takeovers and highway swimming in real life maybe the illegality of the theme hits too close to home when every publisher in the field is trying to play safe. Whatever the real reason is, a game like this is rare today. And they fumbled on this one, again. The peak experience of MW2005, 10+ cop cars trying to apprehend you and you crashing them left and right using a giant donut or scaffolding, is not present here. The police AI is certainly better than in the past games, but cops are still not rubberbandery enough to keep the thrill at high levels, and you are actively discouraged from ramming interceptors because of the health bar of your ride. It's not fun.\n\nWith how often it goes on discount under $5, the bar is certainly at the bottom. But with how noticeable and unignorable its faults are, it's only good for its sale price. The best compliment I can give to this game is that it's at least, better than Payback.",

More and more they feel like a goofy arcade game with the look of fancy cards. The handling and feel is so far away from the good mix pro-street had... I think I'm finally turned off by the Franchise. This game has a good story going for it and many story arks you can do, that's fun, but if you're looking for a game that plays at all realistic even in the slightest.... THIS ISN'T IT. Story-line for the game isn't bad, and is funny at times, but I sadly cannot recommend it if you like realism. Now if you want to play a crazy game where you can take 90 degree turns at 100+ and come out going 70+ MPH (which is impossible) you'll love this game. It's just not my cup of tea anymore.",
