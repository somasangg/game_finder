      "review": "[h1] I think it's safe to buy now [/h1]\n\nWhat can you say man, it's Oblivion. Take one of the greatest video games ever made, slap a fresh coat of paint on it, make some modest QOL improvements/modernizations, and the result is...a really damn good video game! Oblivion is in my top 5 favorite video games of all time, so when I heard it was getting a remaster (and let's be real, we all heard, it was the worst kept secret in gaming), I said shut up and take my money and was in there day 1, because I am what is known in the games business as a \"mark.\" Day 1 was almost 8 months ago at this point, so why has it taken me so long to write this review? Well, I told myself that I would wait to review Oblivion until I felt I had \"finished\" it, but in hindsight that's kind of silly, isn't it? Because finishing Oblivion is a monster undertaking, at the time of writing I am 85 hours deep into this game, I have finished the main questline, the Knights of the Nine questline, and most (but not all!) of the Fighter's Guild and Thieves Guild questlines. I have not started the Mages Guild or Dark Brotherhood questlines, nor have I even set foot in the Shivering Isles. There is [b] easily [/b] 120+ hours of content here, and for a relatively modest $49.99 ($59.99 for the deluxe edition which comes with a couple new quests and some sick-ass armor that I highly recommend), safe to say your dollar will go pretty far with this one even at full asking price, but of course you're more than welcome to wait for a sale or play it on Game Pass (assuming you haven't canceled it yet).\n\nYou might look at my progress and say, \"gee, you haven't gotten very far, just what have you been doing all this time?\" Just taking it all in, man. This is one of the most gorgeous video games I have ever played. I don't know if it's the [i] biggest [/i] remaster of all time, but I struggle to think of one that was bigger. This is a top-to-bottom visual overhaul, and it just looks so damn good. For the vast majority of my playthrough I wasn't really fast-traveling, just hopping on my horse and soaking in the new-and-improved Cyrodiil, wandering around the map and just seeing where the adventure took me. It's a rare gift to be able to experience one of your favorite games for the first time *again*, and man, what a great thing; there were some moments where I would take in a particularly breathtaking vista and actually get a little emotional, and all I could think was, \"Those madmen. They actually did it.\"\n\nAnd yeah, in this day and age, any time Bethesda does something that isn't some kind of massive f*ck-up you have to celebrate it. In the early days post-launch this game was full of that Bethesda Magic (derogatory), and some of the post-launch patches actually made performance [i] worse, [/i] to the point that I had to put the game down for a while because it was crashing so frequently. However, with this current version, v.1.5 or whatever we're on now, I feel confident in saying that the game is [i] mostly [/i] fixed, I'm playing on an AMD Radeon 6950 XT, and after a LOT of tinkering, I've managed to get the game running at a stable 60 fps on high settings, 3k resolution, FSR and ray tracing turned off. As an aside, it says this game is Steam Deck verified and I don't buy that for a moment, when I tried it on Deck, cloud saves were completely busted, but hey if I [b] could [/b] import my save data I'm sure I would have enjoyed playing for 30 minutes at 480p before my battery died.\n\nSo to sum up, yeah man, Oblivion is a great game and this is a great remaster. If you've never played Oblivion before, this is the definitive way to experience the game. I prefer it to Skyrim, I think it has better quest design, plus a quirky charm and tongue-in-cheek sense of humor that's missing from that later game. It's a good value for the price, and after some patches I'm confident in saying they finally got the damn thing working and running smoothly. Well...smooth for a Bethesda game at least, everything's relative. If you love the Elder Scrolls, if you love RPGs, you'll love Oblivion Remastered.\n\nTL;DR they animated the voice actress flubbing her line and starting over. Perfect game no notes, 10/10",

Back in the day, you could only dream of those textures!\r\nEverything else is still...pretty much Oblivion. And that's both great and bad. I've played the og Oblivion a lot and for me, the remaster is an awesome way to dive back into old memories.\r\nHowever, if you've never played it before, don't expect too much! While it is still a good game - even by modern standards - there are a ton of problems, bugs (several game-breaking ones too, so always save in multiple slots!) and other oddities that sour the experience. Also, better games have appeared in the meantime, so why not play those instead? And awesome mods for the original game exist too, for free.\r\nSo, if you don't have sweet nostalgia, maybe wait for a BIG sale - I'd say 25-30 bucks at most - and temper your expectations.\r\nI'm glad that it is what it is and I know that it's buggy and messy, but I can't help but wonder what could've been if they'd have changed more about the game...",

I walk out of the sewers with the confidence of a man who has a plan, and ten minutes later I am picking flowers like a deranged medieval botanist, breaking into random people’s houses to see if they own anything shiny, and joining every guild like I am collecting loyalty cards. Meanwhile the entire kingdom is burning in a demon apocalypse and I am treating it like background noise while I go help some NPC find his pet mudcrab or whatever. Every guard sounds like he smoked gravel for breakfast and every citizen looks like the AI that generated their faces had a personal vendetta against beauty, and somehow I still love these potato humans more than half the people I know. I hate how much fun I had. I hate that I spent hours pretending I had urgent things to do while in reality I was chasing butterflies and committing light crimes across Cyrodiil. I hate that the main quest is still untouched like I am allergic to heroism. Returning to Oblivion in 2025 was the gaming equivalent of texting an ex at 3 AM knowing exactly how stupid it is and doing it anyway with both thumbs. 10 out of 10, would waste my life again like an absolute fool",

      "review": "EXTREMELY POSITIVE\nThe greatest classic has earned its well-deserved rebirth\n\nThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was and remains my favorite childhood game. I eagerly awaited this remaster, fearing disappointment, but the developers not only met my expectations — they exceeded them. This isn't just another “upscaled” game, it's a love letter to fans and the perfect way for a new generation to get acquainted with one of the greatest RPGs in history.\n\nWhat's brilliantly done:\n1. Visuals and atmosphere:\nThe most obvious and impressive change. The game has gained incredibly detailed 4K textures that have enriched its unique artistic style rather than killing it. The forests around Cheydinhal are still magical and bright, but now every leaf and every blade of grass is rendered in detail. The moss-covered ruins, the Mages Guild armor, the characters' faces — everything looks modern, yet retains that slightly carnivalesque but charming aesthetic of 2006. The remaster makes good use of modern lighting and HDR: the sunsets over the Golden Shore make you want to turn off the interface and just watch, and the caves and dungeons are finally truly dark and scary, where you can't do without a torch or the Light spell.\n\n2. Technical revival: Stability and comfort\nThe original Oblivion was famous for its bugs, which became part of folklore. Here, you get rock-solid 60 FPS stability (with an option to unlock the frame rate), no crashes during fast travel, and, thank Akatosh, the famous “save bloat” (swelling of save files) that killed playability during long sessions has been fixed. Loading times between locations have been reduced to 2-3 seconds. This is the game you can now play without having to fight its technical imperfections.\n\n3. Gameplay: The convenience of the new era\nThe remaster has carefully preserved the gameplay foundation, but added a host of quality-of-life improvements:\n\nImproved interface: It is now adaptive for large screens, easy to customize, and the spell/item wheel has become more intuitive.\n\nModern crafting system: Alchemy and enchanting have become more convenient, with clear menus and filters.\n\nRevamped achievement system: New, interesting challenges have been added that encourage exploration of every corner of Tamriel.\n\n4. Sound and Music: Timeless Classics\nThe soundtrack has been remastered and sounds clean and powerful. Jeremy Soule's familiar themes, from the epic intro to the peaceful music in the forests, strike a chord with renewed force. The sounds of swords, spells, and the cries of the Dremor in the Gates of the Abyss have all gained new depth without losing their original “crystal clarity.”\n\nWhat remains “old school” (and that's a good thing!):\nThe developers did not “fix” what fans love about the original. Enemy levels still scale with yours, which may not appeal to everyone, but it's part of the spirit of Oblivion. The famous skill-based leveling system is also still there — it's not perfect, but for purists, it's an important part of the experience. And yes, some of the dialogue and facial animations are the same, which makes them even more nostalgic against the backdrop of sparkling new textures.\n\nVerdict:\nThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is a prime example of how remasters should be done. It doesn't redraw the game from scratch, losing its soul, but carefully restores it, emphasizing all its strengths and smoothing out technical rough edges.\n\nFor fans of the original: This is the perfect excuse to return to Cyrodiil. You'll be amazed by the beauty of this world all over again, just like the first time, but with the comforts of 2024.\n\nFor new players: If you've played Skyrim and want to understand where the series' roots lie, this is your best entry point. A deep spell system, flexible leveling, unforgettable guild questlines (especially the Dark Brotherhood!), and a true high fantasy atmosphere await you.\n\nTime has not been kind to many games of that era, but the development team has given Oblivion immortality. This is not just a nostalgic trip, it is a full-fledged, living, breathing adventure that can still give many modern RPGs a run for their money.\n\nSpend a coin on the guard and immerse yourself in this world. You won't regret it.",

      "review": "The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered brings one of Bethesda’s most celebrated RPGs into the modern era. It keeps the heart of the 2006 classic—freedom, exploration, and deep role-playing—while refreshing the visuals, performance, and interface for new systems. The remaster doesn’t reinvent the game, but it finally makes Cyrodiil look the way nostalgia remembers it.\n\nGameplay remains nearly identical to the original. Players create their own hero, escape the Imperial City’s prison, and enter a massive open world full of quests, factions, and dungeons. The mix of real-time combat, character development through use, and open choice still feels liberating. Despite its age, few RPGs offer this level of freedom and personality.\n\nThe new version upgrades visuals across the board. Lighting, textures, and draw distance are vastly improved, and character models look sharper without losing their original style. Weather effects, reflections, and foliage density give the world new life. It’s still unmistakably Oblivion, but finally without the heavy blur and stiff animations of 2006.\n\nPerformance is mixed but generally solid. On modern consoles it runs smoothly at high resolutions, though PC players report occasional frame drops and stutters. The menus and UI are reworked for cleaner navigation, and controller layouts feel natural. Loading times are also much shorter, making fast travel and exploration faster.\n\nThe inclusion of Shivering Isles and Knights of the Nine means the full experience is here. Combined with hundreds of side quests and guild storylines, the content remains enormous. The quest writing still shines, especially in the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild arcs—proof of how strong the original design was.\n\nAudio has been lightly remastered rather than replaced. Jeremy Soule’s orchestral soundtrack still captures the grandeur of Tamriel, and ambient effects sound clearer with modern mixing. Voice work remains dated but nostalgic, adding charm more than distraction.\n\nOverall, Oblivion Remastered succeeds at preserving a classic while modernizing just enough to make it comfortable to play again. It doesn’t fix every legacy flaw—combat and AI still feel old—but the magic of exploration, discovery, and freedom remains fully intact. For fans of open-world RPGs, it’s the best way to experience one of the genre’s defining worlds.",

      "review": "Blivvy Remastered is wonderful. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was always a fantastic Elder Scrolls game, and now it's extra-gorgeous. As a long-time Elder Scrolls fan, this is a high point of the series of games. Gone are the 2006 mushy faces tech of ridicule, however they still kept all the mismatched (because all were recorded separately) voice lines of NPCs talking to each other. This is actually charming, in a nostalgic/historical way.  Menues are NOT console-ized as they were in Skyrim. Gameplay and interactions are improved over Morrowind, but still keep Morrowind's origin in their design (such as Persuasion still being a feature with any NPC you talk to).\n\nThis takes places in the province of Cyrodill, and as such is lush with normal (to IRL) green vegetation; lots of grass. The ES game Oblivion is classic high-fantasy style (where my beloved Morrowind was much more unique & weird, and Skyrim was snow & Viking-themed with the Nords).\n\nI especially like how you can have 1 spell ready to cast with C at any time, while you are holding weapons.  In Morrowind you had to switch between weapons mode and spell casting mode.  In Skyrim you had to select what was in each hand, with perks to determine how well you can 'perform'.\n\nAs with Elder Scrolls games, it's completely and entirely open world; go anywhere and do whatever you want at any time. You certainly don't have to be a do-gooder knight; joining the Dark Brotherhood of assassins, the Thieves Guild, and/or becoming a vampire are options for you.  The story progression has you entering several Oblivion portals into a Hell-like dimension where you make your way through the fiery land and to the top of a metal tower facility to destroy it and thus close the portal (where the Oblivion denizens are invading Cyrodill from)... this can be ignored if you don't want to follow the main story.\n\nAs with every Elder Scrolls game there are mods!  The OG Oblivion mods don't work, so there aren't *that* many but there are still plenty.",

The Remaster takes this one element of the game that I think needed work and brings it squarely into the 2020s and it makes what was already a fantastic fantasy sandbox much more approachable. The overhaul to the levelling system is also much more forgiving than the original, and overall while the specs are significantly higher than the 2006 original it's otherwise better in every way in my opinion.",

I swear...the original version did not have this many.\n- No mods. (Good luck keep track of what you explored and what you didn't)\n\nedit:\nTwo notes after finishing game\n1. THE BUGS....SO MANY BUGS....SO MANY QUEST BREAKING BUGS. I know I have like 160+ hours in the game, but, honestly, I think a lot of that time was spent loading a previous save in order to try and avoid a bug that stopped me from completing a chain quest.\n 2. If the Shivering Isles quests wouldn't have been so good, I swear I would have changed the review to negative in spite of my time in the game. I had a lot of fun in the dlc, but, as mentioned above... I spent too much time dodging bugs. Some examples:\n- Boulders that you can kick around\n- Floating NPCs and Monsters\n- Permanent aggro\n- Missing NPCs\n- NPCs that don't progress quest steps\n- Ability to crash the game on purpose and not",

The scenery, the music, the voice acting and the sheer feeling of adventure when you first exit those sewers is something that is hard to forget.\r\n\r\nAs far as remasters go, this is a good one. Not to break tradition with TES games, even though this isn't exactly a new entry, it does have some tweaks to the game systems, for better and worse. I for instance didn't love the changes to the leveling system (I know, I'm crazy, but I was fond of the complexity of the old system and the idea of having to plan your character to be able to maximise him--something about it fed my OCD), but what you have to remember is that, as with any moddable Bethesda RPG, [b]nothing about the game is set in stone thanks to the modding community[/b].\r\n\r\nWhat's important to know here, as a remaster, is that the game remains very faithful to its original iteration, which is awesome because the original Oblivion is a great game, and many of us playing this version will play it for that nostalgia.\r\n\r\nSo, friends, once again we delve into the jaws of Oblivion!",

Even so, if you’ve got the hardware, this is the best way to play the game in 2025. Recommend.",

      "review": "I love Oblivion, but I do not like this remaster. It introduces more bugs than it fixes, it eats up a whopping 110 more GB than the original, and for every thoughtful design change (such as the tweaks to leveling to address The Leveling Problem), the devs made two more annoying or obtuse design changes (most notably in the UI and menus, by adding additional submenus, requiring additional keystrokes to access crucial stat information, or removing much-needed organizational subcategories in the inventory panes). While the graphics are overall improved, this comes at the cost of performance on more modest PC setups compared to the original. And on a personal note, part of the charm of Oldblivion came from the uncanny character models and the half-dozen voice actors carrying 99% of the game's dialogue on their gigachad shoulders -- the juxtaposition of picturesque environments with goofy-looking creatures and characters. In updating the visuals and audios, some of the magic is lost, for me. Moreover, Oblivion was already a clearly imperfect game -- from its wobbly writing to its pendulum-swing dfficulty curve to its bug-ridden moment-to-moment experience -- and the remaster does very little to address some well-documented problems. For example, proposing a solution to The Leveling Problem does not fully address The Level-Scaling Problem. \r\n\r\nIn short, if you are trying to choose between the old and the new, just buy Oldblivion. It is much cheaper (especially when on sale), and at least when the experience becomes completely jank and broken, you are getting what you paid for from a 2006-era game, as opposed to feeling cheated by a modern remaster that sadly fails to \"master\" much of the original's mechanics, systems, or most importantly, its spirit.",

      "review": "[i]The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion[/i] was perhaps one of my favorite games as a young teenager. I had played it on my Xbox 360 while my dad watched and it was also perhaps the game that got me into hunting for achievements, as it was the first game I ever 100% completed. People can say what they want about Bethesda now, I mostly agree with the criticisms, but I think their older titles had something special about them that they fail to replicate now with their newer ideas. So much so that I think more people are concerned about [i]The Elder Scrolls: VI[/i] than there are people actually anticipating its release. Bethesda has not done a good job lately in securing their community, especially with what happened with [i]Starfield[/i] being so dull.\n\nAnd the remastering of this game proves why that is. This is a prime example of \"UE5 slop\" that you might often see online being applied to games designed in the Unreal Engine. [i]Borderlands 4[/i] had a similar release strategy where the developers release it to the store and ignore feedback and criticism about bad performance until they start realizing that the player base was right the whole time and their continuous lying wasn't fooling anybody into thinking that all they had to do was enable DLSS. Bethesda, however; released a low effort project, secured their money, and seemingly already abandoned the game. They are somehow worse than Gearbox and Randy Pitchford in that case because at least they went back on their laurels to try and fix BL4. \n\nIt isn't just an example of UE5 slop, it's also been woke-ified, where as early as the character customization screen you see the terrible \"body type\" gender selector instead of what existed before where it was actually male and female genders. This is partly why people have lost hope for Bethesda and any future [i]Fallout[/i] or [i]Elder Scrolls[/i] titles. They have lost the plot in a number of ways. I shouldn't have to install a mod to add proper gender to my character so that I am not running around as a \"body type 1\" and my romanced NPC isn't known as a \"body type 2\" or something while the tourists continue to complain about gender and we have to continue pandering to their perpetually offended sensibilities. \n\nUnfortunately, it became too late for me to refund the game after two hours of playtime otherwise I wish I could have saved the $50 USD. It isn't that the game runs bad for me on my RTX 5090, it's that we can't trust that Bethesda did not implement or change other aspects of the original game to oblige an agenda that the industry continues to push. You would expect that the remastered version of the original would still keep much of the original the same, but with better graphics and perhaps some important QoL changes. \n\nTo make matters worse, Bethesda mentioned that they were not going to officially support modded content, which is heresy coming from them when their video games have always supported modding, and mods could have, yet again, fixed this game and its issues. \n\nThe only thing that stayed true to the original experience? The game, while having a huge map to explore and plenty of quests to do, has a lackluster variety of enemies and is on a sort of table where, as you level up, it moves away from spawning wolves to now spawning bears, completely removing lower level creatures from the map or just having them scale to you. You can easily get distracted by the open world and side quest content and go back into the main story and find yourself fighting against powerful atronachs while the friendly guards around you are slaughtered because they did not scale to your level. This was actually an issue with the original Oblivion and you had to play it a certain way if you didn't want to screw yourself over. I wonder if Oblivion is a game that could actually hold up to modern standards for video gaming, and I'm actually not too sure now that I think of it. \n\nThey \"revamped\" the leveling experience at least so that you didn't screw yourself over that way, but, even still, this is a disappointing remastering of a once great video game in the [i]Elder Scrolls[/i] franchise. It's a lazy, overpriced cash grab that should really serve to hurt Bethesda's reputation more than it helps it.\n\nThis game should actually be displayed as highly negatively reviewed here on Steam judging by achievement completion tracking where there is a steep drop in players where they didn't even make it a few hours into the game to have closed their first oblivion gate. This is literally like the third main story mission, so you know the game is problematic, it is just that award farmers here on Steam virtually inflate positive scores in an effort to be given awards on their reviews. Most of those positive reviews are not actually that authentic.\n\nI played this game here on Steam for a mere fraction of the time I put into it on my Xbox 360 back in the day, and I was just suffering through it to get all of the achievements once more to go and play something better and more worth my time and money. This product genuinely saddens me because it had such potential to be a worthy remastering and it was squandered by a studio that clearly doesn't care about its products and its players anymore. The sooner people come to realize that, the sooner we can get Bethesda shutdown or at least restructured like all the rest of these incompetent game studios. \n\nDon't even buy it on sale. Just purchase the original Oblivion from 2006 and access the treasure trove of mods that enhance its graphics if you want to experience this game properly.",

Firstly, the performance of this remaster is abysmal. On my mid-high end computer (ryzen 5 5600x, rx 7800xt), the game running at 1440p on high settings struggles to maintain 60 fps in the open world, and in some spots it goes as low as 30. I also experienced some extreme stuttering when exploring the open world. For a game releasing in 2025 this is completely unacceptable. Secondly, this remaster is a buggy mess. Not only does it carry over bugs from the original game, but it creates new ones. They may be minor, but they add up to make for a very annoying and frustrating experience. Lastly, the changes to the levelling system make the game very unbalanced. Unlike the original where only major skills contribute to xp gain, in the remaster all skills contribute to xp gain. This causes your character to level up way too quickly, making you miss out on entire tiers of loot and enemies.\n\nIf you just want to experience Oblivion with nice graphics and don't mind performance issues, bugs and imbalances, this remaster is fine. But if you want a more complete experience, I would recommend you wait for Skyblivion or just stick with the original game.",

This game is ridiculous and for me it feels like an expensive template project for Unreal Engine 5.\n\nIf you want to play a simulator about a [strike]drug addict who constantly uses amphetamines [/strike], go straight ahead and buy it. I also recommend going even faster and using sprinting, which wasn't even in the original game.\n\nFrom the classics, the only thing left to do is max out Acrobatics and Athletics, and drink a ton of skooma - then you're guaranteed to reach the third cosmic velocity.\n\nJokes aside - all the other new UI and QoL improvements and features, frankly, are of little use and even more annoying than handy. Still there are lots of pros and cons, and everyone will have different experience with it, but now I feel both toxic and sad, and more than ever, because my sense of nostalgia has completely destroyed my common sense and my ability to accept something new without holding tightly to the old and dear to my soul.\n\nI hope this comment gets lost among the other disgruntled comments, because I'm embarrassed to even write this, but I really want to speak out somewhere.\n[/i]",

My horse looks like it's floating in the air every time I ride it which really takes me out of the experience. Combat is stupidly janky and playing anything released in the last 15 years reminds me of just how much gameplay mechanics have improved since 2006.\n\nCities look horribly empty by modern standards - going from Cyberpunk where every little alley is believably filled with NPCs to this is jarring to say the least. And they've kept the horribly dated NPC dialogue system from the original (look it up on Youtube if you don't know what I'm talking about), which may be nostalgic for some of the older players but for a new player it's so laughably dated it's a joke.\n\nThe worst thing about the game is the performance - constant stuttering even with DLSS and frame gen turned on. Granted I don't have the most powerful PC but it is capable of running most triple A games at medium to high settings so this shouldn't be an excuse.\n\nIt's basically the same game with better textures. The dated gameplay, dialogue, animations and world-building that might have been fine in 2006 just aren't good enough today.

Now it has crashed a couple of times.\n\nThe original don't have this problems. Was QA done by a CEO or AI?",

Bethesda just refuses to fix all the bugs that is plaguing this game. I cant go 20 minutes without a crash to desktop, and that just makes me not wanna play it. I LOVE the original Oblivion, but this is just plain Bethesda cash grab with no fixes in sight.",
