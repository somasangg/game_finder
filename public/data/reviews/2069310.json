I like the new planes, the graphics seem a little better, but paying $70 to upgrade from 9.5s is steep. I would think 30 or so to upgrade would be fair price, because let's be honest the software is almost still the same it always has been. I really like Realflight, and for someone who's into RC and has never had it before, full price is extremely worth it in my opinion, and I think it would be even if there were 3 planes to choose from, because that's cheaper than most models and the fact you can fly so many different types and learn the different angles and test new concepts is almost invaluable. Upgrading from 9.5s? I feel your pain, but the newer planes are really cool. Do it.",
