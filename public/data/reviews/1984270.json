It’s turn-based, but every move feels like solving a Rubik’s Cube that occasionally punches back. Timing, combo skills, and team synergy actually matter, no button mashing your way to glory here. You will learn strategy… or perish trying.\n\n[b]Digivolution Mechanic:[/b]\nYou don’t just level up, you raise your Digimon’s stats, personality, and sometimes their emotional stability (mine cries when I don’t feed it enough praise). Evolving isn’t permanent either; you can de-evolve to unlock new forms. It’s like Pokémon, but if your Charizard could go back to Charmander to rethink its life choices.\n\n[b]Story & Writing:[/b]\nImagine a mix between a wholesome Saturday morning cartoon and a late-night anime that questions the nature of friendship. You read bedtime stories to strangers, help your Digimon understand human emotions, and occasionally stop a rogue AI from deleting your save file out of love.\n\n[b]Graphics & Sound:[/b]\nBright, stylish, and nostalgic in all the right ways.

      "review": "[h1][i][b]Digimon Story Time Stranger[/b][/i] may not be the greatest creature-collector/monster battle game but it is absolutely delightful for people who loves Digimon, potentially newcomers too.[/h1]\n\nHype is real for Digimon fans, while the game itself is awesome and it's probably the best Digimon RPG game up to date but it isn't perfect as it comes with some flaws. Excellent story writing, in the beginning it starts off slow and the plot can be quite confusing later on tho it'll get better, definitely worth to play until the end. The adventure gets a little dark at some point but not so much. Honestly I love the way they added Shadow Puppets as they narrate stories here, knowing they were made with real props just blew my mind. I also find some of the characters likeable. Decent gameplay with fluid animations, sometimes a little addictive however it can get repetitive and awfully grindy if you want to collect lots of Digimon. Visually looks nice but the amount of bloom effect makes everything looks somewhat blurry on highest settings, turning off \"Bloom\" option did not help for me. World designs are absolutely gorgeous, being able to travel between Digimon World and Earth is really fun. Pretty vast exploration although the maps are linear with many invisible walls around. There are outer-dungeons which players can discover, they are quite enjoyable to challenge and the best part is that you can get a free Digimon after beating the level. There is a mini-game about Card Battle but it's pretty much depends on luck. Digimon list are quite huge, some are rideable which is a great addition. Almost all characters are fully voiced, with exception of side stories' interactions and main character. The dub on default is English but changeable to Japanese. BGM sounds nice, the main theme [i]\"wherever you are\" by reche[/i] is so good it almost make me shed a tear.\n\nSpeaking of which, regarding the \"awfully grindy part\".. it kinda sucks that the digivolving system is highly dependant on Digimon's personality where players require to train them in the DigiFarm. Just don't go on blindly and then wonder why you can't get the lines correctly like me, because that's what happened when I got too excited and forgot about the way it works until many hours invested.. oh well, as long as everything did in correct order it should be fine. However it still can be felt like a chore as each training consumes time, hence the grindy part. The good part is that the Digimons in DigiFarm can earn EXP as well, however the inability to check digivolutions of respective Digimon in DigiFarm is a great flaw due to the hassle of removing and add them back again when requirements were not met, etc. I've also encountered a bug(?) where my main roster Digimons would get stuck somewhere of the map or simply not appearing at random times, which prevented me from riding any.\n\nThere is something that worth to take a note, if you're fond of [b]Black Agumon[/b] & [b]Black Garurumon[/b] evolution lines, you'll have to purchase the [u]Pre-order Bonus Pack DLC[/u] even if it just meant to unlock the lines. I personally pre-ordered the game earlier before release so I had no problems, however when I found out that for other people who did not purchase that DLC will be very disappointed. Most of the DLCs aren't really important unless you want more cosmetic options and/or quicker way to farm Digimons level and gold. Season Pass DLC seems to have a great potential for additional content and Digimon lines in future.\n\nOverall the game is fun and it has been a good adventure for me, would love to come back to 100% it, hopefully next year. For the price it offers may not be justifying for some people so I'd  strongly suggest buying on sale. Recommended for both hardcore Digimon fans and anyone who is into creature-collector and monster battle games, can always give the demo a try if uncertain!",

I found myself exploring, aiming to complete the field guide ASAP just so I could get a path to who I wanted. I even went about taking advantage of the DNA digivolution changes; you see, in CSHM we would only receive 1 piece of the fusion back upon breaking it down. Here, however, we receive both pieces, and honestly, it's quite an easy experience farm. I'm looking at you, Exveemon and Stingmon! The removal of the party size limit was like a dream; all that was required for you to be able to use the Digimon you wanted was story progression to complete more side quests! I also found myself not being particularly fond of how Digi-Ride was implemented into the game. Despite it being marketed as the go-to means of travel, it didn’t really feel faster than sprinting in most areas.",

      "review": "It's been 7 years since I wrote a game review, this game is my GOTY for 2025 and I decided I'd like to write a review on it. It's definitely worth getting. I'll start my review with the one negative, everything else is positive.\n\nThe Only Con: The grind. In any JRPG there is expected grind, but in this game there is still a lot of grind even if you purchase the DLC content which adds a dungeon that makes EXP & grinding much quicker. Digimon is grindy due to being able to digivolve and de-digivolve your digimon over and over again for the opportunity of boosted stats, and the game encourages this too. (I wrote this review before reaching the final evolutions & can say all the grinding was 100% worth it after reaching the final tier/ DNA Digivolutions)\n\nEverything else is wonderful & the only times I found myself upset was when I fell behind on my grinding due to trying to zoom through the story quickly because the story IS AMAZING, but again this is my fault. The story was so so good that I couldn't help rushing.\n\nIt's not often that we get games that fully dive into time travel but this one goes in deeply in a way that is refreshing and with a new perspective that also quickly pulls you in & connects the Digimon & human worlds beautifully.\n\nI often struggle with UI when first diving into a game and am directionally challenged. I had 0 problems with that in this game. The UI is easy to understand, the guides at the beginning are very engaging & helped me pick up on everything quickly. The navigation in this game is easy to understand too & I had no problems getting through zones too.\n\nThe VAing is amazing but I may be biased because I got super excited hearing Cristina Vee play Aegiomon, she will always be one of my favorite VAs of all time, she also voices my favorite character in Hunter x Hunter, Killua, so I'm probably biased. There was so much love breathed into this game at every single angle, including the VAing too.\n\nI picked this game over the new Pokemon game and have 0 regrets. This game is everything that Pokemon needs to become imo. I love how the story director didn't shy away from discussing difficult and deep themes in this game such as grief and self doubt/ imposter syndrome and so much more. I cannot recommend this game enough and this is a must play.\n\nThe last Digimon game I played was Digimon World 3 and Digimon Rumble Arena so it's been a while. After this one I will definitely be catching up on the others.",

Not much of a deal breaker though imo!\r\n\r\nThe voices are okay-ish. I played the game with English VO and most of the story characters were good. The digimon voices were on the weaker side though and often either had repeats amongst each other or used the same VA. Though I get that it wouldn't have been feasible considering the amount of Digimon there are. Luckily there are already some mods that try to fix that! :3\r\n\r\nGameplay-wise you got your standard monster collection thing going with usual turn based combat. Both very fun with some nice team builds you can have!\r\n\r\nCostumes and music tracks being locked behind day 1 DLC sucks and may only be worth it when they're on a big sale. Those DLC dungeons might be fine, but I don't own them and I got through the game well enough without 'em!\r\n\r\nOverall a very fun game and hopefully one of many great Digimon games to come out from here on out!

      "review": "Digimon Time Stranger can best be described as what you might get if Persona and Pokémon had a child—an engaging blend of creature-raising, character-driven storytelling, and strategic combat. This makes it an excellent entry point for players who may be unfamiliar with the Digimon franchise, as it combines familiar RPG elements with the unique charm and depth the series is known for.\r\n\r\nFor longtime fans coming from Digimon World on the original PlayStation, it’s important to clarify what this game is—and what it isn’t. If you’re searching for an experience that closely mirrors the classic PS1 game, with heavy micromanagement such as feeding, training, bathroom needs, and the life-cycle mechanics where your Digimon eventually pass away and reincarnate, you may find Digimon World: Next Order to be a closer fit. Next Order retains those traditional virtual-pet systems and focuses heavily on day-to-day care and partner maintenance.\r\n\r\nDigimon Time Stranger, on the other hand, shifts toward a more story-driven RPG structure. While it still features Digimon raising and evolution, the emphasis is placed on narrative progression, party building, and strategic battles rather than constant micromanagement. It’s a more streamlined and accessible approach that allows players to spend more time exploring and engaging with the world while still feeling connected to their partner Digimon.\r\n\r\nOne standout feature is the presentation. The graphics in Digimon Time Stranger are impressively polished—arguably more visually striking than what we’ve seen in recent Pokémon releases. The environments are vibrant, character models are detailed, and the overall aesthetic feels modern and thoughtfully crafted.\r\n\r\nWhether you’re new to Digimon or a returning fan, Digimon Time Stranger offers a refined, stylish RPG experience that respects the franchise’s roots without being bound by them.",

Overall, Digimon Time Stranger was an extremely good game. There's tons of cool digimon to battle with, the battle system lets you choose the battle speed to be the speed you want and you can have super fast battle speed. There is multiple difficulty modes to choose from meanwhile the latest Pokemon games still have no option to select difficulty. The battles take a lot of strategy and the game is a ton of fun to play. A really cool addition in Digimon Time Stranger is for the first time in a Digimon game you can ride your Digimon as you explore areas in the game. Battles let you fight with 3 digimon at a time and guest party members as well. Only negative I can say about this game is the music could have been better. Digimon Story Time Stranger has way more depth then any pokemon game ever made, a way better story than any Pokemon game and it's overall a very good game.",

      "review": "Let me preface this by saying: Digimon Story Time Stranger is one of, if not the best game in the entire Digimon series, including games other than the Story titles\n\nNot only the story is phenomenal, the gameplay is the culmination of everything the Digimon series strived to be, including game mechanics from a lot of the past Digimon Story titles that have been improved upon and make the game an enjoyable playthrough for Digimon fans and JRPG fans alike.\n\nIt was really engaging the whole way, the battle mechanics are the best they have ever been, no more long grindy sessions or random encounters that the past games have been know for, instead having a lot of friendlier and a lot less time consuming options to developing your dream team as watch the story.\n\nAnd by the way, what a story! This is the first time in a while that I couldn't really predict the ending as I was pacing through it and it was a really emotional but somewhat light-hearted journey.\n\nIt's not all roses and rainbows though, I feel like there was some things that I wish were different:\nFor one, I think the way that they did the DigiFarms on this game is worse that earlier entries in the series, I didn't feel the need to engage with the DigiFarm until pretty much endgame when I needed to have certain personalities or stats for my Digimon to evolve, I kinda missed the DigiFarm being somewhere you had to return to, to see your Digimon developing and stuff, this game made it feel like an after-thought and not a main mechanic, which I didn't really like.\n\nI also think that DigiRiding could've been better, not only it was somewhat limited on which Digimon could carry you (I still want to be princess carried by Lilithmon) but it wasn't really... needed? Like, there wasn't a really big map that I needed the DigiRide to explore and most of the maps that were somewhat bigger than most would have a ''stopping'' mechanic (like swinging on the Palmon vines) so it felt lackluster.\n\nAnd a small gripe I've had with the game: missable (kinda) sidequests that you couldn't go back and do until almost the end of the game with ALMOST no warning (besides a not so helpful message from your Operator). It didn't REALLY affect my gameplay besides locking a stage of digivolution for a quest or two, but still, would've been better to have known before moving on that I couldn't access the sidequests that I hadn't done.\n\nOverall Digimon Story Time Stranger is a FANTASTICAL game and I recommend anyone, even non-Digimon fans, giving it a try if you're not averse to JRPG Mechanics (and even then, I think it's still a pretty good game and worth at least watching the story).

      "review": "The game is great if you're a Digimon fan, but it's mired in some questionable decisions by the devs. A good example of this is the new Digimon personality system, where from time to time, your Digimon partners will ask you questions you can respond to that will skew their personalities in one way or another. \n\nNormally, a system like this would be a fantastic breeding ground for fun and unique interactions with your Digimon, but you run out of dialogue choices within a handful of hours. Worse still, you can spend skill points your agent earns that boosts up the stats of Digimon with certain personalities, so if you're not careful going in, it's VERY easy to waste your skill points or have a wide spread of Digimon personalities that gain zero benefits because you just can't feasibly invest all your points into all of them to allow for that to be the case. Luckily, you can go into the Digi-Farm and relatively easily change personalities that way after a certain point, but that's a drain on in-game resources.\n\nSpeaking of the Digi-Farm, it's basically worthless and barely worth using most of the time, besides the aforementioned quick personality changes and min/maxing your Digimon stats in the late game, to get the Digivolution picks that you want. Which is unfortunate, because past games have done the Digi-Farm much better and it boggles my mind they couldn't just copy/paste those ideas. I don't think anyone would've complained about a better and more streamlined Digi-Farm here, even if it was a 1:1 copy.\n\nThe game also has a trading card game within it. It's very easy to collect the cards, but there's a ton of them and basically impossible to get them all without playing the mini-game attached to it with various NPCs several times in a row. The mini-game itself is fairly easy to grasp, but it's very slow and sometimes makes zero sense in the way the cards interact with each other. Funny enough, the game notes there's a presumably intentional bug in the game cards interact, that make Level 1 Digimon cards win every time with Level 7 Digimon cards, but it's possible to win (and lose) every interaction for no discernible reason whatsoever. It feels very tacked on to try to pad playtime.\n\nSpeaking briefly on other things, the graphics are fine enough (if most of the locations are on the boring side and you return to them multiple times), the music isn't fantastic and feels like amateur work for such a popular franchise, but at least the Digimon models and animations are very nice and haven't looked this good in a long time. It feels like they do the smart thing and with each new game they do a pass on each model and animation and try to make them a little better each time. I don't recall them being this good in Cyber Sleuth/Hacker's Memory, but then again, I haven't played those in quite a while.\n\nLast but not least, the story is passable and doesn't do anything crazy. I'm also not a fan of the fact that the game railroads you incredibly hard. These are implied to be huge and interesting worlds, but I just don't get that feeling most of the time playing it. It has all the depth and breadth of a puddle in the street: from a distance, it may look like you'll fall into water up to your neck, only to discover by stepping in that it barely reaches your ankle. There's not a whole lot you can do, and very little reason to explore even when the few brief opportunities are afforded to you.\n\nSomeone mentioned in another review that it's one of the highest quality Digimon games ever made, and better than modern Pokemon games, its direct competition, and I agree completely on that sentiment. However, that bar is incredibly low these days, so it's no surprise Time Stranger easily vaults it. Unfortunately, if you compare it to any other modern RPG, especially with amazing games like Persona 5 (which this game feels like it's trying to emulate) and even Clair Obscur. it smacks face first into the bar and falls onto its back.\n\nStill, I'm going to recommend it to people considering buying it because even though this game does a lot of things wrong (like beyond what's already mentioned, there's the crazy price point, yikes), it does a lot of things right too, and I want to see more Digimon games in the future with positive improvements. The potential is there, and I desire to motivate Bamco to invest in the series more.",

The story, the music, the voice acting, the visuals, all in top form to keep you engaged throughout. Typical turn-based RPG gameplay is improved by adding a few tweaks like encouraging item use and the X-Arts. Interacting with your Digimon through conversation and following each digivolution path feels organic. All in all totally in love with this game.

In both complete playthroughs (Hard and Mega+) I only got a total of 5 random encounters which can have the mons who give a bunch of extra EXP/Money/etc.\n- The pacing felt a bit off to get to Mega-Level Mons etc. but that's probably due to the game already being easy.

      "review": "As a long-time Digimon fan, I'm very happy that Digimon is making a come back now with Digimon Story Time Stranger. This is an amazing game, and is a huge improvement over the last Digimon Story game, Cyber Sleuth.\n\nThe visual and detail is great, the new mechanics are a relief, the music is nice, the character is memorable, and especially, the story is awesome! Digimon isn't afraid to feature stories for adults (there are themes of loss, death, and regret), which, ahem, Pokemon certainly wouldn't dare to do. I was captivated by the story of this game, and even thought deeply about it several times. So I think even if you're not a fan of monster-taming games, you can still enjoy this game as an RPG with a deep story.\n\nThe game's story itself is quite long, taking around 50-60 hours to complete. If you want to 100% the game, it might take around 80-100 hours. Unfortunately, I don't think the game has much endgame content (I hope in the next game, they can think of more end game content.). After completing the main story, you'll just be stuck with side quests or dungeons that aren't very interesting. Even the New Game Plus itself doesn't offer anything new. No new bosses or anything like that.\n\nOne thing that deserves praise from this game is that the developers weren't stingy with their budget. Nearly 90% of the main story scenes have voice actors (and for the first time, they're fully in English). Compare that to Pokemon, which still doesn't have voice actors to this day! Furthermore, in some segments, they even created real wayang (shadow puppets) and didn't use CGI. They truly treat this game as art, and I think that's highly commendable.\n\nHowever, the game does have its flaws, which I think are worth pointing out as feedback to the developers. First, while I'm glad Digimon now has English voice actors, there are some characters that I don't think fit the characters they portray (for example, Merukimon). Then there's the DLC system, which isn't consumer-friendly. Ultimate Edition buyers felt it especially when they suddenly received another DLC on day one that wasn't included in the ultimate edition. This was, of course, incredibly frustrating (please don't be so greedy). On a small scale, for example, the Digi Farm system is annoying because we have to leave the Digi Farm to evolve digimon.\n\nDespite those flaws, overall, I really enjoyed this game. I hope Digimon can continue to maintain this level of quality in their games.",

I'm happy to have this as a new standard for the series.\n\nNow for the reason I wouldn't reccmend it to a typical JRPG fan, the side content is pretty lackluster and most of it is dumped on you towards the end of the game. Most side quests come down to go somewhere, beat a digimon then go back, there are some that are more interesting but the majority are over pretty quickly. There are some small mini-games even card collecting/battling that falls a bit short in terms of it's actual gameplay but other then those you're going to be just battling most of the time. \n\nThe battle system is fine pretty much the same as Cyber Sleuth, you have 3 Digimon on the field 3 in reserve and 3 additional Digimon that may join depending on the story although most of the time it will will just be Aegiomon (RIP my all hot babe Digimon Team) and while the attack animations are great the 5x speed option helps a lot when you've already seen them. Similar to Cyber Sleuth, most of the strategy comes down to the paper/scissors/rock type advantage, also like the previous games most bosses are immune to status effects so they become useless quickly which can make Team building feel a little pointless this is exacerbated by the fact they removed Digimon unique abilities instead adding a bunch of generic ones linked to the personality system.\n\nThis is my biggest issue with the game, every digimon can have any ability, can be equip with any 4 moves and any 2 items, can have their stats maxed at 9999 so the only thing that makes them unique in terms of gameplay are the signature move/s, a lot of which are very similar to each other, so while it's great literally any Digimon can beat the game it loses a lot in terms of strategy and player expression in team building. \n\nTo end on a good note, I like the added skill tree and the new farm system both streamlined a lot of the annoying systems in the previous games, getting Bond, talent & Digivolution requirements is so much easier (although I still spent way too long micromanaging my farm until I found out trained stats don't carry over on evolution), now if only they didn't take the digivolve option out of the farm menu.",

If you played digimon dawn/dusk or cybersleuth, you will definitely enjoy this one as well.\n\nPros:\n1. 475 digimon so the roster is quite vast so you quite a selection\n2. 4 personalities and their buffs allow for some interesting strategies if your not doing Mega +. Unfortunately I could not finish my Mega+ run due to a game breaking bug. Data vs virus vs vaccine and the elemental combinations makes it easier or harder depending on how you abuse the systems given\n3. The story while it does have some cheesy dialogue at points, overall the story was really good and the foreshadowing was implemented very well.\n4. Side quests are all done pretty well, they try to mix it up so not all the side quests are the same\n\nCons:\n1. Minor thing but the texture quality is some of the early game areas is a bit lackluster compared to the areas in the later games, but you can tell their vision.\n2. There needs to be a better bug report system or lack of one. Some players encounter game breaking bugs and their only choice is to load a previous save or start over if they accidently overwritten their save like me. Noteable huge gamebreaking bugs are in the Factory and Junomon Temple. When you get to the quest marker sometimes the next quest doesnt trigger, but you can interact with the next quest objectives. If you do, you are just stuck when the quest actually triggers.\n3. Walking up ladders and stairs are done on 1/2 walking speed for some reason. Also whenever you interact with something, it usually cancels digiride, so you have to digiride again afterwards\n4. There are  several points in the story where you have to walk, teleport, walk and repeat just to pad game time.\n\nOverall the games a 9/10, however the lack of slid bug report makes it 8/10. I would wait for them to do a few more rounds of bug fixes before picking the game up.\n\nEdit: Another Con I forgot to mention is that you can't bulk use items. Example: when feeding you digimon in digimon farm you have to feed 1 item at a time and when yu have to do this 50 times to get bond to 100% for one digimon gets tedious.",

I’ll edit it later, but I need to talk about this right now.\r\n\r\nThis is honestly one of the best (if not the best) creature collector RPGs I’ve played in a decade.\r\nI don’t even wanna mention the mess that Pokeyman has turned into, but Digimon Time Stranger might’ve just dethroned it — gameplay, story, voice acting, straight-up fun — all of it.\r\n\r\nIf you love Pokeyman but feel let down by what the series has become, try this game.\r\nYou’ll end up wishing Pokeyman could be even half as good as this.\r\n\r\n💀 The Charm of Digimon\r\n\r\nPeople who’ve never played Digimon always say:\r\n\r\n“Man, those designs are weird, I wouldn’t play that.”\r\n\r\nYeah — that’s the point.\r\nThat’s the charm.\r\n\r\nYou start with a little blob.\r\nThen it turns into a bigger blob with teeth.\r\nThen a dinosaur.\r\nThen a literal child.\r\nAnd then the Anti-Christ.\r\n\r\nIt’s ridiculous, unpredictable, and so much fun.\r\n\r\nEvery time you evolve, you’ve got like 3–5 possible evolutions, and most Digimon have around 6 stages total, so you can go down completely different paths each time.\r\nAnd yeah, you can even evolve backward — it makes sense when you play, I promise.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve got a team of 6, technically you could end up having almost the whole 400+ Digimon roster just through all the different paths.\r\nSounds overwhelming, but it’s not. You can’t really screw yourself over or get softlocked. It’s just really fun to mess around and experiment.\r\n\r\n⚔️ Combat System\r\n\r\nCombat is classic “weakness/resist” stuff, but way more in-depth.\r\nYou’ve gotta think about not just what you’re strong or weak against, but also if your own type (which is separate from your move types) can even hit for effective damage at all.\r\n\r\nThere’s a third mechanic that shows up later in the game — you can kinda ignore it at first — but it adds a nice twist.\r\n\r\nDamage can go from like x0.3 (basically nothing) to x4.5, which feels insanely good when you line it up right.\r\nIt’s that dopamine hit when you see “x4.0” pop up.\r\nFiguring out weaknesses is part guessing, part logic — kinda like the “One More” system from Persona.\r\n\r\nAnd don’t worry, the difficulty can be chosen from Easy to Normal and Hard.\r\nThere’s a fourth and fifth one too, but these seem to be locked at the start.\r\n\r\n📖 Story & Progression\r\n\r\nStory-wise?\r\nPretty damn good. Not mind-blowing, but really solid.\r\nCompared to Pokeyman though? God-tier.\r\n\r\nI’m about 40 hours in, maybe 75% through the main story, with a bunch of side quests still to go.\r\nYou’ve got your MC rank, which goes up as you complete quests, and that affects how far you can evolve your Digimon.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, do the side quests — they’re fun, they tie into the main story, and they give more context to the world.\r\nAnd one would assume there’s endgame content — I can’t wait to get my ass handed to me.\r\n\r\nI actually like how the evolution system is kinda gated by your progress.\r\nIt sounds restrictive but it’s not — it actually pushes you to experiment more instead of rushing to Mega form right away.\r\n\r\n❤️ Final Thoughts\r\n\r\nI love this game.\r\nLike, really love it.\r\nCan’t wait to jump back in after posting this.\r\n\r\nAll in all — just get this game already.\r\nIt’s genuinely great and you won’t regret it.\r\n\r\nHave fun — and yeah… there’s a reason it’s sitting at 90% positive.\r\n\r\n✅ TL;DR\r\n\r\nDeep combat that actually makes you think\r\n\r\nWild, creative evolutions that feel unpredictable in the best way\r\n\r\nGenuinely engaging story\r\n\r\nTons of Digimon variety and options\r\n\r\nYou can’t really mess up — just experiment and have fun\r\n\r\n10/10 would get digivolved and wrecked again.",

The visuals are modern, if unimpressive, the dialogue and pacing are much better then the other Stories games, and combat is snappy and satisfying. However, it's very clearly a budget title and should be priced accordingly. $50 USD would be understandable. $70 is absurd.\n\nFull review:\n  Oh how I wish these Digimon games were properly priced. First we get a slew of hd ports of old PS Vita games for $60, now we get a clearly budget title for $70. \n  However, I'm still giving this a thumbs up for when I eventually get it on a sale, it's definitely worth $50 or less, because it actually is a great Digimon title.\n  It's come a long way since Cyber Sleuth, with much better pacing, better dialogue, and a more immediately exciting and interesting story. Gone is the onslaught of neverending, rambly text. \n  The combat is also much snappier, helped along by modern jrpg mechanics like attacking enemies on the field for an advantage (and enemies being on the field in the first place), as well as smoother animations and a quick battle end recap. \n  The visuals are the first with things like lighting effects and shadows in a Digimon game, in that tride and true anime shaded style. It looks very appealing, even if more like an early PS4 title.\n  I almost kept this game at the $70 price tag, because I really was having a lot of fun and it is absolutely the best overall Digimon game I've played (though I have a soft spot for Digimon World Next Order). It's just not a $70 game by any means.\n\nOverall Rating: Good Genre Game (Monster Collection JRPG)",

The Digimon game we all have been waiting for and wanting for so long. \n\nThe roster of Digimon is large, making it so you'll sometimes struggle to pick and choose who you want on your team of 6. With varying lines of evolution, making it interesting and fun to see how your Digimon partners change. With the balance of Vaccine, Data and Virus being the main typings, makes it understandable to figure out type weaknesses and strengths, to set up a good team to handle most boss fights. \n\nStory is incredibly good, the characters and digimon all have believable reactions, attachments and personalities. Making the world feel more real and immersive. The plot is interesting and makes you want to learn more, and keep playing. \n\nThe auto battle toggle makes grinding feel smooth and less of a chore, when you want to level up your digimon or work towards a specific evolution line. \n\nWith how many Digimon you can have at a time in your box being so high, makes you feel no pressure in wanting to explore or try different digimon lines. Or even having multiple of the same digimon, if you want to keep an evolution stage from one of the lines. And you can switch them out at anypoint in the game, not having to go to a specific place to swap your team around. \n\nWhile the game has been compared to Pokemon, I can agree it has some similar aspects. But the combat and understanding of reactions and types, is far better. I also would venture to say Digimon has a far more emotionally mature standard to it, with its story and designs within the franchise. \n\nI highly recommend playing this game if you love Digimon, or are new to Digimon.

The story up to this point feels compelling with a lot of surprises. Very much enjoyed the vivid graphics, animations, and victory poses of each Digimon!! Loved strolling around Tokyo, the train stations in this game are somehow very neat and detailed. Loved how lively Central Town is in every era :)\r\n\r\nRaising Digimon is fun. Digivolving, de-digivolving, training, and finding the right combination is fun.\r\nI don't really get the personality system yet but it's nice being able to talk to them and affect their stats.\r\nI was very surprised with the scale of Digimons. Some of them are apparently HUGE, and can be SCARY. Digiride is GOAT. It has been a dream to ride a Digimon. They're generous too with the ride poses and details! Cute.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of convenience such as the battle speed adjuster, auto battle (never used but it's there), I also loved the feature where you can easily continue training at Digifarm with just a click.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't like the most so far is the sound mixing(?) because BGM can be so faint, and sometimes the voice acting of EN dub (sorry) just doesn't fit. I also don't like the hollowness when a Digimon makes a motion but it is soundless; it feels flat.\r\nThe card minigame feels 'eh', but I can still enjoy the sprite animation and collecting the cards.\r\nThis one is not really a complaint but the 'hard' mode turns out to be merciful.\r\n\r\nLet's see how it goes from here.",

Its also fully voice acted.\n\nThe artstyle great, and the digital world feels super lively. Human world is fine too but clearly was not the focus\n\nThe most fun part is definitly the team-building, because of the branching digivoltution parts and the option to digivolve up and down at will once single mons has sooo many differenr forms it can end up in. Each digimon has its own special attack with its own little animation.\n\nThe boss fightes are always a highlight, and on the higher difficultys pack quite the punch. Especially at Mega+ you have to strategize and but some effort into team-building, because only going in with your heaviest hitters is not going to cut it",

I never had the opportunity to watch the anime when I was a kid, I was always more of a Pokémon fan (mostly because of the show) and played a bunch of those games growing up, so Digimon Story: Time Stranger was something completely new for me.\n\nI actually decided to get the game because so many people were saying good things about it. Day by day or maybe week by week, I kept hearing more praise and started getting more and more interested until I finally gave in. And honestly, I’m glad I did, because it’s truly an amazing experience.\n\nI haven’t had this much fun playing a “creature collector” game in a long time. The gameplay is addictive, the world and story are interesting, and even though I still don’t remember the names of most Digimon, they all feel unique and full of personality. I don’t have a favorite Digimon yet since I haven’t collected them all, but maybe I’ll find one when the time comes.\n\nIt’s been a refreshing and fun experience overall, familiar in some ways, but different enough to stand on its own.

This was my first time EVER buying a full price, $70 game after experiencing the crushing disappointment of Pokemon Legends ZA! It was so worth it!\r\n\r\nCombat exciting and fun, love the move change system\r\nLove the ease with which you digivolve/de-digivolve to try out all kinds of skill sets/digimon\r\nStoryline is EXCELLENT*** with plot twists and great character development\r\nArt is awesome and the world is alive (exceptionally better than ZA!)\r\n\r\nTwo issues stand out to me. \r\n1. Can't preview clothing in the shop, and there should be MANY more cosmetic options for outfits. \r\n2. When taking on side missions, you see an icon on the region-changing menu (like when you travel to another region,) to inform you which region you must go to, however you do NOT see any indication while using the travel system WITHIN a region. So you travel to new region where the quest exists, then you get on the region traveling flying mount (birdmon pegasusmon etc.) but then you do not see where in the region you must go to continue the quest. So you can travel to the opposite end of the region and start looking for the quest, only to find it on the opposite side. This is probably my biggest issue with the game. \r\n\r\nThe game is INCREDIBLE despite these minor flaws. Great work!",

I've fairly stringy with buying games that cost more than $50 and especially games with Denuvo, but to me, Digimon was worth it.\n\nSubjectively speaking, the bonding aspect was the best part. It's one of the things I enjoy in Pokemon and was glad to see a more fleshed out version. It really culminated in the credits scene and the call back to each of my main digimon. The human characters were okay, especially the protagonist. I felt like they were a third-wheel, but ultimately the story resolved itself nicely.

This was my first time playing a Digimon game since the OG Digimon World on PS1 and giving this game a go did not disappoint - pretty much the exact opposite!\r\n\r\nThe game was a bit grindy at times which I normally dislike, but it felt very rewarding: You don't capture the monsters in here like you do in most creature collector games, but you have to defeat that said monster enough times to digitalize it into your ally! This way of \"capturing\" your companion creatures felt really rewarding to me and made the grind feel much more fun! The main gameplay overall felt fun for me!\r\n\r\nThe story was much more serious and definitely for a more mature audience, dipping into very dark themes and territories at times, which I (as an adult gamer) really appreciated! Sure it's fun to play less serious games that are more suitable for a younger audience but I realized that it really made the game stand out even more among it's fellow creature collectors! I hope we'll see more creature collectors that are aimed for a more mature/adult audience! The story itself wasn't really anything super extraordinary and the writing felt clunky at times, but then again; I did not pick this game up for it's story and I think most people won't either.\r\n\r\nThe art style was pretty nice and I liked that how much personality they had put into the different Digimon! The Digiworld was much nicer visually than the human world: The human world felt really bland and barren and it was really off putting how non important people didn't even have a face. Digiworld was much better though!\r\n\r\nThe creature roster was incredible! There was so many awesome nostalgic Digimon that I recognized from the Digimon Adventure and Adventure 02 series that I used to watch as a kid, that it really felt super nice! Despite all the nostalgic mons, I did end up using a lot of newer mons that I never even seen before! It was so fun to find out all of this cool new creatures! The best part was that if you didn't like what the Digimon turned into, you could always devolve it back!! This was such an awesome mechanic and I really wish more creature collectors worked the same way!\r\n\r\nOverall, this game was a BLAST to play through, and it will definitely leave me waiting for the next Digimon game!!",

      "review": "I finally completed the game. The only achievement I have yet to do is complete the game on Mega+ difficulty which I will probably get. It took me roughly 54 hours to beat the game on Hard and I was stuck on two boss fights halfway through the game. I'll go over what I enjoyed and what I personally disliked [b]a lot[/b]. Strap yourselves in.\n\n[b]This review will contain spoilers in regards to the story. If you wish to not read it, a TL;DR will be provided below.[/b]\n\n[h1]The Positives[/h1]\n- The game has a really solid main story that hooks you immediately, thanks to the grand opening this game has to offer with the Shinjuku Inferno. The characters are likable and the main cast of characters were well written. I could feel the bond between Inori and Aegiomon like they were actually siblings together. The overall story felt like I was watching an anime and it felt even more like that during the 2nd half of the game.\n- The balance of the game is different from the last one where the passives are now depending on the Digimon's personality. This allows for extremely flexible team compositions where you end up running with more than just 6 digimon in your party, you'll swap and adjust to what fits your team and playstyle best, especially when there's over 400 digimon you can use.\n- The combat is great with the quality of life changes if we compare it to CyberSleuth. A lot of quality of life changes have been implemented (such as items no longer using up your turn during combat) and adjusted the combat/animation speed from 1x up to 5x if you so desire. Everything the game threw at me in those fights felt fair and just, even if two particular boss battles were particularly tough.\n\n[h1]The Negatives[/h1]\n- First things first, I am not a fan of the linear progression. The game looks gorgeous and yet I can not move freely around. It's a little disappointing that I just can't explore the world of Iliad freely, that world looks astonishing in every way possible. If this allowed me to roam around freely, I'd be heads over heels for what has been given to us.\n- Aegiomon, once you have him, will always be by your side, fighting alongside you whether you like it or not. Personally, I wish there was an option that allowed me to have him join my fights or not as controlling 4 Digimon in one fight made things ridiculously easy at times, especially considering that I can just slap Aura and Revive on him and he'll always become the best support Digimon one could ask for as he scales really well compared to your own Digimon.\n- A lot of the boss battles are, unfortunately, immune to most status effects. This makes most fights slap-stick fights where you buff your team up with defensive skills rather than using statuses to come up with a proper strategy.\n- Grinding. The game demands that you at times backtrack to level up your digimon or make a new team as some of those boss fights, especially early on in Iliad, are absolutely brutal because of the limited resources you have. Roughly [b]4 hours[/b] of my gametime was dedicated to making a new team after Parrotmon and Titamon wiped the floor with my favorite digimon, making me to go out of my way to get new ones for a favorable matchup.\n- And of course, the price and the DLCs that are unnecessarily shoved in there. 70 bucks is a staggering amount of money. Just wait for a sale.\n\nThese are all however personal or skill issues I have had with the game. I am a massive Pokemon fan and I enjoyed the last Digimon Story game a lot and this one is not a let down. It kinda lived up to my expectations, something that Nintendo hasn't done since Black/White. I think there is a lot of room for improvement but considering what I expected from a Digimon Story game, I am satisfied. I hope future Digimon games get better with each release as I am infatuated with them.\n\nTL;DR: The game is good. Wait for a sale as 70 bucks is a lot or just buy at full price if you liked the previous Digimon Story game. It's worth it.",

      "review": "**Summary**\n---------------\n4/5 Stars\nTime Stranger is a fun but simple RPG.\nWait for a sale to purchase it.\n\n**General**\n--------------\n\"Digimon Story: Time Stranger\" is a Japanese Role Playing Game set in the near-future world of science fiction. While Digimon are certainly central to the plot, the beginning of the game focuses on your role as a time travelling agent. Digimon are more a means to an end until you reach the middle of the game and see how the Digimon interact with one another. The core story is about how the horrors of digital warfare affect the deutragonist, Inori.\n\n**Reasons to Purchase Time Stranger**\n--------------------------------------------\nThis is the first Digimon console game that can be universally agreed upon as good. Digimon World is regarded as the best Digimon experience, but is frustrating for beginners. Digimon Cyber Sleuth revived Digimon video games (outside of Japan) but ingrained Kowloon into our minds forever. \nTime Stranger has detailed environments, decent combat, is simple to follow, and the mechanics are par the course for gaming standards.\n\nThe artwork is stupendous. You can find a series of development videos on YouTube wherein the developers discuss and showcase step-by-step the care and effort they put into modelling the Digimon. The lead artist for the humans is Suzuhito Yasuda, who you may recognize from Devil Survivor and Durarara.\n\nYou can buy most Digimon skills from the shop, so you no longer need to level up all the way like previous games to learn every single skill (It's still best to do so for statistics' sake when digivolving back and forth with your favourites).\n\nThe game runs superbly smooth. No matter how old your device is it will be able to play Time Stranger without fault.\n\n**Reasons to Not Purchase Time Stranger**\n------------------------------------------------\nFor the first third of the game, your team will be too weak to do much against bosses without heavy grinding. They will primarily be fought by guest characters, such as Aegiomon. This beginning all occurs in the human world, leaving the middle section split amongst the Digital World areas that feel underdeveloped as a result.\n\nThere is a randomized card battle minigame that provides absolutely no benefit or enjoyment despite there being dozens of NPCs programmed to play with you.\n\nThis game has plenty of DLC. In fact, the DLC menu here on Steam can easily be confused for a fighting game's. The detailed costumes and scenario missions were blatantly cut from the main game. There is also a season pass in the works that will include 5 DLC Digimon per season. The immediate DLC Digimon (Black & Friendship) can be unlocked ingame anyway, so don't bother buying them. Even alternative songs to the poor random encounter music cost money.\n\nDenuvo has been installed into the core game files, meaning you cannot access your saves unless you remain connected to the internet. This program is also known to slightly slow down your computer, among other concerns such as privacy. Adding insult to injury, you cannot name your Digimon anything that could *possibly* be interpreted as inappropriate in English (despite this being a single-player game).\n\n**Aspects to be Improved**\n--------------------------------\nDigimon evolutions (digivolutions) are limited to your avatar's level. If your favourite Digimon is a Mega (highest stage), then you must wait until the final third of the game to unlock it. I suppose this was to encourage players to play around with all 450+ Digimon included in Time Stranger, but\n1) The previous entry, Cyber Sleuth, limited your party capacity depending on their stage. This was much fairer: you could get your favourite yet still be challenged by bosses.\n2) Your Digimons' levels (1, 2, 3, ..... 99) play a greater role in their strength more than their statistics. A maximized level 20 Mega is much weaker than a level 40 Rookie. This is stellar if you do not wish to evolve your favourite Digimon, but a letdown for the impact of Digivolution presented in media.\n\nThe Digifarm does not allow you to Digivolve while you are logged into it, so you need to exit, open your Digivice, check if you meet the requirements to Digivolve, and then return to the farm if you do not. Combining both would greatly smooth out the evolution process.\n\nPersonalities are great because the Digimon will follow unique evolution paths and functions in your party. However, changing their personality is randomized by speaking to them. If there is a specific personality you want, you will need to train the farm, but won't have the money to quick train until the end of the game (negligible if you purchased the money outer dungeon).\n\nFor whatever reason, almost all of the side missions were reserved for just before the final battle. They're all quite fun and should have been accessible sooner.\n\n\n**Verdict**\n-------------\nTime Stranger a high-quality 4-star game. Digimon fans old and new will have an excellent time with it. I recommend waiting for a sale to purchase the base game because it's truly worth ~$40 USD.\nHere's to hoping Time Stranger's success will teach Konami to give future Digimon titles a budget larger than pocket change.",

After bouncing off Pokémon Scarlet/Violet (and feeling zero confidence that Pokémon ZA will course-correct), I tried this on a whim after some gameplay clips. The first thing that grabbed me was the attack animations—crisp, weighty, and full of personality. But what kept me playing was the story and characters: it’s got heart, momentum, and stakes, and it treats the player like they care.\r\n\r\nWhat really stands out is how much this feels like a love letter to fans. The art style pops without sacrificing readability, the overall finish/polish is strong, and the simple joy of riding your Digimon never gets old. Systems interlock cleanly, progression feels rewarding, and the game offers fantastic value for the price—generous content without the bloat.\r\n\r\nIt’s not perfect. At times the dialogue can be rough—awkward phrasing here and there that could’ve used another editing pass. But that’s a speed bump, not a wall.\r\n\r\nWhere Pokémon feels stuck ignoring core feedback, Time Stranger feels like the opposite: it listens, refines, and delivers. If you’ve been waiting for a monster-RPG that respects your time and your nostalgia, this is it.\r\n\r\nPros\r\n\r\nExcellent battle and attack animations\r\n\r\nEngaging story with memorable characters\r\n\r\nRideable Digimon = peak fantasy achieved\r\n\r\nStrong polish and value for the content\r\n\r\nCons\r\n\r\nDialogue can be clunky in spots\r\n\r\nVerdict: 9/10 — Digimon gave fans what they asked for, and it shows.",

I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a monster tamer RPG with the freedom to basically have any team you want.\n\nFor a very long time I've wanted a Digimon game that felt like a better, more modern Digimon World 3, which has been my favorite Digimon game since childhood. And honestly this game would have easily replaced it... If not for the story. I still love this game to bits and will absolutely finish it and still recommend it even after the story (at the moment) feels so badly written.\n\n[h3]MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD!![/h3]\n\nWhile I have yet to finish the game and a lot of my issues with the story might be answered then, there's one thing that I think would have made the story so much better: Remove the Agent, aka the Main Character, and their [spoiler]organisation ADAMS[/spoiler] from the story entirely.\n\nThis game CLEARLY actually wants [spoiler]Aegiomon[/spoiler] to be the main character and I'm left to wonder why that's not the case? What reason was there to not have the game have a [spoiler]Digimon[/spoiler] main character like the Shin Megami Tensei games? He's always in your party as a permanent guest character, you can even give him equipment and change his abilities.\n\nAside from that,[spoiler] your Operator and ADAMS as a whole being able to communicate with the MC in \"real time\" in another timeline as if their timeline is always parallel and moving in the same direction forward as the one (or the branch) the MC is in absolutely makes no sense.[/spoiler] There should be no way the MC could communicate with them, because otherwise the organisation would have access to communicating to [spoiler]multiple Agents at once.[/spoiler] If anything, the MC should only be able to communicate to [spoiler]ADAMS in the current time they're in[/spoiler], especially if every action, every change made via time travelling creates a new timeline; the \"butterfly effect\". Why not have the Operator be an AI guide instead? That way, it makes so much sense why they can communicate with the MC at all times and look into data they already have.\n[spoiler]Dr. Yuki was erased, but his actions, ADAMS, and the memories of him still remain in the timeline the MC is from... That doesn't make any sense. The fact that the changes/interferences with the past affected the MC's original timeline can be clearly seen in the beginning of the game through the animation of the two agents with Aegiomon and Inori and \"Aegiomon\" interferring with the war just before the MC is sent to the past.[/spoiler]\n\nAnyway, that's what I think about the story so far. If there's a huge \"aha\" moment and everything can be explained, i'll happily rethink and edit this review.\n\nOne last thing...\nBandai Namco, please.\nGive us more humanoid masc or androgynous Digimon that aren't furries or with muscles jacked up to hell.

Here is my experience -\n\nCombat (10/8): i like the animations (you have to make speed I to III to see the animations, max speed will not show it), and the unique special skills, i like the fusion attack like Black wargreymon + black metalgarurumon they be like using some fusion attacks as (Zwart Omegamon) if they are both in-field, its so amazing, other features are the same as other turn based games (items, weakness, elements, etc...)\n\nStory (8/10): the story is so interesting and the plot is unique, the thing that ruined it for me is the protagonist not having a voice acting, also, most of the protagonist movements during speech is flexing their elbow, which feels not fitting as a body language in lot of context. Otherwise i would have given the story 10/10.\n\nDigivolution (10/10): I love it so much, got to experience lot of digimons evolutions, and loved experiencing having a new digimon after grinding and unlocked certain requirments.\n\nItems/Store/Digimon build (10/10): There are multiple skills that can be adjusted if they were non-special, and there are different multiple items to be used in various suitations, and you can also equip some permenant boost items infield.\n\nMusic (DLC, 10/10): I used DLC music. Here are the music i used. And i only bought the anime music not the cyber music. And the fact that you can change the game music is really good.\n- Field: After the battle\n- Normal battle: SLASH\n- Boss Battle: Believer\n- Digivice: Default\n- Digifarm and Card battle: Negabia\nAnd they were so perfect.\n\nCard battle (10/10): i liked it, it was so fun as an extra non-mandatory content)\n\nSide-quests (10/10): not exhausting or that long which is good, and they have a significant benefits especially for agent skill upgrades. And i did them all i think.\n\nConversations (10/10): You can have conversations with your digimons to have an affect towards their personalities and i love it\n\nGraphics (7/10): This is a major weakness in the game, and at the start of the game i couldnt even see digimons and i was getting ambushed a lot\n\nI bought the anime music DLC (Highly recommended), The swimsuit, The starter pack (not important), and the Farming XP/Gold/Materials back (Highly recommended) \n\nRecommendation:\n- Get to know the Load Enhancement, i couldnt level cap some digimons then i discovered its importance\n- Buy the DLCs i recommended above\n- Try multiple digimons, and you can know better about them from some guides, like the Digimon chart list.\n- Have the combat speed between I to III to enjoy the animations, and you can later but it at max, if you had enough of them. \n- Do side quests\n- Dont rush the game, the price is expensive compared to average games with similar effort/resources, and the content is fun, enjoy every bit of it.\n\nI recommend buying the game. And good luck.",

      "review": "Quite likely the best modern Digimon game. It solves pretty much all of the issues of Cyber Sleuth - and you're even able to change FMC's ugly default outfit almost right away! :D\n\nOn a more serious note, you can't help but love some of the improvements, such as proper difficulty levels (which you can switch on the fly - hell, you can pretty much switch everything on the fly, including the main character's gender/appearance). The grind is much less tedious, and you can alleviate it even more by training/feeding your Digimon on the farm, talking to them, and investing in your Agent's skill trees (side note: the human character being able to help during fights in more offensive ways than just chucking healing items at their 'mons is a super cool idea, and I hope they stick with it). Surprisingly, even the post-battle auto-heal feels more like the game valuing your time rather than like too much hand-holding.\n\nThe plot is far from being super deep, but it's serviceable. It even manages to feel like an anime series at times, what with there being some truly dramatic plot twists and sacrifices, some properly epic action sequences, some cutesy and/or silly moments, and even some vaguely Persona-like mysterious shenanigans.\n\nThe characters are quite likeable, though it would've been nice if there had been a couple more of them, at least of the major ones, and more opportunities to talk to them (this goes for your own Digimon, too; it would be nice to have at least one special 'mon with whom you could converse and/or a much bigger choice of random conversations with all of your 'mons).\n\nThe FMC/MMC is fine, though they barely have some personality and they are more of a spectator of Inori's/Aegiomon's story for big chunks of the game. I didn't mind it, I just wish my Agent had felt slightly more relevant to the story before the endgame. It also kinda sucks that the character you decide to play as isn't voiced at all, especially since your counterpart's voice lines as the operator are, as those of other characters, pretty nicely acted (at least in the Japanese version; no idea about the English voices, though the snippets that I've heard didn't sound supremely grating).\n\nWhile I slightly miss the more cyberspace-like digital side of Cyber Sleuth's world, the Digimon world in this game is refreshingly vibrant (c'mon, tell me you weren't at least half as surprised and impressed as the characters upon visiting Central Town or Junomon's temple for the first time), and feels very much like a callback to the first and second Digimon series. The overall vibe of the game, however, is darker and more Tamers-like, which is a combo that I absolutely adore, seeing as Tamers will quite likely always be my favourite series, but I've always loved the feel of the digital world in the first series. Overall there's a decent amount of references and easter eggs from all corners of the franchise, from 'mon-/situation-exclusive dialogue lines to various iconic attacks being translated into the game's mechanics pretty well.\n\nGetting back to the more technical side, the game is decently translated, and it sounds well (including some truly catchy tunes). It runs pretty smoothly except in some areas in which there's plenty of 'mons (this happens even on a decent setup). The quality of some textures is definitely on the lower side, but you can get used to it, considering the overall retro/cartoony vibe of the game's graphics.\n\nNow here's some less awesome bits:\n\nI do agree with one of the most popular reviews: all of this still doesn't mean that the gameplay is groundbreaking; it's just noticeably less frustrating than in most if not all previous entries. And, of course, there still are some issues, some of them pretty weird and outdated, such as the game still being written only with the MMC in mind (which results in some unintentional hilarity), or the game's gameplay time and achievement count going totally bonkers if you like to play offline (look, Steam Deck's battery isn't all that great). Fortunately, saves still get properly synchronized with the cloud. And speaking of saves and being outdated - limited save slots? And less than two dozen of them? Really?\n\nThere still are some supremely grindy bits, one of them being... the frustratingly random card mini-game (at least it's completely optional). And don't get me started on some Outer Dungeon challenges. The racing ones are more frustrating than any boss in the game.\n\nAlso, seeing as all of the game's versions are atrociously priced (I definitely wouldn't have been playing the game any time soon if I hadn't gotten it as a gift), some content STILL being locked behind separate DLCs even if you own the Ultimate edition is beyond shameless. No, I don't care that it's just a music bundle and some dungeons for grinding, it still means that Bandai/Namco is choosing to portray itself as the most stereotypical greedy corpo. Envious of Nintendo's infamy, huh?\n\nEither way, here's some wishful thinking for the next game: unlimited or at the very least more save slots, less awkward treatment of the FMC, a fully voiced FMC/MMC (!!!), more polished and better explained training/talent/bond systems, less half-empty dungeons, more 'mons from recent anime series/movies, more dialogue lines for all of your 'mons and/or an option to have one special partner Digimon, more variety when it comes to offensive skill discs... More hi-res textures would be nice, too. Oh yeah, and no more extra-super-separate DLC bulls***t; let's not turn people off of a franchise that already isn't among the most popular ones, yeah?\n\nTL;DR: Great game for diehard Digimon fans; will definitely be less enthralling for people who aren't very familiar with the Digimon 'verse and/or who prefer a more cartoony, Pokémon-like approach to their monster-catching games (which is completely fine, of course). Either way, it's a noticeable step forward for Digimon games.",

      "review": "Time Stranger is a peculiar game, and the exact kind of game I wish I could give a mixed review for.  Tl;drs for each part.\n\nFirst, let's compare its gameplay to Digimon Cybersleuth, the most similar game to it.  Generally, the game is an improvement.  One of Cybersleuth's biggest flaws is def piercing attacks being so much better than everything else that they are essentially mandatory.  This is NOT present in this game, but Time Stranger brings a new flaw: boring unique attacks.  Almost all Unique Attacks from in-training to Ultimate digimon are dull.  Simple damage dealing attacks with few effects.  As an example, let's use Skullgreymon.  In Cybersleuth, Skullgreymon's Oblivion Bird has this effect \"Physical attack, 110 Fire damage to one foe. 50% chance of reducing target's DEF by 10%.\"  Compared to Time Stranger's Skullgreymon, \"Performs Fire physical attack at power 90.\"  Time Stranger's attack has a lot less going on, and this is case for almost all digimon below Mega.  Even Time Stranger's Mega digimon tend to have very similiar effects.  Most either ignore attributes or decrease the targets resistance or debuff or status effect enemies (there are a few more).\nTl;dr, more balanced than Cybersleuth but also more boring.\n\nTime Stranger's biggest flaw is its story.  Its incoherent.  There's really not much to say about without spoilers, but it feels like the writer died multiple times and was replaced.  It jumps from wild idea to wild idea, including but not limited to: being a secret agent, being a dectective, being a time traveller, being a time traveller (again), etc.  The individual ideas work, and could be very interesting if explored in depth, but they just aren't.  Characters are treated very similiarly, not being given nearly enough time to explore them.  All of the characters are varying degrees of bland.\n\nDespite all this, I enjoyed Time Stranger.  Training digimon is lots of fun, and there are a ton of cool and exciting digimon.  Most of them are even pretty effective, in their own ways.\n\nTl;dr; very flawed, still a fun digimon game.  I wish the story was less terrible, and that the price tag was more reasonable.  Pretty fun game, coulda been better.",

I Won't spoil but...\n\nThe story makes sense, everything is written coherently and well enough that I would assume most would be able to follow. But the ending can be, depending on the personal opinion, a bit cruel, not just to some character but to the protag, especially the protag.\n\nIt's well written ending, don't get me wrong, but a major part of me thinks that this might be the cruelest ending of any JRPG game I ever played.\n\nI am yet to be able to fully embrace it as a good ending, I'm not sure If i can honestly. \n\nIt may be an Absolute Cinema of a game, but to me it's an absolute cinema because how it made me feel and think for a long time after finishing the game.",

I think the only thing I'd want out of the next game is maybe a create-a-character for your main, and an even bigger roster of monsters.

      "review": "[h1]The Digimon Game that Made Me Give Up on Digimon Games.[/h1]\n\nI've always struggled with sticking to modern Digimon games as they often are plagued with a slew of problems that they've latched onto for nostalgia-baiting purposes. Time Stranger steps away from that time honored tradition that Digimon Games follow and tries to set itself apart and cater to NEW players who might have an interest in the game. Unfortunately whilst Time Stranger sets itself apart from other Digimon games, the game just isn't particularly that great, and if you've played any generic turn-based RPG from the early 2000's or even now you've basically played it. Admittedly I've tried SO HARD to like this game as it does stand apart from other Digimon games, but the experience is either largely bland or bad for the majority of the game to the point that I can't bring myself to continue wasting time playing it.\n\nFurthermore there seems to be this.. Overall consensus that a large portion of the community has regarding this game which is that \"It gets good around the 25-30 hour mark\", and admittedly I find that to be insanity. In our world where there's an ever-growing supply of games which can be FUN and ENGAGING from the first 5 minutes, why spend your time on something which isn't fantastic from the first step? Are the standards of people playing this game so astronomically low that they think this is ok? Even the #1 Review AT CURRENT says the game is essentially boring/mid yet rates it positively due to it being A DIGIMON GAME.\n\nThere's so many things in this game that make it obvious that the game is half-baked like there only being basically 5 voice actors for all the Digimon when they attack - I sincerely hope you like the voice of in-game Agumon because it's possible to have 15 different Digimon you use which have the same voice! Time Strangers' marketing paints the game as having these grandiose and beautiful overworld areas, but all these are is cleverly disguised hallways and linear paths. \n\nTime Strangers' gameplay is overall boring and so badly wants to be mechanically deep and interesting yet doesn't give you enough tools for that to be the case and restricts your actual usage of tactics. Gameplay for the game quickly devolves into \"Does your Digimon have the type which is resistant to the enemy? No? Do you have Convert?\". Almost every single attack in the game is basically just a reskin of every other single attack in the game, and bosses being resistant to most statuses means that the only real \"tactical gameplay\" to be had is just whether you debuff them or not. \n\nTime Strangers' view of difficulty seems to be confused for annoyance, with the bosses not even being hard to take on within the hard difficulty. Boss fight formula in this game is essentially the boss pulling some dumb bullshit out of nowhere repeatedly to *TRY* to make the fights require you to think, yet they still devolve into using three Digimon which are resistant to the boss and nothing more because you're not given any other options than to buff and sweep.\n\nTime Strangers' story is extremely predictable and almost all of the characters just feel so unlikable within the storyline, with constant terrible and predictable choices plaguing the narrative to the point it feels like your stereotypical shonen anime. On top of this the progression system feels incredibly padded to make it to where you're FORCED to spend more time playing the game to Digivolve anything to a Digimon you might actually care about. Time Strangers' Agent Rank system is admittedly worse than the grinding system in CyberSleuth which already wasn't great. \n\nGo play something else which is fun from the start.",

The card game is horrible, nothing like losing every battle even though your cards are stronger and have type advantage because of the horrible randomness. \r\nThe game is very linear and the way that Digimon ... work, just doesn't do it for me. It's grindy, simple, and really lacks any sense of advancement since most evolutions boil down to just increasing stats. The evolutions are also mandatory and not really ... difficult to get, so they don't really make sense to me (at least for as long as I played). The concept of course makes sense, but everything is so simple nothing feels rewarding. When I look at the evolution charts, I'm not even sure what ones are supposed to be difficult to get. Even the ones that need higher stats are just need to be put into training and leveled up, it's not like you need to do anything complicated. \r\nThinking about it, I wasn't a real fan of the battle system to begin with. It starts out ok, but gets brain dead easy about 5 hours in. Typeing maters a lot, but nothing is really difficult enough for it to mater, so just spamming different elements until you find one that it's weak to doesn't feel rewarding and just ends up feeling like a chore.\r\nI wouldn't really consider it a bad game, but I can't recommend it due to the oversimplification and lack of variety of things to do.",

      "review": "For reference, I'm an RPG veteran and love the Digimon franchise. I wish there was a middle-grade rate that I could give this game, but due to the nature of game mechanics and just video games in general, I elected to veer on the side of negative. That said, let's get into it.\n\nI am actually very disappointed. I went into this extremely optimistic. I'm currently going through the Cyber Sleuth games and having a wonderful time with them. I think the presentation and story of Time Stranger is very appealing, and it hooked me in effortlessly. There was clearly a lot of love put into it.\n\nSo what's the issue?\n\nDifficulty. Now, I understand that this is a very volatile discussion for everyone, and I'm not here to tell anyone how to enjoy the game. If you're having a good time with it, great. All the more power to you. However, I have to point out that what separates a game from other pieces of media is the ability to interact with it. If a game demands practically nothing from me, then my brain checks out, and if my brain checks out, I'm not playing anymore, now am I? The game is playing itself. I'm just the guy in the chair, tilting a stick and occasionally pressing a button.\n\nThe reason this is important is because I selected hard difficulty with the expectation that I would be challenged. I expected, reasonably, that the developers had designed the game in such a way that I could interact with all of its mechanics and still find portions of it difficult. That is what the word, \"hard,\" is meant to imply in this context.\n\nBut nearly fifteen hours into the game, and not a single encounter has challenged me. Seeing how easy every encounter has been up until now, I turned on autobattle, and I was mortified to find that my team was cleaning through encounters like nobody's business. To make matters worse, you can hold still and wait for your digimon to fully recover. So, there's nothing stopping you from keeping autobattle on 24/7 and just moving from encounter to encounter. No resource management or tactics required. Just sit back and let the game play itself.\n\nI've heard the argument, \"Well just don't use autobattle,\" or \"Wait until mega+,\" or \"then don't use the mechanics.\"\n\nAutobattle shouldn't be here to begin with. To me, that demonstrates a lack of confidence in the player.\n\nAsking me to play the game for 50+ hours for a new difficulty is absurd.\n\nLastly, going back to what I said before, what separates a game from other forms of media is its ability to be interacted with. If I'm just on autobattle the whole time, moving from marker to marker, and am not required to put any real thought into my setup or my evolutions beyond the rock-paper-scissors format of combat, then I fall asleep at the wheel.\n\nI'm not asking for it to break the average player's back, but Cyber Sleuth has consistently challenged me in areas. Other JRPGs, such as Etrian Odyssey, Persona, any game in the Shin Megami Tensei series, and fights from the original Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest games gave me the occasional run for my money. But there's nothing like that here, and judging from what I've read online, it doesn't get any harder. Only easier.\n\nCan I really still call this a game? This is more of an interactive novel.\n\nThank you for reading. And please, if you're enjoying it, do not let me opinion sour your mood. It's still leagues better than Pokemon ZA.",

Furthermore there is a 1 - 2 second loading screen between two map sections -> gets annoying, as small map sections = a lot of loading times \n- digifarm? can be ignored, as it is just a boring \"grid\"\n\nGeneric Story:\nWrite a generic story and replace people with digimon...and you have some Chapters for your game.\n\nPrice and dlc:\nAnd then there is the high price and you dont get everything in the base game, as there a lot of dlcs (mostly cosmetic and music, bust still...).\n\nTo summarize: The game is heavy story focused with a slow pacing. At some point it lacks of introducing new systems to keep the game interesting. The map and mission designe is very bad, because it is too heavily based on old systems, that were designed that way in the past due to hardware limitations.",

Either make the game cheap and bulk up the cost with DLC or make the game expensive (like they did) and have everything already built into the game, no DLC. There's literally only one good DLC for this and it should be built in to the main game. Very disappointed in the cost.  I'd say to anyone in the future, only buy this game on deep sale. It's not worth the price.\n\nI like this game because I nostalgically love Digimon, especially the first 3 seasons. Unfortunately that isn't really good enough for me to give this game higher marks. It's a competent RPG game but it involves an absolute ton of grinding if you want to make your dream team. The characters are pretty generic with maybe 1 or 2 exceptions. I also felt it took way too long to get going but the plot is actually really good, this could change as I haven't quite finished playing yet but so far so good.",

FOR 120 EURO?!?!\n\nMy Negative Review is SOLY do to the pricetag in comparison to the actual product.\nIf you like DIgimon and Money isnt a question, then this is a solid 7/10.\nbut for some of us that cant just throw that kind of money around, ill have to give it a 5/10.\n5, because its not a \"bad game\", just not for 70 Euro.",

The silent digivolving and attacks are also kinda lame, maybe it's for the best since some of the voices are like nails on a chalkboard (both english and japanese). The silent main character stuff also needs to stop. if you don't know how to do it well, then don't do it. I get it 'bUt PoKeMon DoEs It'. don't be pokemon, be digimon. Also, gating your power progression with bland side quests is one of the worst game design choices i have ever seen. Forget to do 1 side quest and you are gated on power for literal hours until you prog the msq enough, and by then you get just get inundated with mundane fetch quests with massive amounts of meaningless dialog. There is such little gameplay doing the side quests (that you have to do because of agent points) that i see why they added the microtransaction dungeons. The game is designed in a way to make you want to buy them because the base game reward structure and progression is just that bad. The more i trudge through the tedium of mandatory boring walking simulator sidequests, the more i grow to hate this game.\n\ntldr: solid combat, digimon are cool, everything else is miserable\np.s. some mechanics don't work the way the game says they do (e.g. digi attacks do NOT work how described). it also has the laziest implementation of NG+ I have ever seen; buyer beware grind all your levels and stats to maximum before ng+.",

Sadly enough, that is the most positive thing I can say about the game.\n\nThe story itself is... mediocre. I do not wish to spoil it for anyone, so I will deliberatly keep it vague and it had me hooked at times, but after seeing it in it's entirety it left me wanting. There was potential there, but it got squandered by clichees, plottpoints that get picked up and just fade into nothingness, storybeats that drag on far too long and the good old forced twists and turns many rpgs suffer from where they try to get as many shocking reveals in as possible that ultimately turn the story into nonsense the second u sit down and look at it in it's plotthole-riddled entirety. All of those though, are the smaller issues the story is suffering from, the far bigger one is the moment to moment storytelling, the actual character-dialogue. Characters repeat what they just said over and over, I wish I was exxegerating, but I constantly had characters repeat what they said 1-2 sentences ago in the same conversation UP TO FOUR TIMES. It's honestly insane and if you played a well written RPG over the last few months the tonal whiplash will definitly get you.\n\nThe biggest issue though, is the combat. There are some nice quality of life things here, like the ability to just speed up mid combat via flicking the rigth stick, or even turn on auto-combat when u just have to figth through random mobs. But there is also most of the bossfigths beeing far to tanky, so that u know u r definitly gonna beat them by repeating the same inputs u did for the last 5 minutes for 10 more minutes(there were 2 bossfigths that took me over an hour, even though I had the game running at 5x speed and that was with maxed out digimon, after completing all the sidequests AND having elemental advantages). There is also the rockpaperscissor type combat system, which in of itself isnt an issue but how it is used. The vast majority of bossfigths are virus-type digimon, so data and virus type digimon are kinda useless. I was literally using the same all-vaccine-type-team for the last 9 bossfigths straigth, no clever composition, no tactics, just the same type of typeadvantages that worked consistently. It's not even like there is a plot-reason why they couldnt use more data or vaccine type digimons as bossfigths, that those dont work as a strict allignement-chart has been established time and time again.\n\nAll of these things make this an experience I can't really recommend in good faith, at least not at full price(someone called this an AA game that got priced as AAA and its kinda fitting). It will give u the dopamine from constantly getting new creatures, which is just a winning formular and why I love this genre so much, but you can get interesting new creatures in other games with better mechanics, writing and pricing and without BS MTX that pester u at several ingame-stores.",

      "review": "Wanna be clear, I 100% this game in 50 hours, (100% meaning all side-missions, beating the main story, and completing the digimon-pokedex) That's fairly depressing for a $70 rpg.\r\n\r\nDecided to pick this up over Pokemon, as the quality of the pkm series continues to drop I figured Digimon would be better, however this game's quality is just as poor as any modern Pokemon game. I have to imagine most people who are recommending this game is just used to the series being bad, but since I was expecting an actual good game I was caught off-guard.\r\n\r\nThe Pros:\r\n-The Digimon look very nice. Good animations all round, and there are cool stuff like being able to ride certain Digimon, and seemingly every digimon has it's own unique \"battle victory\" animation.\r\n\r\n-Uhhh you can skip cutscenes I guess?\r\n\r\nThe Cons:\r\n-Everything else in the game\r\n\r\n-Gameplay is horribly boring, and they KNOW this is the case because you can speed the animations up to 5x, with an auto-battle so you don't have to actually do anything either. I have to admit, at least they make skipping things very streamline, but grinding is just soulless.\r\n\r\n-Permanent stats are poorly explained, even now I don't really understand how they work. Not to mention dealing with personalities is just awful, getting them to move in the correct direction without using the farm training (i.e. waiting 15 irl minutes multiple times) is basically impossible. Your best bet is just ignoring them completely until your far enough in the game to just quick-complete farm training and deal with them like that.\r\n\r\n-Additionally, the game is extremely easy, even on hard. This is double annoying, as they have difficulty settings, and even allow you to lower/raise them at any time. It's just rock-paper-scissors, only you can swap out your team at any time for free. It's pokemon, but you can change pokemon and still attack. Plus, you can farm infinite stats. I was playing the entire game trying to complete the digi-dex, so my main team wasn't even max leveled or trained much or anything, so the game could have been even easier.\r\n\r\n-The story seems cool in theory, but the characters and cutscenes are so bad it doesn't matter. Everytime I have to choose 1 of 3 of the same dialogue option but slightly different I get so annoyed I skip the rest. I think alot of the larger ideas / themes of the story are super cool, but so much of what you actually engage with is \"wow a bad thing is happening, lets go stop the bad thing\" with 0 depth and nothing interesting going on. Idk, maybe I'm expecting too much? It's very hard to watch these cutscenes compared to something like the xenoblade series, at least to me. They also do a TON of exposition dumping, which I consider a red flag that usually showcases a failure of storytelling.\r\n\r\n-Absolutely no polish. There are so many small things wrong with this game it's crazy. The most annoying is lack of menu optimization. the menu to evolve your Digimon is different from the one to move your party, which is different from the one to level enhance. This gets compounded when you need to train on the digi-farm. Let's say you need +300 ATK to digivolve your mon, so you put it into the farm to train ATK. You can no longer access the digivolve menu. This means you need to know when you have enough ATK, or else you have to take it out of the farm, check again, then put it back. That doesn't sound too bad, until you realize you have 6 party members, and a ton of extra digimon you may be trying to evolve at any 1 time. You might have 1 digimon that needs 300 ATK, 1 that needs 200 DEF, 1 that need 400 SPI, and 1 that need to change it's personality. Good luck keeping track of all that.\r\n\r\nAll in all, this is a $30 game that could have been sold for $40 because Digimon, but is instead $70 because they can I guess. A complete joke for the price. Similar to pokemon, unless your a die-hard fan, it's not worth it at all. Very disappointing.",

      "review": "So i bought this game after reading reviews, watching some gameplay and cutscenes, and checking out how many Digimon are in the game. If you're enjoying this game, that's great. It's better than what Gamefreak is pushing out.\n\nLet's get some positives out of the way first:\n- There is indeed a lot of Digimon. Even though many are very similar to each other, i have no complaints there.\n- Animations for most of the moves are solid.\n\nNow, the negatives obviously outweigh the positives since i do not recommend this game.\n- Combat pretty much plays itself. Just spam attack. There's no real gameplay here. Especially since i picked the harder difficulty, expecting to actually use my brain to beat encounters. There was one battle that i lost, and only won because i was lucky. One battle in 7.5 hours that i somewhat enjoyed. Combine this with how many encounters are spammed around in some areas and for me it's a repetitive recipe for disaster. This is by far my biggest complaint.\n\n- Story is okay. It's not bad, but it's not great either. If the gameplay wouldn't be so stale, this wouldn't have bothered me as much. Since it's a Digimon game, i wasn't expecting much to begin with. But i had to try and find some redeeming qualities that could keep me playing. The story fails to deliver in that regard. \n\n- The biggest portion of the game i was sent down into sewers and empty buildings. Cool. In the trailer there's these cool looking areas and so far i've only seen the Digimon city, which was fun, but guess what? I was sent into the sewers there too! Why? \n\nIt starts off with a bang and it was definitely fun at first. But it's all downhill from there. Result is that i can't refund it. So i feel tricked in a way for sure.",

Characters are introduced in a very dry manner, you get a short amount of time with them, they go away for extremely long time & then you revisit them and the game acts like they're important characters. There's a dozen+ of these characters which all follow this same pattern. There are plot twists, but you usually see them coming miles off or they're just underwhelming or complete nonsense. \r\n\r\nDigivolving digimon is a big part of my enjoyment in digimon games, yet in this one it feels unnecessary to really do a lot of this. Most of the game you'll be stuck with Ultimate rank digimon as the jump to mega takes forever. You can't chart out digivolution paths ingame (even using online sites its a big chore) leading to it being a very annoying chore. The way stats stay and grow is very unclear as well.\r\n\r\nThe personality system is just boring, you talk to your digimon & can nudge them in a personality direction. sometimes you get 4 options, sometimes 1. it feels cheap, doesnt feel rewarding. You can also move personality on the digi farm, which is even more of a chore & takes 10 minutes of real life time (or payment of ingame money)\r\n\r\nThe world itself is also kind of just really uninteresting. The maps have some exploration, but its usually just \"take dead end side path, get an item you already have 20 of\". Don't expect to have to solve puzzles, or fight optional bosses to open new areas. Its always just corridors with some short side paths. \r\n\r\nFights themselves are very very easy except for boss fights, which are basically HP sponge fights even when using hits at 300%. Combined with scripted HP% activated \"boss does big move hit a spot to cancel\" mechanics. \r\n\r\nNow grinding to gain exp, and digivolve to the digimon you want is a big aspect of the game (though largely optional), but the game just doesnt really let you grind anywhere in a satisfying manner. enemy density is low, the corridors have constant \"gaps\" where you gotta go through a dialogue option to appear on the other side. Digimon dont reappear except when you reenter areas either so its just extremely tedious and boring if you actually want to digivolve a lot of digimon for completion sake. Ofc they do sell a 7€ DLC that lets you grind EXP items extremely easily. Which is just scummy. Endgame supposedly does have better grinding spots, but like that's a really long slog to get to.\r\n\r\nI just don't get who the target audience is for this game. If you want a good story, this aint it. If you want good gameplay, this aint it. If you want to grind & digivolve a lot of digimon, this aint it. \r\n\r\nTl:DR 5/10 game.",

Each time it happened I was manually saving and in the middle of that, the steam deck crashed and reset itself. When I tried loading the game it said the data was corrupted. The first 3 times I was able to verify game files, and attempt to load the auto save data and save to a new slot. This worked. The 4th time however, following the same steps, when I launched the game it automatically started new game. It didn't even launch to the home screen of the game, it put me directly into a new game where it told me to select a difficulty. No matter what I did this was the outcome. I created a new game, waited for the unskippable intro then attempted to load my save data again only to see it was completely wiped and replaced with 00:00 playtime data. It would refuse to load and any autosave data was replaced when starting the new game.

I was a big Digimon fan back in the PS1 days, but I fell off the series after that. When I heard this new entry was a turn-based RPG and people were calling it better than the modern Pokémon games, I figured it was finally time to jump back in.\r\n\r\nAnd to be fair, the combat is genuinely fun and interesting. The turn-based system has depth, experimenting with different Digimon is enjoyable, and there’s a nice variety of team setups to play around with. Battles were easily the highlight of the experience for me, and I can definitely see why long-time fans love the monster-collecting side of things.\r\n\r\nBut unfortunately… the story lost me fast. It’s extremely anime, but not the good kind of anime. The pacing, the dialogue, the tone, it just didn’t hook me at all. I found myself zoning out during cutscenes and waiting to get back to the battles instead. Compared to modern Pokémon games, which at least give you things like online battles or Raid Battles to break up the monotony, Time Stranger feels more restrictive. If the story bores you, there isn’t much else to fall back on.\r\n\r\nOverall, I’m left with mixed feelings. The combat is fun, there’s a huge roster of Digimon to experiment with, and mechanically it’s solid. But the story, unfortunately a major part of the game, is a real let down for me. Fans who love Digimon narratives might feel differently, but if you’re here for gameplay and a strong story matters to you, temper your expectations.\r\n\r\n [h3]★★⯪☆☆ - Great battles, weak story.

      "review": "I am very conflicted about this game even though I had quite a lot of fun with it. If I had the option to give it a neutral review, I would have chosen that.\n\nFor starters, the pricing policy of Bandai Namco is indefensible in my opinion. While Digimon Story Time Stranger certainly has the highest production value of any game in the franchise, it still is a AA game that somehow asks for 120€ for its „ultimate edition“ to get the full content. For reference, this is more than Baldur’s Gate 3 and Clair Obscur’s day one prices combined and that is kind of ridiculous. It is also more than what Final Fantasy VII Rebirth asked for. Not only is the production quality of all aforementioned games (significantly) better, none of them sell predatory day one „EXP for money“ DLCs like Digimon Story unfortunately does. Yes, you wont’t need that DLC, but that’s beyond the point. With this pricing the game puts itself far above any of the best RPGs of the recent 2-3 years while not being able to see eye to eye with them in most aspects. I’m sorry, but that alone already warrants a negative review.\n\nNow you might argue that the pricing shouldn’t matter in a review, and that you are rather interested in knowing whether this game is good or not. What you are willing to pay for it is your business alone. Fair enough I guess.\n\n[h3] Things to be enthusiastic about [/h3]\nThe game has a lot of positive surprises in it. The story may start slowly, but after the first third of its runtime the tension and mystery picks up a lot. It is genuinely a gripping and emotional story with a great main cast and some very positive side characters. Some twists you’ll probably see coming but others will catch you by surprise. Be prepared for the story to feature mature and fairly dark themes such as war and how it affects the population of humans and digimon alike. Don’t worry though, it manages that without feeling overly oppressive or depressive. \n\nEvery digimon has a unique special attack animation, sometimes even more than one which is awesome. And there are all these little details on top of that, which show how much love has been put into this game. For instance every time you use an item in fight on one of your digimon, they happily emote to that. It is really cute and a nice touch. Speaking of the battle system, it has a lot of (semi-deep) tactical options and things you’ll need to manage. The latter boss fights are a delight and you have some great challenges as end-game-content.\n\n[h3] Things that are good and bad at the same time [/h3]\nThe game has some rather mixed choices in its game design and narration. While the story does get much better later on, the first 20-25 hours are uneventful and at times even somewhat painful to get through. It doesn’t help that most of the human characters are kinda one-dimensional and not all that interesting unlike the great digimon cast for both friends and foes alike. That is a bit of a pity.\n\nSimilarly, the battles are great and disappointing at the same time. Yes, I mentioned fun boss fights and I really did like them. Well, mostly the second half of them because the first were almost trivial despite choosing the „hard“ difficulty. However, the real issue are the mob battles. With one exception none of the regular fights were challenging at all. They felt like copy paste filler in between boss fights, which is a shame considering that this is what you’ll do the majority of the game. I acknowledge that this is sadly quite prevalent especially in RPGs. Games like Baldur’s Gate 3 and Clair Obscur showed that this doesn’t need to be the case though.\n\n[h3] The game’s serious flaw [/h3]\nIf you want to pinpoint the biggest issue of the game with a bit of an edgy comment, it would look something like this: „You’ve most likely already played this game even if you’ve never spend a single minute in it.“ What do I mean with that? This is referencing the real antagonist of Digimon Story Time Stranger: the game and level design. \n\nIf you have played any of the two Cyber Sleuth games, then you’ve basically played this game with less quality-of-life features. In fact, this is also true if you’ve played any linear turn-based RPG from the PS2 era onwards. You have small linear maps with copy paste mob enemies and (very short) loading screens when you move to the next location and of course also a fine selection of fetch-side-quests (go from a to b and fight c) over and over again… Some call this „not pushing the boundaries of the genre“, others will see this as yet another attempt at the classical but overdone turn based RPG-formula with basically zero innovation. \n\nIf that doesn’t bother you and if you really like turn based RPGs, then you probably will have a good, perhaps even great time with the game. If you’re looking for something fresh and unique, you’ll find next to nothing here.\n\n[h3] Conclusion [/h3]\nOverall I did have fun with Digimon Story Time Strange and it does have some undeniable strengths. However, it is also very formulaic with a heavily dated map and quest design. You’ll have to decide whether that is a deal-breaker to you or not.",

Even 10/10 games shouldn't cost this much.\nThe video game market is due for a crash. Wait for a sale.\n\nEdit: I want to be absolutely clear: I'm not hating on the game. I'm not that far but I enjoy it. I simply hate the practice that Bandai Namco and other large publishers have of removing content and selling that content as an overpriced version or more DLC. It preys on people who have OCD or heaven forbid want a complete game. If missing content doesn't bother you, buy the standard edition. I simply do not recommend the \"complete\" game a the price it is currently. It's a good game from what I can tell so far, but you can get a LOT of good games for that price. If money doesn't matter to you then obviously this whole conversation doesn't. \n\nFor people wondering why I bought it, this was a rare occasion. Most of my games are free or are gifted to me. When a company or series has a consistent record of $800 of DLC like modern Monster Hunter games, I avoid it. I get that a lot of you have enjoyed the game so far like myself. I'm certainly not trying to dampen that or offend you. I'm simply saying that I do not recommend a purchase at this time for people wanting the Ultimate Edition. Have a good one!\n\n100% completion edit: Firstly, ignore the playtime. There's an AFK spot in the game to grind out levels for getting all the digivolutions. I did everything there was to do in the game. All digimon, all chests, perfect completions of all outer dungeons, etc. I enjoyed the game but I once again say wait for a sale. I enjoyed seeing the digimon, battling, and exploring when the game allowed me. I didn't enjoy the minor bugs like the digi-attack just not responding occasionally, the general extreme linearity, and the pacing of the game (the game dumps half the sidequests on you only after reaching the last story bit, for example). Speaking of sidequests, the translation effort/budget definitely didn't go into those. In particular, the second half or so of the sidequests had a ton of errors (wrong names showing up when clearly another character is talking happened more than once, for example). Overall I liked the game but the price to enjoyment ratio was a big miss.",

      "review": "Playing this game left me genuinely sad and mad. I’ve been a Digimon fan for years, and after really enjoying Cyber Sleuth, I was genuinely excited for this one. I wanted to love it so badly, but couldn't.\n\nIt’s not just the game that frustrates me — it’s the company behind it, and the players who keep enabling this nonsense. Watching people throw money at this just because it's a Digimon game feels pathetic. Nostalgia shouldn’t make you a paypig for a corporation that clearly doesn’t respect its fans.\n\nThis is a $70 title that barely lasts 35 hours, it’s impossible to recommend. Especially when other modern JRPGs like Persona or Expedition 33 offer more content, better pacing, and actual value for your money.\n\n[h2]The Good[/h2]\n\n✅ The story is good, and the twist lands greatly (even if predictable).\n✅ The characters carry the game; you’ll actually care for them, which is rare in monster-taming games. \n✅ The core combat / Digimon evolution stuff is fun. There is a satisfaction in juggling builds and a wide variety of mons, but it really never challenges you meaningfully.\n✅ It’s enjoyable until the flaws nag at you so badly you want to quit.\n\n[h3]The Bad[/h3]\n\n❌Every side quest is “go to X, fetch Y, return,” over and over. No variation. Fifty fetch quests just to kill time.\n❌There’s no good spot in the game where you can reliably grind or level up without frustration (unless you buy the grind DLC). And right before the final fight, they dump dozens of side-quests into your journal just so they can say they have content.\n❌At launch, there were game-breaking bugs: like Aegiomon not recovering HP/SP outside of battles, the Pegasusmon egg bug, etc. Seems like they were too busy making a dozen DLCs to QA.\n\n[h3]The Ugly[/h3]\n\n❌ The game shipped with [b]TEN[/b] DLCs from day one. So the devs literally withheld content for extra cash.\n❌ The season pass (at ~$30) gives you virtually nothing meaningful at launch. The big “Gold Statue” is purely decorative. The rest (~15 “mega digis”) are scheduled for rollout in 2026. You’re paying now for content you might not get (or may not be worth it) later.\n❌ There is no multiplayer (no co-op, no trades, nothing). Previous Digimon Story titles allowed more social interactions; this one is utterly single-player.\n❌ There’s an NPC whose sole function is to open the Steam store. The main menu has a button that opens the DLC store. The game feels like a giant ad.\nBut it's worse: [b]even if you don’t own a DLC item (outfit, music, whatever), the game adds it to your inventory menu anyway[/b]. If you accidentally click it, it pulls up the Steam store—unwanted prompts to buy garbage you didn’t ask for. \n❌ 20 bucks for a music DLC, lol.\n\n[h3]Overall Take[/h3]\nIf you want to enjoy this, you’ll have to mentally ignore the DLC crap, the side quests, the pacing issues, and the bugs. If you can do that, there’s a pulse of a decent JRPG underneath. But for what it charges, it fails to deliver.\n\nIf you like Digimon lore and are willing to be nickel-and-dimed, you might still find some joy. But if you expect a polished, generous JRPG you’ll be disappointed.",

      "review": "TLDR - Buy this on sale\n\nAs a casual Digimon fan, I REALLY want to like this game but the $70 price point is really killing this for me. The music is uninspiring, the animations are so-so, and the story+dialogue is sub-par. The only thing that is masking the stench is the joy of unlocking new Digimon. Just to preface, I am Agent level 6 at them moment to give an idea of where im at in the game. I have done all the side quests up to this point for reference. \n\nI'm sure that hardcore fans are loving this and that is good for them but as a general JRPG, its just okay. There are so many QoL features that are missing like getting to see the Digivolution lines in the farm. Why do I need to constantly open the farm in a non-tp-able area and swap between menus just to see what personality/stats I need to digivolve? It is just so convoluted.  \n\nTo no ones surprise, the game involves time travel. Time travel as the focal point of any story is a very delicate balancing act that needs to be done right. It is so easy to mess up a story that involves time travel. So what happens when you get a time travel story and bad dialogue? You get Time Strangers. The Operator is so unbelievably bad that it tears down a lot of my enjoyment of the game. They constantly (and I mean CONSTANTLY) bring up the most obvious things and regurgitates the same info they said 5 lines ago. Early in the game, the player finds out that their adoptive parent is dead/missing through dialogue between the Operator. Well, 40 hours in and they STILL mention it to like its the first time all while in the first few hours of the game they apologize for bringing up the topic and promising that they wont do it again. It's just exhausting seeing the player's phone ring and its the Operator just spewing the same garbage they did 2 minutes ago. ACTUAL DIALOGUE BTW; \"I bet you remember your own adoptive father's mysterious appearance\" and the context of this is... entering a new biome... 20ish hours into the game...\n\nThe music... I dont know man, there is just nothing that pops out to me. It just feels like generic JRPG music you can find anywhere. Nothing feels stylized or unique to the franchise, In the demo, there is a section of the game that has a 15+ second long sequence of where it sounds like a jet engine is about to explode. This LOOPS CONSTANTLY and the fix i found was changing the music. Such a shame.\n\nYou'll see such high praise for this game but it will mostly be from long time fans. As a Digimon game, it is pretty good, great even. As a videogame, it is sub-par and not worth the price tag. Just save yourself the money and buy this game when it is inevitably sub $40. There is just so much missing from this game that just makes it a 5/10 at $70 but maybe a 7/10 below $40.",

TLDR it's a solid 7/10, if you enjoyed Cyber Sleuth you'll enjoy this game. But at this price point I can't recommend it for everyone. If it gets a permanent price drop to 50 or maybe 60 if they do some impressive patches I'll recommend it to people. \n\nI was told by someone the game was in development hell and you can kind of tell. The story is a bit of a step backward the mechanics are a little step forward. Somethings are improved over the last game like organizing the mons and changes to personalities are more useful though not revolutionary.\nBut then there is the digifarm -sigh- this one feels clunky and also a little bit useless. The time investment you put into it can probably be out performed by grinding which is not ideal. It is at odds with another system, the anomaly skill points, which are much more easily accessible and more impactful. The digifarm needs a lot of work to be adequate it may as well not be in the game.\nThe sound mixing is a little off, some of the VA is not so great alongside pretty good VA. The environments are very pretty but they are also kind of small and you backtrack through them a lot. Cyber Sleuth kind of did that too but it was a vita game and also a long time ago now.\nThe boss fights are improved but not by much, we've had stunning mechanics in rpgs for at least a decade so there isn't much to talk about there. You won't feel the least bit lost if you played Cyber Sleuth or really any rpg. It relies on you not knowing anything about the mon you'll be fighting next to be \"difficult\" the solution is always to reset and swap mons in your team for a type advantage if you can't win.\nTo give some idea of issues with the plot and pacing of the game without spoiling anything. There is one prominent character that says virtually the same thing every time they talk to you. It feels almost like a mistake but it's voice acted and the background is different and sometimes it's part of a scene that is different. So believe me when i say it's not a bug, it's just baffling. I'm not at the end yet but I'd say it's a little worse than Cyber Sleuth.\nI'm enjoying it overall. My expectations were not high, I'm getting an adventure with some digimon and that's what i wanted. The overall gameplay formula even if it wasn't improved by much is still fun. For those of us that liked the last game anyway, I think if you didn't like Cyber Sleuth or Hacker's Memory that this game isn't doing anything that would win you over.",

The amount of monetary extortion from Bandai however is inexcusable, and prevents me from truly recommending it. This game is already not worth 70 dollars, and you are expected to pay another 50 dollars on top of that to get so basic additional content down the road. Worst of all there are optional dungeons available for purchase as well to help ease grinding, which raises the question of whether the game is balanced in a way to push users toward using those options. That's not even all of the purchasable content, making this game in some ways feel more like you just paid 70 dollars for a store to buy more content within. I am willing to overlook this to a degree in a free multiplayer game, but this is a full-priced single player experience, and results in a very anti-consumer product from Bandai.",

      "review": "ESL so sorry for bad englando.\nI love Digimon and the games, especially the older PSX titles. Unfortunately I feel disappointed in this one as it is yet another victim of the shittified modern industry. Luckily I was able to play it thanks to the Family Share. If I paid for this game I'd be very salty.\n\nPositives:\n\n- Pretty Graphics. The world really looks good, so do the Digimon and the animations. I never grew tired of them. \n\n- Good voice-acting. Played with JP voices and ENG subs. I find that the voices were fitting very well and sounded good.\n\n- Interesting Story. In-line with what you'd expect from Digimon themed story but it was nice and I enjoyed reading it. If I ever play it again I probably won't be skipping it all either.\n\nNegatives:\n\n - The game is ridiculously easy. It doesn't let you play the Mega or Mega+ mode on your 1st playthrough, you can only pick Hard. This is piss easy. You can auto-battle through most of the game, including side-quest bosses. Only some main story bosses require you to actually manually input your controls and they are still easy. The hardest side bosses/post-story bosses which are harder than the main story bosses on this difficulty require very little effort too. All you have to do is go face and spam items. No tactics or variety needed. I would like to point out I didn't do any grinding either. Just went forward and battled Digimon that were in my way.\nIf you're asking for specific points why it's too easy here you go:\n        1. You automatically heal by standing still, this completely eliminates any sort of danger or need to be prepared. You never need items while just going around. Every battle is from full HP/SP, no risk of dying. In all previous games you'd only heal at specific spots or maybe before major encounters.\n        2. You can freely swap Digimon during your turn as many times as you want before attacking. This used to consume your turn. \n        3. You can always use 1 item for free, even when swapping Digimon. This again used to consume your turn too. Now you can do both for free. It's not like the items are expensive or rare either. You get tons of money and items.\n        4. Agent Skills are very OP. Both the X-Arts do ridiculous amount of work for you and the special nature skills let you evolve your Digimons too easily. This is a problem if you focus on one of the natures, you can easily get super strong Digimon through Digivolution and farm bonuses with no effort even unintentionally. \n        5. 3v3 Battles. Except not really, for almost the entire game it's at least 4v3 or even 6v3. You get an extra party member that's nearly always there whom you can customize with skills and items. This gives you drastic advantage as the member is actually good.  Not to mention there tend to be other guest members that will help you further, even if they aren't good at times they can still tank hits and seem to have at times unlimited HP.\n        6. Digimon in Box get XP. You'd think this is to make sure you don't have to grind for all other Digimon, while that's true it's also a problem. In other games only Digimon in your party get XP. Here you have seemingly unlimited box size. Why is that bad? Well, whenever you convert a Digimon you can leave it in the box until it's max level or whenever you need them. As soon as you get a Digimon to evolve you just feed them all these useless Digimon to get tons of XP. So tl;dr this just gives you countless XP batteries for free.\n\nYou'd think that these may've been decisions to improve the QoL for people who aren't used to grinding or don't have too much time. I'd be willing to concede that point but then you have to compensate for it in other ways otherwise things just become boring. This games gives you everything, all the time. At least on the hardest difficulty that you can pick during your 1st playtrough. \nWhile I understand you can make the game harder for yourself by imposing your own rules I don't find that as valid argument. It's developer's job to provide adequate challenge, especially when the game has multiple modes. What is ''Hard'' here I'd normally consider ''Easy'' difficulty. In no world should you wait until NG+ to actually be challenged. I may try it if enough new content/mods are released for the game and update the review then.\n\n- Not that many new/different Digimon compared to previous titles. If we're talking Cyber Sleuth/Hacker's Memory or even Next Generation I feel like there's very little variety. Especially in the Mega+ Digimon, some things like X-Antibody are missing completely. It wouldn't be that big of a deal if at least the existing Digimon were different but they aren't, which means you are going for the same end-game you went for in the previous games. Nothing new or exciting. This yet again makes it worse because even if you get to the NG+ & Mega+ there's nothing to play it for but the challenge.\n\n- Bad Sidequest distribution. During the game you will get 1-2 sidequests in every area, which you can finish if a matter of minutes. This pace remains until right before the end where the game dumps like 20+ sidequests on you. It would be much nicer if they'd spread them out more evenly.\n\n- Card Battles. This is just a disgrace and slap in the face for anyone who ever like any mini-game ever. This is a horrible rock-paper-scissor game that's affected by pure RNG. Straight up worst mini-game I've ever played. It's all the worse considering that Digimon World 3 had the whole Digimon Trading Card Game in it, even though it was somehow reduced and the turn were pre-determined. I sincerely hope whoever made this and approved this gets fired. The game would be better off without it, as it will just make you disappointed or angry.\n\n- Farm is bad. Besides the issues of how much stronger it can make you very easily it straight up looks worse than Cyber Sleuth or even Dusk/Dawn. It has some customization element that's purely cosmetic but what is even the point when it looks so bad and does nothing? As if that's not bad enough some items for it are paid DLC, which does literally nothing.\n\n- Monetization. This is overall pretty expensive game. 70€/$ is a lot for some people. I don't feel like you're getting your buck's worth out of it and what's worse is the atrocious DLCs. Day 1 DLCs are a tragedy, even more-so when you have DLCs that aren't included in the most expensive version of the game. Yet another spit in the face for paying customers. And what do you get out of it? Random farm items that do absolutely nothing nor look good. Two Digimon (Black Agumon/Black Gabumon) that you can get easily and almost immediately. This is supposed to be worth IRL money when you actually paid already? Or paying for OSTs from previous games/anime series? Absolutely ridiculous. Don't get me started on the P2W dungeons that you can only access if you buy them. Yes, you don't have to buy them but just the fact that we got to a point where single player games have this is beyond me.\n\n- Outer Dungeons. I don't have problem with all of them or the concept in general. They are ok, but eventually you get few specific dungeons where you fight the ''Strongest'' Digimons. I assume this is meant to be some kind of challenge dungeons. This is where the problem is, not only are they really easy you have to rewards for them. No items, no money, no special item, achievement, nothing. Just a waste of time and disappointment.\n\n- Denuvo. Perhaps the most egregious overstep. What can I say besides that no developer who ever includes Denuvo in their game ever deserves any money. Just another big ''Screw you'' to the paying customer. This would warrant bad rating on it's own, though the game gives me plenty other reasons to do it anyways.\n\nUltimately I feel like this game has great core and potential that was stomped to the ground by bad decisions and corporate greed. I absolutely wouldn't recommend financially supporting games like this, otherwise nothing will ever change.",

You can even notice it in the demo if you wanna check before buying, Itt feels like it should be $20 cheaper.\r\n\r\nCurrently at launch there's tons of bugs some that softlocks and forces you to either wait for a fix/mod or reload an old save. The game just feels like it had bad testing\r\n\r\nDifficulty options are really bad. Previous games like Cyber Sleuth and Hacker’s Memory had hard modes that actually mattered. Here, “hard” barely changes anything. Dataminers say it only gives enemies 20% more ATK and INT, everything else is the same. Compare that to Cyber Sleuth where stats doubled, or Hacker’s Memory where it was 1.5x.\r\n\r\nThe common response I see? “Just play on Mega or Mega+” that’s for NG+, not a first playthrough. I wanted a hard first experience. There's no harm in that you don't have to choose it, I don't want a boring Pokemon feeling in turn based RPG games.\r\n\r\nRight now you can ignore a lot of mechanics and still auto-battle bosses on hard because the game is just too easy. It feels like a Pokémon game where nothing you do matters, I could basically mash my keyboard (or controller) and win every fight.\r\n\r\nBalance overall is bad. The game gives players a ton of advantages and new mechanics to get stronger while also making enemies weaker compared to the previous two games. The loading system completely breaks balance you can feed fodder Digimon to one and have it carry you through the whole game. They nerfed it a bit in day 1 patch from the demo I believe, but it’s still way too strong.\r\n\r\nThe Agent Tree is too strong too. You can give a Digimon the right personality and get like 75% extra stats. But honestly… do you even need it? The game is already too easy, so it feels pointless. No real satisfaction.\r\n\r\nLots of QoL stuff is missing too:\r\n\r\n*You can’t evolve in the farm, have to take them out first\r\n\r\n*Feeding in the farm is slow, clunky, and annoying\r\n\r\n*Paying to fast-forward training should at least scale with how much time is left, but it doesn’t\r\n\r\nAt its core, the game just feels outdated. It’s way too similar to vita games like Cyber Sleuth and doesn’t feel like a proper upgrade for the price and year.\r\n\r\nAt this state I put the game down and started waiting for a difficulty mod.",

      "review": "I really wanted to like this game but the flaws are just too big to ignore. I've practically played every Digimon game with an english translation so far, and sadly Time Stranger is on the weaker side. Its saving grace is that it is the only Digimon game we're gonna get for another 5 years probably.\n\nThe good parts first:\n- We actually get a digital world this time.\n- I really like the big city in the Digital World. It feels lively.\n- Big Digimon roster\n- Nice signature move animations\n\nProblems:\n- The game was clearly rushed. Especially nearing the end this gets more and more evident. The story is skipping some parts. The animations get very barebone. The majority of side quests unlock just before the final boss, indicating that they were finished before the parts in the story where they belonged.\n- The story is badly written and boring. Expecting a good story for a digimon game might be overkill, but it makes up the biggest part of the game in Time Stranger.\n- Too many badly written human characters, who you are forced to interact with for dozens of hours.\n- You have very little freedom in the game because the time travel story often locks you into certain areas.\n- Way too much time is wasted outside the digital world.\n- No real \"digimon feel\" after the first few areas in the digital world.\n- No postgame.\n- Most of the game is spent on auto battle at 5x speed (at least for me). Manual battle is too tedious for trash mobs. If you know your game has tedious trash mob encounters, you should rethink your design instead of adding high speed auto battling as a bandaid.\n- The personality system actively hinders you from digivolving your partners across the entire digivolution grid. It's much easier to just get a new digimon with the correct personality for a digivolution line than it is for you to make your long time partner into the digimon you want.\n- Costs 70 bucks despite being unfinished\n- Lots of unnecessary and overpriced DLC\n\ntl;dr:\nOnly buy if you really need a Digimon game, no matter the quality. This game was rushed despite the 10 years since Cyber Sleuth and you can feel it. Despite that, Bandai charges 70 bucks for it. The story and the characters are bad and take up the majority of the game. Exploring the Digital World feels like an afterthought.",

      "review": "Initially thought it was a great sequel to Cyber Sleuth (bought on several systems, but several hundreds hours in to) but the more you get into the systems the clunkier they feel. The story is good and the and the game, especially the digimon themselves are looking great, however things feel bottle-necked to push you into DLC's to speed up obtaining currency/xp/etc. \r\n\r\nThe trait system is a pain to micromanage with no ability to set a 'target' so you're constantly having to double check what dialogue choices you need to make to get traits where you want them, especially if you're working on several digimon at once. This is coupled with the descriptions around the trait system being different to the actual terms used in the table itself, which all just adds to the general feeling of clunkiness. \r\n\r\nI'm still enjoying it, but its beginning to wear thin and its wildly overpriced for a game that feels inferior to the predecessor gameplay-wise.",

      "review": "Can't recommend it for this price. Its a good digimon game but a bad videogame..\nIts quanity over quality.. \nSame engine as the Vita/PS4 versions and you just feel that\n\nAnimations are very bad and do not fit the new models most of the time (Looking at you idle animations)\nEastereggs are just heartless bs.\nOH YEAH THATS RENAMON ITS THERE IN THE CORNER WITH IMPMON, LOPMON AND TERRIERMON I KNOW THEM FROM THE ANIME\nBut they don't do anything, there are just there but you can't even talk to them?!\n\nAll NPCs are soooooo boring and just stand there or go in circles, you literally feel the Vita version of cyber sleuth coming through here\n\nRiding on your Digimon? Yeah sure! Just without ANY sounds its suuuuuper blant\n\nThe maps and levels are also very boring and tiny halls that connect to eachother.. Great work Vita engine!\n\nIf you LOVE digimon, go for this one here! If you just want to collect monsters maybe try it out, but generally its not a good game in my opinion",

      "review": "[h1]The Digimon Game that Made Me Give Up on Digimon Games.[/h1]\n\nI've always struggled with sticking to modern Digimon games as they often are plagued with a slew of problems that they've latched onto for nostalgia-baiting purposes. Time Stranger steps away from that time honored tradition that Digimon Games follow and tries to set itself apart and cater to NEW players who might have an interest in the game. Unfortunately whilst Time Stranger sets itself apart from other Digimon games, the game just isn't particularly that great, and if you've played any generic turn-based RPG from the early 2000's or even now you've basically played it. Admittedly I've tried SO HARD to like this game as it does stand apart from other Digimon games, but the experience is either largely bland or bad for the majority of the game to the point that I can't bring myself to continue wasting time playing it.\n\nFurthermore there seems to be this.. Overall consensus that a large portion of the community has regarding this game which is that \"It gets good around the 25-30 hour mark\", and admittedly I find that to be insanity. In our world where there's an ever-growing supply of games which can be FUN and ENGAGING from the first 5 minutes, why spend your time on something which isn't fantastic from the first step? Are the standards of people playing this game so astronomically low that they think this is ok? Even the #1 Review AT CURRENT says the game is essentially boring/mid yet rates it positively due to it being A DIGIMON GAME.\n\nThere's so many things in this game that make it obvious that the game is half-baked like there only being basically 5 voice actors for all the Digimon when they attack - I sincerely hope you like the voice of in-game Agumon because it's possible to have 15 different Digimon you use which have the same voice! Time Strangers' marketing paints the game as having these grandiose and beautiful overworld areas, but all these are is cleverly disguised hallways and linear paths. \n\nTime Strangers' gameplay is overall boring and so badly wants to be mechanically deep and interesting yet doesn't give you enough tools for that to be the case and restricts your actual usage of tactics. Gameplay for the game quickly devolves into \"Does your Digimon have the type which is resistant to the enemy? No? Do you have Convert?\". Almost every single attack in the game is basically just a reskin of every other single attack in the game, and bosses being resistant to most statuses means that the only real \"tactical gameplay\" to be had is just whether you debuff them or not. \n\nTime Strangers' view of difficulty seems to be confused for annoyance, with the bosses not even being hard to take on within the hard difficulty. Boss fight formula in this game is essentially the boss pulling some dumb bullshit out of nowhere repeatedly to *TRY* to make the fights require you to think, yet they still devolve into using three Digimon which are resistant to the boss and nothing more because you're not given any other options than to buff and sweep.\n\nTime Strangers' story is extremely predictable and almost all of the characters just feel so unlikable within the storyline, with constant terrible and predictable choices plaguing the narrative to the point it feels like your stereotypical shonen anime. On top of this the progression system feels incredibly padded to make it to where you're FORCED to spend more time playing the game to Digivolve anything to a Digimon you might actually care about. Time Strangers' Agent Rank system is admittedly worse than the grinding system in CyberSleuth which already wasn't great. \n\nGo play something else which is fun from the start.",
