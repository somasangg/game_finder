I believe if the devs had a more clear idea of the direction they wanted to go with it and put more time into improving the game play, it could have been worth the insane price increase. Good game to play with friends, best when bought on sale!",

      "review": "Rating: 8.5/10\n\n7 Days to Die is one of those rare survival games that manages to be brutally punishing, deeply addictive, and unexpectedly immersive all at the same time. Even after years in development, it stands out as one of the most unique combinations of survival, crafting, FPS combat, and base-building on the market.\n\nWhat the game does exceptionally well\n\nCrafting & Base Building\nThe building system is incredibly flexible, one of the best in any survival game. You can design anything from simple wooden shacks to reinforced concrete fortresses with traps, electricity, and ingenious funnel systems to survive the horde nights.\n\nAtmosphere & Exploration\nThe world feels dangerous and unpredictable. Towns are full of loot, hidden stashes, and zombie surprises. POIs (points of interest) are surprisingly well-designed, often feeling like handcrafted mini-dungeons.\n\nHorde Nights are truly unique\nEvery 7 days, the game becomes something different, more intense, more strategic. It forces you to prepare, adapt, and constantly improve your defenses. Surviving the red moon is satisfying every single time.\n\nWhere it falls short\n\nThe graphics and animations can feel outdated\nEven with updates, some animations and zombie models show their age. It doesn’t ruin the experience, but it’s noticeable.\n\nOccasional bugs and jank\nIt’s still rough around the edges. Physics glitches, weird zombie behavior, and performance dips happen, especially on larger maps or co-op worlds.\n\nWhy it stands out\n\nFew games balance long-term progression and moment-to-moment tension like 7 Days to Die. Whether you're looting a house at 2 AM with a broken leg or watching the sun rise after surviving a blood moon with 3 hit points left, it creates stories you remember.\n\n*Final Verdict*\n\nIf you love survival crafting, tense exploration, and the thrill of defending a base you built with your own hands, 7 Days to Die is still one of the best experiences out there. It’s not perfect, but its depth and replayability keep players coming back for hundreds of hours.",

      "review": "7 Days to Die is, in my opinion, one of the best zombie survival games ever made. It’s fun, intense, and full of jump scares that will have you leaping out of your seat — especially when you’re new and a zombie sneaks up on you.\n\nThe early hordes aren’t too bad to manage, giving you time to learn the basics of looting, crafting, and fortifying your base. But as the days go by, the hordes grow larger, faster, and much more destructive, turning each horde night into an adrenaline rush.\n\nThe game also offers a ton of customization options in its settings, letting you tweak difficulty, zombie behavior, loot abundance, and more — so you can tailor your experience to be as chill and fun or as chaotic and punishing as you want.\n\nEvery seven days, all hell breaks loose during horde night — so you’ll need to build not just a base, but a strong raid base to survive the massive zombie assault.\n\n✅ Pros\n\nDeep and rewarding survival and crafting system\n\nBuilding your own base (and raid base) feels awesome and strategic\n\nIntense horde nights that evolve over time\n\nGreat co-op experience — even better with friends\n\nStrong modding community that adds tons of new content\n\nTons of customization to fit your playstyle\n\n❌ Cons\n\nEarly game can feel a bit grindy\n\nCan get repetitive after long sessions\n\nGraphics and animations feel dated at times\n\nPvP isn’t for everyone (and can be chaotic on public servers)\n\n🧩 Mods & Extra Content\n\nThe Darkness Falls mod is amazing but much harder than the base game — best saved for experienced players looking for a real challenge. The base game alone is solid and has plenty to keep you hooked before diving into mods.\n\n🎯 Final Verdict\n\n✅ Recommended!\n7 Days to Die is a solid, well-balanced zombie survival game that’s fun solo or with friends. It’s not perfect, but few survival games capture the thrill, creativity, and pure chaos of a horde night quite like this one.",

      "review": "After fully completing 7 Days to Die and earning every achievement, I can confidently say the game was an absolute blast. My entire experience was in co-op—because I rarely play survival titles solo—and the game truly shines when shared with friends.\n\nProgression feels meaningful throughout. As you invest in skills, you can genuinely feel your character growing stronger, and that sense of advancement keeps the early and mid-game engaging. Even without any mods, the base game easily justifies its price tag, offering well over 100 hours of content.\n\nAlthough I didn’t dive into modding myself, I’ve seen enough reviews and gameplay footage to appreciate how extensive the mod scene is. The sheer variety of community-made content can completely reshape the experience and add countless hours of replayability for anyone who wants more.\n\nMy biggest gripe is the end-game loop. Once you’ve secured strong weapons and fully leveled skills, the sense of purpose starts to fade. Looting becomes meaningless, and zombie encounters lose their tension. A more rewarding or structured end-game system would do wonders here.\n\nStill, despite the late-game lull, 7 Days to Die is absolutely worth picking up—especially if you plan to play with friends. It’s a chaotic, creative, addictive survival experience that’s easy to sink time into and hard to forget.",

Overall I think it's a good game, can easily lose hours just running round looting, crafting and base building which is ideal for me. However, with the recent updates I feel the game just seems bland now. The hand-holding through POI's suggesting you go certain ways, lazy placement of zombies just standing above rooms waiting for you to trigger them, the \"new\" water system, the new creatures (Plague Spitter & Frost Claw) just seem dumb and annoying more than anything. My biggest criticism is there is just no story whatsoever and the game has been out for how long now? This could genuinely be the best zombie / survival game on the market if it had a solid story. I do hope the developers take the community feedback and improve certain elements (eg bandits). I do recommend the game to others, but just know it's far from a great game.",

The mix of survival, crafting, and base-building is fantastic, and when played with a friend it can be a genuinely fun experience for a few hours at a time. Crafting especially stands out — it’s deep, rewarding, and gives you plenty of freedom to shape your survival story.\n\nThat said, the game has some major drawbacks:\n\n Zombie Variety: The enemies rely on one basic attack pattern, which gets boring fast.\n\n World Design: The environment often feels empty and hollow, lacking the atmosphere that could make it truly immersive.\n\n Unrealized Potential: The game has so much promise but never fully delivers on it. Mods and player-owned servers help, but they don’t completely fill the gap.\n\n Constant Changes: Updates frequently alter mechanics, which can be frustrating. If you step away for a while, you’ll often come back to changes you don’t like. Removing the xp from crafting was a big drawback.",

      "review": "This game is one of the most uniquely addictive survival sandbox games out there — part FPS, part crafting, part tower defense, and part “why did that zombie just climb the wall I thought was safe?” The game throws you into a brutal open world full of undead, limited supplies, and constant pressure to prepare before nightfall. Every seven days, a massive horde comes for you, and suddenly every nail, every wall upgrade, and every trap you built matters.\n\nThe progression feels great: early game is pure panic and scavenging whatever junk you can find, mid game becomes crafting, looting, and base upgrades, and late game turns into engineering crazy kill corridors and experimenting with increasingly ridiculous defenses. The building system is incredibly flexible — you can make anything from a tiny bunker to a full zombie-proof castle (or at least you think it's zombie-proof until they break in).\n\nCombat feels satisfying, especially when you finally get better weapons and perks, and the RPG skill system makes every run feel different depending on how you choose to play — stealthy archer, melee tank, explosive maniac, engineer, trader, you name it.\n\nIt isn’t perfect: the graphics can feel outdated and the learning curve is harsh at first, but the depth of gameplay and the chaos of each blood moon easily make up for it. Whether playing solo or with friends, it’s one of the best survival sandbox experiences — tense, creative, hilarious, and endlessly replayable.\n\nIf you enjoy base-building, survival challenges, and the thrill of preparing for a wave of destruction you know is coming, 7 Days to Die is absolutely worth playing.",

      "review": "This game is an amazing Survival base building zombie experience. Highly recommend to any friend groups looking for their next sandbox survival experience. A lot of thought went into crafting the awesome map locations, talent trees, and fun in game items and weapons to craft. I have almost tried every build imaginable at this point and every one of them was fun and fulfilling. This game does a great job of showing the value of team work, in being able to split the work load with team mates by allocating level up points into different paths; and also gives solo players a fun challenge of trying to make a build completely self dependent. There are tons of enemy types which all add a breath of fresh air to the game when you see the high variety of undead faces coming at you. Despite how old the game is it has recently gotten a lot more attention and more regular meaningful updates as well. \n\nThis game is far from perfect, in fact if im being honest it feels like its missing one or two things that would put it on a whole other level entirely. I will add a couple of my more in depth notes about the game below.\n\nThe game is completely missing anything that feels like an \"end game\", every time I return to this game I will grind  enough cement to make an awesome base, loot all the largest buildings on the map, and have more dukes than I could ever know what to do with. Then you just sit and wait for the blood moon. This has probably been discussed a lot in the past but I think one step in achieving that \"end game vibe\" im describing is by include some actual boss fight mechanics. This would be such an awesome addition in my opinion, id love to see aa giant boar attack on horde night with a health bar that shows up on peoples screens until its dead. Maybe it can be an optional thing you can trigger by doing something in game to make a boss spawn I dont know.... But it would increase the stakes for sure!\n\nId also love to see them add another level of tools into the game, maybe even one or two more! They wouldn't have to be \"better\" or higher than the Auger/Chainsaw/Impact Driver but another level/tool type between would add more magazines needed, areas looted, and ultimately time played. A dream fantasy would be to see them add some level of industrial vehicles like an actual back ho or tractor or something to lay roads etc... I know that is a long shot but the vehicles in the game are another slightly underwhelming part of the game. Trucks are kind of a buggy joke and you can only get up to a gyro copter! Let us build a helicopter please!",

      "review": "[h1] This Game Turns You Into a Hoarder Fast [/h1\n\n7 Days to Die is one of those games that looks rough at first, but once it grabs you, it really grabs you. It’s basically a survival sandbox where everything wants you dead, including the weather, the zombies, and sometimes your own terrible decisions. What makes it stick is how every single moment feels like you’re barely holding things together, and somehow that never gets old.\n\nThe first week is always the best part. You spawn in the middle of nowhere, half-naked, punching grass like it owes you money. Before you even build a door, it’s nighttime and suddenly every little sound makes you freeze. The game doesn’t care if you’re ready. It just drops you into the deep end and lets you figure it out. And honestly, that’s where most of the fun comes from.\n\nBase building is where the addiction kicks in. You start with some tiny shack that looks like it was slapped together by someone who failed woodshop, and a few hours later you’re building weird, overengineered kill corridors with blade traps, dart turrets, electric fences, and whatever else you found while looting some abandoned gas station. Every blood moon becomes this mini stress-test where you find out which part of your genius design collapses first. Spoiler: it’s always the part you were the most confident about.\n\nCombat feels chaotic in a good way. Guns are loud, clumsy, and satisfying, melee weapons feel like they’re one swing away from breaking, and zombies come in just the right amount of “oh god why is that feral running at me like that.” The game never tries to be polished; it leans into the jank, and somehow it works.\n\nLooting might be the real addiction, though. Every building is like a little puzzle — break in, figure out the weird loot path, deal with the inevitable zombie that jumps out of a closet like it’s auditioning for a horror movie, grab your treasure, get out. Simple, but incredibly satisfying.\n\nWant more based things? Take a pick:\n\n• Every blood moon feels like a final exam you didn’t study for\n• Base building is endlessly creative and usually ends in disaster\n• Looting has that perfect “just one more house” pull\n• Tons of weapons, tons of mods, tons of dumb ways to die\n• Skill system actually makes your character feel different each run\n• Great solo, even better with friends who panic at the worst moments\n• Ugly in spots, but the atmosphere hits way harder than the graphics\n\nIf I had to nitpick something, it’s that the game’s been in development forever and sometimes it really shows. Animations are goofy, zombies occasionally moonwalk through doors, and the graphics bounce between “pretty good” and “this texture is from 2014.” But honestly? None of that ruins the experience. If anything, it adds charm.\n\n7 Days to Die sticks around because no two runs ever feel the same. You build, you panic, you loot, you survive… or you don’t. Either way, you’re always telling yourself you’ll do better next time, and before you know it, you’re 20 hours in and your base still looks like a mistake.",

With the lack of immersion from a lack of features which did exist (looting zombies, Collecting glass jars and empty cans, having great clothing and clothing modification variety for different weather conditions, and a skill system based on finding magazines while looting instead of gaining xp in certain skills) it is much harder than it used to be to have fun simply exploring abandoned locations. The game has been downgraded over the years while increasing in price, lead by devs who are guilt-trippers and liars, which makes interacting with the community feel draining, as a good portion of community activity is discontent with the state of the game and the attitudes of the developers.\r\n\r\nIn a live stream last august the devs explicitly stated that all these changes we demand will just delay the addition of bandits (promised 12 years ago on their kickstarter).

The entire weather system is so much worse than what they used to have to the point I just don't even bother now. It went from finding cloths to help survive in biomes to tonics and 'biome gear' locked behind challenges and that don't even show on the character in any way. You could have so much customization with clothing and armor as well as mod options but now it's just armor and a wardrobe tab. This isn't the only time they've made something worse either so here's a 'small' list of some other features that just weren't needed I guess\n\n-They removed clothing and certain armor looks to add them back as overpriced DLC\n-Jars used to be something you could find/make to get water but now it's just a dew collector that also generates heat for whatever reason\n-Learn as you do system was replaced by perks, books, and magazines\n-magazines were added in place of learning to craft through skills and finding schematics\n-Certain food items used to attract zombies to you\n-Multiple guns like the Blunderbuss were removed\n-Zombies no longer spawn as much outside POIs\n-Multiple zombie models have been removed\n\nand you get the idea. Now don't get me wrong I love this game or at least what it used to be and what it could be but at this point it doesn't feel like the devs love it anymore and would rather do anything except what players want whether that be removing liked features, strategies, or working on stuff that doesn't even matter like a knock off version of the game or DLC that isn't needed. If this ever changes I'll come back and change my review but until TFP and 7DTD start to get better I can't recommend this game",

      "review": "Pros\n\n- Large, interesting world with lots of towns, POIs, and places to explore.\n- Combat and gunplay feel much better than the older alphas.\n- Graphics and lighting are noticeably improved, especially in newer versions.\n- Quests give structured gameplay for people who prefer constant action and looting.\n- Multiplayer groups progress quickly through missions, loot, and XP.\n- Plenty of content for looter-focused players, including weapons, mods, and POI variety.\n\nCons\n\n- Base building lost most of its creativity:\n   - zombie go straight for the weakest block. \n   - removed tons of building options.\n   - more below.\n- Skill system replaced active progression with a perk system and magazine RNG that feels generic and punishes base building.\n- Game heavily favors quest grinding, leaving builders and slow-paced players under-leveled.\n- Zombie pathing targets weak blocks like a laser, removing fun or experimental base layouts.\n- Farming and water systems feel downgraded, slower, and more annoying than older versions.\n- Long-standing bugs (hitbox issues, zombie spawns in sealed areas, vehicles glitching out) remain decade-old problems.\n- Shift away from survival and building toward a faster, looter-shooter loop that many older fans don’t enjoy.\n\nOverall: it's probably a fun game for new players.  I'm sure if I played this now without ever having experienced how good the old game was, I'd love it.  Now, it's just a generic looter-shooter to get the largest audience.  It's sad how the devs tinkering took tons of the greatest parts out of the game. \n\nLonger and more descriptive review:\n\nI've been playing this game on and off since 2016.  It used to be my absolute favorite game with great building, a pretty good balance between exploration and base building, interesting mechanics with biomes, good crafting, and most importantly a very exciting and terrifying experience.  \n\nThe #1 downfall to this game and the worst part of it is that the developers CONSTANTLY change the game. Since I've been playing they've had 9 major updates that completely reworked dozens of parts of the game, usually for the worse.  If you like base building don't bother with this game anymore, they've taken out 90% of the creativity and 100% punishes you for building a base now.  \n\nI LOVE base building and this game used to be amazing for it, the skill system actually rewarded you with a skills-based progression system but they changed that to the most generic and useless attribute/perk system with RNG books and magazines you need to find to unlock skills and traits. The old system was the type of active-use progression where if you dig, you improve your digging skill, you craft, you increase crafting skill.  \n\nThe game actively punishes you now for being a base builder.  If you play with people who do the generic trader missions or explore, they level up ten times as fast, find all the magazines and books, and then can put attributes into everything whether they use it or not.  It's so disappointing because good and fun base building takes time but now you're funneled into a looter shooter type game and punished if you build. \n\nThey've also taken out tons of building options and changed the way hordes attack. There used to be a lot more variation in building options, building styles, and general base development.  Now the AI is pathed to the weakest points, they dig directly to the weakest tile like guided missiles, farming and other collectors like water have been replaced with poor mechanics that don't really work but still attract zombies like nothing else.  \n\nIt's all clearly to shift the game from a base building survival game to the generic skins-purchasing looter shooter, generic zombie game which can reach the broadest audiences, which has obviously worked so good for them.  \n\nThis isn't even getting into all the other bugs and problems they've never fixed or added in their constant reworks of the game.  They still have random zombie spawns in places they shouldn't be able to spawn, vehicles are a wild ride, there is still a weird lag on melee and zombie hit boxes that they've never bothered dealing with in over 10 years (one of the reasons why I prefer base building).",

It scrapped the good system it had before hand. The books are clunky and can skew loot so that you only get books you dont want. They scrapped the armour sets. The new ones are nice but they arnt what i expected. Sense 2.0 its removed clothing, eating, random spawn points and unique circumstances for every player. The storm system dosnt seem great and the bio system seems to be worse that the older versions (clothing and foods vs biome badges). They scrapped water jars instead you have to get the dew collectors which just feels dumb. The Jars were nice and useful. It just seems worse and worse to play now-adays. If you want to really progress at all you have to do the trader quests at all time. They taken out a lot of features i thought that were nice and now the game has changed from what i bought it for years ago. Now it just seems like quite a lot is implemented without great thought being put into it.\n\nAlso this game is not worth 45$ now and it wasnt back then. Its price should be lowered to 20$ or less.\n\nMoreover where the hell did you get the funding for bloodmoon? As far as I know, the only funding you had at the time to make the game came from 2 options. The money spent on this game during its beta and release, ment to be put towards THIS GAME, and its DLC which is debatable about where it goes but unltimatly its DLC for this game, and thus its revenue should also go towards THIS GAME, 7DTD.\n\nAlso where the ♥♥♥♥ is bandits? we have been waiting years, they have been promised in very uncoming version sense i got this game.

[/b] The core concept of a voxel-based zombie survival crafting game is brilliant, and for a long time, it delivered some truly memorable experiences. The issue is that the game I fell in love with is not the game it is today, and the developers (\"The Fun Pimps\") seem intent on a cycle of endless, often regressive, change rather than refinement.\n\n\tMy lack of recommendation comes down to one core problem: the developers constantly redesign fundamental systems from the ground up with almost every major update. Instead of building on existing mechanics, they scrap them entirely, forcing veteran players to re-learn a \"new\" game every single time. This isn't early access refinement; it's a lack of vision.\n\n    • [b] Scrapped Mechanics: [/b] We've seen multiple iterations of progression systems, from the \"learn by doing\" model to the current perk and magazine-based system. Each change feels like a sideways step, often removing depth and features that the community enjoyed (like empty jars or specific meat types) for no apparent reason other than change for change's sake.\n\n    • [b] Forced Playstyles: [/b] Recent updates have introduced systems like biome progression tied to loot stages, which can feel linear and removes the open-world freedom that was a hallmark of earlier alphas. Base designs and creative building approaches that players developed over time are often patched out, forcing specific, developer-approved play styles.\n\n    • [b] An \"Eternal Early Access\": [/b] After more than a decade in Early Access, the game still feels unpolished in many areas, while basic, long-promised features like bandits or robust NPC systems remain missing (though competently implemented by the modding community). The recent 1.0/2.0 updates have only amplified these frustrations, adding poorly implemented features like the annoying storm system that just waste time.\n\t\n     I got my money's worth, absolutely. But I cannot recommend 7 Days to Die in its current state, nor can I endorse the development philosophy. If you are looking for a stable, long-term survival experience that consistently builds on its foundations, this isn't it. The game is a revolving door of concepts, and you never know when the mechanics you enjoy will be completely removed in the next patch. The modding community truly keeps this game alive; without them, it would have died a long time ago.",

Let me explain my opinion.  In the beginning, it was an open map, you could built a fort in any biome (winter, desert, wasteland, forest).  The fort/base you built could be intricate or basic.  The building in this game was fantastic.  As each update occurred it became harder to survive as the zombies can now eat thru your strongest building blocks, there are now mythical creatures for zombies.  So in my opinion, the updates were more of an whoops date... whereas improvements should have been a tweak not an overhaul.

Its stupid and it doesnt belong in the game and they are EVERYWHERE! My last big complain is WHERE ARE THE BANDITS they promised a couple of years ago?  I mean, the game can still be fun, but it is not like before when you could have literally TONS of gameplay without even bothering to do any stupid quest, you could just roam free in the entire world.

Earlier builds of the game were more stable than their official release and actually had more survival and more peril. As we went through the alpha builds, I watched the game become less unique in what it was and felt like it was becoming more mainstream. It went from just pure survival, crafting and zombies to a zombie survival RPG game. That and instead of balancing things, they did the age old approach of \"lets just have the zombies hit harder.\" Yes, because every self respecting dev will 'make hit harder hurr durr'.\n\nThey made changes that were quite frankly, in poor taste. They can't really call this a released game and constantly fix bugs every week that somehow made it in. Don't rely on your community to fix your game; it's just going to push the community away. The base vanilla game is 7/10 at best. The lighting issues I have in the current versions are just so unavoidable by going back to the old lighting system. Bright as hell outside, you step inside and its pitch black (that's the new system).\n\nIf you want a challenge, and rewarding gameplay, seriously get a mod overhaul that fixes and expands on the game. Imagine this game to be a Bethesda game. It works, kinda, but the community fixes things and makes it better through mods. \n\nI'm not sure how many extra licks of paint you can give to a turd, but once the devs address the bugs and fix them *before* releasing or adding extra things, then heck, it'll be a \"yes, I recommend this.\" but for now, after 1200 hours, and the game become more unstable than the middle east, it's a no (unless you mod it).",

We still have no idea why we use Duke's when cash money exists in the game.
