Sadly I’ve never been able to finish Drakengard 1 or even play 2. I’ve seen walkthroughs at the very least so I know what happens in them I guess.\n\nI say all of that just so you know I’m obsessed with NieR. It is my favorite video game ever and this one feels the best to play. I like the post apocalyptic setting and story the most. I also have a soft spot for anything involving robots and androids (being a huge Ghost in the Shell fan). You can customize the characters in a ton of different ways to play however you want and there's nearly endless replay value. The music in this game is breathtaking. They created an entirely new language just for the soundtrack.\n\nI’ve played every single port of this game to 100% completion and have over 100 hours in all of them. The best version is the Xbox port which is called Game of the YoRHa edition or something. Runs smooth, amazing visuals, responsive and like zero glitches or oddities. PS4 and Switch are fine with Steam being the worst. Out of the box it runs and plays fine since they’ve updated a lot but there’s still just tiny bugs, glitches and irregularities scattered all throughout the game that hold it back from being preferable to the other ports. Unless you want to mod it or something.",

The gameplay, banger music in the background, and vast map you get to explore all work well to deliver the story of Nier Automata. \n\nFrom the moment I played the first 5 minutes of the game, I was hooked in and only wanted to progress further into the game and learn more about the world of our protagonists 2B and 9S. The game does a great job at fleshing out its characters and what drives them to push forward. So much so that I even found myself getting attached to many of the game's cast and was incredibly pained when anything negative occurred in the story. \n\nFrom what I've noticed, this game goes on sale quite often so if you asked me if you should play this work of art, then I'd say yes, and that it will be worth every dollar(or whatever form of currency u use, idk I'm an American)",

      "review": "NieR Automata is an interesting mix of JRPG and hack n’ slash combat courtesy of Platinum Games. The narrative is about androids fighting back robots on a post-apocalyptic earth in the name of humanity. The sci-fi dystopia setting is interesting and backed up by an incredible soundtrack which creates some truly magical moments. The gameplay mixes 3rd party action with RPG and Shmup elements that are frequently interspersed with lengthy, sometimes philosophical cutscenes. The semi open world features a handful of interesting locations which you will visit a few times too often for my taste and which can sometimes be a little bit annoying to navigate. The game is designed to be completed three times with each playthrough offering a different gameplay focus and providing additional information about the backstory. While this is an interesting approach, I think it would have been more effective and powerfulI if Nier: Automata had been more compact or structured differently. Instead, it’s a great idea stretched across too many hours of repeating content. Despite these flaws it is still a game that is absolutely worth your time which is as slick to play as it is oddly Japanese.",

It's a masterpiece in symbolic, artistic and philosophical ways. \n\nThe music can not be praised enough - each soundtrack fits its respective scene so well. The fact that it's sung in a made-up \"Chaos Language\" adds to the dystopian feel of the game, as if it's a lost, ancient language that's evolved over thousands of years to become unrecognisable. I find myself listening to it even years after completing the game. \n\nFew video games have made me grow so attached to its characters and story. Automata was an unforgettable experience.

I'm probably in the minority, but I thought the C/D paths weren't as strong as A/B.  And the way ending E was hyped up I thought it was an entire path of its own, so I was a little disappointed.  Overall it is a really fun game once you figure out the combat and chip systems.  I like the ambition of combining Shmup, Hack n Slash, and RPG.  The map is still terrible though even after you get used to it.  They even make a meta joke in game about it.  Lastly of course the OST is awesome.

After long contemplation I have concluded that you should just flip a coin to decide which one to play first imo. Or whichever one is cheapest.\n\n[list]\n[*] Automatas gameplay is fun. Weapon combos are cool and the movesets are really fun and flashy. By far more fun and interesting in every way compared to Replicant, spear moveset got nerfed big time though :(\n[*] Soundtrack is amazing and probably one of the best OSTs in gaming, period.\n[*] I love the games HUD and how it intergrates with the rest of the game while keeping immersion.\n[*] You have to play multiple times to get all endings but it does it actually good this time and is definitely worth it to do. Including joke endings was a fun idea too.\n[*] Map traversal is good and not a pain in the ass.\n[*] Characters and story are amazing, the story of 9S is especially good. However I personally enjoy Replicant more here.\n[*] 2B\n[*] I nearly cried multiple times once again. I was screaming at my screen when the final credits rolled.\n[/list]\n\nIf youre going into this thinking this is just the gooner game, then you are only half correct. \nAutomata is eaily one of the best video games of all time. Everything from gameplay to graphics to story is very well done and improved greatly the formula that Replicant established.\n\nNines/10\nPls put Reincarnation on steam Yoko Taro",

      "review": "NieR: Automata isn’t just a game — it’s an existential punch wrapped in beautiful music, stylish combat, and a constant feeling of “wait, what exactly is happening?”. In general, the game mixes hack-and-slash combat, bullet hell, visual novel sections, RPG progression, hacking minigames, and a story that gradually dismantles your emotions piece by piece.\n\nAt the center of everything stands 2B, a calm and elegant combat android who somehow became the global mascot of game collaborations. Seriously — 2B is like the Elon Musk of crossovers: everywhere, unstoppable, and probably doesn’t sleep. Mobile games, MMOs, even games that have absolutely nothing to do with cyber-dystopian androids… they all want her. And honestly, can we blame them?\nBeautiful design + tragic story + iconic eye mask = collaboration gold.\n\nBut if 2B’s popularity keeps her face in front of the world, it’s the game itself that keeps people talking years later.\n\nWhen you finish NieR: Automata (and I mean finish finish — all the major endings), something strange happens. The game stays with you. A song suddenly plays — Keiichi Okabe's “City Ruins / Rays of Light / Weight of the World” — and instantly your brain jumps back to the ruins, the mechanical desert village, the abandoned amusement park glowing with artificial joy. Even if you don’t remember every detail, you remember how it felt.\n\nThe melancholic world.\nThe weight of questions like “what is the meaning of living?”\nThe way 2B always holds herself together… except when she doesn’t.\n\nAnd then there’s 9S.\nSweet, curious, adorable 9S.\nWe all start thinking “aww, precious boy” and end up going “oh no… please don’t suffer anymore.”\nThis game does not hesitate to emotionally stab you a little. Then again. And again.\n\nThe story starts simple — machines vs. androids — and slowly evolves into something philosophical, uncomfortable, and strangely hopeful. The game never gives perfect answers; it just makes you feel too much while searching for them.\n\nWhat surprised me most (aside from the emotional damage) were the small details:\n\nThe way even side quests have meaning.\n\nThe visual shifts between 3D action, 2D hacking, and side-scrolling platforming.\n\nThe fact that even the credits can turn into gameplay.\n\nThe idea that sometimes… kindness is a radical act.\n\nAnd those final endings?\nYou think you’re prepared.\nYou are not prepared.\n\nEven after years, just a few notes of Okabe’s music can pull me straight back into that world.\n2B. 9S. A2.\nThe desolate city.\nThat hollow feeling in the chest.\n\nEternal NieR. Forget NieR.\n2B to 9S no koto.\n\n— Yori, Machine Lifeform (still recovering emotionally)",

The soundtrack alone could carry the entire experience; it’s haunting in a way that stays with you long after you stop playing. And even with the little I’ve seen of the story, it’s clear that it’s something deeper than just an action RPG. Every character, every mission, every small detail seems to mean something.\n\nThe gameplay shifts constantly — one moment you’re in fast-paced hack-and-slash combat, the next you’re in a top-down shooter or a side-scrolling platformer — and somehow it all works together seamlessly.

Why should I not take a hit just because I roll on the ground?\nI wanted a fast paced game like Sekiro but not the ridicolusnes of 1000 kills in mousu genre games like Dynasty Warriors.\n\nPros:\n→ Small 2D Gunship battles like arcade games: 1943 and more.\n→ Small 3D Terminator/Armored Core battles which are also very cool.\n→ Many 3D levels turn into 2.5D and it's much more fun to play that way and it keeps changing very quickly.\n→ I am barely 30mins into the game and I have already figured out so many ways of combat without the game actually telling me so.\n→ Giant boss battles which are pretty good.\n→ Loved the quick dodge, still have to figure out the combat, a lot of things to go.\n\nQuirks/Cons:\n→  Game can be saved after around 45mins of gameplay. Will be around 1 hour if you keep dying.\n\nHaving a sexy protagonist really hurt this game as everyone who shared stuff about this game focused on the naked female body which I dearly admire, but this game should have just put in the Fable-in game model and then people might have realized what a fucking cool game this is. That being said, I am not complaining about the model one bit because you will never notice what your protagonist is wearing because you will be focused on the battle at had.\n\nTo Update Later:\n1) It feels like a mouse and keyboard game just due to the targeting system but I am giving this a try on gamepads only as I want to actually play this via Steam Link with external gamepad.",

Everyone else might have trouble appreciating it for what it is.\n\nNier: Automata isn't the flawless masterpiece that a lot of people seem to claim it is, but it is a damn good 9/10 for me. Most of its problems lie in the fact that its combat and exploration are frankly boring as hell, but the story, world building, and characters are insanely good.\n\nIt starts off by wasting the player's time with meaningless fetch quests and \"go here, kill x\" quests, and I have no idea why these could be here other than because of some boneheaded executive's decision to pad out the game's length. They shouldn't have ever been included and the game suffers for their existence. The game does a lot of similar stuff throughout playthroughs that feels like it exists to artificially extend playtime, and I was not a fan of it considering how middling the actual gameplay can often be.\n\nWhat all of this means is that you end up with an okay game with a story that takes too long to ramp up, and I think a lot of people will ultimately drop the game before it \"gets good\". I was enjoying myself overall, but it wasn't until the ~10 hour mark that I found myself extremely invested. And wow, was that ever worth it.\n\nUnfortunately it is impossible to talk about my favourite parts of the game without spoiling major parts of it. What I can say is that I am absolutely shocked this kind of game ever got funded. Games with these sorts of themes are usually only ever indies that don't have the financial backing to fully realize their ambition, but Nier: Automata *does* have that kind of funding, and I think the end result is one of the most unique experiences in video games period.\n\nOverall did not expect to love it nearly as much as I did, and I'm extremely glad I had a friend convince me to play this. I will not forget about this game for a long, long time.",

      "review": "Okay. This game is exceptional, truly outstanding, worth playing if you have interest in experiencing the best of video-gaming, there's no experience quite like this one, but... with a fairly heavy caveat (and one or two more minor ones). Let me break it down like this.\r\n\r\nRoute A - 8/10\r\nRoute B - 1/10\r\nEverything after - 10/10\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the game rolls credits after Route A, so it's easy to feel like it's a pretty good experience and little else will come from restarting a run. Route B I feel definitely should have been edited down. I personally pushed through the drag of this against my better judgement. The structure of the game in this way definitely leaves something to be desired - it could have just been one story that split off into two with the 9S/A2 section in the second half, imo. Credits rolls a few times and there is a title card drop somewhere in the middle of the game, for some reason. I think around when the tower appears during Route C/D.\r\n\r\nThe crafting/economy/upgrades area of things is also quite weak. In regular play, I don't think I got enough for one upgrade for my pods the entire time, and maybe only one or two for the starting sword. It's not a game that lends itself to knowing where this or that stripped screw or rusted bolt or whatever is farmed, it all blends into one. Economically, as it's skewed toward healing being too cheap, the game is generally on the easier side, because you can always just use a medium recovery for 50% of your health back, and they cost you fairly little in the context of the game. Fish are also probably too good a source of dollarydoos. I was only killed a few times in my playthrough, when an outlier enemy who hit for way too much would suddenly catch you twice in the space of one second - outside of that, nothing posed too much of a threat. They didn't really plan for deaths and how much that would set you back it seems, because it sometimes puts you back several minutes of running across the map - because sometimes they grey out a certain location you can teleport to, because reasons. read: because the devs want to railroad you.)\r\n\r\nI will also quickly say that the game is a bit ham-fisted/inelegant/a little on the nose with its conveyance of the themes of machines having consciousness and sentience and such. Sometimes it feels a little like it could have been handled with more care when storyboarding the game. But in equal measure, there are truly profound moments that balance those out plenty, and make the game a really worthy experience.\r\n\r\nOnto the good:\r\n-The character design, world design, architecture, etc in the visual department, all pretty amazing. 2B and A2 are pretty heavily sexualised in their models, a bit distracting, but it is what it is.\r\n-The game is pretty 'anime' in it's setpiece design. Meaning, DBZ, or something - i dunno, i'm not huge on anime. But there's big setpieces and mechs and stuff. It's cool.\r\n-The audio - music and sfx - is pretty excellent. You'll know it as soon as you get to the resistance camp. One of the female vocalists who sings in the forest kingdom area is like... whiny sounding though? A bit grating. Other than that, it's a 9 or 10/10 OST. Not the kind of thing you'll be playing in everyday life much, but serves its purpose in the game exceptionally\r\n-The voice acting and writing also is generally really, really good. \r\n-The shot direction is often great\r\n-The character animations particularly in combat, although I find the combat from a gameplay perspective to be a bit lacking. Fun if you like hack and slash stuff, but I personally like a bit more of a balanced challenge like a dark souls game, where there's measurements of time between swings and windows and such. This just felt like mindlessly pressing the slash button sometimes. And 9S' hacking combat wears thin fairly fast as well. A really great spin on a hacking mini game, but yeah, wears thin if the entire combat experience is just hacking mini games (in Route B, and C/D, whichever is 9S')\r\n\r\nThe game does some really cool things like having a 'boss' be beaten by not attacking and the ending credits thing - taking the one currency the player has put into the game, their time, and asking if they'll trade it to the aid of others, without thanks.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is poorly formatted and whatever, but this game starts good, gets bad, and then gets great. Basically that's it. If you're interested in anime, or hack and slash stuff, or philosophy, or the best video games have to offer, then i'd put this one on the list. It's a bit of a drag at times, but I promise the second half of the game is a pretty epic time. Had it all been tightened up to that same standard, it would be an easy 9 or 10/10 game for me, despite the combat being kind of lacking in actual balance and challenge. As it stands, I can only rank the three main sections of the game, A, B, and C/D/E, seperately as I did at the start. Definitely a true accomplishment in the realm of videogames, but not without fault. Still, play this game. Honestly, if you haven't played games and wanted one to get a sense of what they can be capable of, this might be a good single game to play. Great stuff, PlatinumGames.",

It takes a while for the game to open up but it's worth sticking through. I liked that I could take a relatively hands off approach to combat as it was not a huge draw for me personally, and though hacking was fun it was a bit laborious for me later on. Though the game did not grip me completely, I would say it is very much worth to play through as the high acclaim for the game is not misplaced. There is some element, some attachment for everyone.",

      "review": "\"Some games entertain you for a while — this one stays with you forever.\"\n\nWhat I Loved:\nWhat I love about NieR Automata is how personal it feels. It’s not just about finishing a quest or defeating an enemy — it’s about the quiet moments, the strange beauty, and the emotional weight that sneaks up on you. It’s a game that lingers in your mind long after you stop playing.\n\nThe World:\nThe world is both beautiful and melancholic — vast fields, small villages, crumbling ruins, and mysterious shores. It feels like every location has a story behind it, even if it’s never told directly. There’s a sense of history and loss woven into every area you visit.\n\nThe Combat:\nCombat is fast, fluid, and blends swordplay with powerful magic. It’s easy to pick up but has enough room to experiment with combos, weapon types, and spells. It’s not overly complex, but it feels satisfying and responsive throughout.\n\nThe Soundtracks:\nThe soundtrack is nothing short of breathtaking. Every track feels handcrafted to fit its moment — whether it’s a quiet melody during a peaceful walk or a sweeping score in the middle of battle. It’s emotional, haunting, and easily one of the game’s strongest points. Including one song out of the whole playlist, Kaine / Salvation.\n\nVerdict:\nNieR Replicant is a unique and memorable experience that takes its time unfolding. While the pacing can be slow and not every quest will grab your attention, the game’s atmosphere, characters, and music create something special. It’s the kind of story that quietly grows on you the more you play, leaving you with moments you’ll remember well after you’ve put the controller down. It may not appeal to everyone, but for those who connect with it, it’s an unforgettable journey worth taking.\n\n“We’re not so different, you and I. We both just want to live our lives in peace.” – Kaine",

Just mash shit until something cool happens and you go \"Wait how the fuck do I do that again??\"\n- Game will randomly switch between a Top down, Sidescroller, and freecam between areas without warning.\n- Enemy designs are boring. Literal cylinders and balls boring. \n- Combat is seriously repetitive. Move to this area and fight more of the same enemies you were just fighting earlier so you can move to the next area and fight those exact same motherfuckers again.\n- Somehow being able to see the female protag's high definition ass 80% of the time is critical to the plot.\n\n\n\nI would refund this game in a heartbeat if I didn't get the GOTY edition for 60% off.

I can't recommend it for the following reasons:\n\n1) the game is level gated, not skill gated.\n\nIf you're level 35 and up against level 45 enemies, you'll get thromped. Come back at level 45 and you'll dominate. Perhaps that's as it should be. But why does it happen? Your HP, armor, and damage output hasn't changed THAT much. Your tactics haven't changed. Only your level has. The game appears to artificially cap your real damage by some factor differential between your level and your enemy level. The only reason that level 45 enemy was so tough at level 35 was because you nerfed my damage. I'm not hitting 10x harder at level 45.\n\n2) the game doesn't respect your time. \n\nThere's a LOT of backtracking and rehashing the same areas. New quests are presented that force you to go back to the same areas over and over and over again. Many quests are multi-stage, but they require time to pass between completing one stage and starting the next. That means, you guessed it, you have to leave and come back. Once I even found boxes containing \"useless\" items that I couldn't pick up. I told myself, \"If I have to come back here to get this %#$ later because a quest needs this item I'm gonna be very upset. Yes, that immediately happened.\n\n3) formulaic plot: \n\nLots of pseudo-philosophical gibberish on the meaning of life and free will, etc. can a machine be alive, etc. I've heard from those who have completed that game that it's a great plot and maybe it is when done, but I just can't see it happening.",

On a similar note, travel in this game is extremely inconvenient at best. The combat is shallow and very easy.

Leaving the game in the tutorial is just as bad as dying, being restarting the game from the very beginning.\n- Started on Controller, controls are wacky. Moved to mouse and keyboard, controls are still weird as shit.\n- Combat is combo based. There is no combo guide that I could find. Just mash shit until something cool happens and you go \"Wait how the fuck do I do that again??\"\n- Game will randomly switch between a Top down, Sidescroller, and freecam between areas without warning.\n- Enemy designs are boring. Literal cylinders and balls boring. \n- Combat is seriously repetitive. Move to this area and fight more of the same enemies you were just fighting earlier so you can move to the next area and fight those exact same motherfuckers again.\n- Somehow being able to see the female protag's high definition ass 80% of the time is critical to the plot.\n\n\n\nI would refund this game in a heartbeat if I didn't get the GOTY edition for 60% off.

I can't recommend it for the following reasons:\n\n1) the game is level gated, not skill gated.\n\nIf you're level 35 and up against level 45 enemies, you'll get thromped. Come back at level 45 and you'll dominate. Perhaps that's as it should be. But why does it happen? Your HP, armor, and damage output hasn't changed THAT much. Your tactics haven't changed. Only your level has. The game appears to artificially cap your real damage by some factor differential between your level and your enemy level. The only reason that level 45 enemy was so tough at level 35 was because you nerfed my damage. I'm not hitting 10x harder at level 45.\n\n2) the game doesn't respect your time. \n\nThere's a LOT of backtracking and rehashing the same areas. New quests are presented that force you to go back to the same areas over and over and over again. Many quests are multi-stage, but they require time to pass between completing one stage and starting the next. That means, you guessed it, you have to leave and come back. Once I even found boxes containing \"useless\" items that I couldn't pick up. I told myself, \"If I have to come back here to get this %#$ later because a quest needs this item I'm gonna be very upset. Yes, that immediately happened.\n\n3) formulaic plot: \n\nLots of pseudo-philosophical gibberish on the meaning of life and free will, etc. can a machine be alive, etc. I've heard from those who have completed that game that it's a great plot and maybe it is when done, but I just can't see it happening.",

At least I assume you should shoot at that ball which shoots at you(?) because if I take 0 damage in that minigame I still take damage outside. Very confusing and annoying.\n\nMIght come back to this in a couple of years but for now I don't want to continue playing.\nA shame really :(",

I am told that this is a game that you have to play more than once to really \"get it\" and I am going to give it a shot.\n\nRecommended.\n\nNow we just have to hope it plays nice with my hardware.\n\nSwitching review from positive to negative.  Needing to finish a whole game multiple times to see the whole game is stupid.  I like the plot but the actual moment to moment game play gets stale.  \n\nI have been playing it for the last 2 nights after not touching it for years.  It's fun but it's just not that compelling to revisit.  I cannot imagine how badly this would overstay it's welcome if I was one of those people going for all 5 endings.\n\nRemember.  No matter how pretty it is it's a JRPG and most of the side quests amount to fetch quests or going somewhere and killing a mob.\n\nlots and lots and lots and lots of tapping b to pick stuff up.  Stuff that you would never have a reason to leave behind.  Needs autopickup.",

Also the fighting is strange, you never really feel like you're controlling the character.\nI love the way it looks and the story seems interesting. It's just not fun enough to keep playing long enough for me to get through it.\nI really want to love this game, but I don't.",

I sincerely can't remember anything about it, some androids fighting some robots and mandatory rebels wanted something too.\nOthers praised the OST but it was so annoying I actually set music volume to 0. Do not put repetitive vocal music in the background and if you do, DO NOT choose one with whining singer (Desert).\nFighting in general is fine but holy f boss fights are a hot mess. Screen is full dozens of particle effects and whatnot and I've no idea where's 2B, or which one of those light circles in the midst of chaos is 2B. Also over half of the dialog is during the boss combat! You seriously think I've time to listen then? \n\nWell I'm a simple man and I came for the graphics and at least I got good graphics.",
