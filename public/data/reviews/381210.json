      "review": "⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nThere is a lot that can be said about this game, both negative and positive. Firstly, I do enjoy it very much. As a huge horror fan, this game and all it's collabs is something we might have dreamed about as kids but would have never thought it could be reality. There is no other game where you can play as Freddy Krueger and hunt Resident Evil's Leon Kennedy who is working together with Stranger Thing's Steve Harrington. There is no other game where you can play as Rick Grimes and attempt to escape from the Xenomorph or any other wild mix up you can think of. For that I must commend the developers not only for really making this happen but also for making it a generally pretty fun game and continuing to support and add content to it. \n\nThe gameplay is very easy to learn but hard to master as all games should be. Personally I think playing as the killer role is significantly more difficult and frustrating than the survivor role as most of the game's mechanics seem to be centered around giving the survivors the best chances of escape possible but that is a topic of ongoing debate and contention with the community and I don't really want to dive into it here.\n\nSpeaking of the community, I've been playing online competitive games since I was old enough to hold a controller and I have to say, Dead By Daylight might hold the record for having one of the most toxic player bases I've ever come across. And this is coming from someone who has played CoD for most of my life. There is a lot of tea bagging, taunting and just overall BM in both the game itself and in the post game chat. Not a lot of good sportsmanship happening here. Sore losers and sore winners. \n\nAll that being said, if you can ignore the occasional toxicity and not get too hung up on your losses as you learn to improve and adapt to whatever balancing issues there may be on either side, this game can be really fun. It has a large variety of maps, survivors, killers with unique abilities, perks, tools and addons to customize your loadout that make each match unique and keep the game feeling fresh for a long time. It's easy to see why Dead By Daylight has lasted so long in a genre where all of it's competitors usually die off within a couple years. \n\nDespite it's flaws Dead By Daylight has quickly become my favourite online, competitive title. I mean, a game where you can pick your favorite horror character and try to survive or kill the survivors? How could any horror fan pass that up? It's way too cool of a concept.",

      "review": "Dead by Daylight is an asymmetric 4v1 horror game where one killer hunts four survivors trying to escape. Released in 2016, the game has grown massively with new characters, maps, and collaborations.\r\n\r\nStory\r\nThe narrative centers around “The Entity,” a supernatural force that traps both killers and survivors in endless trials. Each character has a backstory, but the main plot is intentionally fragmented, giving the game a mysterious, haunting atmosphere.\r\n\r\nGameplay\r\nSurvivors must repair generators, avoid the killer, rescue teammates, and open exit gates. It’s all about stealth, teamwork, and decision-making. Killers, on the other hand, must track survivors, use unique powers, and sacrifice them to The Entity. Matches are tense, unpredictable, and often chaotic, which is part of the charm — and frustration. The learning curve is steep on both sides, but rewarding once you understand perks, loops, and mindgames.\r\n\r\nGraphics\r\nThe visuals have been significantly improved over the years. Maps are atmospheric, lighting is solid, and the killer designs are detailed and intimidating. Still, animations can feel stiff, and some textures look dated, especially compared to newer horror titles.\r\n\r\nMusic & Sound\r\nThe soundtrack fits the tone: eerie, minimalistic, and tension-driven. Chase music varies per killer and adds personality to each encounter. Audio cues are crucial — footsteps, grunts, and terror radius all shape the gameplay experience.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nDead by Daylight isn’t perfect: it has balance issues, occasional bugs, and a sometimes harsh matchmaking system. But despite its flaws, it remains one of the most unique and replayable horror multiplayer games available. Its tension, variety, and unpredictability keep players coming back.\r\n\r\nScore: 8/10",

      "review": "This is a problematic review in so far as the game it self is fun/enjoyable as both a survivor and as a killer (caveat that I play both and do so with randoms only -- no pre-made teams by design).\n\nThe balance in the game is questionable. Depending on skill levels, perks, which killer, which map and which map iteration etc. the balance can be substantively skewed to one faction or another. This is, largely, intrinsic to the game.\n\nThe studio, as a general rule, does not seem to actually listen to the player base and often does streams espousing various metrics as the basis for their decision making processes. However, the neutrality of the data collection and it's interpretation is highly suspect (the last survey had a single section for killer input with the rest of the survey -- being survivor centric only). If I make a survey for for a school which asks the question \"Do you want to get out of school 60 minutes early every day?\" It would be highly likely that the majority would vote yes. However, if it was not disclosed that, in getting out early every day, that all school sports would be cancelled as there would no longer be sufficient time in the day to conduct them, then the poll results would likely change as the question would no longer be misleading.\n\nMisleading data collection skews the data. A desired outcome, when present prior to data analysis, skews said analysis. Behaviour Interactive seems to have a long history of making data fit their desired narative. This is, at best, disingenuous and tone deaf.\n\nThe questionable paradigm of Behaviour Interactive Inc. notwithstanding the other major issue with Dead by Daylight is the community.\n\nThere is substantive toxicity here -- both as survivours and as killers. There are times that Dead by Daylight could readily give Rust a run for it's money in the toxicity category. There are many good players as well -- helpful, polite et al. Good teamwork and skilled killers. There are also a great number of individuals who seem to be overcompensating for diminutive genitalia (irrespective of age, gender or socio-economic status).\n\nThis is a good game with a good community and an above average demographic of very \"LOUD\" toxic players.\n\nIs this game worth a buy -- when things are on sale yes.\n\nGet what interests you and then get what is borderline via free in game currency (you get shards as you level up and can unlock many things for free beyond the time spent playing to get to that point). Do not, however, buy this title expecting every run to be amiable -- people will rub you the wrong way with above average regularity and the development team will frustrate  you with bias and tone-deaf responses the majority of the time.\n\nThumbs up overall but with caveats.",

On one hand, the gameplay loop is very easy to understand and the Perks system allows for a lot of self expression. On the other hand, the complexity of the Perks system means that the real difficulty curve is memorizing the hundreds of Perks and how they interact. And with 300 Perks so far, as well as each Killer having their own unique bag of tricks separate from Perks, the bar continues to up for what you are expected to know to succeed in the long term.\n\nThe community around DbD has always been very intense. When I first began playing in 2020, my more experienced friends told stories about old tricks and exploits, the famous players and the infamous, their hates and their loves. People care very much about this game, and I find it comforting to know that the developers have taken the very intense criticisms they've received over the years with grace.\n\nDbD content creators have done a fantastic job showcasing the entire spectrum of play, from goofy one-trick builds to super serious shutout builds. Dead by Daylight is also very stream-friendly, and I regularly run into players streaming live during my games. I find DbD to be the most fun with friends, and running into friendly players and having a good laugh is often the highlight of my play sessions.\n\nDead by Daylight could have crashed and burned years ago if the DbD community and the developers stayed on different pages, but in recent months I've begun to feel that the devs and community are more in sync than ever before.

To start with I appreciate there's simple killers like The huntress and more complex ones for any kind of playstyle. My gripe with killers tho is how the devs seem too lazy to fix any that don't work anymore or can't keep up with metas for example Pig and Sadako. I also don't appreciate the matchmaking giving me a prestige 20 player in my fifth game ever so it seems like the matchmaking is completely random which I understand may deter or frustrate some people from the game. But other than those two things I've enjoyed learning the game so far and hope to stay for a while. Overall 8/10",

I used to play Friday The 13th up until its legal troubles and this game filled that void. I especially like how competitive this game is and what it has to offer, other horror games generally are a pick up a few times for me, but DBD gives meaning and purpose to wanting to improve at it. DBD also isn't limited to one specific horror character when other games typically focus on one. You could argue the gameplay can get repetitive, but I find myself enjoying the different killers approaches in changing the gameplay dynamics. As a horror fan, I approve. \r\n\r\nTip: Get the perk from the chainsaw killer that makes you immune to flashlights, you can apply it to different killers. Have fun!",

      "review": "What works — What’s good about Dead by Daylight (2025)\n\nStill a very popular and active game. DBD recently hit a new all-time high in concurrent Steam players during the 2025 “Twisted Masquerade” event — an indicator that the game remains alive and many people still enjoy it. \n\nAsymmetric horror concept remains engaging. The core idea — one Killer vs. four Survivors — still delivers strong tension, scares, and unique multiplayer horror vibes. Many enjoy the thrill of the chase or the survivor’s fight to escape. \n\n\nVariety in killers, survivors, customization and content. There’s still a broad roster of killers and survivors, with different play-styles and perks. This variety lets players find what suits them: stealthy survivor, aggressive killer, support survivors, etc. \n\n\nGood atmosphere and horror-game feel. For players who like horror/mystery and the fear-escape vibe, DBD delivers with sound design, tension, unpredictable matches, and horror-themed elements that still hold up. \n\n\nCross-platform and social experience (for groups/friends). Playing with friends can make the game much more fun and entertaining, increasing the replayability when you’re with people you know.\n\nWhat’s bad — Problems, frustrations and weaknesses (2025)\n\nSevere balance issues and “killer-sided” gameplay. Many players in 2025 complain that the game is heavily skewed in favor of the Killer. Survivors often feel they have little chance unless teammates cooperate flawlessly. > “Killers are OP … I win as a survivor maybe every 1 out of 10 games.” \n\nToxic community & unfair play behaviors (tunneling, camping, slugging, rage-quitting). A recurring complaint is that some killers (or their teammates) exploit mechanics like tunneling or slugging, or camp hooks, making matches miserable for survivors. Many survivors report zero wins over long sessions because of this imbalance. \n\n\nBugs, glitches, crashes, and technical issues — sometimes game won’t even launch. There are multiple 2025 player reports (PC/Steam) about the game failing to launch or crashing mid-match, even after reinstalling, verifying files, or updating drivers. > “Dead By daylight will not start … the splash screen appears and … then DBD never opens.” \n\n\nMatchmaking problems, long queues / lobbies with few players, slow or unfair matches. Some players say that finding matches (especially as Killer) can take ages, or that matchmaking mixes inexperienced survivors with over-powered killers — making games unbalanced by default. \nBefore You Buy\n\n\nDevelopers’ focus on new content / monetization over balance or fixing core issues. Many users feel that while new killers, cosmetics or DLCs arrive regularly, the core problems — balance, bugs, community toxicity — remain largely unaddressed. \n\n\nSteep learning curve / frustration for new or casual players. Because of complexity (many perks, mechanics, varied killers, high skill gap), new players may find it hard to enjoy or survive. This increases frustration and reduces enjoyment, especially when matched against experienced players or unbalanced opponents.\n\nMy 2025 take — Who DBD works for (and who it doesn’t)\n\nI’d say DBD in 2025 works best if:\n\nYou and at least a few friends play together (so that you can coordinate and avoid some of the “toxic matchmaking” randomness).\n\nYou like horror-games, the thrill of asymmetric multiplayer, and enjoy playing as Killer (or are okay with tough Survivor games).\n\nYou accept that the game is messy at times — bugs, queue times, balance problems — but still enjoy the unpredictability and social horror vibe.\n\nIt’s less ideal if:\n\nYou mostly play solo, especially as a Survivor — you’ll likely face repeated frustration and unfair matches.\n\nYou dislike toxic players, unfair mechanics (camping, tunneling), or random losing streaks.\n\nYou expect smooth, polished experiences and balanced gameplay for both sides.",

Some people enjoy Dead By Daylight.\n\nIf you can get past the awful new player experience, the insane DLC pricing, the INSANE amount of sheer shit you have to know about with the perks, addons, killer powers and the intricacies of how they work with survivors...\n\nThe game is rather enjoyable...most of the time.\n\nSometimes when you play survivor you get tunneled right out of the match in 2 minutes flat. Other times you are simply not going to win because you brought let's say...a healing perk build against a Plague and now you are shit out of luck. Or you simply just haven't forked over enough cash for a licensed survivor that has an insanely meta perk that (if you are free to play) you just are never going to have unless you roll a D20 on the shrine of secrets to get it (it's only going to get worse as the perk pool gets more and more diluted with each new DLC)\n\nOkay so you are a new player. You just got tunneled out of the match in the first 5 minutes of the last 3 games. This is partially a skill issue, partially your teammates, and partially because you simply just have no access to the perks in the game.\n\nYou evidently get frustrated and say \"Fuck it. I'm playing killer.\"\n\nHex: Cock and Ball torture has now activated.\n\nFirst, you have the same issue with killer as you do survivor. No access to meta or good perks, only a handful of the killers to play as (two of which, The Trapper and The Wraith are quite bad but are reasonably easy to pick up and play. The bright side? you also get access to two of the best killers in the game, that being the Nurse and the Hillbilly. The Problem? hard as fuck to play.)\n\nSo now you have the dilemma of picking up an insanely hard killer to play like Nurse or an easier killer like Trapper and get dunked on the entire match. Not good.\n\nBut here's where the REAL shit goes up the creek.\n\nNow you have to have an adept knowledge of over 40 maps, know what killers are good on what maps, pray to the gods above you get a good variation of the map you are playing.\n\nSometimes you just get a blight game on Lery's memorial institute and you just gotta relax your throat and make eye contact. Other times you will get a huntress game on haddonfield and you are hit with pure euphoria. You'll come to learn that the entire game is a roll of the dice on killer.\n\nOh? you want to try a new killer and don't know what you're doing? BAM survive with friends 4 stack playing like they are in Fortnite world cup 2019 finals. All meta perks, 3 gens done before you get a down, everyone spamming flashlights like they are playing Alan Wake or something. Pallet Town from Pokemon FireRed decides to manifest in ALL of your games playing as killer. You are taking more wood to the face than Bonnie Blue on a Saturday night.\n\nOh and god help you if you want to main a killer you like but is bellow B tier. You basically hand survivors free games if they are remotely coordinated. It's feast or famine playing killer.\n\nYou either die a Ghost Face main or live long enough to see yourself become a Nurse or Blight main.\n\nI can keep going but the entity is pulling me back into the fog for my nightly dose of cock and ball torture.\n\nI hate playing Dead By Daylight, It's awesome.",

      "review": "Dead by Daylight is not an easy or beginner-friendly game by any means. The biggest flaw? It desperately needs an updated tutorial and practice mode. New players have no way to rehearse basic skills like flashlight saves, flash bangs, loops, or facing specific killers. In custom matches, you can only fight bot survivors as killer—never the other way around.\n\nI’ve introduced this game to several friends; 90% quit within their first week. The learning curve is brutal and full of odd mechanics (like having to line up exactly 90° for a fast vault). After nearly a decade, the same issues remain—tunneling and slugging still dominate matches, making the solo experience miserable. Solo queue players are punished by design, since survivors can’t communicate beyond basic gestures (“come here” or “follow me”).\n\nThe developers seem to prioritize new content over stability, balance, or beginner accessibility. The business cycle feels predictable: announce a new killer, generate hype, attract new buyers, they realize how unforgiving the game is—and then they leave.\n\nA notable example I would like to point out is Dead by Daylight hasn’t been forced to evolve for nearly 10 years due to lack of major sustainable competition. Until Behaviour Interactive adds quality-of-life features that support new and solo players, I can’t recommend this game to anyone starting fresh.\n\nVerdict: Great concept, deeply flawed execution. 6/10 for veterans, 2/10 for newcomers \n\n [Overall]: Not recommended",

It is a 1 killer vs 4 survivors and the most effective strategy as a killer is to take one of the survivors out of the game as soon as possible so it becomes a 1v3 . But hooking the same survivor 3 times in a row is called ''tunneling'' and if you do what's best for you as a killer you will get insulted in the end game chat lobby. But if they all escape you also get laughed at, called ''baby killer'' and survivors always have something negative to say at the end of the match. In my opinion the most outrageous is the survivor perk ''Windows of Opportunity'' which lets them see all the pallets and windows around them and makes them plan the loops way easier so it's like having a hack. Not to mention that recently they ''balanced'' the pallets density by adding even more on the maps and leaving no ''dead zones''. The game is also infested with LGBT flags because the devs had the brilliant idea to break the immersion of the game by letting survivors hang flags from their belt and killers hang flags from the hooks.

The devs are going far out, above and beyond, to ensure that the poor and helpless survivors don't feel \"bullied\" or are \"having a bad time\". They have an entire exit/uninstall survey, that specifically asks why SURVIVORS have left the game, there isn't a single option to select that accounts for a point of frustration for killers. It is blatantly obvious and clear for all to see, that Behavior CLEARLY values one side over the other. It isn't refutable at this point, there is no denying it in any way, shape, or form. Punish the killers for playing. It's genuinely sad to see, all because Behavior makes money off of shit like Sable bikini goon skin, so they must cater to that demographic at the expense of everyone else.

Being able to queue as killer and play as survivor while you wait is probably the best feature they have implemented, which is surprising even to myself to say. All in all, I know there will be people who disagree with me because they have played survivor since day 1 and see loops in their sleep or killers who cant get a kill without sitting on your ass and waiting to tunnel you out at the first instance they get, and you know that is awesome and all, but this review isn't for them. This review if for the Devs and the people who are still on the fence about getting this game, even after all these years. \r\n\r\nWhat all that being said, Do I recommend this game to people. No, I really don't. You can find some fun in it at times, but the Con's severely outweigh the Pro's.",

I've spent more hours suffering in LoL than I have any other negative experience in my life. I recently escaped my addiction, and somehow replaced it with something worse.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for game that is well-maintained, run by a competent developer team, then I would recommend League of Legends before DBD. BHVR have proven time and time again that they do not play their game, and do not actively give a damn about the player base's opinions. This developer team spends more time apologizing to their community than dedicating time to playing the game. Don't trust the developers, play the game for fun, pray they don't shut it down due to sheer incompetence. \r\n\r\nIf this game ever dies, it's because BHVR's headquarters got burned down by an angry mob. They actively encourage toxic behavior in their game. Certain gameplay mechanics facilitate community outrage, and recent updates have no Quality Assurance, and add more issues than solutions. Many 'fixes' the developers incorporate only apply to statistics and on paper. They sweep glaring issues under the rug. Cheaters run rampant. In one week alone I encountered a cheater twice a day. That's 14 different cheaters where I only got feedback for reporting one. There is no interesting balancing decisions. The same killer has been S+ tier for her entire existence.\r\n\r\nAs I stated above, I love the **gameplay** of this game, I love **playing this game with friends** but I do not love this game.

Stop trying to pass the Slugging, Tunneling, and Camping update if you want to keep making money. You are actively making Killer a worse role to play while making survivors all the better. Why? You, as a team, do not understand Killer game play, nor do you understand that Killer is supposed to be unfair. Your team seemingly only ever cares about how it feels to play survivor, to the point of over-tuning it. Why are you gutting one of the most fun perks for killer and replacing it with an ability that doesn't work for more than HALF YOUR ROSTER OF KILLERS? Why are you making it that if a killer dares to hook a survivor in the basement, they get 30 seconds of haste, endurance, and get FULLY HEALED? You are punishing Killers for doing what they're supposed to do. Your making the Survivor role less about \"surviving\" and more about farming clips for Tiktok and playing this weird power fantasy. Slugging, facecamping, and tunneling are NOT real problems. Why? Because games last a few minutes, then you move on to the next one. Killers do NOT quit a game after chase that ends badly for them, some Survivors, however, quit as soon as they lose one chase and get hooked. Those survivors are the people you are capitulating to. Making this game more casual for the new people coming in is the stupidest choice as a company you can make. This game is almost ten years old. People having been playing this game for that long. You have a good thing going here, DBD is the most fun when both sides have options to win, not when Killers HAVE to play with one play style the entire time or risk getting punished for nothing.

Both sides of the coin, killer and survivor will always tell you that the other side is handheld by the developer, the other side is too easy, it's too broken, blah, blah blah. Let me ask you, then. Which side are new players AFRAID to play? Is it the half of the game where they are hunted down like prey, slaughtered while they run and complete objectives? Or is it the one doing the slaughtering, the one holding those lives in the palm of their hands? It's killer. It's always been killer. Because killer has always been the centerpiece of any match of DBD, killer NEEDS to feel good. Killer needs to feel powerful. Killer needs to feel... fun. And recently, it feels like BHVR has been trying their hardest to prevent that from being possible.\n\n I try my best to leave survivors alone when they get unhooked, unless there's a damn good reason to do otherwise. I've never slugged someone out in my life. And yet, I'm being punished by the devs for the actions of bad actors by having survivors be granted 30 seconds of fucking god mode on unhook. Wicked and Resurgence are going to allow survivors to go down, get hooked in basement, self unhook in front of my face at FULL HEALTH, get hit, run away for 29 seconds, get hit again because they still have endurance, and then make a break for it. The pallet density is still off the charts. And what do killers get for these survivor buffs? One tier of bloodlust. .2 meters per second of movement speed. Most killer's base movement speed is 4.6 meters per second. That is a microscopic increase. And not only is the increase microscopic, it is very fragile. If I'm playing a mid-tier killer, one that is supposed to benefit from this move speed increase instead of making the top tiers stronger, what do you suppose the first thing I'll want to do after hooking a survivor is? Looking for another survivor. How does The Knight do that? Well, it's easy! I'll just send out my guard, check this generator, and... my movement speed bonus is gone. All because I tried to play the game.  How does The Doctor do that? Let me just charge up my static blast, and... the movement speed is gone. Any teleport killer? Gone. Any information? Bye-bye. Stealth? Nope. This is the kind of ass-backwards design that BHVR comes up with to keep the playing field \"fair\". It's nonsense. \n\nLet it be known. I'm no fool. BHVR is no stranger to swinging the pendulum the other way. I remember Call of Brine Eruption. I was there for original Hex: Ruin (which was only so universal because survivors were given more tools than killers had at the time, but I digress). Killer has been miserable for survivors to play against too. But that's the problem. This is a fucking video game. Why should we be miserable? Why should we sink another 500 hours and 2000 auric cells into this game when we could do literally anything else? Learn a skill. Read a book. BHVR doesn't respect your time.

Every attempt they made was just a band-aid on the original problem, which more often than not had to be reverted because each attempt made the game buggier or more unbalanced. The recent \"health updates\" to the gave have been a big failure and most of the content had to be reverted because it broke the game too much. So the Devs ended up wasting all these months just for one Quality of Life change to actually make it to the live servers...\n\nSomehow BOTH roles both feel overpowered and underpowered because all the killers have widely different power levels and all perks for each role are wildly unbalanced. Both roles are extremely unfun to play right now unless you use meta stuff in every match. The toxicity in this game is worse than any other game i've played. You get called slurs and get death threats for ANYTHING sometimes.\n\nTIme and time again the veteran players and content creators who know the game in and out seemingly more than the Devs do, have given suggestions on how to fix some of these root issues but in response they are ignored and pushed aside. The Devs have made several consultant-type programs over the years and each one has been abandoned and a new one created in its place. The neglect is pushing away these veteran players and content creators, and it's only going to hurt the game more. It's really obvious the Devs do not play test their own game and only make decisions based on their spreadsheet data and push those changes without realizing the effect it will have even if its a slight numbers tweak which they love to do.\n\nThis game is also extremely unfriendly to beginners. The tutorials are years out of date and don't accurately show you what to expect when playing a match. There's a lack of resources you can check to learn more about perks and status effects as nowadays there are way too many of them. Each DLC has introduced 3 survivor perks and 3 killer perks, which has led to an insane amount of bloat in the game. Most of the perks in the game, especially some of the really good ones, are locked behind DLC. In order for a new player to get all these perks which are basically required now, they have to shill out a ton of money on all the DLC packs, in-game currency for the licensed characters or grind for an eternity to get enough shards to buy them in the Shine of Secrets. This game is monetized to hell, more than some Free-to-Play games and it's crazy.\n\nDon't waste your time buying this until the Devs actually wake up and fix all the glaring issues with this game, but don't hold your breath because in the past it has taken them literal years to fix certain issues.",

Pinhead's chains can simply not connect, and Pinhead can be stuck in the ground following a teleport.

I love this game, I really do, but when it gets to a point where there's only one way to play to have fun (and most of the time it's really easy and boring anyway) I can't recommend this game to anyone. Seriously, if you think it's a good game please reconsider. I was a survivor main when I started but once I got around 300 hours on the game I began to play 50/50 and have been ever since. (To note; I have 500 hours on epic games + the hours I have on here so take that into consideration as well). \r\nTo put it simply, this game is not fun for 70% of the time you play it, and when it is fun it's only when you're a survivor bullying the killer. Playing survivor most of the time is holding w and running around an obstacle 17 times until you get hit - then repeat the process until you die or you escape. Playing killer actually feels like a social experiment to test how stressed a human being can get before throwing a chair at their window. \r\nSurvivors get handheld because the devs want the game to be \"beginner friendly\" which is a bunch of bs since it means they just buff and buff and buff survivor until it's literally impossible to play against them. They've far since left killers in the dirt to just fester in the sorry state that they're in, and I don't see any kind of improvement to the current state of the game anytime soon. \r\nThe devs also just don't give a toss about the community or quality of life for their players. They just push to release popular licences as a buggy mess of an update to bring in more players, and they make \"balance changes\" always in favour of survivor to \"help\" those new players settle into the game. The tutorial is years old at this point and teaches the player to do gens, pallet save, and leave. There's nothing about perks or other niche mechanics in the game that are useful for beginners to know, and it essentially teaches the players to bot gens and leave. \r\nAnyone reading this MUST know about \"survivor entitlement\" and honestly it's bad. It's so bad actually that you'll have survivors threaten you personally just because the game didn't go their way. The wider community for the most part is fine but in-game it's atrocious. \r\n\r\nTo TLDR this review; Survivor is easy and boring, Killer is rage inducing and absolutely not worth your time if you haven't spent money on the game, The devs don't care about anything the community says to help make improvements and instead they push buffing survivor, The community in-game is ass.\r\nOh yeah and one more thing... THE BUGS. This game doesn't go a single update without some colossal game breaking bug. \r\n\r\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It's a WASTE of your TIME and MONEY. Please!",

Not only is the chasing ability weak, but the Killer's perks are also monotonous and repetitive—the strongest skill turns out to be a simple dash. What's more, despite such an obvious imbalance favoring Survivors, the developers still haven't realized it. As game developers, they have failed to see the core issue—they only notice Killers targeting specific Survivors without understanding why. If chasing other Survivors offered a better payoff than focusing on one, who would persistently tunnel a single player and relentlessly limit their game experience? Survivors want to win, but don't Killer players want to win too? Step by step, the game space for Killer players is being constrained. I can only say that the future of this game looks bleak. If Dead by Daylight continues to refuse to face reality, indulging in the idea that profiting from four players is better than profiting from one, thereby sacrificing the Killer player experience, this game will soon fade into obscurity, drowned in players' disappointment.",

      "review": "I really wanna enjoy this game, i really do. But at this point i genuinely feel like i got scammed. When i first got the game back in June, it was a blast. Sure i did get killed a bunch of times and sometimes don't get a full 4k. And maybe get called a few slurs on the side (Although i enjoy the cope.) But the game was still absolutely fun to play both as killer and survivor.\n\nBut nowadays, especially with what's being going on right now. Things are definitely different, and not in a good way. Every time i boot up the game, i don't feel like i'm trying to fight for my life or purge any living thing by dawn. but instead trying to endure the daily punishment set out by the Laughing Joking Numbnuts over at BHVR. We all know that the devs love to glaze and hand hold survivors, BUT DEAR GOD! This is just full on Helicopter Parenting for survivors at this point, while killers get left to shiver in the doghouse in the pouring rain like an unloved family pet. Pallet Density, Survivors getting more OP buffs than killers, while bugs that affected killers for a while never getting fixed. And of course the latest PTB, (or as i like to call, anti killer update) being their magnum opus. The fact that they brought this back, despite the massive backlash they got when it was first announced. Shows that they are really incompetent, tone deaf, and overall don't care about killers. And are fully determined to make the role less fun for new players and pros alike and get them to uninstall and get refunds.\n\nThey don't understand that there are times that killers need to do these to win matches and get blood points, so taking away those simple things and nerfing them, just makes them less of an imposing threat, and more of a worn out punching bag for survivors to wail on every match. And i'm not being biased, cause i also main survivor as well. And i've definitely seen killers struggling to get a single kill. While other survivors just pick on them with flashlights, vial bombs and other stuff. Sometimes i even offer myself to get killed cause i feel bad for them, Genuinely tragic. And survivors just rag on them and be super toxic towards them after every match. Yet those same players are the type that don't want to learn how to actually get good and learn how to use builds and strats such as looping, but instead bitch, whine and complain to BHVR that they need buffs, and that killers are doing this and that, and overall being crybabies and ruining the fun for everyone. And whats's worse is that these are the people BHVR are kowtowing and submitting to the most, for reasons i don't know why. But it's just Grade A Textbook favoritism towards survivors and don't even dare to touch upon things like gen rushes, bully squads and other unfair things that they do, and they have the nerve to say killers are being handheld? What a sick joke!\n\nIt's genuinely sad to see this game go down like this, cause this definitely had and still has the potential to be a great game, especially for horror fans like myself. But the biggest problems are the game killing clowns from BHVR. They clearly show that they do not even play their own damn game, let alone know what they're doing, and instead pander and rely on the whiniest part of the fanbase to help make decisions. They lack integrity and do a very piss poor job at balancing and maintaining their game. So yeah, i have absolutely have no faith with those jokers behind the wheel, and them bringing back the PTB, despite the backlash solidifies that for me. So you might as well give me and other players our money back, cause we ain't touching this ever again.\n\nAnd to the crybaby survivors who were clamoring for something like this. Congratulations, you won. Your tantrums have succeeded and now the game is yours. Just don't whine to BHVR when y'all have to wait longer to join games, or losing against bots. Cause remember, you wanted us gone and now your wish is becoming a reality real soon. So have fun with what BHVR will spoon feed you in the future, and don't you think of begging us to come back, cause we sure hell ain't.\n\nJust remember, you need us, and we don't need you.

      "review": "This game has more bugs than features, and I mean game-breaking bugs. Examples:\n\n- 1 Generators sometimes count as 2.\n\n- Half the killers are bugged or don’t work correctly. For example, Vecna doesn’t show survivors struggling when you carry them, Ghost Face makes random sounds as if you’re watching him when he’s nowhere near you, Wraith sometimes crashes your game or the other player’s game when breaking a pallet, and many other killers are broken too.\n\n- Hitboxes are atrocious in this game be ready for Bluetooth hits.\n\n- Because the developers don’t know how to program or what server authority is, cheaters run rampant. Be ready to find them 1 out of every 4 matches. And I’m talking about finishing gens in seconds, getting you stuck in animations, going under the map, rezzing and unhooking people......… it’s a shit show.\n\n- The balance team doesn’t even play the game. If they did, they wouldn’t make half the changes they do, where they fuck the game and then have to roll it back. \"Data-driven changes\" my ass.\n\n- Did I talk about the bugs? Because god dammit, there are so many. My favorite was when you could get infinite item charges and the devs said that’s not game breaking.................… having an infinite item is not game breaking?........ Fuck off.\n\n- Some killers are so OP it’s pointless to play anything else. The only counterplay is hoping the player sucks or misplays, because otherwise you’re dead. So what did the devs do to address this? They nerfed bottom tier killers and left the S-tiers alone. Makes sense, right?\n\nWhile the concept is fun and has great potential, it’s completely mismanaged by the devs.",

They were in the right direction with the tunneling system & all these killer mains complained & cried about that making their killer-sided game not as much on their side, less fun for them when playing survivor is the most annoying thing on the planet. There is a reason why when you want to play & then the game rewards you EXTRA blood points for playing survivor lol it's right there bro lol. A lot of the characters are broken, survivors get staggered when they fall from great heights but NOT killers LOL. The game use to be survivor-sided, i'll give you that BUT NOW? it's just killer sided & these people don't think so. This why your game is so crap now. The hit boxes on killers is INSANELY huge yet they won't change it at all & they prob never will change it. If you sit here & tell me that this game is survivor sided, you are an idiot. Probably the biggest idiot on this planet, this universe even. The devs need to ignore the killer mains & they're crying over making a KILLER SIDED GAME less killer sided. There are so many negative reviews on this game & you can see why bro. FIX YOUR GAME. ALSO APPARENTLY THIS GAME HAS PRIVACY ISSUES? they want ur info while NOT FIXING THEIR GAME. LOLOL WHAT A JOKE\n\nUPDATE: The new update makes you LOCKED from MATCHMAKING, it's one thing if bro leaves one mid way thru the game but one of my friends got locked from leaving the game WHILE HE'S DEAD!!! HE'S DEAD HE'S JUST SPECTATING STFU BRUH THIS GAME IS GOING TO DIE SOON I CANT WAIT FOR IT TO HAPPEN",

      "review": "This genuinely might be one of the worst \"popular\" games that I have ever played. I'm not even playing into the DBD hate hype train. I am absolutely shocked that it is not dead yet - Perhaps because there aren't other asymmetrical games like it, and the licenses keep player count high. \r\n\r\nThis does not feel like a live service game. Year after year we have asked for specific things, and BHVR responds with \"yeah that's cool, also look at this new license! But no, you're right, Game Health is important... so in honour of that, let's worsen the cosmetics UI for no reason\". Also, there is a long-standing bug list for a bunch of killers that the devs haven't even sniffed, and I don't think they're ever going to get fixed. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of killers, the balance team at BHVR definitely like to troll. The Krasue release was absolutely awful - and this was only exacerbated by the recoil from the terrible Walking Dead livestream situation prior. I literally stopped playing for weeks until she got nerfed. \r\n\r\nHow many times have game-breaking things like this happened which make the game unplayable for an extended period of time? BHVR somehow manage to maintain a completely ignorant approach to all the things that they do. Like dude, if this was any other game, you would legit think the company hates their fans or are intentionally trolling, but when it comes to this game, you just say \"Good Ol BHVR!\". This company's name and reputation has become synonymous with \"dogshit\" for crying out loud. I will say that is not true in regards to the support team at least. The support team actually try to stay on top of tickets, unless they get inundated like all of the employees at BHVR do, which is why there are so many quick fixes. \r\n\r\nThe game itself is so monotonous and boring, and the seasonal events and 2v8 do little to actually make the base game anymore entertaining. Imagine your soloQ team is trolling, so you have to sit on gens the whole game... 5 games in a row. Not fun, right? That's often the reality. And dude, fucking Among Us makes doing survivor tasks more enjoyable than a 10 year old, live-service horror game. Where is the courage to go out of their comfort zone and bring engaging gen completion ideas to the PTB. BHVR are terrified to take risks. This is another reason why DBD does not feel like a live service game. Rather, it feels like they are just keeping the servers running. \r\n\r\nIf it wasn't for comp or JRM-style trolling, people with over 2000 hours would've left for another game like a mass exodus (and BHVR only recently started doing things like \"supporting\" creators or DBDLeague. For so long, there was such little community involvement in ANYTHING. I have rarely seen other western companies do the same with their popular games). \r\n\r\nI came back to Dead By Daylight from a month of not playing (during which I played CS2, Runescape, Metro 2033 series and Minecraft) to this game and was absolutely shocked at how truly unenjoyable everything was. Like I said, if it wasn't for comp or JRM-ing killers, the only way DBD would keep its numbers up would be with a constant influx of new players, as older players would be getting tf out ASAP. I have not played a game less rewarding to invest time into. \r\n\r\nQueue up in SoloQ against a good killer? That's always game over, because BHVR's \"mmr-based\" matchmaking will consistently give you bad survivors who should not be put in your lobby, so it's not even a fun challenge. Queue up in SoloQ against a bad killer? That's always ggez, because you stomp this poor baby killer who doesn't even know what a CJ tech is, again because the matchmaking is not coded with any common sense in regards to mmr, but done in a way to reduce queue times. \r\n\r\nAlso they 100% lie slightly about the ping in public games. Whatever your ping is, add 30 onto it. \r\n\r\nI actually was working towards becoming a major content creator for DBD, but HensDaMonsta can take the spotlight, because whilst this game still has potential, the way BHVR manages it does not, and so I have lost faith in Dead By Daylight.

Sticking to the phrase \"See you in the fog\" but they removed all fog from almost every map (take a look at coldwind today compared to 5 years ago). The events like chaos shuffle or 2v8 keeps the game somewhat interesting since you don't have the strongest build vs the strongest build every game. They are doing nothing to this current meta that has been the same for over a year and a half. They need to do a full game reset because this is not even the same game as it once was.

And that doesn't even mention how unbalanced some of these killers are or have become, running into a 50% haste clown making it near impossible to loop unless you have 4k hours on the game and every map memorized, or a 20k hours huntress, who could play the game blindfolded and still win. And thats not even mentioning how many survivors and killers dc during games, getting rid of the dc penalty just makes players feel justified in leaving if one thing doesnt go their way.\r\n\r\nOverall it is a game that can be fun and has its moments, where both sides are balanced and having fun is an actual possibility, but thats 1 in 10 games, and quite frankly the other 9 games id rather jump infront of the hillbillies chainsaw.\r\n\r\nOn all the consoles ive played this game on id say i have around 750-1000 hours on this game, compared to some people thats nothing, but personally id say ive played long enough to watch this game go from good to bad to great to terrible, and unless it makes serious changes in the next few patches to increase balancing, sbmm, punishments and various other problems, its just not the kinda game you can have a lot of fun in.

Yes but No, it's not a hard No but i wouldn't recommend to a new player for the sole reason you need to sink a silly amount of numbers into the game to learn the basics but also to actually enjoy the amount of perks you need to buy nearly every character just to be in for a chance of competing against good players. Now the review, this is a killer mains perspective so you survivor mains move along you will just disagree with everything boohoo killer main yes yes.\n\nSo I've played, streamed and put so much time into this game that it was the sole game i played for years now, patch after patch, perk addition after perk addition, toxic message after toxic message later I've learned what a pile of poop this game really is, beneath all the bugs, imbalances and overall mess of a game this is, is the most toxic community only second to League of Legends I've ever come across!! Had a decent game with 8 hooks, 2 hooks on 3 people and 1 dead, nah trash should get good while watching 3 lots of tea bags at the exit gate because you played \"fair\", so you change it up, get 2 survivors out earlier and avoiding the good looper BANG!!! TUNNELLER, UNFAIR, REPORTED, CAMPER, PLAYING LIKE A TOXIC PERSON!!!, You can't win.\n\nNow let's move onto the devs. I am sick and tired of seeing the immense hand holding to one side it's unreal, look at patch 9.3.0 that is soon to come out (PTB.... we will see), it's honestly a disgrace that survivors are getting countless base kit additions, x-ray, shield, speed, stealth etc.... oh but don't worry the killer gets some extra speed after hooking, but he will lose it as soon as they see a survivor... but don't worry we will throw in an extra 200bp for each hook!!! Talk about the 2nd child treatment oh my gosh. The fact they don't even play test their own game (Jim Beam is an obvious fact that they don't) is laughable. This game is digging it's own grave and i'm tired of thinking team killer will have an easy time. The last survey i closed, i didn't even finish because it's insulting that the options for why you uninstalling or not enjoying the game features 2 anti fun killer options basically asking Survivor mains why they are not enjoying... what about why i'm not enjoying? Why is there no \"Gens are too fast\" \"Too many Endurance perks\" \"Base kit is too oppressive\" \"Why can i only kick a gen 8 times but Survs can heal infinite times and reset\" or any other killers are not having fun options but nope they only care about the favourite child. \n\nBefore anyone wonders... yes i play Survivor, i have around 1K of my play time survivor as well and boy can you feel the game is designed around them just by the game play. So, to most i would never recommend this game but apart of me still holds stupid hope that they will think about both sides and reward the killer for playing how \"They are supposed too\" you know killers are meant to play a certain way to make sure the survivors are having fun too. The more i type all this out the more i realise i am just no longer enjoying the game and for the first time in years i actually am close to calling it daylight.\n\nHope this didn't feel too much like a crying rant as yes it does look like it but i guess it's just come this far and that is how i am viewing the game! The game at its core is fantastic but has too many issues. Until the devs actually decide to think about the other team I'm going to give it a rest for a while.
