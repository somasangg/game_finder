You have to click/slap a humongus amount of times, but once the idle/auto upgrade is complete, you won't have any more upgrades (ironic). It will then become more of a collection game for butts and steam achievements.\n\nAlthough there is minimal gooning, the game is nice.",

This game is a real game-changer (or should I say, butt-changer?). The best part? It's free! I'm not sure what's more impressive, the game's daring humor or its wallet-friendly price tag. If you're looking for a unique gaming experience that will leave you giggling, look no further. Just remember, with great butt power comes great responsibility",

You may think this a simple clicker inventory game like all the rest of them on steam, which I won't lie that it is.

The Good, but... rating is heavily influenced by the fact that this game is free. You can buy packs to give you more content but its not required to enjoy the game. Nothing is pay-walled as of the time of this review.\n\nI enjoyed my time with the game but admittedly only return occasionally when there is a patch of new... content. \n\nYou slap butts. That's it. Its a good time, lol.\n\nThe slap sounds are very satisfying, the various backsides you unlock (time released, yes you can just let the game run and unlock gatcha pulls) are varied and even funny (they have some that are wild). I wouldn't pay for this game but you don't have to, and whats here is a fun and sexy distraction or a guilty pleasure achievement hunt if you want a change of pace. Doesn't require any effort at all.\n\nWhat this game DOES require of you is your time. A lot of it. At least for fellow achievement hunters. You will be slapping the disembodied posterior of various women you unlock (it is just their butt you you unlock, literally an abdomen with the top parts of thighs, still very attractive and appealing despite this) for hours and hours unless you tire of it quickly as I suppose many people have.\n\nAs someone who collects trophies, this game will take a long long time 100 percent. If you have some way to cheat a clicking game. Utilize that here and save yourself several months of your life.\n\nI recommend it as a sexy little different experience, you owe it to yourself to download as either a laugh or something to do in-between robust NFSW content, or Triple A gaming. For those who take everything seriously or need most of their content to be engaging and worthwhile... You will be disappointed.\n\n[If you like games like this, consider joining my curator group :)\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/43326716/]",

Booty: There's a lot of ass in this game\nNeither of these are in my opinion enough to give this game a positive review. Item drops here just kinda suck, all they do is change the design of the butt. In a game like Don't Starve Together items also only serve as skins but there's much more gameplay than just clicking, the drops here weren't made for the game but the game was made for the drops. It also fails as a porn game because there's barely any nudity, some butts have visible vaginas but it's not like you can interact with it or anything and ass without the rest of the body isn't hot at all. The only reason I have so much playtime in this is because I wanted to get every achievement\n\nBoba best girl",

Unfortunately, this is an ideal product of an average introverted virgin who never touched a butt in their lives and for very obvious reasons:\n\n[list]\n    [*]Gambling\n    [*]Repetitive/Boring\n    [*]Retarded/Tedious (Why?)\n    [*]When 'playing', nothing can be bothered to reward you for slapping a molten gummy bear you call a 'human butt'.\n    [*]Speaking of a 'human butt', it's more of a gummy bear than jello on how it moves and just as cheap as the reviews satisfied by literally doing nothing. (Go to Deviantart and find yourself some nice and old butt Gifs. You'll see what I mean)\n    [*]Nobody knows the meaning of 'a butt' as opposed to 'the butt' so you are pretty much stuck with just one that most virgins drool over; a bunny. Would've made more sense to have different but cannot expect anything beyond a low-end clickbait.\n    [*]Leaving or clicking it to farm slaps and crates is not a game but gambling. (Especially without Auto)\n[/list]\n\nYou are far better off starting with all butts and methods of slapping. Fortunately the game is free so even if nobody can read, you are better off [strike] growing balls, getting a job, finding an alive girl [/strike] uninstalling it.
