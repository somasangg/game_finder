I spent days trying to figure it out and it was something stupid like needing to install a english (US) language pack.\nAfter i finally got to play the game it was amazing other than a few small bugs with the autopilot and the atc not doing what its told. totally recommend this game for those interested in aviation.\n\nif you're having the same problem as me:\nInstall the English (US) language pack for windows. The game requires it for air traffic control. Fixed the closing to desktop for me.\n\nInstructions here: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/language-packs-for-windows-a5094319-a92d-18de-5b53-1cfc697cfca8",

      "review": "Microsoft Flight Simulator is a great game, or at least a solid base for addons. If you want a more arcade-style experience, the default Asobo A320 is fine. But if you want true realism, you’ll need high-quality addons, either payware or some of the excellent free options available.\n\nThe graphics are impressive, and I get around 40 FPS on the ground with a 3060 12GB and a 7600X. The best part is that you can fly anywhere in the world. While the default airports aren’t the highest quality, there are many great freeware options, and payware airports are available too.\n\nA joystick — or at least an Xbox controller — is almost essential. Flying with a keyboard is very unrealistic.\n\nThe learning curve can be steep if you’re new to flight simulation, but there are built-in tutorials that help you get started. The community is also great, with lots of guides, YouTube videos, and helpful people on forums.\n\nMultiplayer is fun, especially with live traffic and real weather, which make the world feel alive. Loading times can be long, but the experience is worth it once you’re in the air.\n\nIf you want an even more realistic experience, I highly recommend trying VATSIM — an online network where you can fly with real people acting as air traffic controllers. It adds a WHOLE NEW level of immersion.\n\nOverall, an amazing simulator and absolutely worth it if you love aviation. Highly recommended!",

Using the Satellite data, the names and relative shapes of even tiny towns is represented, even if the buildings are generic. Downloading the Canadian city data allows me to take off from Regina, Saskatchewan Airport, fly over Mozaaic Stadium where the Saskatchewan Roughriders play CFL Football, and then make the nearly one hour flight over Moose Jaw and then South to Assiniboia, the little town of 2000 people where I grew up. Then I can enjoy a set up in-air flight from Giza, over the Great Pyramid and the Sphinx, and land in Cairo Airport. The flight training includes Airbus Airline flight training. All this, and I can turn on stunning VR mode and feel like I'm really flying the airplane thousands of feet above the ground myself. This looks and plays so much better than the history of flight version and Flight Simulator X previous editions. Even flying a Helicopter feels real, especially in VR.

And that's okay. \r\n\r\n[b]Gameplay;[/b]\r\nAt the start, it is VERY confusing. If you want to take the game seriously enough, most of your time will be staring at Reddit articles and youtube videos on \"how do flight sim\". Once you've found an aircraft that you're happy with (For me it was the Fenix Simulations A320 family. However if you're not willing to drop €90 on that, then go with the FlyByWire A32NX). It gets sooo much better. You actually stressing less and enjoying the game more.\r\n\r\n[b]Base Game Content;[/b]\r\nThe base game content (for the standard edition) is fine. good enough to get started with the game, however (imo) to really start enjoying the game, you need addons. A third party aircraft, GSX, Charts Software and VatSIM or BeyondATC are a must.\r\n\r\n[b]Controls;[/b]\r\nGet yourself a controller at least. Once you're into it start considering spending some money. For starting I'd go for the Logitech Saitek Yoke or the WinWing URSA MINOR Airline Joystick. And an actual hands-on throttle quad.

They are now both 4 years old.\n\nWhen we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.\n\nAfter learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.\n\nAfter coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.\n\nToday, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.\n\nI now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.\n\nMoral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.\n\nThank you.",

I have the EXACT same problem with this set, in addition to only a tiny bit of the truster axis being used at all, which makes controlling the engines annoying and difficult.\n\nI haven't so far been able to fix these issues via sensitivity/deadzones/response curve.\nI'm sort of at a loss with this one, so this will have to be a negative review.
