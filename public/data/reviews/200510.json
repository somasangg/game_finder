      "review": "\"XCOM: Enemy Unknown\" is a brilliantly crafted strategy game that offers a deeply engaging experience for both tactical thinkers and action lovers alike. One of the standout aspects of this game is its challenging blend of turn-based combat and resource management. You don’t just control a squad of soldiers you're also in charge of managing a global defense initiative, making critical decisions on how to allocate resources, research new technologies, and upgrade your base.\n\nthe tactical combat in XCOM is incredibly rewarding, as every decision matters. Whether it’s deciding where to position your soldiers or choosing the right abilities for a mission, every move requires careful planning. This creates a thrilling sense of tension, especially since a single mistake can lead to the loss of a beloved soldier, making each mission feel personal and high-stakes.\n\none of the game's most compelling elements is its emotional connection to your soldiers. As they level up and develop unique skills, you begin to form a bond with them. When a character is lost in combat, the loss is felt deeply, adding an emotional layer to the game that few strategy games can match. This creates a powerful sense of attachment and makes every victory feel truly earned.\n\nwith its compelling story, engaging mechanics, and the constant balance between risk and reward, \"XCOM: Enemy Unknown\" provides a satisfying and immersive experience that keeps players on the edge of their seats. It’s a game that challenges your intellect and strategic thinking, all while keeping you emotionally invested in the fate of your squad.",

      "review": "\"XCOM: Enemy Unknown\"\nThe thrill of defending humanity from apparently overwhelming dangers, challenging missions and hard decisions are all back in this modernized version of XCOM. Combat is gripping because of its cinematic presentation and simplified action and squad customization and base management provide depth. Even long-time players may desire for the originals' immense complexity, which had many bases, stricter micromanagement and a wider array of mission scenarios. Even though Alien AI can get predictable with time, the classic's distinctive core is still provided by the mix of strategy, panic, and success. Yet despite knowing failure is always around the corner, I keep coming back — because few games make victory feel this hard‑earned and satisfying.",

      "review": "XCOM: Enemy Unknown - The Streamlined Revival Of A Cult Classic Strategy Behemoth\n\nEU is the revival of a long thought-dead franchise that started all the way back in the mid-90s and was the stroke of genius by Julian Gollop and his team of talented developers at MicroProse. A studio that is now long-since been closed but was responsible for hit games such as Sid Meier's Civilization 1 & 2, Gunship, Master of Orion and many other classic hit games that all aim to bring strategy to the home computer of the time, one of which was also XCOM: Ufo Defense and later games such as XCOM: Terror From The Deep and Apocalypse (There are no other XCOM games, trust me, don't google it).\n\nThe original games were always known for being absolutely hardcore. Full of micromanagement in its GeoScape parts and an unforgiving slaughter in the BattleScape, where your soldiers have a chance to be eviscerated the very first turn as they all step off their VTOL aircraft. And because of its unforgiving but rewarding nature, the game has a dedicated and passionate cult following to this very day, with fans still actively banding together to develop a Source Port to make sure the game continues running as best as it can on modern operating systems.\n\nTo say that EU had big shoes to fill would be an understatement.\n\nWhile modern gamers weren't really aware that XCOM was a thing before EU, many people who have fond memories of the original were cautiously optimistic as EU was revealed alongside a supplementary game that ended up being a Third-Person Shooter. But that game has no direct ties to EU and can safely be enjoyed on its own or outright ignored, as it seems largely forgotten with middling reviews.\n\nEU wanted to be nothing more than a more modern, sleek and streamlined revival of a long-dormant series, trimming off the fat where necessary to give a conscise and focused new iteration of the series, one that would have an easy skill floor where many things are explained to you quite intuitively, but with enough depth to still stand out in a videogame market that was, at the time, oversaturated with mostly effortless first- and third-person cover shooters that didn't require much involvement other than pointing and shooting your rifle.\n\nSo what is this game about? Well, you are the Commander of the XCOM Unit, an organization collectively funded by the big world powers as a way to combat the threat of Extraterrestrials, also colloquially known as Aliens to the common man.\nYour job is to be the Commander of this unit and stop the Alien Invasion of Earth, figure out what their goals are, learn about them, co-opt their tactics, gear, and other advancements to gain an edge in an arms race that spans the entire campaign from start to end.\n\nThroughout the game, you are assisted by a cast of outstanding characters such as Central, the man who will give you the intel for all your missions. Dr. Vahlen, a scientist who is deeply fascinated by the advancements of the Aliens and wishes to pursue ways of enhancing the human body, and Shen, the Chief Engineer, who is responsible for the building of most weaponry and utilities, and also the construction and expansion of the XCOM Headquarters.\nAnd not to forget: Your soldiers. Who will form the frontline and backbone of all your efforts in taking down the Aliens. They will fight for you, bleed for you, and some may even die for you, and will forever be remembered for their efforts, because once somebody dies, they are gone forever.\n\nPermadeath is a constant in this game; your choices in the BattleScape matter. Sometimes you will make a mistake, and you will pay harshly for it.\nSometimes you can plan for all the possibilities and make all the correct moves, but simply be messed up by bad RNG, which causes your 95% chance hit to suddenly miss the enemy, who will then go on to massacre your Squadmate.\nBetween battles, your time is wisely spent in the GeoScape, a menu encompassing your XCOM Headquarters and all the things you can do there; From recruiting, upgrading, and outfitting Soldiers with their gear all the way to Research, Development, and Production of new Gear, Tactics, Technologies, etc.\nYou will also have to contend with a rising Panic System that each country in the XCOM program has: Let the Panic Meter get too high, and a country will leave the program, depriving you of precious monthly funds that you now lack and are now permanently without.\nTo counteract this, you need to make sure to put up satellites to monitor the countries in the program for Alien Activity, stop the abduction/massacring of civilians, and other things.\n\nIt's a punishing but deeply rewarding gameplay loop. Preparing for a mission and seeing all the things you've worked on come to play in the Battles you fight.\nWhen everything clicks into place, you will feel invincible, and it is so rewarding to pull off a perfect mission or to see the credits roll after a long campaign, knowing that you made it happen despite all the odds.\n\nXCOM also got a few DLC, most of which I would consider part of the base experience; There is no real reason NOT to have the DLC enabled, especially \"Enemy Within\", which fundamentally adds things to the game such as a new faction to fight against, extra bits of story and lore, new mechanics such as Mechs and Gene Therapy etc.\nIt is all integrated into the base game well, and Enemy Within is considered part of the base experience when Enemy Unknown is mentioned by name.\n\nAnd as a modern iteration? I think EU perfectly succeeds. It deserves all the praise it gets where it is due, and the only thing that brings the experience down is a bit of jank here and there. Sometimes you get shot from weird angles that count as flanks, sometimes you enter the line of sight of an enemy despite them clearly being behind the wall, and sometimes the game just freezes up after an action for a few seconds as the Enemy CPU seems to not know what to do for a moment.\n\nOther than that, this is a phenomenal Reboot and a great entry for people new to the series, and I absolutely suggest that you play this game BEFORE XCOM 2 just to see how they refined the gameplay and what direction they chose to take it in.",

      "review": "A game of incredible highs, but also extreme lows. I definitely recommend XCOM: Enemy Unknown — it’s a great game. I’m a huge fan of the originals (which I still think are better), but Firaxis have done a solid job capturing that old-school spirit while making it more accessible and modern. Totally worth playing.\n\nThat said, it comes with one big caveat: those lows can be very low. Sometimes it feels like you’ve gone from a strategy masterpiece to an indie level game in some ways, with how disjointed and off some of the design feels.\n\nBut let’s start with the good stuff. Firaxis really took the core premise of the original and fleshed it out — not so much in gameplay depth (it’s much simpler than the originals), but in scope, story, and the overall sense of discovery. And that sense of discovery in the originals was already fantastic. They’ve taken it even further here with things like genetic enhancements, mech units, and all sorts of additional elements. It was top-tier before, but I’ll give them credit, they managed to take it up another notch.\n\nThey also nailed that same rush of satisfaction you got from clearing missions and pulling off kills in the old games. It’s tough, it’s tense, and it feels great when you win. It contains RNG elements too, so it still has that unpredictable edge that makes every decision matter. Overall, it’s an extremely satisfying game to play and it fulfils you very often.\n\nThe biggest flaw by far, though, is the pod system. Basically, aliens don’t freely roam the map, instead they sit in preset groups (“pods”) that only activate when you spot them. Later missions and harder difficulties make this a bit more dynamic, but for most of the game, you’re not really playing the tactical battles, instead you’re just managing pod triggers. This turns the game into this weird meta of manipulating enemy activation instead of focusing on actual combat. It’s a really poor system which feels worse the more you play. That said, it takes a while before it starts to annoy, and even when it does, the satisfaction from the general gameplay still carries it.\n\nNow, a lot of people complain about the game being “bullshitty,” and yeah, I get it... but that’s just RNG gaming. You’ll take a 95% shot and on occasion miss. It happens. It’s part of the tension, and honestly, I like that.\n\nSo, the highs still outweigh the lows. The combat, the discovery, the constant push-and-pull of risk and reward — it’s all just so satisfying. It’s an experience that’ll absolutely frustrate you at times, but when it’s good, it’s really good. Some people can handle that, some can’t, but if you can, this game’s a hell of a ride. Just be sure to check out the superior original!",

The sense of growth, from scrambling to survive to outsmarting and outgunning the aliens is really satisfying. The strategy layer and tactical missions feed into each other perfectly, and every upgrade feels earned.\r\n\r\nEven when the campaign stabilizes, the tension never fully leaves. You're still one or two bad missions from a potential spiral into defeat, but by this time you have the tools and knowledge to recover before things get too bad. \r\n\r\nGreat experience, I give it an 8 out of 10",

      "review": "XCOM 1 is still a fantastic strategy game, maybe even a masterpiece. There are a few minor mechanical issues, but overall the game holds up surprisingly well (Classic difficulty).\nI'll add comparison thoughts below after replaying XCOM 2, but I think it's interesting to evaluate this on its own, with only faint memories of the sequel.\n\n(this review contains only slight spoilers in the beginning but more and more further down, though I've tried to reduce them as much as possible)\n\nResearch is still fun, offering many simultaneous options with different rewards. Strategically it's a bit sad you don't know the exact effects beforehand, though as an experienced player you do, and this also delivers more curiosity and excitement.\n\nBase management is also great and strategic, with so many different options for various dimensions (like soldier strength and country satisfaction/monetary support). The biggest resource management factor, besides time, is of course money, and it works very well. You always just barely have enough for 1 or 2 exciting improvements that you need to weigh against often equally promising other ones, and sometimes you have to sell items you don't want to to get an important improvement.\n\nHaving also replayed the original X-COM (UFO Defense / Enemy Unknown), which I love, it's amazing how many mechanics they managed to keep/update, while streamlining/simplifying the mechanics in general (which is not always a strict improvement, more on that later):\n* terror events where you need to save as many civilians as possible\n* the aircraft-UFO dogfights are surprisingly close to the original\n* alien base attacks\n* XCOM base attack (only in the DLC Enemy Within I think, which seems like a strict improvement)\n* Selling loot from missions, but only if you e.g. don't destroy the ship parts in the mission\n* having to cover multiple continents (with satellites, aircraft, missions, etc)\n* laser and plasma research/upgrade paths\n\nand many more, probably. You can really see they looked at the original X-COM hard and tried to translate as much as possible to a modern feel.\nThe streamlining works well in general and still offers a great deal of complexity, there were many small and fiddly details in the original X-COM like managing ammo or multiple bases that maybe didn't offer enough depth and reward for the tedium.\n\nI do miss a few of the freedoms in X-COM that gave it immersive sim qualities, like being able to time grenades to explode only after x turns, soldier inventory instead of only 2 fixed item slots allowing you to e.g. exchange medikits or stunners between soldiers, the flexibility of the point action system where you can e.g. move a little bit and shoot once or twice or just stand and shoot three times, and especially free aiming shots to shoot away cover or house walls (in XCOM you can only shoot main weapons at aliens directly). Or being able to assign an exact number of researchers and engineers to projects, though that again has a rather small benefit. But it does feel more like a choice and degree of freedom.\nAt least they did keep free aiming for grenades and rockets, which leads to some of the most creative and fun plays.\nReloading was also a bit more strategic in X-COM, as you had limited ammo magazines and had to balance reloading to not have an empty magazine with not running out of magazines, as the remaining ammo in the magazine is wasted when reloading.\nReloading even becomes a chore in the late game in XCOM, as you have unlimited ammo, and strategically it's optimal to reload even after shooting once, if no enemies interrupt you.\n(the original X-COM did have some weapons that didn't require magazines iirc, like lasers)\n\nSoldier talent paths are a good idea, but maybe a bit too simple, and often between the 2 talent choices there is a rather clearly better choice, like being able to shoot twice in a turn (if you haven't moved) instead of suppressing an enemy, which just gives you a reaction shot if they move and slightly reduces their aim or something.\nThere are still a few interesting choices here (like more smoke grenades vs more medikit usages), and there is still some strategy in choosing which soldiers to take on a mission to get a critical new talent for them.\n\nHere it gets a bit more spoilery strategically:\nOne class is probably slightly OP compared to others, namely snipers, but mostly only when they have their last talent and the elevation bonus, sometimes giving you 2 100% high crit shots over 3 screens distance in a single turn. But they do have low HP, especially with the movement armors, and they don't work well in labyrinthine, sight-blocking areas, obviously better in open areas.\nAnd other classes with full talents are also very strong, like the assault run and gun + double shot,  reaction shot for enemies getting within 4 tiles, and the free first shot within 4 tiles (these are 4 separate good talents).\nOr the heavy's double shot, shredder rocket (which increases dmg to the target), and expanded range rockets, which can also blow up things like cars, adding extra damage.\n\nMechanically there are some minor annoyances especially in the late game. The biggest is that it sometimes takes a lot of time to find the remaining aliens, and while you can move multiple soldiers simultaneously which is great QOL, it doesn't help that you have to wait for each soldier's movement to finish before you can do actions like overwatch. This costs you a few seconds every turn where you're just waiting for animations to finish. It would have been great to have a skip animations option like in the original X-COM.\nBut as I said, if this is the biggest nuisance, the game has aged very well and is very solid overall.\n(this is probably something XCOM 2 fixes with the concealment system, which is about the only relevant comparison I could remember for this review before replaying 2)\n\nBalance wise besides snipers one thing I'd change is enemies being able to move freely while mind controlling your soldier. They can just run away to max range, and if there are other enemies between you, you can't just chase them, so you basically have no other choice than to kill (or I guess stun if you're lucky) your own soldier. I'd say they shouldn't be able to move at all, or maybe only a few tiles.\n(you can also get a soldier upgrade to make them immune to mind control, but this is late and a bit of a cheap move)\n\nThe game does start to be a slight slog toward the end game and is slightly easy at that point on Classic difficulty (one above normal, one below max \"insane\" difficulty), but until then it offers great challenge and many epic moments like a tense base defense or a turn where you just barely manage to eliminate all visible enemies with your last few actions.\n\nI could have probably tried to finish the game a bit more quickly (around 40 hours for this playthrough, first was around 50), as I ended with pretty much full research and the best equipment, then it would have been more challenging for the endgame.\n\nBut still, the conclusion is satisfying, and it's fun to finally use the enemy's greatest weapon (psi moves) against them. Though I've avoided them until the very end as they're likely OP, just part of psi tech is mandatory to progress story-wise.\n\nNow I'm looking forward to replaying XCOM 2 to compare, I haven't even really played the DLC for that yet, I'm afraid to say (War of the Chosen).\nIdeally I'd also love to play the Long War mod which I've heard great things about and is supposed to make the game more balanced and strategic, but also longer. Not sure I have the time for that unfortunately. But first, XCOM 2 DLC is waiting anyways.\n\nNoteworthy Long War quotes from the game's designer Jake Solomon:\n\"Takes XCOM to a new level.\" - via Twitter\n\"We're basically a 20-hour tutorial for Long War, and that's okay.\" - via IGN",

      "review": "XCOM: Enemy Unknown is an excellent game, and it’s easy to recommend even to those who usually don’t play turn-based tactics.\n\nThe gameplay consists of two main components: base management and tactical battles. At the base, you train your soldiers, manage resources, and research new technologies. There’s always something to do — buying, building, or researching — so even outside of battles you’re constantly making important decisions.\n\nThe battles are engaging and cinematic, without being overloaded with unnecessary numbers or mechanics. They can last quite a while, but they almost never feel dragged out. The permanent death of your soldiers adds challenge and motivates you to play as carefully as possible.\n\nIn my opinion, the game has only two serious flaws.\nFirst, the lack of a clear sense of progression for most of the campaign. Yes, there’s a storyline and a proper ending, but the story missions often get lost among the many random encounters, and clear global objectives appear only rarely. This somewhat lowers the motivation to finish the game.\nSecond, technical issues on modern hardware. The game frequently crashes and corrupts saves. Losing dozens of hours of progress is a real risk. Even worse, in my case the game started breaking after just around ten hours of play.\n\nStill, despite these issues, XCOM: Enemy Unknown is absolutely worth playing. It’s a fun and engaging tactical game. I wouldn’t call it the best in the genre, but it’s an excellent entry point if you’re new to turn-based strategy.",

And as a video game, XCOM: Enemy Unknown fails to deliver a pleasant experience.\n\nAnd I'm gonna say right off the bat: I like difficult games. Hell, I've beaten Darkest Dungeon 3 times, Dark Souls 2 twice, Terraria Master mode god knows how many times, and so on and so forth. I like a great challenge. But my problem with this game is that it's completely up to the game if you're going to have fun or not. \n\n-\"Oh, you're at the face of the enemy and you wanna shoot him? Well, screw you, your soldier's gonna miss and die instantly\".\n-\"Oh, what's that? Your sniper has a clear shot on an uncovered enemy at the perfect angle? And he also has the high ground? Don't care, he's gonna miss and get jumped by that same enemy.\".\n\nXCOM feels like being a kid at a playground, and you're playing with that one kid that makes up rules in the middle of the game when they're losing just so they can win. No matter how versatile, careful and thoughtful is your strategy, the game can just say: \"You know what? I don't care. Now lose\".\n\nIt's a game with a cool premise: Fighting aliens, managing council interest, resources, money, soldiers, saving civilians etc. However, the combat, which is the core mechanic of the gameplay, always boils down to you praying something good happens, no matter how good your strategy is.\n\nXCOM: Enemy Unknown has been influential to the TBS genre. However, just because it's influential, doesn't mean it's automatically good (speaking as a person who's not that into TBS games). It's a game which I wish was better, and most importantly: Fun.\n\nI do not recommend getting this game. And if you do want to get this game, wait to get it on a sale where it's dirty cheap.",

You can go 7 days or more with no mission opportunity - and you can go two months without seeing a mission to a zone that's at medium to medium high (3/5 or 4/5 pips) or even most of a month at max panic, without actually even seeing a mission to GO TO that location.\n\nThe problem with this is that countries, once lost from the \"Council,\" cannot be recovered. They are just simply permanently lost - and you can lose from having too many countries leave the council, even if you never fail a mission. You might just simply not get the missions you need to be able to reduce panic level.\n\nIt would be hard, because you can supposedly lose 8 countries out of 15, without losing the game totally, but the problem I have is that the countries are nonrecoverable. The game really needs to either have the ability to station colonels and fast-response teams around the world as soon as you have colonels, to speed up satellite uplink construction and satellite manufacturing, give you 3-4 satellites to start with, or make lost countries recoverable via special missions.\n\nIt also needs to not have it come down to RNG whether or not you get a mission to a country whose panic level is maxed out.",

Hell, I've beaten Darkest Dungeon 3 times, Dark Souls 2 twice, Terraria Master mode god knows how many times, and so on and so forth. I like a great challenge.

Well, screw you, your soldier's gonna miss and die instantly\".\n-\"Oh, what's that? Your sniper has a clear shot on an uncovered enemy at the perfect angle? And he also has the high ground? Don't care, he's gonna miss and get jumped by that same enemy.\".\n\nXCOM feels like being a kid at a playground, and you're playing with that one kid that makes up rules in the middle of the game when they're losing just so they can win. No matter how versatile, careful and thoughtful is your strategy, the game can just say: \"You know what? I don't care.

However, just because it's influential, doesn't mean it's automatically good (speaking as a person who's not that into TBS games).

You can go 7 days or more with no mission opportunity - and you can go two months without seeing a mission to a zone that's at medium to medium high (3/5 or 4/5 pips) or even most of a month at max panic, without actually even seeing a mission to GO TO that location.\n\nThe problem with this is that countries, once lost from the \"Council,\" cannot be recovered. They are just simply permanently lost - and you can lose from having too many countries leave the council, even if you never fail a mission. You might just simply not get the missions you need to be able to reduce panic level.\n\nIt would be hard, because you can supposedly lose 8 countries out of 15, without losing the game totally, but the problem I have is that the countries are nonrecoverable.

Now lose\".\n\nIt's a game with a cool premise: Fighting aliens, managing council interest, resources, money, soldiers, saving civilians etc. However, the combat, which is the core mechanic of the gameplay, always boils down to you praying something good happens, no matter how good your strategy is.\n\nXCOM: Enemy Unknown has been influential to the TBS genre. However, just because it's influential, doesn't mean it's automatically good (speaking as a person who's not that into TBS games). It's a game which I wish was better, and most importantly: Fun.\n\nI do not recommend getting this game. And if you do want to get this game, wait to get it on a sale where it's dirty cheap.",
