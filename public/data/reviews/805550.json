You can't really see yourself progress, you will have to make up challenges for yourself. There's a singleplayer (practice, hotlap and a quick race + career/championship) and unranked multiplayer. Ranked multiplayer is just a race with higher stakes.\n- people online only race on Monza, Spa, Nurburgring and like 3 other tracks.\n- haven't qualified for LFM yet, but as I understand it, that's a kind of community supproted crutch for lackluster native ranked online\n- you can't report players in online servers\n- unranked servers only have a safety rating of 50 at best (out of 99 possible)",

The rating system is so so much better than iracing esp with the hell on earth that is the rookie licsence. Good livery design software. My only problem is that the setup screen is too complicated and detailed which is just an issue on my side and I hope I will understand car setups better in the future. Great car handling but could be improved on the multiplayer side. But definetly a must play for simracers and GT racing enjoyers, I recommend buying while its on sale along with some dlcs.",

The physics, the car feel, the sound, the tyre behavior... everything hits exactly the way it should.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that drags the experience down are the open lobbies full of people who have no clue how to race. Late braking is cool until they use your rear bumper as the braking marker. Because of them, grinding safety rating is a bit of a pain in the ass.\r\n\r\nBut the game itself? Absolute top tier.",

This is real racing no frills game and still is actively played. \r\n\r\nAll cars drive a little different like t hey would do in real life. The only thing to note is that this game uses real steering locks from the real cars. Look up ACC Steering locks on google to find the steering lock for every car you drive. It can be a hassle to set it up everytime you drive a different car since you cant make car specific settings besides the tuning. Altho you can save the profiles for easier switching.\r\n\r\nDef worth buying in a sale, game is \"done\". No more additions will be added so dont expect more than what you pay for.",

I did wish it was as easy as the Assetto Corsa (Orig) Wheel Wizard, but this worked for me on an old 2-pedal Logitech Wheel.\r\nAnd don't give up if you spend more time spinning off the track at the beginning - play with your TRACTION CONTROL and ABS until you get a feel for the dynamics and physics of the game.\r\nIt runs on my very old laptop with medium settings, still looks and sounds amazing!\r\nI'll never be able to afford a PS5 for GT7, but I reckon this Racing Sim is right up there with it, so enjoy, and expect to spend a LOT of time (and fun) learning new tracks and getting the realistic feel of the cars!",

The driving in Automobilista 2 is not as good, the FFB not as good but damn the collision physics and damages are amazing. The only thing that will beat this title is Project Motor Racing I think.
