Very low online, sh1t ping and FPS! (somehow, while multiplayer), some of forgotten spanish players that don't speak english will be your only enemies and ofc we'll never receive an any updates/balance patches anymore (the last one dated of 2019).\n\nDevs will close game servers for multiplayer soon, it's just a matter of time, like it was with classic AoE 3 (one year ago).",

I bought this like a year or two to re-live my childhood nostalgia, had to uninstall it for a bit, and now it is ruined. Screw you, devs. Stealing my god damn money and then corrupting the game to be unplayable.
