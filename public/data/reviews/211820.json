Frackin Universe. or they can make it simpler like mods that skip the story, you are allowed to do what you want its a sandbox game, add spicy mods if you want or don't, make it harder or easier, that's your choice, if you are struggling to find content in this game it is my humble and honest opinion you didn't look hard enough \n\n\nAdditionally i have about as much time in this game as sea of thieves and id consider them entertainment equals, with starbound having less content :) thank you for reading",

It's very charming.\nAnd goddamnit, I got pulled in by that charm. \n\n\n\nIf you want a 2D sandbox game with engaging gameplay, an endless variety of ways to play, and awesome boss fights; this isn't your game. You already know what is.\n\nBut, if you're looking for an adventure across the stars, with your faithful crew and rusty old starship, encountering odd creatures and ancient ruins, give Starbound a shot.\n\nI highly consider trying mods out, by the way.

BUT...\n\nI used to have this game on my old computer that could no longer connect to the internet. I probably had around 100 offline hours on this game and I must say, despite the lackluster story, it is a lot of fun. The building and item collecting is fun and engaging. I think that with more mods I could have made this game a lot more fun, and I strongly encourage players to get the Frackenuniverse mod. But, this game should be based upon its own merit, not upon the merit of a modded version. The music in the game is very very good and the main menu theme has been my top song on spotify for three years in a row. \n\nIt's an alright game.

Sure, there’s technically a universe that needs saving, but let's be real most of your time is spent tunneling straight into the dirt on some random planet, immediately forgetting which rock you crawled out from.\n\nNow, about those planets. \"Procedurally generated\" sounds fancy, but it really means you'll hop between a million IKEA wannabe biomes with the same three pieces of alien furniture, just in different shades. “Wow, a planet full of cacti.” Jump a bit. “Whoa, snow… and, uh, cacti again. Neat.” Somehow it’s the same, but you don’t get bored. Go figure.\n\nCombat? Oh man. It’s a hot mess, but it’s a good time. One minute you’re swinging a sword the size of a Buick, next you’re blasting a trumpet bazooka, then bam some demonic bird drops in and absolutely wrecks you. Birds in this game are like Navy SEALs with wings and unresolved trauma.\n\nNow, if you’re into building, this is where Starbound really flexes. You can go full HGTV with space castles and farms, or if you’re lazy like me just slap down a sad little dirt box and abandon it the second you see shinier terrain. But hey, if you’ve got patience, maybe you’ll build something that doesn’t look like a rejected LEGO set.\n\nLet’s talk about the penguin mafia. Yeah, you heard me. Full on space penguins in trench coats, handing out black market quests like it’s no big deal. At that point, logic just packs its bags and leaves. You’re in fever dream territory now think Minecraft, Terraria, and some weird underground art film all mashed together.\n\nBottom line Starbound is a wild, lovable mess of a space sandbox. You can go be the galaxy’s hero or just lose three hours trying to breed chickens with antennae. Honestly, both are solid life choices.",

Frackin Universe. or they can make it simpler like mods that skip the story, you are allowed to do what you want its a sandbox game, add spicy mods if you want or don't, make it harder or easier, that's your choice, if you are struggling to find content in this game it is my humble and honest opinion you didn't look hard enough \n\n\nAdditionally i have about as much time in this game as sea of thieves and id consider them entertainment equals, with starbound having less content :) thank you for reading",

I am fully capable of having a good time with it, it's a complete product I enjoy.\n\nBut it's moreso having fun IN SPITE of the game, not BECAUSE of the game. Heck, I'd hesitate to call it a 'game' rather than a 'framework'. Starbound is a game hard carried by its modding scene; the vanilla experience is wide as an ocean yet deep as a puddle: The story is little more than a galactic fetch quest, the gameplay is whatever, the combat is meh, and the world is spread so thin it doesn't have any fat to chew on.\n\nThe progression is very similar to Terraria, as in 'harvest resources in order to harvest better resources and fight bosses so you can harvest better resources'. However unlike Terraria, it doesn't feel as good precisely because it spreads itself too thin. You have no incentive to build anything, as while there is NPC housing, there are very little worthwhile rewards that come from it, and since you keep moving across the galaxy, you're rarely in one place for long enough for it to be worth it. This, coupled with the fact that there are thousands of the same planet type, you don't get endeared to the world in the same way you do with Terraria.\n\nI wasn't around much for the alpha (I joined during the Spirited Giraffe version of the beta) so I don't mind the cut content too much, but it still pains me a little. Additionally, while it's not the game itself's fault, the development behind it was problematic, featuring theft and unpaid work, but this is a review of Starbound, not Chuckle Fish themselves, so I won't go too deep. Still worth noting.\n\nThere are other games like Rimworld and Kerbal Space Program that also have their replay value hard carried by their modding scene, but those games also have a fun vanilla experience and didn't have nearly as controversial of a development phase. While I am capable of having a lot of fun with Starbound, I can't say I like the vanilla experience at all. I can't recommend a game solely for its modding scene, but there's a lot of hours to be had if you have the game and give them a go. Definitely one of those games you only every play vanilla for one playthrough and never again.\n\nNow that I think about it, this game is the polar opposite of No Man's Sky. Both are absolutely massive space sims set across the entire cosmos that launched with broken promises, yet one of them bothered to continue its development and as such blossomed into an actually complete experience with lots of vanilla hours, while the other stopped receiving updates after interest died from how shallow the game was.\n\nBut hey, if you still get this game anyway, the modding scene really is that good. Frackin' Universe gives you a much more fleshed out experience, Shellguard is a great expansion to the vanilla experience, and Galaxy in Conflict is an amazing milsim. It does pain me that there's only one universe, so you have to keep swapping the files around whenever you want to play a different universe generation mod like Arcana or GiC, and the fact that there's no mod profiles you can easily swap through is kinda sad, but what're you gonna do, because the devs aren't going to do anything, for sure.",

Sure, there is a threat, but you don't feel compelled to take care of it, because the grindy gameplay that tricks you into feeling like your not grinding as well as no indicator that this \"threat\" is really doing anything. Combat is too simple for its own good as well, making all wildlife enemies a breeze if you have a half-decent spear. Becasue of all of this, you have to install mods to give you any real directive or incentive to do directives, ie: Frackin' Universe mod. But if you want to treat the game like a sandbox you really can't, due to crafting stations needing to be upgraded with mid-to-late-game materials just to let you craft futuristic blocks and furniture.

Boring and repetitive, but doable if you're grinding out the food achievement, just make a farm near the colony.\n-Complete a specific, rare costume, where you MIGHT find one piece per galaxy, if you're lucky, and what piece you find is random.\n-Dig and carry a planet's worth of dirt (No, this will not happen organically).\n-Catch all the bugs, several of which require specific rare biomes, and one of the rare ones is effectively invisible.\n-Collect all the armor types in game, which requires many, many hours of grinding and randomly spawned merchants, who MIGHT sell you an armor piece you don't already have.\n-Collecting all the fossils, which are random. And have rarities. And a failable minigame. And only spawn underground. And there are 55 of the hateful things.\n-And, finally, the one that broke me, collecting 50 **********ing figurines. After 368.2 hours, killing every monster I saw, and grinding bosses, I had 4. And 8 hours later, after grinding more bosses (who have a higher drop-rate), I had 6. That's when I just spawned them in with console commands, because **** that. \nWhat little of this game I play in future will be entirely to hang out with friends who invite me, and, even the, I will recommend we play a different game first.",

But i'd sooner buy someone a game like terraria... or simply just go for a walk and hang out outside. do something else creative before i even consider this one and that's the truth with zero malice in my heart. I got nothin but love for this game.\n\nBut hey if you got some extra buckaroons to spare and you just wanna try something out.

Building in this game is a lot of fun, even though the hotbar is severely limited. There are SO many items you can decorate with, so there seems to be endless possibilities!\n\nBut i just had too many little annoyances that kept me from truly enjoying myself. \nThe travelling by ship mechanic is never explained. \nThe upgrading your crafting stations mechanic is never explained. \nThe main story is 5x the same process/questline but with a different race\nThe storge system is diabolical, why is there no smart stacking feature? \nIt is completely hidden how to recruit members for your ship, and even if you know, the process is tedious, repetitive and boring.  \nThe feature of placing/breaking walls is never explained. \nMoney is too scarce in the beginning, and not important in the endgame\nYou're unkillable by the time you reach the endboss\nProgression always follows the same schematic: planet -> 1 new ore -> upgrade gear and breating device -> new planet type\nThe \"riddles\" were not hard at all, although the jump and run parts and challenge portals were fun.\nThe amount of time i spend mindlessly walking on the surface of planets searching for a specific structure to \"find clues\" about a race is about 40-50% of my 30 hours of playtime. Absolutely NOT fun to search the entire planet for a avian village on the correct planet and star type, only to find out it only houses another race.\n\nThis game was fun enough for me to finish it, but i was annoyed, or felt like i was doing the same thing over and over  a lot of the time. There is more stuff to do like expand your ship (which requires A LOT of crew, which, as said, is annoying to hire!) or mess with pets or activate the arks you find in some solar systems, but the game was not fun enough for me to care.",

I am fully capable of having a good time with it, it's a complete product I enjoy.\n\nBut it's moreso having fun IN SPITE of the game, not BECAUSE of the game. Heck, I'd hesitate to call it a 'game' rather than a 'framework'. Starbound is a game hard carried by its modding scene; the vanilla experience is wide as an ocean yet deep as a puddle: The story is little more than a galactic fetch quest, the gameplay is whatever, the combat is meh, and the world is spread so thin it doesn't have any fat to chew on.\n\nThe progression is very similar to Terraria, as in 'harvest resources in order to harvest better resources and fight bosses so you can harvest better resources'. However unlike Terraria, it doesn't feel as good precisely because it spreads itself too thin. You have no incentive to build anything, as while there is NPC housing, there are very little worthwhile rewards that come from it, and since you keep moving across the galaxy, you're rarely in one place for long enough for it to be worth it. This, coupled with the fact that there are thousands of the same planet type, you don't get endeared to the world in the same way you do with Terraria.\n\nI wasn't around much for the alpha (I joined during the Spirited Giraffe version of the beta) so I don't mind the cut content too much, but it still pains me a little. Additionally, while it's not the game itself's fault, the development behind it was problematic, featuring theft and unpaid work, but this is a review of Starbound, not Chuckle Fish themselves, so I won't go too deep. Still worth noting.\n\nThere are other games like Rimworld and Kerbal Space Program that also have their replay value hard carried by their modding scene, but those games also have a fun vanilla experience and didn't have nearly as controversial of a development phase. While I am capable of having a lot of fun with Starbound, I can't say I like the vanilla experience at all. I can't recommend a game solely for its modding scene, but there's a lot of hours to be had if you have the game and give them a go. Definitely one of those games you only every play vanilla for one playthrough and never again.\n\nNow that I think about it, this game is the polar opposite of No Man's Sky. Both are absolutely massive space sims set across the entire cosmos that launched with broken promises, yet one of them bothered to continue its development and as such blossomed into an actually complete experience with lots of vanilla hours, while the other stopped receiving updates after interest died from how shallow the game was.\n\nBut hey, if you still get this game anyway, the modding scene really is that good. Frackin' Universe gives you a much more fleshed out experience, Shellguard is a great expansion to the vanilla experience, and Galaxy in Conflict is an amazing milsim. It does pain me that there's only one universe, so you have to keep swapping the files around whenever you want to play a different universe generation mod like Arcana or GiC, and the fact that there's no mod profiles you can easily swap through is kinda sad, but what're you gonna do, because the devs aren't going to do anything, for sure.",

Sure, there is a threat, but you don't feel compelled to take care of it, because the grindy gameplay that tricks you into feeling like your not grinding as well as no indicator that this \"threat\" is really doing anything. Combat is too simple for its own good as well, making all wildlife enemies a breeze if you have a half-decent spear. Becasue of all of this, you have to install mods to give you any real directive or incentive to do directives, ie: Frackin' Universe mod. But if you want to treat the game like a sandbox you really can't, due to crafting stations needing to be upgraded with mid-to-late-game materials just to let you craft futuristic blocks and furniture. With the addition to mechs that do nothing but pad out the non-story gameplay part of the game means that the devs are aware of these problems and are not directly fixing them.\n\nI only like this game because of nostalgia at this point.\n3/10",

FUCK THIS GAME!!!!! it takes forever to get anything done! all i've been doing is digging, fighting, starving, dying and look for crystals. rinse and repeat, even on the most easiest mode, this game is still ruthless, all the random ass creatures keep coming at you, so many times i was hoping to find some more food, medicine, better weapons or armor, you know, anything useful! BUT NO!!! just enemies, enemies, enemies, oh hey look, some people, nope more enemies. great, yeah, exactly what i needed MORE ENEMIES!!! and the fact that the developers added a hardcore mode; has got to be some kinda of trolling. you die easily in this game! theirs no way in hell your character will live long. i do not recommend this game, unless, you like to digitally torture your self. i regret buying this game!",

There are much better 2D Sandbox Survival games that respect their artists and modders out there that I'd recommend more.",

I don't know if Windows updates ruined it but the game refuses to launch in a stable resolution full screen now.  I can't stand playing games using a \"window\" and know this wasn't an issue prior.  \r\n\r\nTried multiple resolutions; manually configuring the game files but it would either change the default back to 800 x 600 upon launch or generate a new config file ignoring the old.  Such a shame because it was fun to play.  Just be warned that you might be wasting $$\r\n\r\nApparently the internet is full of forums similar to my experience...  shame",

I remember trying this for the first time back then, and I found the game desolate, repetitive, and needlessly grindy.\n\nI decided to give it another try yesterday, because surely 10 years is enough to iron out all the flaws. I dug all the way to the core of the planet. I did the first dungeon and beat the first story boss. The game feels as desolate and empty as ever, and the echoey music just helps amplify that feeling. UI is awful, combat is awful, building is... serviceable but awkward because of how little you can place on the hotbar, forcing you to manually pick up items from the inventory items. Yes, people say \"the mods are great\" but that doesn't say anything good for the game itself. I wouldn't recommend buying this game even on sale, this is a game designed to waste your time, and not in a fun way.",

This one is tough cuz i do truly love this game\n\nHowever i dont find myself wanting to come back super often. i usually need like a good year or two of a break before i even want to or think about coming back to it. All my memories of the game are fun. But after a couple days of playing i usually find myself a bit overwhelmed with... too many choices i guess? There so so so much you can do in the universe you play in. which kinda makes everything you do feel kinda lack luster. I have friends who've beat the game but they don't come back to it the way they will for other games. \n\nLets put it this way. If you have some friends and yall have gone nothing to do and you want a fun game to play with them. This is your game. OR if you like to be alone... like in real life. If you're going through a rough time and you wanna dissociate and just get away. Get lost in something for awhile. This is the game for that. It can be exhilarating at times if you fully fully immerse yourself. But Would i recommend this game to someone...?\n\nNo i don't think i would. This is a Good, fun, enjoyable, creative, and unique game! Truly I mean that and i cherish the experiences i had with it. But i'd sooner buy someone a game like terraria... or simply just go for a walk and hang out outside. do something else creative before i even consider this one and that's the truth with zero malice in my heart. I got nothin but love for this game.\n\nBut hey if you got some extra buckaroons to spare and you just wanna try something out. You can get a good week or two of fun with this game before you get bored. Go for it! itll be worth the money. You could spend the same amount on a fast food meal and be less satisfied, get me?",

It was fun exploring all the planets and different races. Music and sound design worked well, and i Loved the little outpost area: so full of life! Building in this game is a lot of fun, even though the hotbar is severely limited. There are SO many items you can decorate with, so there seems to be endless possibilities!\n\nBut i just had too many little annoyances that kept me from truly enjoying myself. \nThe travelling by ship mechanic is never explained. \nThe upgrading your crafting stations mechanic is never explained. \nThe main story is 5x the same process/questline but with a different race\nThe storge system is diabolical, why is there no smart stacking feature? \nIt is completely hidden how to recruit members for your ship, and even if you know, the process is tedious, repetitive and boring.  \nThe feature of placing/breaking walls is never explained. \nMoney is too scarce in the beginning, and not important in the endgame\nYou're unkillable by the time you reach the endboss\nProgression always follows the same schematic: planet -> 1 new ore -> upgrade gear and breating device -> new planet type\nThe \"riddles\" were not hard at all, although the jump and run parts and challenge portals were fun.\nThe amount of time i spend mindlessly walking on the surface of planets searching for a specific structure to \"find clues\" about a race is about 40-50% of my 30 hours of playtime. Absolutely NOT fun to search the entire planet for a avian village on the correct planet and star type, only to find out it only houses another race.\n\nThis game was fun enough for me to finish it, but i was annoyed, or felt like i was doing the same thing over and over  a lot of the time. There is more stuff to do like expand your ship (which requires A LOT of crew, which, as said, is annoying to hire!) or mess with pets or activate the arks you find in some solar systems, but the game was not fun enough for me to care.",
