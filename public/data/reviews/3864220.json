OMG THE ANIMALS ARE WAY TOO CUTE!!!!\nI would appreciate if they added a better \"pet the animal animation\", although it's not necessary, it's just a little something that would just make the game perfect.\nIt is a demo, and for some things you can feel it, but it's very polished, and I honestly wouldn't mind playing it as is. \nThe devs have also been updating the demo constantly, which gives me great hope for this game!!\nHonestly can't wait to play the full version soon\nRECOMMENDED FOR SURE!!",

The art style and animation flows so naturally and I love the concepts the devs are striving for.\n\n\nThings I hope to see in the final product:\n\n- less animation locks; they are not common but I love the way watering doesn't take several seconds to do one plot and wish more animation locks, such as picking up items off the ground or crafting at the workbench, were instant or took a fraction of a second.\n\n- strangers to close friends dialogue! I would talk to someone for the first time and they would treat me as if we've been besties for years; it felt forced and with how amazing the devs are trying to make relationships in this game I think this small fix would add so much depth. I want to feel like I earned their trust and friendship, not like I'm the main character of a kid's anime. I love it when characters are rude, distant, or mistrustful of me from the start because it adds so much backstory to their personalities and feels much more realistic.\n\n- skateboard mechanic feels a little clunky getting on/off the skateboard. It would feel much better if there were no animation lock because it's easy to crash into things while dismounting and feels like I'm wasting a little bit of time. Similarly, I wish the skateboard turned faster; it's difficult to naviagte some areas of the city. Need more control of where the skateboard is going and being able to turn quickly would feel so smooth and a whole lot cooler!\n\n\nI'm excited to see how this game is on release.",

There's a lot of QOL stuff in this that others don't have (like how harvesting and planting work) and I appreciate that. \n\nThere's not too many negatives I have to say and the ones I do have are mainly just personal opinion/preferences:\n1) The devs should add a twirl jump for the rollerblades as the skateboard jumping just felt so much more fun for traversing the island. On that note, they should add a small feature that you can grind on ledges, although that might be too much, so I'll take a skateboard wheelie/manual instead.\n2) I wish customization at the start was a bit better ie. you can choose hair colour, but I assume that was just for the demo. \n3) Combat felt a tad weak as the one time I fought something it was a squirrel and it was very slow and didn't pose much of a threat. \n4) There's a lack of partner candidates in this who I enjoy, which may be a good thing so that there's less choice, but still- it's very rare for a game to have only one person MAYBE two that I'm interested in. (Zerine my beloved) \n\nPhenomenal demo overall and highly recommend trying it out! \n\nStreams when I played it (Live thoughts):\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/2608296579 \nhttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/2611599059 \nhttps://youtube.com/live/6-eQf45GZgs \nhttps://youtube.com/live/czs_PlwnBdg \n\nTier list stream with the game (More detailed review):\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/videos/2613427869\nhttps://youtube.com/live/uyNKP1hWnBw",

And also the camera movement in building mode is a bit tricky to use.\nOf course apart from the good things, there's also the downside, which is:\n- You can't freely choose the color of your hair and makeup. This has impact to certain color skin (especially the darker one) which makes them incompatible with the current makeup color. I think this one is pretty important if you guys planning to include darker skin color in the final release later.\n- The trial session is too short *sob* T^T)/ AAAAAAAA",

Granted, it is just a demo but you can get an idea of where they're trying to go with it. The crafting and exploration seem to be the main focus of it at them moment where their combat and farming seem to fall behind.

Will progress from the demo carry over to the full release? Also, how many players will be able to play together in multiplayer mode?

The art design and decor for all the locations, characters etc. is really well done, everything looks so adorable.\n- Game mechanics are good and they work. Getting around is easy, there is lots to do.\n- Dialogues seem polished already. The characters have a personality that makes you want to remember them, which is something a lot of games struggle with these days with their generic ChatGPT bs.\n- There is loads of customization, both for yourself, clothes (you can save and rapidly swap 5 outfits) as well as your plot (can use house templates, make your own from parts or use someone else's layout by searching for it).\n- Coop isn't in the demo, but the final game will have one.\n\nCons:\n- Loading times for the initial game and transition to the mine map and back take really long, but that's expected for a demo. Pretty sure this will get optimized. The game is stable so that's not an issue.\n- They use a gear wheel to hold your tools, which is fine and all, but it seems to be the ONLY way to put stuff in your hand. This means that you have to constantly go through inventory -> map to gear wheel for every single use item you want to use in the game, then put your gear wheel back how you wanted it. There needs to be a way to equip something in your hand directly from the inventory without having to go through the gear wheel. The gear wheel should also have numbered shortcuts so you can use it like a hotbar.\n\nOverall, this is what a demo / early access game should look like, not the bug infested and content devoid cashgrab a lot of games pull these days.",

I've been really enjoying the demo and I think the game is coming along very nicely! I've encountered a few bugs but not very often and nothing too major (mostly audio issues, like sounds of rain being very loud and playing even in clear weather), I assume they'll be fixed by release. I will definitely buy and play the full version.\n\nHere's some things I noted down while playing for a fuller picture:\n\n[b]What I liked:[/b]\n✦ The graphics, obviously.\n✦ Being able to save basically anywhere, anytime.\n✦ The ability to build whole premade houses is AWESOME - I'm an awful builder and I want to have a nice big home lol\n✦ Houseboats! \n✦ Building looks very detailed, there's a lot of different parts.\n✦ The map is very big but imo it doesn't feel too empty, even though there aren't a lot of NPCs around.\n✦ Villagers gift me back and seem to remember what I gifted them and mention it in conversation.\n✦ Tourists frequently give gifts when talking to them too.\n✦ The little \"parkour\" challenges around the map.\n✦ Can pet dogs, cats, bunnies, squirrels, capybaras, pandas...\n✦ There's a lot of modes of transportations - mounts, motorcycles, skateboards, rollerblades and more\n✦ The little detailed animations and smooth transitions, like characters moving chairs to sit, putting down my watering can, actually using the water pump and picking the can back up, putting the skateboard on the ground and picking it back up... I could go ON AND ON, I really, really love appreciate all these little details!\n\n[b]What I'd like changed:[/b]\n✦ There's currently no way to change key bindings.\n✦ Limited character creation - all hairstyles and eye styles (there's different iris+pupil graphics) are set colours - like long black hair, short blonde hair with a headband, etc. I hope in the full version we'll be able to change the colours.\n✦ I'd love if hats and accessories were separate from outfits for more mix & matching.\n✦ I find the tool wheel too small, I hope we can expand it via an upgrade.\n✦ Dialogue feels stiff/unnatural in a lot of places. Idk if it's AI writing or issues with translation/localization (like calling a stranger Auntie, then the stranger telling me to call her Auntie).\n✦ I want more things to consume stamina, like pulling out weeds, gathering, crafting... I feel like I do a lot and I still have over 80% of my stamina by the end of day. There's so many ways to replenish and reduce stamina use and I just have no need for them so far. Maybe a difficulty setting?\n✦ Getting money feels too easy too, I think partially because plants grow in a day or less even without fertilizer.\n✦ Some NPCs look very similar and a lot of them have blonde hair. I actually confused 2 characters when doing quests. I think more hair colour/skin colour variety would help.\n✦ Too few romanceable men compared to women. I'd also really like some guys with facial hair. At least a stubble.\n✦ One of the characters, Zerine, got a MAJOR redesign and I liked her look from kickstarter WAY more.",

The fishing is so fun and smooth / simple. The visuals omg are SO pretty. I have a potato for a pc and it still looks amazing on lower settings. It's amazingly open world you can walk in places without loading times. I love the phone aspect with the camera and taking selfies.. You can interact with pretty much everything you see. You can even STEAL STUFF LOL. I'm extremely impressed with this game so far!! The building looks really free as well, its giving me vibes that you can build to your hearts content and I love how you can open windows, turn light switches on and off, open doors and how free it is moving around your house and back outside and the little animation of getting in and out of bed is so cute with your little pjs. \n\nThe only thing that bothered me was the customisation of your character! I wanted the longer hair in a brown shade and I wanted certain eyes with different colours etc etc, I really hope they will add more stuff like this, stuff more detailed! I want the juicer lip gloss lips with the fangs aswell and more eye shape options would be really nice!! \n\nAnother thing I noticed is my hair / clothes would clip through the lounges at the beach so it would be nice to get that fixed to make it more immersive! \n\nIve a feeling this is gonna be my GOTY 2026 already",

I'm not very far in, but I absolutely love how much there is to do in this so far. I understand a lot of people don't care for fetch quests or gathering because it can get tedious. However, this game is right up my alley. I also like the relationship/friendship mechanic in this game. It doesn't feel too difficult to earn people's affection and it's not completely a requirement. Plus, I adore that they give you presents back! That's the big thing that always felt missing to me. It really helps the characters feel more like people rather than NPCs.\n\nUnfortunately, there are SOME problems with it, but nothing too awful. It's expected because it's a demo. So, I won't be too harsh about them. One of the biggest problems for me is that I'm still experiencing lag or random stutters, despite having it on low settings. It also sucks to have such low settings because I really want to appreciate the beauty of this game. Another issue is that trees, shrubs, and other objects are randomly popping in and out of existence. Again, to be expected, but it's strange considering that I'm on the lower settings. \n\nThis is more of a nitpick, but I wish the camera could be in a fixed position or can go through assets. I was trying to fish near a stone bridge, but there was a shrub above me that kept getting in the way. It doesn't make the game unplayable, but it is hard to find good vantage points. \n\nFinally, I wish you could have a shortcut to open your bag. It's not a hassle to open up your phone to get to it, but I've gotten used to press a button to open my map or bag. Although, considering all the buttons on the PS5 are being used, I wouldn't be shocked if there just wasn't enough \"room\" for it.\n\nThat's really it. This game seems very promising and adorable. It has it's own uniqueness that it doesn't feel like a copy and paste of every other cozy game out there. Defintely would recommend, even with all the small issues. Can't wait to see more!",

      "review": "I approached this game with cautious optimism, but the demo has confirmed several of my initial concerns. My biggest worry was that the gameplay might not offer much novelty and would instead lean heavily on the familiar, overused cozy farming-sim formula—and unfortunately, the demo largely reinforces that impression.\n\nFor instance, the farming and animal-raising systems feel underdeveloped. You simply grow crops or raise animals and then sell everything directly to NPC vendors—any vendor, in fact. Even the tutorial encourages this bare-bones loop. I would have loved to see more depth here: perhaps more systems for processing goods, fulfilling contracts, or using a dedicated “farmer’s app” that could introduce more strategy and serve as the primary (or even sole) income source.\n\nThe cooking and stamina mechanics also feel somewhat unengaging. A more dynamic system—similar to what games like Valheim or Enshrouded utilize—could make cooking and eating more purposeful. For example, we could have a natural stamina regeneration that is slow and capped, with food providing long-lasting boosts to regen rate and maximum stamina. A similar approach could work for health, adding another layer of decision-making.\n\nThe in-game economy would also benefit from a careful balance pass. While this is only a demo and many values are likely placeholder, it’s worth noting that cozy games don’t need to be “effortlessly easy.” Some level of challenge—or at least optional difficulty settings—can go a long way toward keeping progression satisfying.\n\nThat said, the game does introduce some genuinely promising features:\n-The DIY creation system, along with the ability to share and use community-made designs, is a standout addition.\n-Relationship-building appears to have more depth and potential than what is typical for the genre.\n-There’s an impressive variety of vehicles and mounts.\n-Animal husbandry seems more nuanced, with animals contributing meaningfully to your farm—rabbits clearing weeds, for example.\n\nBeyond mechanics, the game is visually stunning. The animations are charming, and small touches—like your character changing into pajamas before going to bed—add polish. Overall, the presentation gives the impression of a higher-budget production than many others in this genre.",

      "review": "The world design is beautiful, the atmosphere is relaxing. Character designs are cute. The game has potential. \n\nGameplay, however, is clunky -- character movement doesn't feel fluid, and various mechanics just don't seem very intuitive or enjoyable. Animations don't flow well into other animations; jumping especially just feels bad. \n\nThe vehicle system seems interesting, but the world is simply too laggy for it at this stage. Textures pop in and fps tanks when you ride a motorcycle. Not exactly fun. \n\nThere's bugs and unfinished areas, including a few empty houses with walk-through walls. \n\nCharacter customization leaves a lot to be desired. It currently doesn't have many options. \n\nThe previous points are things that could well be fixed in the full release. The game is slated for a Q1 2026 release, and there's time for polish. \n\nWhat concerns me the most, though, is the dialogue and the amount of machine translation used in the demo. \nThe demo does have a disclaimer about the usage of machine-assisted translations, but they seem to have used a fair bit of it. \n\nLong bits of text (like character intro cards in the menu) are fatiguing to read due to the lack of localisation. It's not always fully clear when characters request things from the player outside of the mainline quests (and when they do, the requests often bug out). \n\nNPCs appear soulless because they don't speak like actual people. It remains to be seen whether that's due to the lack of localisation or if it's simply poor writing. Games like this are carried by their NPCs, and I hope the devs put actual work into the localisation and writing of them. Currently you can meet an NPC, talk to them once, gift them something in the same conversation, and they'll tell you that they appreciate you always giving them so many gifts.\n\nThe cozy games genre appeals to people who are incredibly kind and lenient with their games, and often devs take advantage of this by cutting corners. So far, the demo has left me anxious that this is another case of it. \nI've been looking forward to this game for a long time, and as a massive cozy genre enjoyer I really, REALLY hope the full release will be one I can recommend. :(",

      "review": "To be honest, I do love this game, but I just cannot only praise it because I'm so sick and tired of praising EA and demos, only to get a disappointing full release.\n\nThe movement feels weird. Initially, I didn't know how to word it, but after getting the skateboard, I figured that it's because the game is trying to make me look and feel like I'm going fast when I'm actually not. If the in-game time gets shortened in the full release, this would be super frustrating.\nI've ridden skateboards before and that made me feel like I'm speedy, but my character in this game keeps pushing the skateboard to go faster and it barely does. The game makes it painfully funny because they give you the visual effects of going fast.\nThe swimming is also painfully slow. The river is actually pretty 'thin' but the swimming speed makes it feel like a lake. I'd rather not have the ability to swim.\n\nThe city is beautiful and really gives you the feeling of lived-in and loved community, the insides of buildings are gorgeous, there are plenty of free stuff you can pick up, the villagers and tourists even give you gifts even from Day 1. It is absolutely one of the more cozy and actually heartwarming games with welcoming characters ever.\nBut the sprawling nature surrounding it, which is where you would collect resources outside of your small farm, while beautiful even at low graphics, is unfortunately mostly empty. It was why you would eventually notice that your character moves weirdly slow.\nThey also have this minigame where you would stand and walk on the railings and jump from one to another. It should be very easy to do, but the weirdness of the character movement actually forces you to be very careful of it to do the minigame. It's not something you have to be careful about in normal gameplay, but the minigame really draws attention to it.\n\nThis game has a stamina bar as well, and it's surprisingly pretty generous right from the beginning, but we'll have to see if that remains in the full release. They also allow you to recover energy at 1 stamina (and more if you upgrade) per 1 in-game minute by sitting, which is really nice!\nBut, oh man, replenishing stamina through eating is kinda painful at the beginning (with the items that understandably replenish very little) because you either stand there for minutes, pushing mushrooms and berries down your throat, or you're in your inventory menu opening the sub-menu of the consumable to click 'eat' then you open the sub-menu again and click eat again and again and again...\nCrafting on the workbench is also painful in the same sense. It's like Animal Crossing New Horizons where each item gets their own animation. I almost quit the demo when I had to craft the tools one by one and decided to push through it since not all production benches (furnace, charcoal kiln, cooking pot, etc) is as painful.\n\nI'll proceed with the other features, like farming, fishing, logging, mining, catching bugs, 'hunting' animals, livestock raising, I swear. Let's go!\nI won't comment on logging and mining much. It's fortunately standard. Farming is also mostly the same with some minor tweaks like crops growing within in-game hours and weeds growing in the farmlands.\nCatching bugs is also technically the same, but clicking catch when the pop-up appears doesn't actually guarantee a catch, and you can catch bugs even without the pop-up appearing. I'd appreciate if the pop-up just doesn't appear at all or the bug catching be less about running after the bugs or making myself dizzy because the bug keeps circling around me so I have to keep rotating the camera.\nFishing is actually pretty fun! Unfortunately, it bugged out for me. The hook lands far away from me and made fishing harder.\n'Hunting' animals is pretty interesting because they don't really allow you to 'hunt'. You're just incapacitating animals to capture and find new homes for them. But at least the animals, or at least the rabbits, are surprisingly useful because they would remove weeds from your farmlands, albeit for limited times per day.\nAs for livestock raising, it's still pretty standard with the feeding, affection levels, and juvenile and adult statuses. But it does have the interesting feature where each animal has their own positive stat, such as being 'strong' allows them to be ready for breeding again a day earlier than other animals.\n\nSpeaking of affection levels, the characters are quite nice and likable in many ways. Unfortunately, I cannot understand them sometimes as I am a scum who doesn't know Japanese.\nI have to admit that I actually don't know much about them since I didn't want to read the dialogue. There's actually quite a lot of them, even for the tourists! They're all chatty.\n\nAs for other features that involve the NPCs, they have this Mentor System where you have to do quests for some NPCs (they're all romanceable characters, I think?) to get their approval of your expertise or something like that. Upgrading your level unlocks skills for farming, crafting, etc., which basically reduces stamina, increases chances of something happening, or giving your fun surprises for doing those activities.\nIt's actually... pretty nice! They're mostly fetch quests that are fortunately not super grindy. Kinda wish the currency for upgrading skills isn't used for anything else though.\n\nAnother complaint that I have is that the rain is just so heavy. It's the 'I need to pray for my safety' kind of heavy rain.\n\nOnce again, I want to reiterate that I love the game and I only wish for it to fix these little things because they do pile up and I don't want such minor things to ruin the full release of the game because it looks sooo promising!\nEspecially for me who's using a trashy and old gaming laptop, yet this game still runs and looks pretty well on the lowest graphic settings, and it doesn't make my laptop heat up like a boiling kettle.\nPlease become better.

Using vehicles to get around town instead of running around like a madman? Building presets in addition to building my house the shitty way? Hell yeah.\n\nI'm biased to anime aesthetics so this could be an easy recommendation from me but NOT with the game's current state. Few of my complaints are:\n\n- Give the villagers more diversity. Take Graminova, Aurelis, Loren, and Solana for example. They look like lost twins because they share the same pale skin and blond hair. And they look like they're on the same age!\n- The women have different, noticeable personalities and characteristics than men, so maybe balance that please? \n- Did u guys remove Delphin's tan in the game???????? Why make him tan in his promotional images when you end up whitewashing him?\n- Optimise the game, please please PLEASE!!! The world loads way too long, it might be because I don't have the ability to change the graphic settings.\n- I play primarily on Steam Deck. While it says the game's compatibility is unknown, it runs okay. But again, the game needs serious optimisation because I get around 18-40fps. Not cool.\n- The quest can be a little too overwhelming. I just talked to Delphin to get my fishing certification and then he just gave me more quests AND said something sounding like it's been a while since he saw me when I'm... right there standing in front of him???? Give the quests some cooldown time. Make them send a letter the day after, saying something like 'congrats on ur fishing certification! Now come meet me at the pier. I have something for your first fishing assignment.'\n- I'm a bit hopeful that the full release of the island won't have this much of tourists. I'd rather have a small town filled with villagers I'd LOVE getting to know than see the island slowly getting gentrified lol.\n- If u guys plan to make tourists to give side quests, make them slightly different from the generic ones.\n- I just hope u guys dont mean 'AI' when u put a disclaimer saying there's a machine translation in the game.\n\nPlease don't take this thumbs down review as an insult. I still believe the full release will be better than this and I'm looking forward to it. With the demo period ending soon, I hope u guys can take the players' complaints into consideration and work to deliver the game the way you advertise it :) Cheers",

      "review": "I approached this game with cautious optimism, but the demo has confirmed several of my initial concerns. My biggest worry was that the gameplay might not offer much novelty and would instead lean heavily on the familiar, overused cozy farming-sim formula—and unfortunately, the demo largely reinforces that impression.\n\nFor instance, the farming and animal-raising systems feel underdeveloped. You simply grow crops or raise animals and then sell everything directly to NPC vendors—any vendor, in fact. Even the tutorial encourages this bare-bones loop. I would have loved to see more depth here: perhaps more systems for processing goods, fulfilling contracts, or using a dedicated “farmer’s app” that could introduce more strategy and serve as the primary (or even sole) income source.\n\nThe cooking and stamina mechanics also feel somewhat unengaging. A more dynamic system—similar to what games like Valheim or Enshrouded utilize—could make cooking and eating more purposeful. For example, we could have a natural stamina regeneration that is slow and capped, with food providing long-lasting boosts to regen rate and maximum stamina. A similar approach could work for health, adding another layer of decision-making.\n\nThe in-game economy would also benefit from a careful balance pass. While this is only a demo and many values are likely placeholder, it’s worth noting that cozy games don’t need to be “effortlessly easy.” Some level of challenge—or at least optional difficulty settings—can go a long way toward keeping progression satisfying.\n\nThat said, the game does introduce some genuinely promising features:\n-The DIY creation system, along with the ability to share and use community-made designs, is a standout addition.\n-Relationship-building appears to have more depth and potential than what is typical for the genre.\n-There’s an impressive variety of vehicles and mounts.\n-Animal husbandry seems more nuanced, with animals contributing meaningfully to your farm—rabbits clearing weeds, for example.\n\nBeyond mechanics, the game is visually stunning. The animations are charming, and small touches—like your character changing into pajamas before going to bed—add polish. Overall, the presentation gives the impression of a higher-budget production than many others in this genre.",

      "review": "The world design is beautiful, the atmosphere is relaxing. Character designs are cute. The game has potential. \n\nGameplay, however, is clunky -- character movement doesn't feel fluid, and various mechanics just don't seem very intuitive or enjoyable. Animations don't flow well into other animations; jumping especially just feels bad. \n\nThe vehicle system seems interesting, but the world is simply too laggy for it at this stage. Textures pop in and fps tanks when you ride a motorcycle. Not exactly fun. \n\nThere's bugs and unfinished areas, including a few empty houses with walk-through walls. \n\nCharacter customization leaves a lot to be desired. It currently doesn't have many options. \n\nThe previous points are things that could well be fixed in the full release. The game is slated for a Q1 2026 release, and there's time for polish. \n\nWhat concerns me the most, though, is the dialogue and the amount of machine translation used in the demo. \nThe demo does have a disclaimer about the usage of machine-assisted translations, but they seem to have used a fair bit of it. \n\nLong bits of text (like character intro cards in the menu) are fatiguing to read due to the lack of localisation. It's not always fully clear when characters request things from the player outside of the mainline quests (and when they do, the requests often bug out). \n\nNPCs appear soulless because they don't speak like actual people. It remains to be seen whether that's due to the lack of localisation or if it's simply poor writing. Games like this are carried by their NPCs, and I hope the devs put actual work into the localisation and writing of them. Currently you can meet an NPC, talk to them once, gift them something in the same conversation, and they'll tell you that they appreciate you always giving them so many gifts.\n\nThe cozy games genre appeals to people who are incredibly kind and lenient with their games, and often devs take advantage of this by cutting corners. So far, the demo has left me anxious that this is another case of it. \nI've been looking forward to this game for a long time, and as a massive cozy genre enjoyer I really, REALLY hope the full release will be one I can recommend. :(",

      "review": "I approached this game with cautious optimism, but the demo has confirmed several of my initial concerns. My biggest worry was that the gameplay might not offer much novelty and would instead lean heavily on the familiar, overused cozy farming-sim formula—and unfortunately, the demo largely reinforces that impression.\n\nFor instance, the farming and animal-raising systems feel underdeveloped. You simply grow crops or raise animals and then sell everything directly to NPC vendors—any vendor, in fact. Even the tutorial encourages this bare-bones loop. I would have loved to see more depth here: perhaps more systems for processing goods, fulfilling contracts, or using a dedicated “farmer’s app” that could introduce more strategy and serve as the primary (or even sole) income source.\n\nThe cooking and stamina mechanics also feel somewhat unengaging. A more dynamic system—similar to what games like Valheim or Enshrouded utilize—could make cooking and eating more purposeful. For example, we could have a natural stamina regeneration that is slow and capped, with food providing long-lasting boosts to regen rate and maximum stamina. A similar approach could work for health, adding another layer of decision-making.\n\nThe in-game economy would also benefit from a careful balance pass. While this is only a demo and many values are likely placeholder, it’s worth noting that cozy games don’t need to be “effortlessly easy.” Some level of challenge—or at least optional difficulty settings—can go a long way toward keeping progression satisfying.\n\nThat said, the game does introduce some genuinely promising features:\n-The DIY creation system, along with the ability to share and use community-made designs, is a standout addition.\n-Relationship-building appears to have more depth and potential than what is typical for the genre.\n-There’s an impressive variety of vehicles and mounts.\n-Animal husbandry seems more nuanced, with animals contributing meaningfully to your farm—rabbits clearing weeds, for example.\n\nBeyond mechanics, the game is visually stunning. The animations are charming, and small touches—like your character changing into pajamas before going to bed—add polish. Overall, the presentation gives the impression of a higher-budget production than many others in this genre.",

Currently you can meet an NPC, talk to them once, gift them something in the same conversation, and they'll tell you that they appreciate you always giving them so many gifts.\n\nThe cozy games genre appeals to people who are incredibly kind and lenient with their games, and often devs take advantage of this by cutting corners. So far, the demo has left me anxious that this is another case of it. \nI've been looking forward to this game for a long time, and as a massive cozy genre enjoyer I really, REALLY hope the full release will be one I can recommend. :(",

There is also no graphical options to edit besides brightness. \n2. It's extremely blurry. It's almost like some form of upscaling is used by default.\n3. Very liberal use of machine translated text. \n4. Insane character naming restrictions. I literally could not name my character Ice (my typical handle in all of the games) as it was \"restricted word\". I am not a child, let me name my characters whatever I want. \n\nAll in all I am very disappointed. I see nothing in this game that says that it shouldn't run on a Steamdeck at 45 fps with 2-3 hours of gametime and instead it has performance issues similar to the rest of AAA industry.

      "review": "To be honest, I do love this game, but I just cannot only praise it because I'm so sick and tired of praising EA and demos, only to get a disappointing full release.\n\nThe movement feels weird. Initially, I didn't know how to word it, but after getting the skateboard, I figured that it's because the game is trying to make me look and feel like I'm going fast when I'm actually not. If the in-game time gets shortened in the full release, this would be super frustrating.\nI've ridden skateboards before and that made me feel like I'm speedy, but my character in this game keeps pushing the skateboard to go faster and it barely does. The game makes it painfully funny because they give you the visual effects of going fast.\nThe swimming is also painfully slow. The river is actually pretty 'thin' but the swimming speed makes it feel like a lake. I'd rather not have the ability to swim.\n\nThe city is beautiful and really gives you the feeling of lived-in and loved community, the insides of buildings are gorgeous, there are plenty of free stuff you can pick up, the villagers and tourists even give you gifts even from Day 1. It is absolutely one of the more cozy and actually heartwarming games with welcoming characters ever.\nBut the sprawling nature surrounding it, which is where you would collect resources outside of your small farm, while beautiful even at low graphics, is unfortunately mostly empty. It was why you would eventually notice that your character moves weirdly slow.\nThey also have this minigame where you would stand and walk on the railings and jump from one to another. It should be very easy to do, but the weirdness of the character movement actually forces you to be very careful of it to do the minigame. It's not something you have to be careful about in normal gameplay, but the minigame really draws attention to it.\n\nThis game has a stamina bar as well, and it's surprisingly pretty generous right from the beginning, but we'll have to see if that remains in the full release. They also allow you to recover energy at 1 stamina (and more if you upgrade) per 1 in-game minute by sitting, which is really nice!\nBut, oh man, replenishing stamina through eating is kinda painful at the beginning (with the items that understandably replenish very little) because you either stand there for minutes, pushing mushrooms and berries down your throat, or you're in your inventory menu opening the sub-menu of the consumable to click 'eat' then you open the sub-menu again and click eat again and again and again...\nCrafting on the workbench is also painful in the same sense. It's like Animal Crossing New Horizons where each item gets their own animation. I almost quit the demo when I had to craft the tools one by one and decided to push through it since not all production benches (furnace, charcoal kiln, cooking pot, etc) is as painful.\n\nI'll proceed with the other features, like farming, fishing, logging, mining, catching bugs, 'hunting' animals, livestock raising, I swear. Let's go!\nI won't comment on logging and mining much. It's fortunately standard. Farming is also mostly the same with some minor tweaks like crops growing within in-game hours and weeds growing in the farmlands.\nCatching bugs is also technically the same, but clicking catch when the pop-up appears doesn't actually guarantee a catch, and you can catch bugs even without the pop-up appearing. I'd appreciate if the pop-up just doesn't appear at all or the bug catching be less about running after the bugs or making myself dizzy because the bug keeps circling around me so I have to keep rotating the camera.\nFishing is actually pretty fun! Unfortunately, it bugged out for me. The hook lands far away from me and made fishing harder.\n'Hunting' animals is pretty interesting because they don't really allow you to 'hunt'. You're just incapacitating animals to capture and find new homes for them. But at least the animals, or at least the rabbits, are surprisingly useful because they would remove weeds from your farmlands, albeit for limited times per day.\nAs for livestock raising, it's still pretty standard with the feeding, affection levels, and juvenile and adult statuses. But it does have the interesting feature where each animal has their own positive stat, such as being 'strong' allows them to be ready for breeding again a day earlier than other animals.\n\nSpeaking of affection levels, the characters are quite nice and likable in many ways. Unfortunately, I cannot understand them sometimes as I am a scum who doesn't know Japanese.\nI have to admit that I actually don't know much about them since I didn't want to read the dialogue. There's actually quite a lot of them, even for the tourists! They're all chatty.\n\nAs for other features that involve the NPCs, they have this Mentor System where you have to do quests for some NPCs (they're all romanceable characters, I think?) to get their approval of your expertise or something like that. Upgrading your level unlocks skills for farming, crafting, etc., which basically reduces stamina, increases chances of something happening, or giving your fun surprises for doing those activities.\nIt's actually... pretty nice! They're mostly fetch quests that are fortunately not super grindy. Kinda wish the currency for upgrading skills isn't used for anything else though.\n\nAnother complaint that I have is that the rain is just so heavy. It's the 'I need to pray for my safety' kind of heavy rain.\n\nOnce again, I want to reiterate that I love the game and I only wish for it to fix these little things because they do pile up and I don't want such minor things to ruin the full release of the game because it looks sooo promising!\nEspecially for me who's using a trashy and old gaming laptop, yet this game still runs and looks pretty well on the lowest graphic settings, and it doesn't make my laptop heat up like a boiling kettle.\nPlease become better.

So far, the demo has left me anxious that this is another case of it. \nI've been looking forward to this game for a long time, and as a massive cozy genre enjoyer I really, REALLY hope the full release will be one I can recommend. :(",

      "review": "To be honest, I do love this game, but I just cannot only praise it because I'm so sick and tired of praising EA and demos, only to get a disappointing full release.\n\nThe movement feels weird. Initially, I didn't know how to word it, but after getting the skateboard, I figured that it's because the game is trying to make me look and feel like I'm going fast when I'm actually not. If the in-game time gets shortened in the full release, this would be super frustrating.\nI've ridden skateboards before and that made me feel like I'm speedy, but my character in this game keeps pushing the skateboard to go faster and it barely does. The game makes it painfully funny because they give you the visual effects of going fast.\nThe swimming is also painfully slow. The river is actually pretty 'thin' but the swimming speed makes it feel like a lake. I'd rather not have the ability to swim.\n\nThe city is beautiful and really gives you the feeling of lived-in and loved community, the insides of buildings are gorgeous, there are plenty of free stuff you can pick up, the villagers and tourists even give you gifts even from Day 1. It is absolutely one of the more cozy and actually heartwarming games with welcoming characters ever.\nBut the sprawling nature surrounding it, which is where you would collect resources outside of your small farm, while beautiful even at low graphics, is unfortunately mostly empty. It was why you would eventually notice that your character moves weirdly slow.\nThey also have this minigame where you would stand and walk on the railings and jump from one to another. It should be very easy to do, but the weirdness of the character movement actually forces you to be very careful of it to do the minigame. It's not something you have to be careful about in normal gameplay, but the minigame really draws attention to it.\n\nThis game has a stamina bar as well, and it's surprisingly pretty generous right from the beginning, but we'll have to see if that remains in the full release. They also allow you to recover energy at 1 stamina (and more if you upgrade) per 1 in-game minute by sitting, which is really nice!\nBut, oh man, replenishing stamina through eating is kinda painful at the beginning (with the items that understandably replenish very little) because you either stand there for minutes, pushing mushrooms and berries down your throat, or you're in your inventory menu opening the sub-menu of the consumable to click 'eat' then you open the sub-menu again and click eat again and again and again...\nCrafting on the workbench is also painful in the same sense. It's like Animal Crossing New Horizons where each item gets their own animation. I almost quit the demo when I had to craft the tools one by one and decided to push through it since not all production benches (furnace, charcoal kiln, cooking pot, etc) is as painful.\n\nI'll proceed with the other features, like farming, fishing, logging, mining, catching bugs, 'hunting' animals, livestock raising, I swear. Let's go!\nI won't comment on logging and mining much. It's fortunately standard. Farming is also mostly the same with some minor tweaks like crops growing within in-game hours and weeds growing in the farmlands.\nCatching bugs is also technically the same, but clicking catch when the pop-up appears doesn't actually guarantee a catch, and you can catch bugs even without the pop-up appearing. I'd appreciate if the pop-up just doesn't appear at all or the bug catching be less about running after the bugs or making myself dizzy because the bug keeps circling around me so I have to keep rotating the camera.\nFishing is actually pretty fun! Unfortunately, it bugged out for me. The hook lands far away from me and made fishing harder.\n'Hunting' animals is pretty interesting because they don't really allow you to 'hunt'. You're just incapacitating animals to capture and find new homes for them. But at least the animals, or at least the rabbits, are surprisingly useful because they would remove weeds from your farmlands, albeit for limited times per day.\nAs for livestock raising, it's still pretty standard with the feeding, affection levels, and juvenile and adult statuses. But it does have the interesting feature where each animal has their own positive stat, such as being 'strong' allows them to be ready for breeding again a day earlier than other animals.\n\nSpeaking of affection levels, the characters are quite nice and likable in many ways. Unfortunately, I cannot understand them sometimes as I am a scum who doesn't know Japanese.\nI have to admit that I actually don't know much about them since I didn't want to read the dialogue. There's actually quite a lot of them, even for the tourists! They're all chatty.\n\nAs for other features that involve the NPCs, they have this Mentor System where you have to do quests for some NPCs (they're all romanceable characters, I think?) to get their approval of your expertise or something like that. Upgrading your level unlocks skills for farming, crafting, etc., which basically reduces stamina, increases chances of something happening, or giving your fun surprises for doing those activities.\nIt's actually... pretty nice! They're mostly fetch quests that are fortunately not super grindy. Kinda wish the currency for upgrading skills isn't used for anything else though.\n\nAnother complaint that I have is that the rain is just so heavy. It's the 'I need to pray for my safety' kind of heavy rain.\n\nOnce again, I want to reiterate that I love the game and I only wish for it to fix these little things because they do pile up and I don't want such minor things to ruin the full release of the game because it looks sooo promising!\nEspecially for me who's using a trashy and old gaming laptop, yet this game still runs and looks pretty well on the lowest graphic settings, and it doesn't make my laptop heat up like a boiling kettle.\nPlease become better.

Using vehicles to get around town instead of running around like a madman? Building presets in addition to building my house the shitty way? Hell yeah.\n\nI'm biased to anime aesthetics so this could be an easy recommendation from me but NOT with the game's current state. Few of my complaints are:\n\n- Give the villagers more diversity. Take Graminova, Aurelis, Loren, and Solana for example. They look like lost twins because they share the same pale skin and blond hair. And they look like they're on the same age!\n- The women have different, noticeable personalities and characteristics than men, so maybe balance that please? \n- Did u guys remove Delphin's tan in the game???????? Why make him tan in his promotional images when you end up whitewashing him?\n- Optimise the game, please please PLEASE!!! The world loads way too long, it might be because I don't have the ability to change the graphic settings.\n- I play primarily on Steam Deck. While it says the game's compatibility is unknown, it runs okay. But again, the game needs serious optimisation because I get around 18-40fps. Not cool.\n- The quest can be a little too overwhelming. I just talked to Delphin to get my fishing certification and then he just gave me more quests AND said something sounding like it's been a while since he saw me when I'm... right there standing in front of him???? Give the quests some cooldown time. Make them send a letter the day after, saying something like 'congrats on ur fishing certification! Now come meet me at the pier. I have something for your first fishing assignment.'\n- I'm a bit hopeful that the full release of the island won't have this much of tourists. I'd rather have a small town filled with villagers I'd LOVE getting to know than see the island slowly getting gentrified lol.\n- If u guys plan to make tourists to give side quests, make them slightly different from the generic ones.\n- I just hope u guys dont mean 'AI' when u put a disclaimer saying there's a machine translation in the game.\n\nPlease don't take this thumbs down review as an insult. I still believe the full release will be better than this and I'm looking forward to it. With the demo period ending soon, I hope u guys can take the players' complaints into consideration and work to deliver the game the way you advertise it :) Cheers",

      "review": "I approached this game with cautious optimism, but the demo has confirmed several of my initial concerns. My biggest worry was that the gameplay might not offer much novelty and would instead lean heavily on the familiar, overused cozy farming-sim formula—and unfortunately, the demo largely reinforces that impression.\n\nFor instance, the farming and animal-raising systems feel underdeveloped. You simply grow crops or raise animals and then sell everything directly to NPC vendors—any vendor, in fact. Even the tutorial encourages this bare-bones loop. I would have loved to see more depth here: perhaps more systems for processing goods, fulfilling contracts, or using a dedicated “farmer’s app” that could introduce more strategy and serve as the primary (or even sole) income source.\n\nThe cooking and stamina mechanics also feel somewhat unengaging. A more dynamic system—similar to what games like Valheim or Enshrouded utilize—could make cooking and eating more purposeful. For example, we could have a natural stamina regeneration that is slow and capped, with food providing long-lasting boosts to regen rate and maximum stamina. A similar approach could work for health, adding another layer of decision-making.\n\nThe in-game economy would also benefit from a careful balance pass. While this is only a demo and many values are likely placeholder, it’s worth noting that cozy games don’t need to be “effortlessly easy.” Some level of challenge—or at least optional difficulty settings—can go a long way toward keeping progression satisfying.\n\nThat said, the game does introduce some genuinely promising features:\n-The DIY creation system, along with the ability to share and use community-made designs, is a standout addition.\n-Relationship-building appears to have more depth and potential than what is typical for the genre.\n-There’s an impressive variety of vehicles and mounts.\n-Animal husbandry seems more nuanced, with animals contributing meaningfully to your farm—rabbits clearing weeds, for example.\n\nBeyond mechanics, the game is visually stunning. The animations are charming, and small touches—like your character changing into pajamas before going to bed—add polish. Overall, the presentation gives the impression of a higher-budget production than many others in this genre.",

Textures pop in and fps tanks when you ride a motorcycle. Not exactly fun. \n\nThere's bugs and unfinished areas, including a few empty houses with walk-through walls. \n\nCharacter customization leaves a lot to be desired.

But it does have the interesting feature where each animal has their own positive stat, such as being 'strong' allows them to be ready for breeding again a day earlier than other animals.\n\nSpeaking of affection levels, the characters are quite nice and likable in many ways. Unfortunately, I cannot understand them sometimes as I am a scum who doesn't know Japanese.\nI have to admit that I actually don't know much about them since I didn't want to read the dialogue. There's actually quite a lot of them, even for the tourists! They're all chatty.\n\nAs for other features that involve the NPCs, they have this Mentor System where you have to do quests for some NPCs (they're all romanceable characters, I think?) to get their approval of your expertise or something like that. Upgrading your level unlocks skills for farming, crafting, etc., which basically reduces stamina, increases chances of something happening, or giving your fun surprises for doing those activities.\nIt's actually... pretty nice! They're mostly fetch quests that are fortunately not super grindy. Kinda wish the currency for upgrading skills isn't used for anything else though.\n\nAnother complaint that I have is that the rain is just so heavy. It's the 'I need to pray for my safety' kind of heavy rain.\n\nOnce again, I want to reiterate that I love the game and I only wish for it to fix these little things because they do pile up and I don't want such minor things to ruin the full release of the game because it looks sooo promising!\nEspecially for me who's using a trashy and old gaming laptop, yet this game still runs and looks pretty well on the lowest graphic settings, and it doesn't make my laptop heat up like a boiling kettle.\nPlease become better.

Using vehicles to get around town instead of running around like a madman? Building presets in addition to building my house the shitty way? Hell yeah.\n\nI'm biased to anime aesthetics so this could be an easy recommendation from me but NOT with the game's current state. Few of my complaints are:\n\n- Give the villagers more diversity. Take Graminova, Aurelis, Loren, and Solana for example. They look like lost twins because they share the same pale skin and blond hair. And they look like they're on the same age!\n- The women have different, noticeable personalities and characteristics than men, so maybe balance that please? \n- Did u guys remove Delphin's tan in the game???????? Why make him tan in his promotional images when you end up whitewashing him?\n- Optimise the game, please please PLEASE!!! The world loads way too long, it might be because I don't have the ability to change the graphic settings.\n- I play primarily on Steam Deck. While it says the game's compatibility is unknown, it runs okay. But again, the game needs serious optimisation because I get around 18-40fps. Not cool.\n- The quest can be a little too overwhelming. I just talked to Delphin to get my fishing certification and then he just gave me more quests AND said something sounding like it's been a while since he saw me when I'm... right there standing in front of him???? Give the quests some cooldown time. Make them send a letter the day after, saying something like 'congrats on ur fishing certification! Now come meet me at the pier. I have something for your first fishing assignment.'\n- I'm a bit hopeful that the full release of the island won't have this much of tourists. I'd rather have a small town filled with villagers I'd LOVE getting to know than see the island slowly getting gentrified lol.\n- If u guys plan to make tourists to give side quests, make them slightly different from the generic ones.\n- I just hope u guys dont mean 'AI' when u put a disclaimer saying there's a machine translation in the game.\n\nPlease don't take this thumbs down review as an insult. I still believe the full release will be better than this and I'm looking forward to it. With the demo period ending soon, I hope u guys can take the players' complaints into consideration and work to deliver the game the way you advertise it :) Cheers",

      "review": "I approached this game with cautious optimism, but the demo has confirmed several of my initial concerns. My biggest worry was that the gameplay might not offer much novelty and would instead lean heavily on the familiar, overused cozy farming-sim formula—and unfortunately, the demo largely reinforces that impression.\n\nFor instance, the farming and animal-raising systems feel underdeveloped. You simply grow crops or raise animals and then sell everything directly to NPC vendors—any vendor, in fact. Even the tutorial encourages this bare-bones loop. I would have loved to see more depth here: perhaps more systems for processing goods, fulfilling contracts, or using a dedicated “farmer’s app” that could introduce more strategy and serve as the primary (or even sole) income source.\n\nThe cooking and stamina mechanics also feel somewhat unengaging. A more dynamic system—similar to what games like Valheim or Enshrouded utilize—could make cooking and eating more purposeful. For example, we could have a natural stamina regeneration that is slow and capped, with food providing long-lasting boosts to regen rate and maximum stamina. A similar approach could work for health, adding another layer of decision-making.\n\nThe in-game economy would also benefit from a careful balance pass. While this is only a demo and many values are likely placeholder, it’s worth noting that cozy games don’t need to be “effortlessly easy.” Some level of challenge—or at least optional difficulty settings—can go a long way toward keeping progression satisfying.\n\nThat said, the game does introduce some genuinely promising features:\n-The DIY creation system, along with the ability to share and use community-made designs, is a standout addition.\n-Relationship-building appears to have more depth and potential than what is typical for the genre.\n-There’s an impressive variety of vehicles and mounts.\n-Animal husbandry seems more nuanced, with animals contributing meaningfully to your farm—rabbits clearing weeds, for example.\n\nBeyond mechanics, the game is visually stunning. The animations are charming, and small touches—like your character changing into pajamas before going to bed—add polish. Overall, the presentation gives the impression of a higher-budget production than many others in this genre.",

      "review": "The world design is beautiful, the atmosphere is relaxing. Character designs are cute. The game has potential. \n\nGameplay, however, is clunky -- character movement doesn't feel fluid, and various mechanics just don't seem very intuitive or enjoyable. Animations don't flow well into other animations; jumping especially just feels bad. \n\nThe vehicle system seems interesting, but the world is simply too laggy for it at this stage. Textures pop in and fps tanks when you ride a motorcycle. Not exactly fun. \n\nThere's bugs and unfinished areas, including a few empty houses with walk-through walls. \n\nCharacter customization leaves a lot to be desired. It currently doesn't have many options. \n\nThe previous points are things that could well be fixed in the full release. The game is slated for a Q1 2026 release, and there's time for polish. \n\nWhat concerns me the most, though, is the dialogue and the amount of machine translation used in the demo. \nThe demo does have a disclaimer about the usage of machine-assisted translations, but they seem to have used a fair bit of it. \n\nLong bits of text (like character intro cards in the menu) are fatiguing to read due to the lack of localisation. It's not always fully clear when characters request things from the player outside of the mainline quests (and when they do, the requests often bug out). \n\nNPCs appear soulless because they don't speak like actual people. It remains to be seen whether that's due to the lack of localisation or if it's simply poor writing. Games like this are carried by their NPCs, and I hope the devs put actual work into the localisation and writing of them. Currently you can meet an NPC, talk to them once, gift them something in the same conversation, and they'll tell you that they appreciate you always giving them so many gifts.\n\nThe cozy games genre appeals to people who are incredibly kind and lenient with their games, and often devs take advantage of this by cutting corners. So far, the demo has left me anxious that this is another case of it. \nI've been looking forward to this game for a long time, and as a massive cozy genre enjoyer I really, REALLY hope the full release will be one I can recommend. :(",

I know it's definitely not representative of the customization they'll have in the full game, but even so, the options were weak. \n\nThe menus felt a little overwhelming and you're just bombarded with so much stuff from the get-go, I'd prefer it if they slowly introduced all of things you can do. \n\nSorry, I'm not particularly great at putting all of my thoughts clearly and concisely, but I saw all the hype around this game and the demo left me not even caring about keeping up with it.",

Very liberal use of machine translated text. \n4. Insane character naming restrictions.

I am not a child, let me name my characters whatever I want. \n\nAll in all I am very disappointed.

      "review": "To be honest, I do love this game, but I just cannot only praise it because I'm so sick and tired of praising EA and demos, only to get a disappointing full release.\n\nThe movement feels weird. Initially, I didn't know how to word it, but after getting the skateboard, I figured that it's because the game is trying to make me look and feel like I'm going fast when I'm actually not. If the in-game time gets shortened in the full release, this would be super frustrating.\nI've ridden skateboards before and that made me feel like I'm speedy, but my character in this game keeps pushing the skateboard to go faster and it barely does. The game makes it painfully funny because they give you the visual effects of going fast.\nThe swimming is also painfully slow. The river is actually pretty 'thin' but the swimming speed makes it feel like a lake. I'd rather not have the ability to swim.\n\nThe city is beautiful and really gives you the feeling of lived-in and loved community, the insides of buildings are gorgeous, there are plenty of free stuff you can pick up, the villagers and tourists even give you gifts even from Day 1. It is absolutely one of the more cozy and actually heartwarming games with welcoming characters ever.\nBut the sprawling nature surrounding it, which is where you would collect resources outside of your small farm, while beautiful even at low graphics, is unfortunately mostly empty. It was why you would eventually notice that your character moves weirdly slow.\nThey also have this minigame where you would stand and walk on the railings and jump from one to another. It should be very easy to do, but the weirdness of the character movement actually forces you to be very careful of it to do the minigame. It's not something you have to be careful about in normal gameplay, but the minigame really draws attention to it.\n\nThis game has a stamina bar as well, and it's surprisingly pretty generous right from the beginning, but we'll have to see if that remains in the full release. They also allow you to recover energy at 1 stamina (and more if you upgrade) per 1 in-game minute by sitting, which is really nice!\nBut, oh man, replenishing stamina through eating is kinda painful at the beginning (with the items that understandably replenish very little) because you either stand there for minutes, pushing mushrooms and berries down your throat, or you're in your inventory menu opening the sub-menu of the consumable to click 'eat' then you open the sub-menu again and click eat again and again and again...\nCrafting on the workbench is also painful in the same sense. It's like Animal Crossing New Horizons where each item gets their own animation. I almost quit the demo when I had to craft the tools one by one and decided to push through it since not all production benches (furnace, charcoal kiln, cooking pot, etc) is as painful.\n\nI'll proceed with the other features, like farming, fishing, logging, mining, catching bugs, 'hunting' animals, livestock raising, I swear. Let's go!\nI won't comment on logging and mining much. It's fortunately standard. Farming is also mostly the same with some minor tweaks like crops growing within in-game hours and weeds growing in the farmlands.\nCatching bugs is also technically the same, but clicking catch when the pop-up appears doesn't actually guarantee a catch, and you can catch bugs even without the pop-up appearing. I'd appreciate if the pop-up just doesn't appear at all or the bug catching be less about running after the bugs or making myself dizzy because the bug keeps circling around me so I have to keep rotating the camera.\nFishing is actually pretty fun! Unfortunately, it bugged out for me. The hook lands far away from me and made fishing harder.\n'Hunting' animals is pretty interesting because they don't really allow you to 'hunt'. You're just incapacitating animals to capture and find new homes for them. But at least the animals, or at least the rabbits, are surprisingly useful because they would remove weeds from your farmlands, albeit for limited times per day.\nAs for livestock raising, it's still pretty standard with the feeding, affection levels, and juvenile and adult statuses. But it does have the interesting feature where each animal has their own positive stat, such as being 'strong' allows them to be ready for breeding again a day earlier than other animals.\n\nSpeaking of affection levels, the characters are quite nice and likable in many ways. Unfortunately, I cannot understand them sometimes as I am a scum who doesn't know Japanese.\nI have to admit that I actually don't know much about them since I didn't want to read the dialogue. There's actually quite a lot of them, even for the tourists! They're all chatty.\n\nAs for other features that involve the NPCs, they have this Mentor System where you have to do quests for some NPCs (they're all romanceable characters, I think?) to get their approval of your expertise or something like that. Upgrading your level unlocks skills for farming, crafting, etc., which basically reduces stamina, increases chances of something happening, or giving your fun surprises for doing those activities.\nIt's actually... pretty nice!
