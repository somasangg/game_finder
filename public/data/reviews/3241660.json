The devs are extremely impressive with constant updates being released, frequent Q&As, and strong engagement with the community through suggestions and feedback.\r\n\r\nThe physics mixed with proximity chat and the unique abilities and characteristics of each monster make it extremely entertaining and fun with mates. We planned on playing the base game and then moving on to modded, but with the frequency of the updates and the content, we have not found a need to try modded yet.\r\n\r\nIf you want a game that delivers laughs, chaos, and chill sessions with friends, this is it.

The gameplay is simple: pick up junk, run from monsters, die. Repeat. It’s like a simulator of real life, but more honest. The monsters are a whole separate nightmare. They spawn out of thin air, from bushes, behind your back, and probably from your childhood trauma. Their only mission: destroy all your hopes and dreams.\r\nYou find valuable loot?\r\nThe game goes: “OH GREAT, TIME TO EAT THE PLAYER.”\r\nSometimes the balance feels like it was made by someone who hates happiness. But that’s exactly why the game is fun. Because when you do survive and bring back a bunch of junk to sell, you feel like a strategic mastermind (even though it was probably just luck).\r\nThe game might look simple, but it has a weird charm. It’s like it keeps saying:\r\n“You thought this would be easy? Lol no.”\r\n\r\n[h3] My rating: 8/10. [/h3]\r\n[h3] A wonderful game if you like collecting stuff, running, panicking, and fearing for your virtual life. [/h3]\r\n[h3] Highly recommended, but prepare your nerves in advance. [/h3]",

It's the sort of thing I think of as friendslop, where the fun comes from hanging out with your friends while the game occupies you all with silly physics shenanigans.

The monster and player designs do a great job of blending goofiness with genuine scares.

While that, you shouldnt not get detected by the monsters, which are chasing you. So far there are only 4 different levels and a lot different hunter types.\nFor an early access game, it's really very well done.

      "review": "[h1] R.E.P.O.; the most funniest game when playing with friends, yet quite a good scary one when playing solo [/h1]\r\n\r\n[b] Note before you read: Those are my personal opinions and views of the Game. [/b]\r\n\r\nRepo is, next to Lethal Company, one of the most funniest but also quite the most horrifying multiplayer game when playing with friends and solo. Multiplayer.. obviously the horror gets replaced with lots of funny moments with your friends, but when playing solo, it has quite a chilling atmosphere and with mods (love that the devs openly support mods, that's so awesome) even a lot more better!\r\n\r\n[h3] Graphics and Atmosphere [/h3]\r\n\r\nSimilar like in Lethal Company, it has an old-school PS1-PS2 Look when you keep the pixelation on the highest setting (of course you can lower it when you have difficulty seeing anything with the filter). Me, who grew up with an PS2, love the old feel the game gives when playing on high pixelation. But without the pixelation, the game is a really simple, yet really good looking game that doesnt need high Triple A Standard Graphics to be an good game. The Atmosphere of the Game (when playing solo) immediately drags you into the feeling of dread with the excellent ambient and sound design. However with playing friends.. not as much but still quite chilling.\r\n\r\n[h3] Gameplay [/h3]\r\n\r\nGameplay? Very simple like in Lethal Company. Collect Stuff, bring it to the Extractions and try to survive. What i love about this, you can use items you find to be able to damage the enemies and if lucky, kill them. You either play stealthy or you become a babarian.. which you can become either way when getting guns in the shop lol. When playing with Friends, the game turns quickly into an good shitshow. Accidentally smashing an cup to an friend and kill them. The amount of times i've laughed when me and my friends killed each other accidentally x'D.\r\n\r\n[h3] Devs and Community [/h3] \r\n\r\nDevs? Amazing with regular videos of Game Updates, QnA's and even simply reacting to what the community creates. It's rare seeing Devs actually caring about their Playerbase and even join the fun the community creates. The Community is very creative with modding, how they play the game (that includes speedrunning and simply giving gameplay tactics and tipps) and even in the artistic ways. Dozens of many creative individuals in this community!\r\n\r\n[h3] My Final Thoughts [/h3] \r\n\r\nRepo is one of my favorite Indie Multiplayer Game i regularly play with my friends, when they are available. Even when playing solo, the game is very fun. It can become frustrating in some cases tho. Aside, the community is very creative and the Devs full-on support mods. I can't wait for any future updates and hope the Devs have a lot of fun interacting with the community and keep giving the game updates! A solid 10/10 Game!\r\n\r\n- Link",

      "review": "TLDR: Easily at LEAST an 8/10 game. \n\nWhether its laughing your ass off with friends or being scared shitless when playing solo, this game has it all. Don't be fooled by its Lethal Company like gameplay like I was originally, these two games are completely different. While I did receive this game for free, knowing what I do about the game now I would have no doubt in my mind bought this game full price. Repo isn't a friend-slop like SOME [i]others[i] (peak, content warning, etc.) aka its main gimmick doesn't revolve around being with friends, though if you want a happier experience instead of a scarier one, than having friends is a must. There's also consistent updates too where YOU the player can have an influence on the outcome of. The developers also regularly interact with the fanbase which is always a plus. \n\nNow I've only mainly played with friends or solo, rarely touching the online mode. So if you are looking for a review on the community or its toxicity level, this isn't the right review. But what I can tell you is that it gets playing with a friends and playing solo perfectly. When playing with friends there is always something happening. It could be perfectly timed moments, or that feeling of dread when your friend walks into another room and he suddenly stops talking, whatever it is, your almost guaranteed a 'fun' time. Solo, on the other hand, is also amazing. Instead of the lightheartedness you'd expect you are greeted with a much more horrifying experience. While I can't give you the exact reasons why solo is so horrifying other than the obvious, the point is that it turns into a fully fledged horror game. Whatever playstyle is your go to, this games got it covered.\n\nMods. The game is fairly easy to mod and has a very active modding community. So even if one part of the game doesn't fit quite right with you, or you get bored, you can always change it. I personally don't use mods as I'm still having a lot of fun with the game as is but I can see myself down the road modding the game a little bit to add that extra bit of fun.\n\nWhile this game review has been mostly positive, others might not like this game for a few specific reasons.\n\n1. Since the game is based on repeated gameplay, its not for everyone, some people who I have played the game with got bored of it almost immediately because it wasn't stimulating enough.\n\n2. Friendly Fire. In this game it is really easy to sabotage teammates. So if you got a bad batch of friends, it can be hard to even enjoy the game, this isn't really the games fault but it can be a major turn off that it does exist and will happen to you at some point.\n\n3. Social media. Ever since this game blew up on social media seeing all the funny clips people think that the entire game will be like this. This is just plain wrong though and to get really funny clips like this you will have to play for a bit.\n\nWhether you agree with these statements or not doesn't matter. What does matter is that this game overall is an amazingly fun time and is definitely worth the buy. Even if you don't end up liking it all too well you can always refund the game though I seriously recommend playing for at least an hour or two because that's around the time the game really shines.",

      "review": "[b]I decided to check out R.E.P.O. because, well, everyone and their grandma was posting about it. You know how it goes: trending everywhere, gotta see what the fuss is about. And yeah, it’s got flashes of “this could be fun,” but also enough quirks to make you raise an eyebrow (or ten).\n\nWhat grabbed me first was how fast-paced and chaotic things get. There’s an energy to the matches that feels raw: weapons fire, grenades fly, and decisions are split-second. When things go right, you and your squad breaching a room, nails hitting the wall, hearts pounding, enemies dropping, there’s a real sense of \"we did it, lads.\" It’s the kind of rush that makes you remember why shooters can be so addictive.\n\nBut here’s where R.E.P.O. stumbles: sometimes the chaos is too chaotic. Guns feel inconsistent; a spray-and-pray might work once and flop the next time. Match balance can swing wildly, one moment you’re dominating, the next you’re getting fragged by someone who moves like they’ve got a jetpack. The learning curve and randomness make it tough to feel like skill is always rewarded. On top of that, a few bugs and lag spikes popped up during my sessions, nothing catastrophic, but enough to remind me that this game is still a bit rough around the edges.\n\nAll jokes aside, R.E.P.O. is a “love-it-or-leave-it” type game. For a casual go-at-it-with-friends shoot-em-up, it’s got some fun in it. Just don’t go in expecting the most polished shooter out there, treat it more like a wobbly roller-coaster: exciting, unpredictable, and maybe a little nauseating after a while. If you’ve got time to spare and tolerance for mayhem, give it a shot. But if you're picky about balance and consistency, maybe hold the trigger finger.[/b]",

You can’t just pick up the goods; you have to carefully carry or drag them. This single mechanic turns every extraction into a synchronized tragedy. You spend half the run whispering about a monster's location, and the other half screaming because your teammate just clipped a massive statue on a doorway, sending it crashing into a wall and reducing its value to that of a damp sock.\n\nThe proximity chat, of course, enhances the absolute chaos.

It removes stealth as a viable option, which was the core defensive mechanic and what made REPO unique in this genre.\n\nWhen playing solo, you might as well restart your run, since hiding becomes impossible. Loom always knows where you are, relentlessly tracks you down, and either kills you outright or triggers other monsters. Even in the best scenarios, dealing with her feels tedious, and the game often throws in a second monster alongside her, making every encounter stressful and unfun.\n\nHer health pool is absurd for how annoying she is to deal with. Six hundred HP in level 2 is ridiculous.\n\nStealth has always been a huge part of REPO’s charm. The Duck and Huntsman combo was funny yet manageable; both were dangerous but could only find you through sight or sound, letting you strategically avoid them. Loom, on the other hand, makes zero noise, alerts every enemy to your location, one-shots you through doors, and completely removes the stealth element that made the game special.

This game had so much potential to be an enjoyable and replayable game but with the October 2025 update- it seems absolutely unredeemable. \r\nInstead of finding new and interesting ways to raise the difficulty in the game, the devs have added a bunch of random new monsters who range from childishly easy to 'rip your hair out' difficulties. The two main monsters I hold issue with are the green ghost (who moves to fast to shoot and I've yet to kill) and the bug (who once touches you, prevents you from defending yourself in any capacity and leads to a quick gameover). \r\nNot to mention now instead of having a few monsters spawning every thirty seconds or so now there are four spawning in the same room as you. \r\nThe other glaring issue with this game is it's godawful RNG and shop spawns. With a bad string of luck that has you replaying level 1 ten times before making it to level 2, it doesn't exactly feel fair. The highest level I was able to reach in the newest update was 11 but it was completely unenjoyable. While you could laugh and mess around with friends before, there is absolutely no margin for error now. \r\nIt seems the devs focus completely on the social media and community aspect of the game forgetting the most important part of that... being the game. Adding a dozen new unbeatable monsters and a dozen new holes in the floor seems pretty lazy in terms of creating a more difficult game. \r\nI've been waiting for a year for this game to get better but the devs seem more focused on raking in new customers to disappoint.",

They all seem to have some sort of aim bot included. Meet them once in an unfortunate situation: dead. Because a blind man obiously never misses with his shotgun. Try to get back to extraction: you can't. Enemy keeps patrolling constantly on the only exit route. That's pure frustration. I'd also reconsider the respawning option: why not just have your friends respawn when you find them. Sitting there watching others struggle is also no fun. This is a game. Let us play not watch.

Among other \"friendslop\" games it does stand out as much as it can among the countless other 1-4 player \"go in and grab stuff\" games. However it has a few serious flaws in its design.\r\n\r\nMany monsters are functionally impossible to counter in a serious way unless you get decently far in, and they can do absolutely unmitigated damage to the items you've collected in the process. The choice often comes down to either losing outright or letting the monster destroy everything in your cart, which depending on how greedy you are (I myself am greedy on a biblical level, so put all my valuables in one cart) can make the round impossible to pass.\r\n\r\nAlongside that there is a serious balance issue. There should not be the possibility of the \"make noise or you die\" monster coinciding with the \"don't make noise or you die\" monster in the same round, as a general example of the kind of problems that can arise. The number of enemies that spawn is very inconsistent and you will frequently find some monsters spawning in groups of 3 of the same monster, which for a monster like the gnomes can lead to literal armies of gnomes attacking you.\r\n\r\nI know some people go doomguy and dominate high level runs where dozens of monsters might be attacking at all times, but I feel like a game like this really would shine if it focused less on spiky non-linear difficulty progression where a lot of the emergent behavior is how cRaAaZy the match gets when 3 psychics, 2 trudges, a scarecrow and now the flying kid on a tricycle that can fly around, stunlock you and kill 2 or more players in one activation. Instead I really wish, and hope to find in the future, that they would lean more in on both limiting the number of monsters and which ones can spawn simultaneously. \r\n\r\nI like this game, and I really wanna love it but in the state it's in I just can't :/",

HES A PAIN IN THE ASS. id rather take the 3 headman glitch because at least its easier to avoid/fight them! i wish it was more enjoyable. the tick HAS GOT TO GO. that little shit is too much. its not \"just slam it down\" cuz trust me I DO. it doesn't work 100% of the time. you don't get enough health back. it doesn't work period. also getting the bat in this game is SO RARE to me at this point. also why are we able to hit ourselves with range items? i almost landed in the pit. yes some accidents are funny but it gets incredibly annoying VERY fast. the items we get in the game ill start with upgrades, yes they became less expensive i remember a video of you saying this but now im running to cheaper items or not enough items to afford certain upgrades that i would NEED to move forward. one game me and my friend didn't get strengths and we made it to level 6. idk about you but uhh. its quite hard. there's gotta be more consistency with things in the shop. the weapons? again bat is a rare thing. where are the guns? and if we do have guns they're not gonna work that well because of the wicked health levels these enemies have. ESPECIALLY THE LONGER YOU GO. i miss how it used to be. again its still somewhat fun but come on now.. also screw the head snatcher. there's a lot of unfair things in this game. i dont recommend getting unless you want to set yourself up to fail 90% of the time",

When you fail, the game still doesn't reward you in any way for getting far, apart from deleting your progress. No exp or Character level, no points for customizing robots, or for minor upgrades/bonuses... Simply theres still no goals to climb up. There are no difficulty option or other custom settings for Casual players, or game modes.

The map is too small, movement is janky.

So many situations your run is over 10min ago becaused you didnt bring a item to a certain spot or the shop didnt spawn the right types of upgrades aka streigh.

Overall it is just too many things that is annoying to deal with for a fun game to mess around with friends. Last but not least the game has proc chat I assume I am ment to talk in game to have fun with friends instead of just communicating, but almost all the mobs react to sounds. A well done example of this is agin leath, the only enemy that reacts to sounds is the eyeless dogs that only spawn after dark you inside you can scream, shot and bm as much as you want.

Problem is, this difficulty isn't what makes this game fun. It's not the kind of harsh but fair learning curve you'd expect from a singleplayer roguelike, but instead a tedious and at times frankly inconsistent brutality that detracts from the main aspects of the experience and oftentimes prevents you from creating said fun moments.\nIt would greatly benefit from a light adjustment in tedious game elements, such as starting with no stamina and getting exhausted after a few seconds, only to regen in half a minute (you will die a lot, so this initial, pre-upgrades state is the one you spend the most time in) and focusing more on what players find light-hearted and amusing\nOther adjustments that I could suggest involve scaling economy with amount of players, fixing hits through walls and doors, FOV slider, and SETTING A DIFFERENT KEY FOR SLIDE to prevent sliding into holes when you're trying to crouch",

      "review": "Ehn, I'm recommending against it specifically because the solo gameplay is no fun and the multiplayer is just 'ok'. My first time playing was with friends and we had a decently fun time. Definitely better than Lethal Company. So I decided to play solo similar to how I treated Lethal Company and while I'd say that Lethal Company's systems aren't very good at all and even less fun, this game is bad for other reasons.\n\nNumber 1 being sound design. I think some of the enemies in this game literally don't make sound, while others you can't hear until they're in the same room with you. It makes it so that how you deal with threats is almost purely reactionary. This is one place where Lethal Company wins out actually since it's sound design is surprisingly good and helps you assess threats before you even know they are there. In R.E.P.O. I am not even sure if there is an enemy spawn in sound and this is after I read the wiki. Maybe I just missed a mention there, but I went through and read about all the enemies after frustratingly dealing with them.\n\nThe physics based item collection is actually a great idea, but in practice... well it's still not bad. In multiplayer at least. In solo it feels good too, but only until an enemy decides to smash into the cart and oh, there goes all the valuables. So you have to always park the cart off to the side because the map design is...\n\nWell really that brings us to level design. What level design? Like Lethal Company, it's just a lot of proc gen rooms. There's rarely anything of note in any particular room aside from the obvious items you're supposed to collect for one thing. But more importantly, the levels aren't really designed with the monsters in mind. Lethal company doesn't do it much better, but at least you can sorta predict what enemies you're dealing with. But regardless, the levels aren't actually made to house the monsters. Instead the levels exist and the monsters are made regardless of the levels. They're made to be 'dynamic'. Which means that on one hand, sometimes you will get lucky and there will be a pit and you can just nudge some enemies into the pit making them trivial. I don't understand why the rooms don't serve more function somehow. Aside from the occasional questionably useful laser beam that is. The stars of the show are always the monsters, but why does level design have to suffer as a result of that? And I say that in spite of the monster design being actually very poor. In multiplayer it's more like you're pest control and in singleplayer the monsters function horribly. I have hidden in a cabinet with the door closed and the headman just decided to see me anyway.\n\nUnder other circumstances though the level design will be a terrible hallway with no cover or anything. And you'd like to think that having hiding spots might be nice, but no, not really. A lot of the times the way the monsters detect you means that hiding spots are a noob trap. Really, if you don't know exactly how the monsters function, you might be signing your death warrant trying to hide under a desk. It really makes me wonder what is even the point. Are you meant to accidentally get screwed by the physics because 'lol funny physics!' and that's it? Cause I get it if that's the case, but then why even offer solo? Cause 'having the ability to play solo is better than nothing' right? That's the idea?\n\nYes and that's literally it. The game isn't made for solo it's made for multiplayer. But even with multiplayer it becomes kind of trivial. The only way the game can even challenge you is to overwhelm or cheat you. And by the time you're that good, you'll be bored of the game. Is this even meant to be horror?\n\n\nHonestly when playing solo I catch glimpses of something fun. It can feel cozy and tense, but then something really dumb will happen and ruin it all. Back up into a door without checking. Suddenly die to enemy one shot. Need to go through balloons, balloon boy spawns and intercepts you and you don't get the cart to the side fast enough so there go all your valuables. Death head spots you and nips you, physics tossing you into a high corner where you can't get out fast enough to avoid the next hit. Reaper enemy corners you because you were just slightly unaware. Well now you're dead.\n\nAlso enemies have an automatic detection sphere for some reason? So even if you hide from enemies you're supposed to hide from, if they are just too close to you, they find you no matter what. I seriously can't believe anyone would design levels the way this game is made and add such a feature, but hey, apparently it works. Look at those positive reviews. People sure do have poor taste in games.\n\nIt could be a great game, but sadly it's just not. Is it better than Lethal Company? Yes overall it is. Quite a bit even. Is it a good game? Ehn... in multiplayer it's... ok, but singleplayer no. It's just a death march and after you've seen all the different level types... that's pretty much it. There's nothing else. The core gameplay loop just isn't worth repeating. The items in the shop don't make the game play different at all.\n\nIn fact I also want to add that this game is a really GREAT example of why adding in forced upgrades don't necessarily make the game better. Because if you design your enemies around the player having the baseline stats, you'll usually get a better experience than if you design them around getting upgrades. This is 100% how it feels with this game. And every time you gotta restart, you feel it. And it's not a good feeling because you're not 'doing a new build' you're just 'reset'.\n\nI play a lot of games with proc gen and perma-death and this is not how you should do it. Either offer rogue-lite elements or new ways to build up or don't offer them at all and focus on a more satisfying core experience. This is the worst of all worlds.\n\nJust another friendslop POS. I really need to stop buying these crappy games in EA.",

The monsters are a big add, don't get me wrong, but the update focused solely on the monsters which just don't make up for all the reasons REPO is so beloved. I think the game should focus on making it easier and more accessable for casual players. The game is too hard, and offers no way to make it easier. This is effectively soft locking a big percentage of their audience who aren't tryhards. There are multiple ways they could do this, either by adding checkpoints, debuffing the overpowered monsters, or copping the spawnrate of some of the monsters. (which gets ridiculous in higher levels.) To add some replayability, the devs could also add daily challenges, which would make the player want to keep coming back. They could implement diff modes ( sandbox mode, waves, endless, one where a player can become a monster.) \r\nI know that despite the games huge success, it's still a relatively small team.

It's confusing and poorly explained, not very fun and all three of the people I was playing with all felt the same - the concept was confusing and the aesthetic was a bit whatever. The price was high for something so undercooked.",

      "review": "The game was alright, had more fun the more I played. The issue I have is that it is extremely unbalanced. There are several entities which can spawn within the first 2 minutes of a round which can instantly kill you, or are very annoying to work around. Some of these instant death entities should just be buffed, I hate it. Easy enemies should spawn early, hard enemies should spawn later. Lethal Company does this pretty well.",

(crouching can speed this up, but you move even slower this way)\r\n- Clunky controls jump to dive at monsters (which is a weak crappy attack that hurts you!) \r\n- Weapons are practically useless most of the time and super weak\r\n- Holding and moving objects around and rotating them is so slow and its easy to bonk into things and break everything which is frustrating.\r\n- Die too easily. Hardly any reason to even bother having HP if you die nearly instantly to so many attacks. Then you lose all upgrades when there's a team wipe, all that hard earned money is wasted.\r\n- Extremely repetitive game play loop with very little variety of things to do.\r\n- When you are dead, you can no longer talk to and socialise with friends unless they have your head with them and even then only occasionally you can briefly talk before you have to wait for that ability to recharge. Admittedly this is an upgrade from never being able to speak whatsoever before the update, but it feels bad when you can't really do anything meaningful for long stretches, especially when dying is so quick and frequent.\r\n\r\nI understand that many of my negatives are positives to some, but this game is absolutely painful to play for my tastes.  I like to play games like:\r\nDOOM series\r\nBlood\r\nCultic\r\nDeep Rock Galactic\r\nFallout series\r\nResident Evil series\r\nBatman Arkham series\r\nWitcher 3\r\nFortnite\r\nSuper Mario Bros 3 / World / 64\r\nMario Kart series\r\nSuper Metroid 3",

Plenty of other games have these elements and solved them in single-player, usually by adding bots.\n\nThe devs chose to add solo play as an option, so either they need to put in the elbow grease to compensate for the lack of other players, or remove the elements that come off as unfair instead of fun.",
