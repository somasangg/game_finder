      "review": "I think my current playtime speaks volumes for how much I enjoy this little game, but I'll ramble on.\r\n\r\nRopuka's Idle Island is a very very simple and basic idle game that sits anywhere on your desktop. It's very easy to resize Ropuka and his island and relocate it so that it won't get in the way of anything, and you can toggle it so that it can or can't take priority over other windows (sit on top). He's just a little frog guy who has a little island to take care of, he won't disrupt you! You can also turn off the music and ambience separately, meaning that I can mute the music but still keep the sounds of wind and birds to a \"low hum\" for relaxation.\r\n\r\nI've seen some people deem this game \"boring\", and I get that. This is no action game, there isn't much you can do with Ropuka other than customise him and his island. But it's important to remember this game is intended to give you a little desktop friend who does his own thing whilst you also do your own thing. I personally like big numbers and seeing them rise, so I like leaving him for a few hours and coming back to see millions of grass trimmings. Plus, this game is very low-demand so you can easily run a different game or other programs alongside it!\r\n\r\nOverall, I love the little chill vibes this game brings. And I love little Ropuka, too.",

So I don't have the experience on resizing and blending it. \n\nIt is a slow idle game, so [u]don't expect high numbers or lots of achievements[/u], there will be NO dopamine hits with this one. I am at 8 hours right now and it is still really much the beginning of the game, I am at 0,81% of completion T-T\n\nThe art is beautiful though and what makes this review positive is the ambiant noises and music that makes the [u]overall experience extremely calming[/u].\nSo this one is a pure idle game, really slow, just sitting there, the frog sometimes waves or talks to me and runs around cutting grass but is mostly sleeping. I am a [i]little jealous of him to be honest.[/i]\n\nIt is not my kind of idle game but in its niche I could understand its appeal.

Ropuka does not need to expand his house or buy more tools - He spends his day content cutting grass.

I'd want the pace to be a liiitle bit faster, but that's not critical.\nAlso, worth to note - if you are using screen capturing software while playing the game - you might have some issues. Negligible, but worth to notice:\n1. Software that creates a name for a recording of your screen based on the active app you are recording will always call it Ropuka's Idle Island, since the game is always the top layer.\n2. Similar if your application detects the window you want to capture. It will not detect any windows because on top of them all is an invisible game that captures all the mouse inputs.\nSo just be aware.",
