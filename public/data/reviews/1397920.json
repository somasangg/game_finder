Progress feels slow, even in mid-game, and the randomness can be frustrating.\n\nVisually it's underwhelming-levels look very similar and feel like they were sketched in MS Paint. What's good: the mini-games, especially the cave system, are enjoyable, and you can earn in-game currency for free, which helps. Overall, the gameplay is okay, but the experience would be much better with bug fixes and some visual polish.\n\nEdit: The game now stopped working properly. Assets are no longer loading. Right menu options are no longer clickeable. Even settings don't open. After last launch, the save now seems corrupted. I have no weapons, no super miners, scientists don't open any more.

This time doesn't include offline gameplay. I don't mind devoting time like that to a game but all this game does is basically scroll. The upgrades are minuscule and with most of your time spent being staring at a screen waiting for something to happen, there needs to be more interaction. I get it's tagged \"idle\" but that's literally what you do. Glad I got out when I had only 10 hours and didn't waste more. If you are going to play this game, have a 2nd monitor. You wont ever do anything on it.",
