These devs do not disappoint, and I have gone out of my way to buy every bonus cosmetic pack they release for the game, just to support them further.\r\n\r\nThe game starts out a little slow with the progression, as that is how it teaches you all of the different mechanics of your weapons and gear. However, the longer you play, the more the game offers to you, and that progression goes on for a surprisingly long time.\r\n\r\nROCK AND STONE!",

To add to this there are many wacky loadouts that can completely change your playstyle.\r\n\r\nCooperation is important but I've rarely found myself stressing over incompetent teammates as you can almost always just pull your own weight, this is the core of what makes this game so fun, cooperation feels great but so does doing things by yourself.\r\n\r\nThe game's humor is also top notch and I love how there is a ton of little semi hidden interactables with funny voice lines, even after 300 hours I'm still finding things.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay loop consists of trying to obtain weapons mods and cosmetics, there aren't a ton of different mission types but coupling with biomes, the random terrain and the various modifiers and curve balls the game throws at you, at 300 hours it still feels far off from getting old.",

The majority of players you encounter in the lobbies are really chill and usually have no problem with you messing something up. The gameplay loop is nice, there's no huge penalties for losing the mission, the only paid content is the game itself and the DLC armors and skins, which are purely cosmetic. \r\n\r\nThe seasons have their own \"season pass,\" which is free as well. AND, as of Season 5, you can simply go back to replay the old seasons if you haven't finished some or never played them. This also helped the developers to put the cosmetics from their perspective seasons back into these said seasons, thus lessening the loot bloat in the \"cargo crates,\" \"lost packs\" and \"core infusers\" And as for loot, you never get double of the thing you already own (unless its a beard or a weapon skin for a separate class), which means that you're closer to getting what you want every time.\r\n\r\nThe game is primarily co-op, but it also lets you to play \"solo\" with a drone that follows you, shoots bugs and mines minerals that you point towards to. You can always disable the drone for the true solo experience if you're brave enough.\r\n\r\nThe developers, Ghost Ship Games, also deserve huge praise. Actually listening to the community and often interacting with them is such a welcome change in the sea of triple A bullcrap. They're nice people.\r\n\r\nCannot recommend this game enough. Once you get into the groove of things, it's real fun.",

You can also play offline with all your progress saved, and enemy health and numbers scaled based on player count.\n\nThe only major flaw is the Overclock system. Weapon Overclocks are extremely grindy to obtain and RNG-based, so you can go hundreds of hours without getting the ones you want. Fortunately, most Overclocks are good, so it’s rare to end up with something truly unusable.\n\nThe developers continue to support the game with new seasons, each adding more content",

This design allows for an incredible synergy between the 4 classes, with their tools and equipment greatly complimenting one-another. In addition to all this, Deep Rock Galactic gets new free content regularly via a seasonal model, as well as a paid cosmetic bundle for each season which they don't try and excessively push onto players.

      "review": "Sometimes beginners get confused about the concept of the game. No, it's not minecraft with guns in space, it's more like Left 4 dead in caves in space. The gameplay concept can be described as follows: you go to a randomly generated cave, a level where you must complete the task assigned to you and successfully evacuate back to the station. The gameplay itself is divided into 2 large components: the puzzle part and the shooter part.\n\nThe puzzle part is all that you will do in moments of silence. Moving underground alone is difficult and dangerous, and therefore each class has a unique set of tools to speed up the crossing of the terrain. The faster you get all the necessary minerals, the lower the chance that you will become bug food. The shooter part begins at the same moment when you hear the scream of dozens of beetles and the menacing stomp of larger beetles. The most common opponent for you will be an ordinary glyphid warrior, and if they don't look formidable on lower difficulties, then on high difficulties the continuous stream of arachnids will be the main reason why you can't stop shooting.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is the strongest part of the game. Narrow tunnels where you can be taken by surprise, and giant caves, against which you yourself are like an ant, are perfectly complemented by a suitable soundtrack. The feeling of darkness and isolation will always go with you.\n\nLet's talk about classes in more detail: there are 4 classes in the game, which you can switch between at any time. Unlike many co-op games, DRG does not have pronounced \"carry\" and \"support\" classes, everyone has something that others do not have. If you don't have enough of any of the 4 classes, you will always feel its absence, and your thoughts will flash: \"If only we had a driller!\"\n\nDriller is the main area damage provider in the team, possessing a flamethrower and explosive packs, but having serious problems killing large and/or distant targets. To overcome caves, it is equipped with drills that can level the landscape, make ladders in the rock both up and down, drill straight passages from one section of the cave to another, ignoring natural tunnels.\n\nThe shooter is the main supplier of all damage in the team. It has no disadvantages in combat: huge damage is combined with the largest ammunition among all classes. In case of danger, it has a shield, under the dome of which you and your allies are practically invulnerable. But the shooter has great difficulty moving: the rope allows the whole team to overcome huge depressions and high ledges, but their number is very limited.\n\nThe engineer in DRG, unlike in many games, is not a slave to his turret – it is just another tool here. The engineer is a versatile fighter. You have a shotgun against single targets, and a grenade launcher against bugged crowds. The turret finishes off everyone who managed to survive under your fire or crept up unnoticed. For mobility, you have a platform cannon that creates platforms from which you can build bridges, onto which you can fall so as not to take damage, but use them as footholds for the scout so that he can dig up minerals that are inaccessible to others.\n\nThe scout is the most mobile class. Your arsenal includes an unlimited cat hook and a lighting pistol, with which you remove the darkness of the depths and uncover cave treasures. Together with an engineer, you dig up the largest number of resources and are the first to determine the situation in the next segment of the cave. Your weapons are accurate and deal quick damage, which is ideal for killing priority targets, but the fundamental lack of damage in the area and the permanent shortage of ammunition will always be your companions.\n\nProgress in DRG does not last very long. You will upgrade all 4 classes in about 50 hours. For those who have gone into the gameplay quite a lot, it remains only to discover special modifications for weapons and unique cosmetics, but the amount of good received is limited to 10-11 pieces each week.\n\nThe DRG community is another strong point of the game. Playing with random numbers rarely causes problems, so don't worry if you don't have any friends — you'll get all the same emotions. If you are still not satisfied with the randomness, playing alone (while playing a full-fledged single game, with a pause when entering the menu) is possible in the Bosco company. The game has both text and voice chat for communication, but you won't use them: in practice, a laser pointer (Ctrl) and the V button are enough to convey any thought to your friend. It is worth warning that there is no anti—cheat and reporter system in DRG, and therefore, in case of incidents, the best thing you can do is immediately log out of the unscrupulous player's server.",

Almost everyone is willing to help and will respect your time if you're new to the game.\n\nOne of the best online co-op multiplayer games out there, with a lot of content and more coming in the future.\n\nRock and Stone!",

Many enemies that all pose different challenges are combine with a perfect distribution of difficulties and modifiers for whatever pace you want to play.

Every mission, there is gold and crafting materials to be mined, which means you can unlock something new after each mission. A new weapon upgrade, a new costume, new beer, ect.

      "review": "A classic co-op horde shooter that is up there with the greats like L4D, Alien Swarm, and Payday 2.\n\nOver 5 years of free content updates means there's lots of variety to keep things fresh, and they're still continuing to add more. They've done a good job of managing power creep and complexity over those updates, so even if you're jumping in fresh you can have fun with the initially unlocked weapons and not feel overwhelmed by all the mechanics. Although there are a lot of different objectives and events, you can probably figure them out on the fly if you pay attention to what mission control says. And they actually have an in-game \"miner manual\" that covers the enemies and objectives, so you don't need to rely on a third-party wiki or youtube videos if you want to study the basics before diving in. I wish more games would do this!\n\nBecause of the relatively flat complexity, it's a good game to play with friends of differing experience/skill levels. Even if you don't have a friend group who plays regularly, I mostly play with randoms and have found the community well above average in terms of friendliness. The assignments (basically a sequence of target missions that you get an award for completing all of) also help organize random players into the same lobbies, so even when the game is going through a quiet period you can usually find someone running the same target mission to join. Just don't deposit a gold nugget without annoying mission control first, or there may be hell to pay.\n\nThere are numerous different unlock trees (weapons, weapon mods, weapon skins and colors, dwarf perks, dwarf outfits, beers!) that are deep and uniquely integrated into the game so you can always be progressing multiple things and always unlocking something new to experiment with. As someone who needs extrinsic goals like unlockables to help give me direction in large games, these deep trees are a major factor as to why I'm still playing after 600+ hours.\n\nThere are 4 dwarf classes, each of which gets its own unique collection of weapons to choose from and have their own support role to play on the team. They each play very differently, and I would recommend cycling through all 4 of them to keep things fresh. The way the mechanics synergize do a good job of encouraging team play even among strangers, so long as they're paying a little attention. But other classes can also work around a missing class (or a newbie who's still learning).\n\nThere is a single player mode if you aren't feeling social or want to practice before diving into a team. You get a directable robot buddy that helps you out in lieu of dwarf teammates. He's like a puppy: he can dig, fetch, and fire missiles at horrible abominations.\n\nThe game is buy once and play all you want. The gameplay updates have all been free, including their equivalent of seasonal \"battlepasses\" to unlock even more cosmetics that come with each new content season. You can also play previous seasons to enjoy their unique twists and unlock their cosmetics. There's some paid DLC for extra cosmetic skins that aren't otherwise unlockable, but they are dwarfed by the number of free cosmetics you can unlock just by playing. I like to think of them as opportunities to buy the devs a beer after so many years of playing the game.\n\nAlso, the game has a great sense of humor (specifically, dwarf humor) and the devs have clearly spent a lot of time and love adding little trinkets and silly interactions/voicelines all throughout the game.\n\nIf you enjoy co-op horde shooters, this is a must-try in my book.",

Im genuinely confused as to how they could take the effort to make the base game and then instead of building in a leveling system that gives abundant variety and build depth, they just dont. So after the initial handful of runs even though the maps themselves change the actual PLAYING the maps never really does. Its basically the exact same experience every single time, just with a different skin because you cannot have any real build depth or leveling that feels rewarding or interesting in any way at all.

It is so repeatable with no real goals to achieve - you finish missions, upgrade your gear to repeat the same missions on new difficulty all over again, and again, and again... It became so tedious so quick that I cannot recommend this game, sorry.",

Unfortunately, these upgrades are locked behind a ridiculous weekly rewards, based on RNG that isnt even tied to your character. So you could spend dozens of hours grinding for the cores you need, which are only available during deep dives, and rng machine events, only to roll for a overclock thats for a class that you are not playing and is level 1. \n\nSorry, but  im not interested in leveling another class. the game was enjoyable as long as i was progressing but now ive literally received no upgrades for the last 20 hours+ of gameplay. I am level 5 forging by now and have gotten to prestige 2, 25 more levels on top of the first promotion. ive gotten to forge level 5 which means i have crafted over 20 Ocs by now and none are for the class im playing. The end game grind is complete RNG. So the end game state is a complete purgatory.\n\nI didnt know what to expect when i bought this game, but i thought there was more depth.  It was decent, get it on sale and try it out, you will enjoy it. But overwhelmingly positive seems like a reach.",
