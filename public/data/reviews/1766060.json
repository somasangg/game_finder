The execution is you, from a god's-eye view, desperately trying to remember if you left a can of beans in that one house while six zombies politely shuffle towards you to eat your face. It’s a top-down, co-op survival sim where you'll spend 80% of your time joyfully looting every last piece of scrap and 20% of your time screaming as a horde you totally didn't see ruins your day.\nThe charm is in the beautiful chaos. One minute you're a master carpenter building your dream apocalypse fortress, the next you're a panicked rat running from a zombie bear because you forgot to eat your can of beans. Bringing a friend just means you have a witness to your glorious, stupid demise.\n\nA fantastically stressful playdate. Highly recommended for anyone who thinks \"What's the worst that could happen?\" is a fun starting point for an evening.",

      "review": "My wife, our friend and myself all bought this game. I've only put in 14.5 hours but I've really been enjoying this game. It does have it's issues but that's to be expected of an early access game. First I'd like to talk about the pros.\n\nPros:\n- I enjoy how the zombies feel like actual zombies. Going for the head makes a difference, you have to deal with them crawling should their legs \"break\" and the are also different types of zombies which keeps things fresh.\n\n- I've just had an in-game day of driving around and looting with a car. Myself and the other party members all got in our cars and headed out. I with my ACP, my friend with her souped up truck and my wife who was evel knievel going down the road. Seeing her fly over a ramp and landing on another car is absolutely hilarious and then my friend and myself ramming zombies and NPC characters left and right is amazing. \n\n- The survival aspect in my opinion is on point. There's always that need to improve your gear/sufficiency and the need to go out and loot. Keeping your hunger and hydration up in the beginning can be a little hard but I enjoy it because it makes everything feel that much better when you have some more self sufficiency and supplies at your base. \n\nCons: (I'm doing this with intent that it hopefully reaches the devs and notifies new players)\n- I love that you can place items and rotate them but it is a PAIN to pick up the item you want quite often. The ability to cursor over an item or something would make organizing so much better. I've found that I really enjoy having my car parts on warehouse shelves but had to put them in a storage container because it's just so hard/impossible to pick the specific item I want from the shelf.\n\n- When building various structures the \"build\" or \"add materials\" function is a pain to find at times and can often lead to you being stuck in the thing you are building. I feel that this could be avoided and something better implemented. \n\n- Making it easier to upgrade/customize weapons with attachments. It doesn't seem very intuitive and we find ourselves wondering which weapons can take which attachments. This also goes in-hand with vehicle modifications.\n\nOverall though, this is a wonderful game and I hope it gets more support. It has it's issues but that's to be expected. If you enjoy post apocalyptic zombie survival games then I bet you'll enjoy this one.",

More zombies around, it’s weird that you have to wait to see two of them together \n3. Why there’s people randomly around?\n4. Crafting should require you upgrade skills, idk using books or something.\n\nI think this is all included in the other zombie game we know\n\nJust some ideas for the future. I plan to keep playing and if something change, or need to add gonna write it down.\nSo far it’s good!!",

Highlighting enemies is also a missing things... the gamma/contrast of the game does not make them much visibles on grass and some other surfaces. Some item like \"cement\" are super rare while some other are excessively frequents (guns and ammo).

Driving around is the only laggy part of the game which is understandable cuz you render more of the map but that shouldn't be an issue nontheless cuz exploration is part of the game. To summarize my experience....\r\n\r\n- World and the whole map looks and feels great but it lacks objective, I know its an open-world survivor game but I find myself getting bored when I fully set up a base and its defenses but then I got nothing to do afterwards.\r\n\r\n- Weapons and modifications, great BUT i should have the option to use the scope and remove the attachments, having them permanently in the weapon kind of negates its whole purpose. They are \"attachments\" not permanent upgrades.\r\n\r\n- Vehicles, Vehicle Armor, and mods, PERFECT, chef's kiss <3\r\n\r\n- Base building is so good BUT there should be more choices for traps and there should be an alternative for the power generator cuz FUEL IS THE MOST SCARCITY in the game imo, crafting them is more of a hassle than just finding them in your supply runs, I recommend adding the option to craft a windmill that generates electricity to power up anything electricity related.\r\n\r\n- Weather and other Weather events are very well crafted, storm feels scary and the night is perfectly dark that compliments the danger of zombies or raiders.\r\n\r\n- Camera feels janky and cursor is stupidly wonky. I love it when the camera zooms in when you go indoors but when you leave and it immediately zooms out, hate it, cant see my character cuz the roof of the building I was in is blocking the view. Cursor is wonky, its fine but it still needs fixing, best way to describe it is when I want to aim left or right in combat stance its forcing itself to go back to the middle of the screen which throws off majority of my aim, the same goes for my friends.\r\n\r\nLastly I would recommend the devs to rework all the friendly NPCs, weird how raiders and zombies are the only ones roaming the map coming across you base but never friendly NPCs that fight back, I'd recommend letting NPCs roam and maybe (hopefully) give us an option to take them in and giving them tasks like guarding our base from attacks, monitoring the power generator, car maintenance, supply runs, or even forming a team of 4 (you and 3 NPCs) to come with you on your supply runs backing you up, perfect for solo worlds or with friends to cover more ground.\r\n\r\nLOVE THE GAME, BUY IT ON SALE THOUGH, FUN GAME BUT STILL LAGGY AND SOMETIMES BUGGY WHICH IS FINE AND UNDERSTANDABLE KNOWING ONLY 6 PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON THIS GAME. KEEP IT UP DEVS, GAME IS AWESOME AND WITH MORE FIXES AND OTHER CONTENT UPDATES, IT'LL BE BETTER.",

But once you’ve built a base — which takes quite a bit of effort — you kind of lose the motivation to move around. and Once you found the parts for a vehicle, and the hoarding begins. You spend your time looting and hauling everything back to base, picking up some armor upgrades, winter clothes, and a few guns along the way. After that, there’s not much left to do besides a bit of exploring — maybe dive into a bunker or two, but that’s about it.\n\nI tried farming, but it felt pretty pointless. With all the food you can loot´, and since hunting is easier and takes less resources, farming just didn’t seem worth the effort. For me it got a bit repetitive fairly quickly. Still, it’s a solid game overall, and I definitely got my money’s worth out of it.

      "review": "TL;DR \nFirst Impression: Overall good. Recommended.\n20hrs in\nI like 7 Days to Die and State of Decay, this game scratches an itch that other comparable titles do not, while drawing on familiar mechanics that don't feel like cheesy copypasta crap. \n\nThe open world is very large. I currently have about a third of the map discovered and so far am enjoying a healthy variety of POIs that keep me guessing...and assessing my surroundings. \n\nSome random things that stood out to me...\nThe vehicle mechanics are like State of Decay but better. Fuel management is reasonably challenging, forcing me to do mini expeditions in search of fuel. Gas stations are very fruitful if you find them early, otherwise you may find yourself scrounging for other cars to siphon small amounts of fuel from. For every vehicle, there are basic components that need to be maintained or replaced (tires, starter, fuel pump, etc) and virtually no vehicles are found on the map with a complete set of parts. For this reason, getting multiple vehicles running at the same time with a full tank of gas is both challenging and rewarding. All parts can be directly transferred from donor cars meaning if you find an obvious upgrade in the field you can move everything over from an existing car immediately. This is particularly meaningful when you start dabbling in crafting the tiered modular armor upgrades on your vehicles, which in it of itself comes with nicely done visual changes to the wide variety of cars for that Mad Max look. All the cars are aptly renamed with cute play-on-words that can be likened to an early GTA and Saints Row-esque approach to navigating around intellectual property lawsuits. It makes me chuckle. \nRepair kits are pretty available to find and craft, making vehicle management less about managing damage and more about keeping them fed and finding the appropriate parts to get additional cars running. The vehicle physics is about what you would expect for this game, which is not focused on suspension/ground clearance/mass at all. The game does make a point of using uneven terrain surfaces between \"civilized\" parts of the map, and when driving, it lets you know its there by either sending the vehicle airborne unexpectedly or mantling it on some poorly-defined rock surface. On a brighter side, the vehicles do hit pretty good top speeds which is extremely helpful for long distance looting runs, with a very noticeable stability loss at high speeds that will have you really feathering the A and D keys. Vehicles do actually fish tail with overcompensation complete with squealing tires and treadmarks, which was a completely welcome surprise for a game in this genre. \nThe game is very forgiving with ramming zombies - you can run down large groups before you start having a significant impact on vehicle condition. For this reason, I've often forgone shooting in the more urban areas in favor of ramming. Repair kits are easier to replace than ammo. \n\nThe weapons are reasonably diverse. So far ammo has been pretty scarce so I typically start shooting only when dealing with Hostile NPCs and special zombies. Repair kits can be made to keep them from breaking, modular attachments can be added. There doesn't seem to be anything particularly noteworthy about the gun mechanics other than its all there and it more or less works. The camera angles don't really play nice with the shooting mechanics, especially when shooting at targets that are above, such as zombies on a rooftop or a hostile NPC in a watchtower. You can kill armored zombies with guns by shooting their helmet a few times, but there's really no way to fine tune the aim accordingly, and I just end up dumping a mag until it does the thing. Long range shooting is wanky - put a scope on a rifle, the map zooms out so you can \"see further\" but your target is now smaller making it harder to get a precise shot. Given the quasi top-down perspective, not really sure how to improve this other than doing a first/third person perspective change when using scoped guns. \n\nMelee is closer to state of decay style, with large and small item slots that allow for weapons and tools interchangeably. The inventory management aspect makes sense but because of the \"hand\" slot, fast switching to say, an axe in slot 1 removes the axe from slot 1 and puts it in \"hand\" freeing up slot 1. When you're looting in a hurry, it's very easy to auto-populate an empty slot making it impossible to quickly free up your hand, which can lead to time-killing interruptions or potentially dropping the equipped item and forgetting to pick it up. The melee combat comes with decent, albeit limited combat animations that is neither overly exciting nor feeling like the same animation on constant loop. Mining ore is clumsy and awkward, and the tree chopping animations is clunky at best (pun intended). Everything melee works, but with little grace.\n\nThe crafting system is OK. Inventory management will be a bottleneck early on, as I quickly amassed more items than storage. Weight management is also relatively unforgiving until you start to learn strategies for your playstyle. The crafting and building options are limited and certain items do require a decent amount of grind to craft. Ingredients and options are laid out pretty clearly and they do make sense, however the game currently does not offer much guidance in the beginning. You kind of need to just figure it out. \n\nThere is a pretty wide variety of clothing items that can come with small boosts. Very similar to 7 days with a wider selection.\n\nLooting structures is fun. There's the token stuff you find in every house, and typically a little something extra stashed away that you don't see all the time. There's something very satisfying about walking up to the front door, finding it's locked, and immediately going to the nearest window, smashing it in, jumping through, and unlocking the door from the other side. Lockpicking is basically fallout, but on the hard/very hard side. Lockpicks are not particularly common and break very easily. The loot distribution seems to have been done with forethought. Ammo containers contain ammo, dressers contain clothes, the trunk of a police cruiser contains a body vest, a shotgun, etc. This does make it easier to plan where to go and what to search. Furniture inside buildings can be dismantled for crafting components, which you should exploit early game. There is a limited selection of things that can be dismantled inside, and virtually nothing outside. I'm hopeful the options expand down the line, because this (and hard terrain) is one of the main things that will make the open world feel more sandboxy as the game seems to want to achieve evidenced by the commendable flexibility of slapping base walls anywhere, including filling out doorways and gaps if you take over a building and need some \"traffic control\". Random hostile AI and zombie herds come to you, wherever you plant roots.  \n\nMap can be tricky. Many structures do not actually appear on the map. Some might find this frustrating, but for me there's a level of immersion that I enjoy from a map that gets me in the right general direction but doesn't give me an almost spoiler-esque preview of what's out there. Player marks their own POIs, using a limited selection of icons that can stamped. It's very easy to accidentally un-stamp a location you mark. \n\nThere is currently not much in the way of NPCs. You will occasionally run into a single NPC who will trade from a very limited pool, and if you're lucky they might offer a short fetch-quest. There is also scattered pockets of hostile NPCs that will shoot at you on-sight. The AI is poor, they follow 2005-era pathfinding and in groups this occasionally turns into a hillarious spicy congo-line.\n\nThe camera angle and mechanics do work, and there are different settings to adjust. There are also 3rd party mods that integrate a true 3rd person camera angle (doesn't help much with shooting). \n\nWorth",

I had loot respawn set to abundant, and I explored almost the entire map, but vehicles simply didn’t appear. After creating a fresh server as a test, cars spawned normally, which shows the issue isn’t luck — it’s a bug in older saves or existing worlds.\n\nAdditionally, about 25% of the map is water, which makes large portions of the world unusable. I really wish the map was bigger, as it feels cramped and limits exploration.\n\nI love the concept and the world, but the combination of broken vehicle spawns and the limited map made my experience frustrating. Please fix vehicle spawn behavior in ongoing saves and consider expanding the map.\n\nUPDATE:\nMy original server was bugged due to a demo save name issue. Starting a fresh world fixed the missing vehicle problem. With the new updates, the cars now work as they should, and the addition of new backpacks makes the game much more enjoyable. The changes to the map in the update also make the world feel better overall, and the game feels far more enjoyable now. This game has great potential as the devs keep improving it.",

      "review": "🕒 Hours Played: Technically 0 on Steam, but let’s just say… I’ve done extensive QA testing (40+ hrs) elsewhere.\n💾 Early Access Review\n\n\"HumanitZ is shaping up nicely, but still feels like it’s missing a few crucial bolts in the survival machine.\"\n\nFirst off, major respect to the devs for being actively present in the Early Access space. In 2025, that’s sadly become a selling point on its own. The bar is so low, it’s underground—but these devs are at least digging in the right direction.\n\nMechanically, the game has a solid foundation. Controls are clean and responsive, and traversal feels natural. That said, the aiming system feels like it was designed by someone who spent one too many hours playing isometric RPGs with a loose mouse. It works, but there’s definitely a \"getting-to-know-you\" phase before it feels intuitive.\n\nInventory variety? Minimal. If loot was a buffet, HumanitZ is currently serving rice and water. The game desperately needs more weapons, outfits, gear, and general post-apocalyptic flavor. You can only find the same 9mm pistol so many times before it starts to feel like you're looting a very boring arms dealer.\n\nAnd then there’s melee combat… oh boy. Ever tried hitting a zombie and watching it just… not care? No flinch, no stagger, just pure undead indifference. Feels less like you’re fighting zombies and more like you’re politely tapping mannequins who are late for a meeting. A solid hit reaction system—especially for melee—would go a long way toward making combat feel impactful and not like you're swinging a pool noodle at an existential threat.\n\nStill, despite the jank and content gaps, I found myself coming back (again, in totally legitimate, non-illegal ways). There’s something here worth watching. With more loot variety, better hit feedback, and continued dev support (which they are providing), HumanitZ could easily become a standout in the survival genre.\n\nVerdict: A solid zombie survival title in early stages. Needs more meat on the bones (both in zombies and features), but worth keeping an eye on—especially if you like your games slightly janky and full of potential.",

The largest issue I see currently is the interior of buildings. Nearly all of them look identical, with the same generic layout and furniture. That really should be what's worked on next, because how the game is now is already quite solid, but the mundane buildings really hurts a game that's about going into buildings and looting.\n\nThere should be different flooring, different furniture and themes inside them. I understand the timeline seems to be in the distant future of an apocalypse, yet that doesn't tend to translate well into games, even State of Decay suffers from boring interiors. Pull it back slightly, and give a little more life into the designs of interiors. Carpets, furniture that isn't fully dilapidated. Part of what makes me want to replay games as this is the potential for a base in a different theme. Mall base, arcade base, those are things that go through my head amongst other things when I consider replaying a game. Even the hours I have in it's repetitive.\n\nGenerally, this game isn't hindered with anything major, performance is fine, gunplay works, combat is fine, multiplayer doesn't lag, camera is... okay--be really great if we could put the screen upwards a bit more. \n\n[h3][b]Humanitz has the opposite problems of most games today - it's all small things.[/b][/h3]\n\n-Needs quick stack, badly.\n\n-ctrl+right click breaks when looting from a chest, requiring you to manually press both buttons for each item.\n\n-Interiors need... they need life guys. Should be top prio in my opinion.\n\n-Camera limits need to be tweaked, allowing us to look up and out farther.\n\n-Moveable furniture needs to be apart of the interior rework. Being able to pick up a fridge or storage would be wonderful.\n\n-When inside a building, the camera needs to pull a Sims half wall view fully, including for buildings attached to buildings. Again, interior stuff. It can get really janky when going inside buildings.\n\n-Stack size for items needs set to 999--full clean water bottles needs to be stackable especially--This is a problem older survival games had that has largely been fixed by modern games of the genre.\n\n-NPCs turn into brick walls when you're inside a car. Meaning if one runs up to the car to shoot while you're stationary, you cannot move your car in that direction sometimes. \n\nThis looks like a lot of issues, but it isn't - it's all minor things that are mainly parameters and design. The interiors could be fixed by giving randoms assets to fix things around the map. And the game would be incredibly solid. It's already been a great experience, I've been losing time while playing from my enjoyment.\n\nMy biggest hope is the game doesn't devolve too hard into questing--aka the 7DTD route, bleh--and it also doesn't focus too hard on PvP. As right now, it feels a lot more like Day-Z than Zomboid. Actually it reminds me most of Miscreated which shut down years ago, and I really hope it does go a more simplified Zomboid route as those past Zombie survival games died for good reason.\n\nPull back the apocalypse timeline a little. Give buildings more life due to it. More things laying around, food containers in stores, even if just for aesthetic with nothing in them. Breath some life into the architecture. \n\nIt's a yes from me right now, hopefully they keep up the work and this really becomes a hidden gem. It's on the right track, stay the course.",

It does have it's issues but that's to be expected of an early access game. First I'd like to talk about the pros.\n\nPros:\n- I enjoy how the zombies feel like actual zombies. Going for the head makes a difference, you have to deal with them crawling should their legs \"break\" and the are also different types of zombies which keeps things fresh.\n\n- I've just had an in-game day of driving around and looting with a car. Myself and the other party members all got in our cars and headed out. I with my ACP, my friend with her souped up truck and my wife who was evel knievel going down the road. Seeing her fly over a ramp and landing on another car is absolutely hilarious and then my friend and myself ramming zombies and NPC characters left and right is amazing. \n\n- The survival aspect in my opinion is on point. There's always that need to improve your gear/sufficiency and the need to go out and loot. Keeping your hunger and hydration up in the beginning can be a little hard but I enjoy it because it makes everything feel that much better when you have some more self sufficiency and supplies at your base. \n\nCons: (I'm doing this with intent that it hopefully reaches the devs and notifies new players)\n- I love that you can place items and rotate them but it is a PAIN to pick up the item you want quite often. The ability to cursor over an item or something would make organizing so much better. I've found that I really enjoy having my car parts on warehouse shelves but had to put them in a storage container because it's just so hard/impossible to pick the specific item I want from the shelf.\n\n- When building various structures the \"build\" or \"add materials\" function is a pain to find at times and can often lead to you being stuck in the thing you are building. I feel that this could be avoided and something better implemented. \n\n- Making it easier to upgrade/customize weapons with attachments. It doesn't seem very intuitive and we find ourselves wondering which weapons can take which attachments. This also goes in-hand with vehicle modifications.\n\nOverall though, this is a wonderful game and I hope it gets more support. It has it's issues but that's to be expected.

Things like respawn timers, how fast hunger and thirst drain or how long the nights are. It really lets you shape the experience to your taste.\n\nIf I have to name a downside, it’s the name HumanitZ. I’m really not a fan. It feels a bit cheap",

Driving around is the only laggy part of the game which is understandable cuz you render more of the map but that shouldn't be an issue nontheless cuz exploration is part of the game. To summarize my experience....\r\n\r\n- World and the whole map looks and feels great but it lacks objective, I know its an open-world survivor game but I find myself getting bored when I fully set up a base and its defenses but then I got nothing to do afterwards.\r\n\r\n- Weapons and modifications, great BUT i should have the option to use the scope and remove the attachments, having them permanently in the weapon kind of negates its whole purpose. They are \"attachments\" not permanent upgrades.\r\n\r\n- Vehicles, Vehicle Armor, and mods, PERFECT, chef's kiss <3\r\n\r\n- Base building is so good BUT there should be more choices for traps and there should be an alternative for the power generator cuz FUEL IS THE MOST SCARCITY in the game imo, crafting them is more of a hassle than just finding them in your supply runs, I recommend adding the option to craft a windmill that generates electricity to power up anything electricity related.\r\n\r\n- Weather and other Weather events are very well crafted, storm feels scary and the night is perfectly dark that compliments the danger of zombies or raiders.\r\n\r\n- Camera feels janky and cursor is stupidly wonky. I love it when the camera zooms in when you go indoors but when you leave and it immediately zooms out, hate it, cant see my character cuz the roof of the building I was in is blocking the view. Cursor is wonky, its fine but it still needs fixing, best way to describe it is when I want to aim left or right in combat stance its forcing itself to go back to the middle of the screen which throws off majority of my aim, the same goes for my friends.\r\n\r\nLastly I would recommend the devs to rework all the friendly NPCs, weird how raiders and zombies are the only ones roaming the map coming across you base but never friendly NPCs that fight back, I'd recommend letting NPCs roam and maybe (hopefully) give us an option to take them in and giving them tasks like guarding our base from attacks, monitoring the power generator, car maintenance, supply runs, or even forming a team of 4 (you and 3 NPCs) to come with you on your supply runs backing you up, perfect for solo worlds or with friends to cover more ground.\r\n\r\nLOVE THE GAME, BUY IT ON SALE THOUGH, FUN GAME BUT STILL LAGGY AND SOMETIMES BUGGY WHICH IS FINE AND UNDERSTANDABLE KNOWING ONLY 6 PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON THIS GAME. KEEP IT UP DEVS, GAME IS AWESOME AND WITH MORE FIXES AND OTHER CONTENT UPDATES, IT'LL BE BETTER.",

But once you’ve built a base — which takes quite a bit of effort — you kind of lose the motivation to move around. and Once you found the parts for a vehicle, and the hoarding begins. You spend your time looting and hauling everything back to base, picking up some armor upgrades, winter clothes, and a few guns along the way. After that, there’s not much left to do besides a bit of exploring — maybe dive into a bunker or two, but that’s about it.\n\nI tried farming, but it felt pretty pointless. With all the food you can loot´, and since hunting is easier and takes less resources, farming just didn’t seem worth the effort. For me it got a bit repetitive fairly quickly.

You can see about 20 feet. \r\nThis is like playing Project Zomboid with the Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel engine and camera.  Fallout: BoS came out for the PlayStation 2 over 20 years ago and is hailed as the worst Fallout game of all time by a wide margin.  Even more than Fallout 76 at launch.",

      "review": "I tried to like this game, but couldn't. The devs tried to come up with a \"different\" system of holding things and how the quick slots work. I tried to get used to it, I couldn't. The cam prevents you to see around as it can't get any lower then a certain height. This is not ideal. When you get indoors, this problem becomes even worse. You can't see where you're walking into...You get into a house, there are zombies in there, you hear them but you can't see what your character should be seeing...because you know, he is standing there. I tried to get over it, I couldn't.  When you hold a melee weapon, the crosshair is still there and you need to aim with your crosshair, this feels very weird. The zombie is standing infront of me, but my character turns his back to him with this weird scheme of, I think they call it stance maybe...anyways another thing I couldn't get over. I grabbed a log, the character puts it on his shoulder and I wanted to drop it...I couldn't. Many things I tried to do....I just couldn't. \n\nI don't like giving thumbs down to an early access game, and maybe if you can get used to the cam angle and the weird quick slot issues, it might be for you...but it isn't for me.",
