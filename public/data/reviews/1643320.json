Knowing that you can only save by returning to camp forces you to really live in the world and think through every single decision you make. do i do this quick little side quest? is this guy going to betray me and cause me to lose 30 minutes of progress? is it worth bribing these bandits now that the economy is so much more unforgiving...but if i die trying to kill them... everything is high stakes and it feels amazing. And thankfully enemies are NOT bullet sponges in master difficulty. it's deal HIGH damage and RECIEVE high damage. \r\n\r\nThe intro is a little frustrating to get through in master because of a lack of auto saves and safe zones to save in - causing you to go right back to the very beginning every time you die. The devs should really consider easing you in and allowing auto saves just for the intro because it's likely to deter players from committing to the full master experience. Trust me, once you get through the intro and into the first hub zone where you can plan and purchase and store items - the game becomes absolutely riveting. I cannot wait to sink more time into master difficulty. 10/10 gents we are SO back.",

The atmosphere hit me harder than I expected. The moment you step into the Zone, you just know you’re back in that world: the tension, the silence, the distant echoes, the strange beauty of places you shouldn’t feel comfortable in.\r\n\r\nThe game isn’t perfect, you will notice some bugs and rough moments, but honestly they didn’t ruin anything for me. What stuck with me is how alive the world feels. The lighting, the storms, the way the grass moves in the wind... sometimes I just stopped to look around and take it in.\r\n\r\nCombat feels dangerous in a good way. You’re never truly safe, and every fight feels like it can end badly if you get careless. Anomalies made me nervous again, just like in the old games. And the sound design is on another level, so headphones are highly recommended.\r\n\r\nThe story pulled me in more than I expected. I’m already thinking about what choices to make next time. The characters feel grounded, and I really appreciate the Ukrainian voice acting, it adds a sense of authenticity I didn’t know I needed.\r\n\r\nIf you’re a fan of the original series, this is the closest thing to that old feeling we all remember. And if you’re new to the franchise, it’s still one of the most atmospheric and unique shooters out there.\r\n\r\nFor me, this game isn’t about perfection.

Honestly I thought the story was great, got confusing at some parts but playing through it again right now, and it really is an amazing storyline. I feel like the balancing could be a bit better with guns like the AKs doing nothing  in late game combat while the Dnipro (same ammo type as AKs) just destroys. I also really liked how the game had some horror elements especially going underground into old labs with mutants around every corner. When I first started playing the performance wasn't great getting around 40fps in CPU intensive areas but I just looked up a YT video on optimization and with FSR i was able to get constant 120 fps the whole game. For bugs I didn't really encounter any all the quests worked smoothly and it was a great experience. Overall I'd give this game a 9/10 must play if you like open world shooters.",

The only problem I have is that I dont have enough time to play it more.\nThis game is 100% made for those who loved the older games. And it shows that the devs love their games too.\nThey really kept the soul and the vibe that was there since 2007, down to the smallest parts that contribute to that. As if they played them alongside making this one. When I walk through the Zone with my backpack full of stuff and hear those distant screams and weird but unique sounds I feel like a kid again playing SoC for the first time.\nI played the sh*t out of the previous games, modded and vanilla. It is so fun and exciting to explore this huge map and find places and references from back then, and also exploring a whole new world at the same time. \n\nBut of course, not everything has been perfect the whole time, there were some issues (and still are for some).\nCrashes and performance seem to be mostly what I hear about. I've been fortunate I guess, I've only had 3 crashes in my whole time of playing it so far, 2 of those were in the most recent (Night of the Hunter) update. As for performance, im running on mostly high with over 60fps but also my rig isnt exactly the highest end, so its pretty doable for most people (which is great!)\nThere is also some smaller things, npc behavior, things dropping through the map - once had a corpse with a key in its inventory clip through and i could never get the key.\nAlso the characters feel kinda weird in the cutscenes  and dialogue but I dont really mind that that much. \n\nI would still 1000% recommend this to anyone who wants to try, especially if youre coming from the older ones and worried if its gonna feel good. As a slavic man myself it feels like coming home, I'm very proud and happy to play this game. I remember in the years after CoP we were speculating if we'd ever get another game, and then years later there were talks about a Stalker 2.

I promise you, if you come into this game excpecting Gamma there is a 100% chance you will be disapointed. If you want to play Gamma go play that. It's free.\n\nNow for STALKER 2. I really like this game, but it's taken till now for me to reccomend anyone play it. Most of my hours were through the xbox app as I did not purchase the game until it was removed from gamepass. The problem is this game ran very poorly at launch and had a number of glaring issues such as no mutant loot, but all of the assets for it. The majority of those issues have been patched at this stage. So, if you were waiting for those fixes go ahead and buy the game. I can run the game at 1080p medium settings at 60fps with a 3060, 64gigs of ram and R7 5700x. Before i was sturggling to run the game at Low as places like Rostok would tank my FPS to about 50, but now cutscenes can run as high as 120fps at medium if uncapped. That's good enough for what I want, but if you want 4k 120FPS factor in what im saying. \nLet's talk about gameplay. This game gets a lot of comparrisons to fallout 4 and i get it. This is not a deep apocolypse simulator/milsim, but neither is SoC, Clear Sky, or CoP. You're not gonna get any features that weren't present in the original games for the most part. The combat in this game is reasonably forgiving with the new master difficulty being the first time I thought \"now here's the stalker being a pain in the ass experience i remember\". Make no mistake, this game is the easiest game in the series by a small margin.\n\nAbout A-Life. Its here now. It works. It's nothing you haven't seen before and a little less magical in 2025, but you will experience NPC's roaming and fighting to your benefit or detriment. Came across a Burer fighting a freedomer in the Lesser Zone and wound up with an early game 870 so A-Life will affect your game.\n\nLast, Multiplayer. My actual complaint about this game is we still have very little info on this. The game is a fine value without it (the campaign is LONG) but we did pay for it and I'd like to know more than I do. Maybe stop worrying about DMCA'ing people (Misery was not the only thing they DMCA'd) and focus on that? Just a thought.\n\nTLDR: Do not buy expecting gamma. If you want stalker mod's because your bored of gamma try EFP, Old World Add On, Global War, Improved Weapon Pack, or Radiphobia. You will have a better time and they're free. Most launch issues have been resolved. Right now im gonna give it a 7.8/10 but it could get as high as 9 post more updates and multiplayer",

I put around 8–10 hours into it, pushing through the main story and several side quests in the Lesser Zone, really trying to give it a fair chance. But by the time I reached the next area to the north called \"Garbage\", I had to admit the game just wasn’t enjoyable. It wasn’t what I expected, and the constant crashes, framerate drops, and a completely absent A-Life system left the world feeling empty and static. Nowhere near the living, breathing Zone I hoped for.\n\nThen update 1.7 released and in the last three days alone I’ve put almost 32 hours into S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2.\n\nThe game still has issues, but far fewer than before. A-Life isn’t where I hope it eventually lands, but it’s finally functional. The balancing, optimization, and bug fixes have made a huge difference.\n\nAs someone coming to the series fresh, it took me about 10 hours in this new playthrough for everything to finally click. I kept trying to force the game into being what I thought it was supposed to be. I expected something entirely different. But once I let it be what it actually is, I was pleasantly surprised because it grew into something better.\n\nThe story is captivating.\nThe world is gritty but beautiful.\nThe characters feel genuine.\nAnd the mutants? They’re no joke. My encounter with the Chimera during an emission in the swamps was downright terrifying.\n\nGSC, I genuinely want to thank you for sticking with this game.

Mutants will try to rip you apart. Different factions will try to use you or just outright kill you, and the dangerous anomalies litter the environment. And yet, the quiet walks through the forests, the jokes and banter of the people huddling around the campfires, the glimmer of all the artifacts, and the sunrises welcoming a new day... They all reel you in.\r\n\r\nIf I had to talk more about the game itself, I really enjoy the slightly hardcore approach to it.

But these things were easily adjusted with mods so it's not something I care too strongly about currently. Still plenty to improve, just less held back in modding.\n\nPerformance has technically improved but at least at 4k the improvement is negligble - and more a reduction in stutter rather than overall performance improvment. Apparently an engine upgrade is coming, not confirmed if it will be 1.8 but if performance is your concern I'd wait for that,",

Did not crash once and I've only experienced two bugs, one of them was game-breaking but the game saves your progress quite regularly so it was not much of an issue. Overall, the game is smooth and I've not experienced any major performance issues with RTX 4070 SUPER and Ryzen 5 7600.\n\nThere are a few other minor issues though. Each one of them can be resolved by installing a mod so that's a plus. Keep in mind that installing mods will disable Steam achievements so I recommend installing a mod for that too.\n\n1. Skif definitely needs more stamina and the parkour mechanics need to be improved. Jumping just once pretty much consumes half of your stamina and the other half you deplete in less than 5 seconds if you sprint. That amount of stamina is ridiculous given the entire game is about exploring and running is the only way to travel around the map. I would strongly recommend installing a mod that increases your stamina and fixes parkour mechanics.\n\n2. Flashlight is way too dim. Every single time I turn my flashlight on I tell myself it's just not enough and turn on the NVG instead. Again, easily fixed by a mod but could've been there by default.\n\n3. AI feels weird at times, especially human enemies at night - stealth doesn't really work half the time. Some of the human enemies have literal xray and aimbot and as a result some of the fights are very linear. This only applies for human enemies because I've quite enjoyed fighting the mutants - do not underestimate them, even on STALKER difficulty.\n\n4. Weight limit. I was encumbered 90% of the time when playing without the mods even though I carried the most basic shit. I know I should not be carrying 5 assault rifles with me but at the same time do I really have to be encumbered all the time even though I only carry the essentials? Combine this with the laughable amount of stamina and the game is a very boring walking simulator - which was my experience for the first few hours. I did not give up though and I'm glad I didn't.\n\nNow the positive things; Atmosphere is second to none. Exploring feels great, gunplay is fun and graphics are stunning, especially with Reshade. I also love the weather and the whole concept of Emission. \n\nI was a bit scared of buying this game after hearing the performance is horrible but it turns out it's not true at all. Having not played any other STALKER games I must say I am pleasantly surprised and I can definitely recommend.

The atmosphere is insane, the gunplay feels great, the world is gorgeous and terrifying… and then boom, Windows desktop, like the game just remembered it’s held together with duct tape and Unreal errors. Every time I start to really get into it, some blueprint, AI bug, or random glitch jumps out of a bush and deletes my progress harder than any mutant ever could. It’s like dating someone who’s insanely attractive but constantly self-destructs — you keep coming back because the potential is undeniable, but you’re also silently begging them to get therapy.

      "review": "Bottom line: It's a great installment in the series. It is AT LEAST a solid game. There's no reason to not recommend it.\n\nGood: \n1. Atmosphere. The feelies abound: terrifying, weird, awesome, austere, and intense. The scary parts had me saving every 5 seconds like a young gamer. Exploration actually feels like exploration. There are so many little things to find that are just cool. Also, getting to revisit old locations gives epic nostalgia feels.\n2. Story. It's not convoluted nonsense (though, if you're here, you can indulge some fantasy). It touches on many elements of the setting, and takes you through most of the map w/o being linear. Depth of choice exists, and the factions are more defined than in the other games. Faction cutscenes are awesome, and there are both awesome moments and compelling twists. \n3. Graphics. Beautiful. A dark shelter at night, or running through a blowout is visually intense and captivating. There were multiple times I just soaked it in.\n4. Balance between punishment and reward. I play on STALKER difficulty, so I'm hurting myself here, but your stupid choices are punishing enough that thinking is required (IMO should be more punishing, but that's me). But, rewards (read: gear) is plentiful.\n\nThe mid: \n1. English voice acting is flat. I was gonna do Ukrainian since it added to the environment for me, anyway, and it's not game-breaking, but it stood out as a weak spot.\n2. Good gear gating is necessary, but seems cheap, and requires heavy investment in endgame stuff with limited game left to actually use it. Techs exist to upgrade your gear; endgame gear requires endgame techs, and upgrades really make a difference. IMO this makes sense so you don't just breeze through everything, but by the time you get endgame gear and open up endgame upgrades, it's the end of the game. You can also just run to the endgame techs at any time, so it seems cheaply implemented.\n3. There's so much loot to the extent scarcity doesn't matter. Sure, I hump literally everything back and forth, so maybe this varies, but I never ran out of anything. I never used the high-end medkits, but have hundreds of them. The top-tier gun ammo is more limited, but is also easily findable. Another limitation/check on too fast progress that doesn't quite hit.\n4. Story gaps, setting changes w/o explanation. I'm a big atmosphere sponge, so finding, for example, an entire outpost turned into zombies worth understanding. But there's nothing to find. There's also lots of talk about what the Zone should be, but it's not well detailed enough for me to care. This doesn't break the game, but lost chances for setting depth.\n5. Gunplay. To explain, understand that Sniping at extreme distance is not really doable. Draw distance, though it's considerable, still limits long guns. Thus, there becomes two main categories to the guns: 1) fast-firing, low-damage, medium/short range (assault rifles, subbies) and 2) slow-firing, high-damage, long/short range (sniper rifles, shotguns). IMO this is reductive once weapons are fully upgraded, such that every gun starts to feel the same, short of effective range and rate of fire.\n6. Limited/mixed survivalism. You gotta eat, you gotta sleep, but: not doing so really does nothing. Pet peeve, you don't, also, need to specifically hydrate. I also like the idea of embracing more nuanced wound healing (sorta the way Tarkov does it now). This ain't for everyone, but surivalism is a big mechanic and theme in these games; there should be more depth, at least as an option.\n\nThe bad:\n1. Story-wise, the basic reason the main character is in the Zone is thin. Then, during the intro he gets really pissed about getting screwed over. Both of these are part of the mystery, and, in context, matters a lot, but the rest of the time I'm just thinking this guy is exceptionally pissed about his apartment getting blown up. Sure, you get answers and a shift to the real, intense narrative pretty early, but it's still laughable IMO.\n2. Repairs. It's 10000% intended to be another gear gate, but your stuff gets fucked quickly, and are so expensive to repair it's just annoying, especially early/mid game. Endgame, you got so much and can access all the means of making money that it's less of an issue, but I put this in bad cause it's so frustrating.\n3. NPC spawns, pathing, and artifact spawns are static. There's some variety in what spawns, but you run into basically the same stuff. This maybe works for mutant, you don't want to just randomly run into pseudo giants everywhere, but it gets stale. IMO the Zone should be way more empty and varied than it's been in any STALKER game, but this was a bigger component in this game than the others.\n\nBugs\nThere are bugs that should get fixed, and the game could benefit from optimization. The level of bitching about bugs compared to what actually exists is ridiculous, though. The game doesn't crash every 5 minutes, every hour, etc. The only two crashes I've had were related to outdated Nvidia drivers. And, my brothers in Christ, I might have a 5070, but everything else in my rig is 3+ years old. My game is stable at 80-100 fps on epic settings at 2k.\n\nThere are valid complaints, but the QA issues on launch, prioritizing release timelines, are not unique to STALKER or GSC. I see this game ~1 year on has not been abandoned as a good thing, compared with the endless other $60-$70 AAA games by much bigger studios being run like a pump-and-dump scheme. IMO, stop preordering games to avoid this shit, and, though I agree all studios should be better, don't misrepresent what the game actually is.\n\nFor clarity, here are the bugs I encountered:\n1. Squads spawn right behind you, in areas you just traversed\n2. Captions for dialogue don't pop up immediately; you usually miss a line or two. Nbd if you can speak Ukrainian, or are using English\n3. Artifacts and bodies spawn underground. Artifact issue is more common, but you leave, you come back later, all good. Unreachable bodies appear to also only be ones spawned in, not enemies I killed, and never have been mission lootables\n4. Quest items can't be dropped, remain in inventory even after the questlines are finished. They don't take up that much weight, and a main mission element eventually clears any that should've been removed\n5. I had a constant radiation bug, where naked in a clean area I kept ticking up rads. Following some Google advice, I saved, spammed anti-rads with everything in my stash, reloaded, rinsed and repeated until it stopped",

Ah well, such is life in the zone. \n\nToday the game is the stalker we know and missed for so long. It's beautiful, runs well, and yes of course it's a little buggy. Always has been. The world feels huge and alive, areas aren't separated by obnoxious loading screens. Sure you gotta compile shaders but once that's done loading times are pretty forgiving to be quite honest! \n\nIt's the same A-life I remember from the old classic, and I know that wasn't always the case. You'll routinely walk up on people engaging in sorties amidst the decrepit ruins. You'll find new locations, but you'll also be in for visiting old, familiar locations from Stalker's past. The dialogue is pretty tight, I think it's a nice touch how the player character gesticulates while talking, makes it actually feel like a conversation and not just like someone is staring at nothing.\n\nGunplay feels good, definitely leans more towards the realistic as the previous games do. Bullets drop, nothing is truly hitscan. You also gotta watch yourself because you really can't take hits like in most modern shooters. \n\nWhat impresses me though is how it maintains that feeling the previous titles had, and that's something I was very afraid of losing with STALKER 2. Sure they've incorporated some more modern conventions, I'm definitely picking up some copied notes from CD Projekt Red's journal, particularly with how locations are laid out and the attention to detail like swaying trees and bugs on rotten corpses.  Very atmospheric.\n\nIt's worth checking out whether you're looking for a modern entry-point to a classic series, or maybe you want to give it another go after reeling from a rather poor launch day. I mean... their fuckin' country was besieged so I'm willing to cut em some slack personally, and the development cycle was troubled even *before* the war.

      "review": "Finally getting round to playing this game through a year after the release as someone with no history in the Stalker franchise, first timing the game on veteran difficulty and what I will start by saying is, the game generally is enjoyable, and the world itself is interesting and fun to explore, since I wouldn't have finished it if it wasn't, however, there are some problems with the game. \n\nThe performance as many others elude to, is rough, I messed around with the settings at the start and could never find myself consistently getting above 60fps (I have a 2080Ti and a pretty decent PC set up that handles other games with no problem), and so I had to make the decision to just accept I would be playing the game at roughly 30-40fps, which whilst not ideal, was still playable at least, with some areas like settlements dropping to 20-25fps (which was rough at times so I just made sure to get in and get out as quickly as possible). \n\nThe story and the world itself isn't bad, and there are some really awesome looking environmental effects (emissions and tornadoes etc), the gun play and the overall feel of the game felt satisfying, most of the weapons were pretty cool and fun to use, and the customisation whilst limited, still existed at least. But I have to say towards the end of the main story line, it really just started to feel like a running simulator, designed to extend the \"run time\" of the game and story by making you just run ridiculous distances between locations with fast travel being a very limited option in the game. It started to feel more like a chore and tedious, rather than enjoyable, which it had been for the first 20-30 hours of the game. \n\nA few less game breaking but small annoyances I found in the game:\n\n- Lack of distinction between the factions in the games out in the world, figuring out who is an ally or enemy is very challenging at times, and every now and then I would accidentally shoot an ally thinking they were an enemy and turn them against me. Every NPC just seems to be wearing the same outfit with maybe a tiny clothing/helmet difference which is hard to tell mid gun fight. \n- Stamina/weight management/economy, as far as I can tell, they made the economy a little better, but it's very easy to be overweight, and with the amount of running you are forced into doing, it felt like I was forever battling my stamina bar getting from location to location. \n- Lack of incentive for killing mutants, after a while, some of the mutants just become annoying to fight, and since they rarely drop anything, it felt like 70% of the time it was just more convenient to avoid or run past them and save ammo.\n- Story decisions not really feeling overly impactful, outside of a few choices that ultimately lead you to 1 of 4 alternate endings, it didn't really feel like my conversational decisions held that much weight (not sure if this is by design or not)\n- Loot and stashes eventually becoming pretty repetitive \n- Occasional game crashes or side quest bugs\n\nI do think there is a heart of a really good game here, and as I mentioned, playing this as someone with no previous Stalker experience, the game for what it is, is fun and that's why I am giving the game a thumbs up, I still found enough enjoyment to make my way through the game without any major issues or soft locks. But generally it's a shame that the game is still in this type of state or has been treated this way even a year later, because I feel as though with some genuine care and attention, this game could be everything that it was promised to be. \n\nTLDR- The game is generally fun and enjoyable, but performance and FPS are a problem, as well as some game play elements that make things feel a little tedious at times. So you need to weigh up both sides of that coin to decide whether it's worth paying for.",

It looked great in the trailers and also hearing the devs personal story really captivated me. Fast forward to release and I was riddled with excitement, I couldn’t wait to start my journey as a Stalker in this new world. I absolutely loved it, its atmosphere is breathtaking and nerving at the same time, the gameplay is really immersive and also difficult and the overall UI sucked me in,\n\nSure a lot of players experienced issues in the early days, but I was one of the lucky ones, I barely had any glitches, one or two crashes but overall my experience was great. \nTo my surprise, the game was then periodically updated and small details added that really started to bring this project to life, I fell in love.\n\nUpdate 1.7 for me was the best one so far, the A life has kicked in and performance is noticeably better. \n\nI’ve bought the ultimate edition on the Xbox store because I wanted to support the devs. I have over a hundred hours of gameplay (still only a quarter way through the story) on Xbox.\n\nI can’t wait to see what Stalker 2 becomes in a year’s time, considering how much we’ve improved up until now. \n\nI use UE5 on a regular bases for dev and can confirm that the update to the later version will be a game changer, a 2.0 release if you will.\n\nTheres so much to discover and play with in Stalker 2, I’m actually scratching to get back on it whilst I’m sat at work. \n\nMy favourite game.\n\nThanks",

      "review": "So many things for the game, I would recommend and not recommend it at the same time, but if you played  the old STALKER games ,Anomaly or GAMMA and you have any expectation you are in for a huge disappointment. \r\n\r\nIf you look at the game as a stand alone title, sure, it's an ok open world game. It has it's features, bugs, atmosphere, an identity of itself with the post communist era and the overall gameplay. But it's pretty buggy, not horrible , at least it's playable with just some annoying crashes for no apparent reason and you can have some fun with it, but compared with the older games, it's subpar. Now granted, with some games it's pretty hard to continue what a previous title created for himself, but with STALKER 2 it really shouldn't be the case, especially that they took so many elements from the old games and somewhat made it worse for , seriously, no reason at all and just spit out a somewhat generic  open world game.\r\n\r\nBut let's get a bit more specific:\r\n\r\n-One thing that bothered me from the start is the fact that they changed some parts of the map, I don't have an issue with adding new parts, but swapping and changing them, especially when the action happens in the same location is somewhat a immersion  breaker, it's nothing grave thing , but if you played the old games, is somewhat meh. \r\n\r\n- They absolutely butchered the mutants, now they feel like they don't have any personality at all, are huge bullet sponges and they just feel like are just there to slow you down, with the older games, it was easier to deal with them if you knew how to hunt them, now it's bring along hundreds of ammo with you, coz you never know. The mutants just eat bullets like a gopnik eating roasted sunflower seeds without even having a limp.\r\n\r\n- The weapons durability. I understand that you have this feature, but can you like make them a bit more realistically? Some guns can withstand thousand of rounds fired without jamming in real life, but in the game, several hundreds, and you can't do field repairs, and if you meet a lot of mutants that just eat up your ammo well, you are in for a nasty surprise, you will find yourself with a low durability jamming weapon in no time if you plan for a longer voyage. With the older games, you had more or less the same durability, but the enemy wasn't a bullet sponge so it worked out, but here, no. Just no.\r\n\r\n- The fast travel mechanic. Like the old games, and some other newer one, you just can't travel from wherever you want whenever you want, no, you have to go to a guide that will lead to you to some locations, fair enough. But, in other games, you might have a horse, a dragon, a car I don't know a flying magic carpet, which will make the exploration easier, but not in here, and since the map is pretty big, more than half of the game is just you walking around from one shitty stash to another shitty stash, gee thanks for that 30 rounds of ammo and the 2 bottles of vodka that I spent half an hour for, and that I end up stashing them (with the other 400 bottles of vodka) I swear to god, the main protagonist should just go and win medals after medals at a marathon after dealing with the zone.\r\n\r\n-The A-life mechanic, for those who don't know, in the older STALKER games the A-life made the game more realistically, it made the game look like a real life changing aparatus, constant fights, NPCs had their own goals, you were just another dude in a place filled with other dudes who came to the Zone for their own reason, in here, in the beginning there was no such things, now they improved it, but I haven't play the latest patch so maybe it's good now.\r\n\r\nThere are more thing to say, but  I ranted for to much. Overall it's an ok game, if you look at it as a standalone game, but if you played the old games, boy are you in for a disappointment. I feel like this is the only game that I purchased it at a full price and then be sorry that I bought it. These being said, credit where credit is due, the game developers are doing a good job at constantly updating and fixing it, so I expect in the future the game to be better patch by patch.",

In 1.7, it kept me interested more thanks to my upgraded computer and the exploration appeal than because the story is interesting.\r\n\r\nAs of 1.7:\r\nGOOD\r\n - the exploration and the atmosphere are quite good. The mix of post-apocalyptic with a taste of horror in some subterranean are a success.\r\n - weapons variety and upgrades helps you refine your combat tactics. Armor gives the feeling of progress.\r\n\r\nMeh...\r\n - Too many weapons are mostly unusable since you do not find enough ammunition for them. The cost of ammunition is awful in Stalker difficulty.\r\n - The fight are neither good or bad. Against humans, they have strange detection and the game loves to make them hit you even for very low damage. With mutants, their HP and damage are too high. In any case, It would have been more fun to have higher numbers of enemy than HP tanks.  \r\n - the difficulty setting are just messing with damage and HP in combat or buying and selling price in economy. The gaming experience in stalker-level was bad until I downloaded some mod to correct the latter.\r\n - A-Life is just spawning few people / mutants during your trek. It is just that over the game course, the complexity of the situation never evolves. Only the equipment on humans or the kind of mutant.\r\n - economy and merchants are unbalanced. During a large period of time your enemy uses only early game equipment and they block your progress relying the related equipment and prices (selling, repair, etc.)\r\n\r\nBAD\r\n - scenario and english voices are messed up. There is nobody you would attach yourself due to an overall lack of depth for all the characters.\r\n - In higher difficulty, the game's economy forces you to hunt artifacts but the damage made to your equipment during your trip are forcing way too many repeatitions. It is diluting your game experience. It bores you before reaching the end game. (\"solved\" through mods...?)\r\n\r\nVisiting the unique world of STALKER 1 & standalone DLC hooked me several years ago. On STALKER 2, having a full open world map without loading has increased the immersion. Visiting old location for nostalgia had more impact than I would have imagined.",

As a long-time fan of the trilogy, I was excited to finally return to the Zone. But once the game launched, it became clear how broken it really is.\n\nVisually, the game looks fine and the atmosphere is decent, but everything else falls apart fast. Mutants are bullet sponges, AI has aimbot accuracy, and the A-Life system is a complete mess. Enemies spawn right behind buildings and run straight toward your position as if they have built-in wallhacks. The Zone may be large, but it feels empty and lifeless, with long stretches where nothing happens.\n\nAfter about six hours I gave up.

Clean install, first tutorial mission, talk to Hermann, and the game crashes right after the dialogue. No matter what settings or fixes I use. Exactly what I wanted to avoid.\n\nAfter a two years, I expected at least some fixes and optimization. Nothing changed. As a long-time fan of the original trilogy, this is incredibly disappointing.

Its like going to amusement park and not abandoned tragedy area. feels like the zone is small puddles in vast road.\n\n METRO Exodus felt more like stalker then this abomination\n\nMutants - are a joke , predictable and dumb AI that only gives a chalange by new unavoidable attacks that take your control away.  They are similar only in looks to the franchise, whit the changed behavior and no rarity they lost the magic and scarry part of them. just inconvienences that delete your ammo. \n\nHeard nothing from devs on changing or continuing to develop core gameplay, only visual things and more platforms , won't be surprised if they dip. \n\nThis feels like mockery of good old stalker franchise.  Stalker Gamma or anomaly is the biggest competitor for this team for upcoming decade if they wish to continue the work.",

Ive finished the game once and Ive done 2 additional runs and I just cannot bring myself to continue them because the game gets boring and tedious after the halfway point, the fact that 90% of combat encounters in endgame are monolith and only monolith seems like a bad plan, which I know is integral to the story. The map is huge which is a good thing but it feels as if it had an additional plan for travel, whether that be squad travel from COP or more locations or area guides like CS but you lose access to guides due to faction relations and only certain guides will take you to certain areas theres no real overlap in them so you spend a lot of time especially post halfway point just running.\r\n\r\nThis game doesnt feel like a stalker game but rather an empty shell of what made the original 3 so good. Its a real shame as I really want to love this game and Ive put off writing my review through all the issues Ive had with the game, the new features are good but itll never functionally fix the bones of the game or the direction the studio has taken it.",

Year after release the game still runs like garbage and saturated in an atmosphere that leaves me yearning for something more. This company is shady, removing A-Life feature plug off the store page upon release, investing in TV shows and a half baked remaster of the original trilogy. Multiplayer, if it ever arrives will likely be another battle royale or messy PVP mode with little development time. Recently they DMCA Misery for ripping assets from S.T.A.L.K.E.R. but leave Stalcraft untouched because instead of Misery, Stalcraft makes their money through an in game store front. Whatever the actual case may be, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is a soon to be abandonware. GSC has been attempting to jury rig the game engine into the foundation needed to support core features that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 needs to thrive. When the realize that they cant, support will end after the expansion and multiplayer drops. \n\nYou need basic pattern recognition to realize this game will not get better. It may seem that way with these updates that they drop but they're not giving you anything new. there is no innovation at all, A-life functioned in the old games, NVG's were in the old games. They give content that should have already been there and peddle it as if they're listening to community feedback. It is MANIPULATIVE and it's working. I'm sure some dev's want this game to get better, but they will not be given the tools and will only be strung along until they're no longer needed.\n\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is not a living world. It's an open world FPS that is best played in a linear fashion. besides the main story there is NOTHING going on. If you like linear shooter campaigns, you'll like this game. Returning customers will notice pretty fast that the ECOSYSTEM from the previous games are gone. Think Comparable to rainworld or ARMA's A.L.I.V.E. mod as reference. In 2007 GSC Created a game engine so damn innovative that it served as the foundation of what made S.T.A.L.K.E.R. what it is. The moment they took the easy way out with unreal engine, My expectations should've saved my bank account.\n\nTo conclude, it's aight. Without the legacy attached, the only way you would find this game would be in a steam sale for $20. Without the legacy attached no one would be talking about this game. A miracle to find in anyones library outside of eastern europe. With the legacy attached though, it makes me feel sad. Sad GSC wasted years to push out such a forgettable experience. It would have been more meaningful to use this wasted devtime to protect Ukraine. As of now, I'd encourage every employee to drop GSC and focus completely on protecting the things that actually matter. Home and Country is an objectively better choice then sticking with this disaster.",

      "review": "Stalker 2 Heart Of Chornobyl is a game that I have been waiting for since its original cancellation in 2011. I had been in the community since Shadow Of Chernobyl was called Oblivion Lost. Playing all sorts of fan mods ever since. I still do to this day. I live and breathe the franchise, It is a bit of a problem in my day to day life... :)\n\nIf you are approaching this game as a newcomer? You may still like it, but if you are a veteran you might know what comes next...\n\nI preordered the Ultimate Edition in anticipation.\n\nStalker 2 is an attempt of a continuation of the original trilogy, by a husk calling itself GSC Game World. I have attempted to enjoy this game time and time again, but the results are always the same, this is not a Stalker game, and I end up dissappointed yet again.\n\nMy issues stem away from the game, over to the studio and their behaviour over the last year. It has become increasingly evident that at no point should Stalker 2 have been released in 2024.\n\nTo this very day we are receiving updates for features that had existed in the original games, this isnt new stuff, just a crappy landlord paintjob as an excuse for new features. GSC Game World promised DLC, Multiplayer. These features do not exist a year later, having to backtrack, fixing bugs and adding a crumb of new content in the form of a pistol or a Mosin rifle. They excuse bugs as anomalies: The idea with calling bugs anomalies would've been fine 15 years ago when Stalker was considered Slavjank, and not a AAA project costing millions.\n\nGameplay feels like a modern shooter, with yellow paint(which you can turn off thankfully) to lead you towards your goal, I can make a comparison to the modern Far Cry games, which play alright, but nothing special. The UI is clearly targeting a console market, which is fine but makes it a little less enjoyable to interact with than the original games.\n\nA-Life has turned into a marketing strategy, despite being constantly being neutered between the releases of Shadow of Chernobyl, Clear Sky, and Call of Pripyat. If you are curious I suggest you look online as the grand scale that A-life had before the original GSC Game World studio had to begin using Grigori's Scissors, cutting things out of the project. I still constantly see NPCs spawning in visual range, or even behind me, something that GSC promised has been fixed. Areas are still constantly empty, as if you are somewhere where the game just doesnt expect you to be, rr you are suddenly being chased by 12 dogs, that just spawn behind you.\n\nChoosing to base the locations in the game far more off reality is alright I guess, except for the part where it completely ruins the entire story of the original games, making none of the choices of any of the characters in any way logical. The Brain Scorcher for one, is completely out of the way and can be avoided, it doesnt even lead into Pripyat like in Shadow Of Chernobyl.\n\nKeeping it surface level regarding the story, all mysticism is gone, the game tries far too hard to explain each and everything that exists within. Skif's motives are absolutely atrocious, a new apartment? thats the best you guys could come up with? Iskra and Varta are factions that simply do not make sense, especially when we already had factions that work in their style: Duty and Freedom. Varta acts as a military force that controls the zone, when the previous 3 games show that not even the Ukranian Army could, Operation Monolith from Shadow Of Chernobyl anyone? Operation Fairway from Call of Pripyat? Yet somehow Varta just manages to go around all of the troubles that the Zone gave to those that tried to control it. \n\nThe underground laboratories that gave you heebie jeebies? they have nothing remotely scary about them, either UE5 lacks the capability to bring forth such an atmosphere or GSC simply didnt try.\n\nGSC Game World has a problem with being held accountable, as do their fans. Anyone with critiscm is a paid off Russian orc who cant possibly have an opinion, I have recieved this statement to myself personally. My issues lie with the game, not with the fact that the developers are from Ukraine, despite any attempts to explain that my heart is with their people. Their offices are in the Czech Republic too, away from the very real threats that their countrymen are experiencing. it's incredibly weak to insult those that have more critical views of the game rather than trying to engage in fruitful dialog about its shortcomings.\n\nGSC Game World has become a cash cow. Releasing the original games on console twice, then those 'remastered' games on pc, which just allows them to charge more for games starting to approach on 20 years of age. They also have a new artbook out! Continue giving them money while you get things that should've existed since the original release. Binoculars still don't exist, and do not have a reason to, there is no one beyond a 100 metre range for you to see.\n\nGSC Game world also has acted atrciously due to an indie project called Misery, choosing to DMCA the developers rather than sorting things out behind the scenes, or even more excitedly work with them to create a potential collab. Instead Misery is not even allowed to create an easter egg of one of the inspirations that brought it into existence. How cowardly must you be to feel threatened by such a small project? \n\nI wanted this game to be incredible, hell even just good would've been managable. I still do, I wait eagerly for updates, a comeback to glory much like Cyberpunk 2077, but it just doesnt happen, and it doesnt even feel like its heading in that direction. It feels like these proverbs: If you put lipstick on a pig, it's still a pig. If you polish a turd, you have a shiny turd. I know plenty of people who share my view, and we are all deeply saddened at the result.\n\nI will continue playing the original releases of Stalker, because as far as im concerned Stalker officially died in 2011, and the community is keeping it alive with mods to this day.",

Only rediscovered the game again in 2014. I have finished SOC at least 4 times now with and without mods. Done CS once and COP once unmodded once with a bug fix mod and 3 times with misery. \r\nAnyway I'm giving this game a negative review as its just not what I wanted out of stalker 2 I wanted the OG stalkers but brought into the modern day... instead I got a shell of the OG games on a crappy over bloated and over rated engine. \r\nFirst of all the none existent A-life in the game drains the game of any life other then the random event spawns but they feel so fake and forced. Sure SOC was scripted and CS was a lil more strict too but like still those games had life to them there was still random lose squads that would wonder around the place.\r\nAll they additions they have add too, to the combat ai and looting ai are still nothing compared to the OG games...\r\nWhile the gun combat is really good in this game the ai are dumber then rocks and only in a recent update has made them use cover but still also nothing like the OGs with AI being sneaky or hidding or any of the other things that made the OG combat feel that bit more complex.\r\nAtmosphere in this game feels... bland. Something feels really off when I play this game but it really doesn't have that feeling I get in the older stalkers. I think it might be the realistic lighting ? I mean the lighting in the past was good in the OGs but something feels off the colour grading the weather the sounds something is just off... also stormy weather doesn't give that feeling in this game like it used too... \r\nAlso the rain isn't dynamic in this game it'll gladly rain through objects and make areas that are supposed to be dry wet...\r\nThe graphics are fine I guess... but really I don't care that much about graphics if this game had like 2015 graphics and better mechanics I would be fine with it...\r\nThe map as well... I kinda don't like the map at all... They never bought back any of the cool zones that were cut from the old betas back into this game which is something I'd hope they do. Some of the area changes are confusing and break the OG story line a bit. Also cordon feels empty and awful.\r\nI really was hoping stalker 2 would improve but it hasn't its still a shell of what it could of been or maybe I am just coping too much. \r\nI cannot reccomend this game over the OGs but the enhanced editions also.. with the censorship and changes and problems... Yeah maybe it is better people play anomaly over the enhanced editions... or try openxray if you have the og games.",

Music can also be affected.\r\n-My weapons falling through the map when the thumb looking mutants yank it out of my hands.

For me.\nI played the old ones for hundreds of hours, I got to know a lot of things inside and out, and this new part didn't offer anything new to me. (apart from the story) The huge map is sometimes a disadvantage, as you can only travel on foot, no vehicles whatsoever.\nThe sounds, weapons, food and drink, items, etc. are the same as in the old ones. Okay, the sounds do bring back nostalgia, that's a positive.\nThe English voice acting is terrible. Although the dramaturgy isn't really a big deal either, perhaps that's not the game's main strength.\nIn 2025, I think character creation, crafting, maybe base building, and vehicles would already be necessary for a title of this size. If it wants to be a survival-type game. Because somewhere, it wants to be something like that.\n\nThe bottom line is: for veteran S.T.A.L.K.A.R. fans, I don't think it's a big deal (due to the lack of innovations). The new generation who haven't played the old episodes might be hooked; the atmosphere is just as good as it used to be.\n\nMaybe I'll finish this part someday, but for now, I'm bored with it.\n\n(I'm not even talking about the bugs and the huge patch packs, people with slow internet connections lose their hair after 1-1 patch pack - okay, at least they're working on the game, but they could have scaled it back the sizes, it was like I was reinstalling the entire game ~every week or two weeks)",

      "review": "I have played this game since the very release with xbox game pass subscription. Once subscription became insanely expensive I decided to purchase the game in Steam. It was a real mess on release, but even now it's still very far away from perfect state. With each update we get a list of hundreds of small improvements, but also we get new bugs, small and big. I am honestly tired of waiting until I can enjoy the game without stumbling upon some annoying bugs that wasn't there before each update. For example now with 1.7 patch they broke surround sound, HOW THEY MANAGE TO NOT NOTICE SUCH ISSUES BEFORE RELEASING A NEW PATCH!!! Not worth your money now. The game is good gameplay wise, and story isn't bad, don't take me wrong, you can enjoy the game, BUT ONLY AFTER THEY FIX HUNDRED OF SMALL ANNOYING FUCKING BUGS!!! I was convinced by number of youtubers that now is the time to come back to STALKER 2, but it's not. The optimization is still crap, DLSS is still broken, vegetation is sill noisy and blurry in motion. I don't even want to start writing about the A-life which is simply saying non existent... I have 3070ti and Ryzen 7 6800H which is a pretty good setup for 2k 60fps+ gaming. This game gives me less than 50 fps on average, and it drops to 35 in hubs/bases such as Zalissya, Rookie Village, Yaniv Station and so on. And occasionally it drops to 15-18 fps just for no reason for 1-2 minutes. And that is the best I could get with medium settings. Some of my friends experience crashes after the last patch. It's been a whole year since release and they didn't manage to bring it to polished state even after the whole year. I know that developing a game of such a big scope is difficult, but god dammit, you take money for it while it's not in even good enough state! So, guys, don't bother now. Don't buy it for a full price, don't even think about it. Wait for 50-40% discount and then take it if you really want to. Shame, such a shame.",

      "review": "Stalker 2 is a game I was very excited for. It was a game I was willing to give a lot of leeway, due to the issues with development and the circumstances around the development near the end. Unfortunately, It failed to meet even those low expectations. \n\nNow to describe the developers of this game as lazy, or lacking in passion, would be untrue. They are, you can tell they are. The issue I think is simply that Stalker 2...either became too big, or somewhere down the line things began going poorly or their skill was simply not up the task. I hope the final point to not be the case.\n\nThe early to mid game is fairly good. Its quite content rich. The issue of course, is anything after reaching SIRCCA. The amount of content available to the player drops substantially, and lets not forget the rather tedious boss fights. On top of that, beloved characters feel changed or outright wasted and no real reason is given, or at least not a satisfying one and this even extends to entire Factions. I mean at no point does Duty, Freedom, Mercs or anyone other than the new factions, and Monolith take part in the main plot. (woulda been cool to find some clear sky faction references through rare suits or something like that)\n\nThen we have the fact that A-life was not there in launch, and only just now are we getting something that resembles the bones of A-life, while it lacks the muscle and sinew of what we expected. The various animals of the zone feel less natural than Shadow of Chernobyl for crying out loud (They don't drag bodies back to their \"Dens\" and who thought the Bloodsucker eating animation was a good idea? It in the name guys, come on) A game that is over 10 years old on a far, far smaller budget Human enemies are aimbots, quite simply. What made Human enemies in the old games fun to fight against is that they would flank you, they would sneak up on you. The AI does try to flank you, certainly, the key word being try. The areas where combat takes place in built up areas, typically don't have many flanking routes for the AI and this is despite the fact the areas are generally bigger than the old games. Meanwhile, in the rather bland open areas they simply walk towards you. If there's cover, they will use it now, which is certainly an improvement from launch, but if there's little cover they simply walk at you, not left or right, directly towards you, making headshots incredibly easy. Its certainly more A than I.\n\nThen we have the map itself. Simply put, the Map is too big. Having to run 2 Kilometres to my next objective wouldn't be so bad, so long as I found something to do along the way, but there is very little. You may find some old locations, a stash or two if you have the right edition of the game but other than that, bugger all. Quite frankly I would have preferred that they did what the OG games did, but made the areas larger. This would have meant more detail, less strain on PC's and A-life likely wouldn't have taken this long to get the bare minimum working and felt more impactful.\n\nI could go on for several more paragraphs, but won't. All in all, while I can appreciate the passion of the developers, I don't appreciate that the game we were promised, and the game we got, are 2 very, very different games. I wanted a Stalker game, I got...whatever this is. Perhaps in a few years, the game will be worthy of being a sequel to the 3 (Clear sky I judged you too harshly) previous games titled Stalker, but as it is right now, it isn't.",

Enemies are seeing me from way too far away and then firing their no-aim garbage shotguns at me which makes no sense. They're not engaging me at effective shooting range so it's this dumb encounter that is ultimately just annoying. Enemies are too spongy too, far as I'm concerned. Not terribly but enough.  \n\nThe rest of the game is honestly boring to serviceable. I'm not an OG Stalker guy so I have zero nostalgia. \nThere's no character building, base building, crafting, meaningful exploration, or gripping story (far as I can tell, maybe I'm off about some of this). \n\nAnd if I can nitpick for a moment. Low levels of radiation poisoning do way too much damage and you get it way too easily.

      "review": "(At the very bottom are some Positives) \nIf you're a stalker fan you will be let down, if you're not it'll be an okay forgettable experience. But if you're the type of person to think the recent marvel movies are the best in entire the franchise well then nothing can be bad, and you will probably have a great time.\nIt's a shallow example of the Stalker series. The visuals are a blurry, grainy mess. There are interesting environments, scattered throughout but are then mostly devoid of anything to do or see. The vegetation is incredibly underwhelming compared to the previous games. There's a whole lot more of it, but its all spindly, short and half dead. In universe, the zone has been pumping and growing the environment and wildlife for decades now but it doesn't look or feel like it at all. Lost alpha (an old mod for Shadow of chernobyl) does a far better job of bringing this vision to life with a tiny group of fans. \nWhere you use to come across camps of people that made it feel like the zone was lived in, now in this game most sites/buildings are empty unless related to an active mission. It took over a year for that to be sort of rectified and it still feels all wrong.\nIn odd contrast, the zone is swarming in all the spaces between locations, nonstop with random wandering groups and mutants that are constantly at war with each other. It's sometimes constant explosions and gunfire in the distance, for minutes as you travel between places. A lot of the time its with groups that you wouldn't imagine seeing in that part of the map. It makes it feel like there's a 100,000 or more Stalkers living there and its and active warzone.  Then most of the main hubs are oddly empty in comparison.  Just the bare minimum amount of people. At least in the old games the had limits with the technology and the engine. They don't have that excuse almost 15 years later. 15!!!!! Yet the old games still feel so much more refined, and complete.\nThere are definitely QOL improvements in the gameplay and otherwise but with features like the vaulting, it 's woefully inconsistent. Night vision was completely until very very recently (after the community complaining for a year), but the nights and environments are darker than ever and the flashlight somehow weaker. which is only worsened by the fact the enemies can spot you from a mile away, night or day, and also hit you from that distance with a sawed off double barrel with regular shells. And good luck spotting them flitting through the messy foliage. But don't worry they always know where you are and will always walk right up to it even if you moved around when out of sight. Also stealth just doesn't work unless you are using the default pistol or the glitchy knife execution mechanic they put in. I don't know why every gun has a suppressor option if only one consistently works.\nMost of the game was an irritating mess when it first came out, and mods were the only way to get through it the first few months. Overhauls for AI, spawns, combat, weather, graphics/optimization, QOL, and so on. Everything had to be fixed, everything. And only in the last couple months has the game really started to reach a more complete state. (unfortunately an industry standard practice at this point so not an exclusive issue). Also a purely  political decision they made was to remove as much as they possibly could, relating to the soviet union. Symbols markings, etc. So in otherwords one of the core aspects of the aesthetic of the entire series. The developers must have forgot that the soviet union was a completely different entity from the modern day Russia. Yes Russia is a bad actor in todays global politics still, but the developers erased and censored that history from the series because they felt butt hurt. Its naive, immature and shortsighted. \nThe story is rough. They clearly knew the lore but cherry picked and added too much new random stuff while completely sidelining nearly all pre-existing groups. Motivations and actions largely don't make sense. There were cool things they explored but in the end it felt like the zone was somehow cheapened and made less impressive. \n\nA personal gripe I have is with the main hubs and bases still being dirty, completely ramshackle environments. Some of these bases have been around for a decade and a half but nobody has removed the broken glass from the main walkways and bedrooms, or moved out old boards and crates or patched over the windows?? I don't expect them to have remodeled and renovated their spaces and thrown up a live laugh love sign, but even the biggest richest faction are living in pockmarked hovels with debris ridden floors. Nobody has a broom or knows how to lift stuff? Yet they have a bunch of custom welded structures and the resources to carry that out? It just little details but when everything else is lacking, things like this start to stick out far more. \nThe last negative thing I have to say is that the Map and open world are a detriment, at least how they implemented it. The location of everything is changed and the landscapes massively altered. I believe they wanted to reflect the real world geography better, but why bother after 3 games that put a greater emphasis on the game design/progress for the layout. The paths characters took in the past games just don't make sense anymore. Also The locations from the old games, are often just there for nostalgia with little reason to stop there besides check for loot. which would normally be fine, since you can't just keep reusing the same exact locations endlessly, but again in a disappointing game like this it just makes you sad when you come across them. . \n\nThe GOOD is that the developers do seem dedicated to trying to rectify the endless list of bugs/glitches/issues that plague the game at every turn and have been pretty consistent about updates. Some small bits of extra stuff (weapons, night vision, etc) have been added as well. The modding scene is decent but there isn't anything to crazy to write home about. But there's at least a mod to fix most issues and add some much needed features or changes. \nThough I criticized quite a bit, there are definitely cool moments/ideas, fun fights on occasion and cool areas to roam but in the end it was just a big fat meh.  Also ignore the amount of hours I've played, I have like 300 hours in Back 4 Blood as well and that game was awful. I apparently just like to suffer.",

Your character is tanky to compensate.\n- Mutant AI are bullet sponges and don't react to being shot\n- Limited Stamina combined with a huge amount of running makes traversal tedious\n- Ballistics feel bad with insane damage dropoff and absurdly fast weapon degradation\n- Long term bugs persistent including Artifacts regularly spawning in unreachable places and crashes\n- VRR causes insane OLED flicker",

Artifacts disappear under textures, can't be picked up, and don't respawn. Corpses fall underground, weapons fall underground, and damage and health have been imbalanced since release (a bandit in a jacket can withstand three SVD shots to the head, a scuba diver can withstand six shots from an 860 shotgun, pistols do more damage than anything else in the game and can be used to complete the entire game, grenades suck, and mission rewards and side quests aren't worth the money). The Burer throws objects over walls, and you still get pelted with bottles and bread. Anomalies have a trigger that doesn't match the visual path near them. Visually, you won't enter the anomaly, but the game thinks otherwise and kills you by throwing you into the anomaly with an invisible trigger that's wider than you actually see. There's no life in the game; bots appear behind you or fall from the sky on your head. The story is uninteresting and boring. I'll play through this crap to justify the money spent, but I won't go back to it. I regularly replay the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. trilogy, but I won't download that crap 2 again. A year later, the game is still unfinished, and nothing has changed. The main problems remain from the release: they just ate the money, drank it away, and spent it on girls.

However after 62 hours of playing this from start to finish I honestly have to say this game was bad.\n\nLot's of even basic enemy AI in this game is garbage too, even a full year later. Getting stuck on walls, not shooting at you. Standing there after you just shot their teammate next to them. There is no enemy AI in this game.\n\nIf I wasn't getting one shot due to a boss fight I basically had infinite healing items because the game just throws them at you every nook and cranny, same with food. Never once were survival mechanics an issue which makes me ask why even have them then? When in a battle it's legit get shot at cause you can't see the enemy, heal, shoot back, try to reload your gun, heal, fail to reload, heal again, finally finish reloading, heal again, return fire, heal again. It's bullshit and not fun. There are many times where you just get stun locked into healing constantly because of certain fights. You try running away? You can't cause even their shotguns have insane range, but your shotgun is trash at distance. If you're not using a sniper in this game you're not even able to play it.\n\nAnyways I DO NOT recommend this game even a year later. I bought this on release about a year ago and played it for about 20 hours and it was the same thing over and over again. From hour 1-62 it's the same. I've basically used the same shotgun/sniper loadout you get near the start the entire game as well because the weapons don't really make any difference until you get your own Gauss Cannon.\n\nSPOLIERS for two of the three endgame \"bosses\" and their trash. One isn't even a boss fight, it's just skulled enemies.\n\n\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n\nEspecially many of the boss fights in the game. One of the last fights is against a squad of 7 enemies with Gauss Cannons on balconies sniping you while you have 5 skulled shotgun bosses charging you with NO COVER and the cover that is there THEY CAN SHOOT THROUGH WALLS. Absolute trash. It's basically RNG if you can even win this fight as you constantly have to heal which interrupts your reload.\n\nOne of the final bosses in the game I had to cheese to beat because he kept teleporting everywhere every second. He ended up getting stuck on a wall so I was able to headshot him 25 times in a row with a .308 WHICH IS RIDICULOUS I even had to shoot him that many times in the head for a human enemy in what is supposed to be a semi-realistic tactical horror game. I understand it's a boss, but come on. My damage is maxed out and if the guy didn't get stuck legitimately wouldn't of realistically won.",

The performance is awful, the visuals bug out constantly, and it feels like the entire thing was glued together at the last minute.

Metro Exodus, Red Dead Redemption 2, and even older last gen console titles look better, feel smoother, and have far fewer issues. Those games were made years ago on weaker hardware and they still manage to embarrass Stalker 2 in every way.\n\nStalker 2 is a broken, choppy, messy product that should never have released in this condition. After a year of patches it still looks like a beta that nobody tested. The visuals glitch out, animations break, and the game feels like it is always fighting against itself.\n\nRight now, Stalker 2 is not worth your time or money.

And if you're not dead after the first shot then you will be once they've stunlocked you into oblivion again. Seriously why is it like this?\r\n\r\nSome parts of it are brilliant like the cutscenes, animations, story, atmosphere, the guns look great yet shooting them feels off somehow. I think it's because the aiming and movement feel sluggish. In the older stalker games movement and aiming felt a lot more fair and way more natural to me, lots of issues like that build up and cause an experience that made me wanna slam my head into the keyboard. \r\n\r\nThat being said, there's huge potential in the game, It's why I kept playing it despite not having a good time, and I tried so hard to have a good experience with this, but unfortunately, most of it was painful to get through. \r\n\r\nI played on Veteran difficulty, I tried out Master difficulty when that was released which turned out to be what I expected = first bloodsucker appears > stunlock to death > repeat from start of game > hell no\r\n\r\nI paid the full price for the game, upon release the game was extremely lackluster. Thankfully after some updates it has become better, but not nearly good enough than I expected it to be. If they fix the game and all it's weird gameplay issues, then I would recommend it to people once it's on sale or something.\r\n\r\nIt sucks to leave a negative review, I hate doing it, but I feel the need to throw out my opinion anyway because I really wanted this game to be good. I wouldn't have spent 71 hours of my life on it despite suffering through it if that wasn't the case.",
