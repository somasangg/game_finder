It's different strokes for different folks. What pleases me may not please you. For that, you have to play it. The most important thing to remember, is this is a simulation, not an arcade. You need to spend some time learning the game, you can't just log in and start blasting.\n\nIt is the overall experience which is why I recommend this game.  It really captures the atmosphere. The dev team are increasing their firing rate on new content in recent years, and the game offers you all the freedom you need to take on any space career that you like, from being a passive tour guide, to being a bloodthirsty pirate. You have total freedom.\n\nMy biggest plus about the game is the customer service. I have contacted them several times over the years regarding varying issues, and they fixed every problem and granted every request that I had. The stories of other players tell a similar story. If you are nice and polite with them, they are happy to bend some rules and make exceptions where other games would not be so willing to go against their own policies to satisfy a player.",

      "review": "[h2]The Good[/h2]\r\n\r\nThe game delivers exactly what it promises: a huge, open galaxy full of meaningful gameplay loops. Whether you want to explore deep space, mine resources, map planets, run cargo, smuggle contraband, or dive into exobiology, there’s always something to work toward. Ship engineering and upgrades offer plenty of long-term progression, and the new colonisation update adds even more freedom by letting you claim systems and build your own orbital or ground infrastructures.\r\n\r\nSpace combat is a standout. It has a steep learning curve, but rewards skill and creativity - letting even smaller or weaker ships hold their own if flown well. Most of your time will be spent in space, but landing on airless or thin-atmosphere worlds offers a nice change of pace and access to exclusive resources.\r\n\r\n[h2]The Not-So-Good[/h2]\r\n\r\nThe game includes microtransactions for early access ships, stations, and cosmetic items. They aren’t overly aggressive, and everything except cosmetics can be earned with in-game credits - but it’s still worth noting.\r\n\r\nSome systems feel underdeveloped. Powerplay and on-foot gameplay could use more depth, especially for combat, where gunplay and AI behaviour feel dated and inconsistent. Exploration-focused players will get more out of the on-foot side thanks to exobiology being both profitable and satisfying.\r\n\r\nThere’s also a grind. Gaining reputation for bigger ships or collecting engineering materials can take time, even if it’s easier than it used to be. Unlocking engineers still requires a fair amount of prerequisite work.\r\n\r\nThe game’s narrative side shines with long-running mysteries and slow-burn story arcs that often lead to massive events like alien wars or uncovering decades-old conspiracies. They’re fantastic when they hit, but progress can be very slow - weeks may pass between major developments so do be prepared to wait.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd absolutely recommend Elite Dangerous because it constantly gives you something to chase, something to discover, and there's always something to master - it’s a game that genuinely rewards your time more often than not.",

      "review": "Elite Dangerous is kind of a handful, I personally love it, it's something I've played for years, perhaps not consistently, but still adore. I guess the way I could picture it is like a really good comfort food that you know is probably not good for you but you'll eat anyways, or like cigarettes, or both.\n\nThis game is really really pretty, it's sound design, atmosphere and graphics are really solid, all the ships have unique engine sounds and characteristics that drive someone like me to want to try all of them out, at least for a little while. All the systems are fairly in-depth, not enough to scare off a person just jumping in, but enough to be engaging, most of the time. Honestly it's fairly versatile, when you're finally well off enough to kind of go for whatever you can do whatever you want, combat if you want more engaging gameplay, exploration for a mix of engagement and lax gameplay, and mining and trading for something you kind of just turn your brain off for or as a stimulus to stay focused on other things like D&D or some other form of media. The good part is now there's a lot of ways to make good money, and you don't really need to like cheat the system or anything anymore to make enough money to be worth your time and effort. \n\nThis game is very far from perfect though, it kind of lacks a lot still and has seen a long period of inactivity that has only recently been dusted off and has been getting more and more content. It also kind of sucks how FDev isn't exactly great in it's monetization philosophy, either, it's a microtransaction game which it doesn't lock anything out per-se (and we should keep it that way, pretty please, fdev) but it does keep non-paying customers waiting for a few months for the 'early-access' period of content to be rolled out to them. I think obviously they have a lot of people who are really passionate about this game but also some who are kind of greedy, or otherwise need to keep these systems in place either due to necessity for funds or legal reasons, it isn't right, but it's the situation that the game is in.\n\nGameplay wise, the Odyssey Expansion is hit or miss, Exobiology and the exploration aspect of the game is emphasized a lot more and is pretty fun, as is the scavenging and salvage. The gunplay kind of leaves a lot to be desired, however, where it feels kind of weak and the guns don't sound very satisfying or don't really reflect how powerful they are stat-wise, which feels very odd considering how excellent the sound design is in other parts of the game. They claim to be working on the gunplay balance in the future, so we'll see if that improves at all in due time.\n\nOverall, the game is an imperfect- but solid title, I'd recommend just buying it on sale, even though 24 bucks is honestly pretty fair. You can get a lot of mileage out of it just so long as you kind of cycle through the different 'professions' for lack of a better term so as not to get burnt out.",

But as it is, this game is an amazing accomplishment, and insanely underrated. It has to be the single greatest spaceflight simulator of all time, as well as one of the greatest science fiction MMOs of all time. The only game that really overshadows it is, of course, the one and only Eve Online. \n\nElite is essentially like No Man's Sky, except the spaceflight, combat, and ship customization are actually good, whereas No Man's Sky is sadly mediocre and as deep as a puddle of piss. NMS is basically a pretty looking tech demo, but ED is a true sandbox. I don't mean to hate on NMS, but for me the game has simply fallen short on what I want from this type of game, regardless of how much it improved over the years.\n\nBasically, No Man's Sky leaves you wanting more, and it lacks any kind of depth, or meaningful progression. It's very surface level.\n\nOn the other hand, Star Citizen promises a whole lot, but ultimately hasn't delivered, and it's not really a stable, finished product, AND the system requirements to play it are fairly prohibitive - you can play Elite on a toaster, but Star Citizen requires a monster machine to actually run, and even then it's still full of bugs.\n\nEssentially, I see Elite Dangerous as the black horse of these three games - not nearly as flashy or overhyped the way the other two are, yet in many ways a perfect balance of what both the other two games want to be. \n\nI hope the game sees a brighter future, because it really deserves it.",

It puts realism and scale into perspective and this game is easily one of the best VR experiences I have had as well. The downside is that it is extremely hard to recommend to other players due to the high skill gap, a tutorial that does little in favor of helping new player and a MASSIVE grind to get to experience everything there is to offer. I would still reocommend this to anybody who is willing to put the time and patience into learning this simulation game because once the game clicks it really does become a one of kind experience.",

For some people this breaks immersion but I find it to be the opposite. I like to imagine that these sites are canonically accessible to pilots and that I'm accessing them through my ship!\r\nAll-in-all I highly recommend this game if you have the time to invest in it and the patience to familiarize yourself with the mechanics of it. \r\nI will say though, that even after 622 hours of playing this game, there are tons of things that I've never bothered to pursue- but that's the beauty of it! There are so many options for all kinds of players! YOU choose what you want to do and how you want to play!",

      "review": "Elite Dangerous is one of those games that can be exactly what you want it to be. You’re not following a linear story; you’re carving out your own. And whether that story is “Fearless Bounty Hunter” or “Delivery Pilot Who Really Shouldn’t Have Jumped Into Anarchy Space,” it’s yours to shape.\n\nSome nights, I’m cruising through the black in silent running, watching starlight spill across the cockpit while a distant nebula glows on the horizon. It’s calm, meditative, almost therapeutic. It's a perfect “I just want to chill tonight” experience. And then, on other nights, a pirate shows up, scans my cargo, and suddenly my peaceful space yoga session turns into a frantic scramble where I discover, once again, that I forgot to bind half of my combat controls.\n\nThe game’s galaxy is truly massive and realistic (hard sci-fi). The sound design is phenomenal, the ships feel weighty and distinct, and the moment you nail your first manual landing without scraping paint off the station? Chef’s kiss. And let’s not forget the community: helpful, passionate, and always ready to explain why your rebuy cost is the most important number in the universe.\n\nElite Dangerous is a rare game where you can log in to relax and also log off because you got hyperdicted by Thargoids and your blood pressure spiked. It’s peaceful until it isn’t, calm until it’s chaos, and that balance is what makes it unforgettable. If you want a space sim that rewards curiosity, patience, and the occasional panic-induced button mash, this game is absolutely worth your time.",

It's a fantastic sim for those with patience, and is respectively unkind to those looking for easy thrills. A surface level analysis will leave you feeling aimless in an empty galaxy, but there is significant return on investment for those willing to put in the effort.\r\n\r\nMuch of the fun comes from the nuance of immersion and novelty of exploration. It's a true sandbox so you're expected to make your own goals; it will never hold your hand. This is equally true for learning systems and discovering lore - the game leaves breadcrumbs, but most will need to turn to external tools and knowledgebases to be satisfied.\r\n\r\nIf you're in it for the long game, ED will no doubt be one of the best simulator-focused space exploration experiences you'll ever have. All Commanders best come prepared though, or you'll find the game can be as unforgiving as space itself.

      "review": "Elite: Dangerous is such a fascinating game.\n\nNowhere else have I seen such a dedicated and hard-working community coupled with such a terrible and lazy developer.\n\n10 years of Elite with countless community tools, out of game groups and networking, dedicated information gathering software all to provide a QOL to the players that the devs have never even attempted to provide.\n\nBugs take years to get fixed (if ever), the pace of updates is a new ship every few months with almost no gameplay differences (This is the most active the game has ever been), and a development team that is so wildly out of touch from the community I can only assume they're locked in Frontier's basement. \n\nWe've reached a point in the community where every single greedy action by the devs is brushed off as \"Oh they need to keep the servers on\" as if this isn't a full priced game with required dlc (That you need if you ever want to meet another player or use the new ships) and thousands of dollars worth of cosmetics.\n\nThat is just the overall view of the game, a more detailed explanation of why everyone is bothering to make their negative review is as follows:\n\nFor the past year, frontier have been slowly developing colony building into the game, which the community accepted with eager arms despite how unfinished and half-baked it was. Almost no explanation was given to how anything worked, bugs were constantly present, and the entire gameplay loop was more unrewarding material transport (something already part of the game) for dozens of hours. Despite that, hundreds of people have colonised thousands of systems, gathering groups and communities together to FINALLY make a mark on the game. People have quickly realised that half of the \"stats\" given in-game are worthless, tons of features are missing. and the entire thing had little to no purpose other than essentially map painting.\n\nAn entire year later, and colonisation is ready to come out of beta! Almost completely identical but with new QOL! Like the ability to deconstruct your buildings (not possible for the longest time) and slightly more logically modifiers to how the space stations run. Realistically? Colonisation is still only because you want to leave a mark on the game, a tiny insignificant mark that will take you hundreds of hours of the most boring kind of gameplay. \n\nNow, Frontier have come up with a brilliant idea to really tie off and celebrate the end of their \"immense\" work on colonisation, a $30 voucher to place a station from the original elite into one of your systems. It has the added benefit of skipping the 100+ hours that you would need to construct it manually. Once, of course. If you ever want to build a 2nd one you'll have to go through the whole agonising process again. \n\nSo the community, the disgusting cheapskates who only paid for the full game + dlc, ask Frontier \"Hey, will we ever be able to grind for 100+ hours to build one of these ourselves?\" \n\nFrontier, in their infinite wisdom, said no, of course not, \"why would you deserve anything, purchaser and active community member of our game?\"\n\nIt was only after days of the community yelling and complaining that Frontier finally relented. \"Fine, you can buy it now, or wait to build it in 2-4 months time, like we do with every new ship.\"\n\nExcept, JUST as everyone was ready to put it all aside, and forgive Frontier again for a controversy that would decimate a less-dedicated game's community, they released a final patch for colonisation. Was it filled with an actual guide? An explanation for what the hell all the stats actually do? New buildings? QOL? Anything?\n\n\"No lol, remember that first shitty space station you built in your system? The one that you have a time limit to build, forcing you to play 100 hours of the most mind-numbing actions in a month? That's the only space station that matters, everything else you built will be subsequently nerfed into the ground and be useless. This will update all the systems you built over the past year retroactively.\" \"Btw we're releasing the new station now and Oh look at that it has the best stats you really should just buy it and save yourself the hassle of playing the gameloop we designed.\"\n\nIt's amazing how Frontier can treat the community like pigs on a farm, feeding them crumbs of gameplay every few months and expecting nothing but money to flow into their wallets.\n\nAs always, the game has the POTENTIAL to be so fun, the whole Thargoid war was the absolute best thing Elite has ever done despite how long it took to implement. The community is so dedicated to this game despite how terribly the devs treat them, to the point where they somehow feel responsibility to BUY useless cosmetics just to keep the servers running, as if any of that is their responsibility.\n\nI personally have such love for the game and the people in it, and yet such loathing towards whoever is in charge of the direction this game is going in, my 778 hours are 70% boring mindless gameplay, 20% doing something that actively goes against the game design, and 10% actually appreciating whatever Frontier has made that year.\n\nIf you have any respect for yourself, don't buy this game, at least until the folks at Frontier develop some respect for you.",

Oh, and it has gameplay altering properties, not just for you, but also negatively towards others as you can use it to lock down claiming any nearby system for 24 hours by choosing when to place your instant station! And on a smaller scale, negatively drive traffic away from non-paying systems by having exclusive features and instant boosts to your economy over theirs.\n\nOh, and we're throwing away the art design to include Star Trek type ships. Nothing wrong with Star Trek. But this wasn't it for decades. And now it is.

And then they made some more of it, and I liked that too, but it was getting long in the tooth even then. Then they repeated the same gameplay formula exactly again in Elite Dangerous. And it was nice to revist an old friend. But they introduced shocking bugs at times. And badly designed features, and refused to give the players what they wanted. No, you'll grind the exact same tedious content again and again and like it; then they kept increasing the grind, and selling you macrotransactions to try and tame it again. Now, they are planning to sell you the option to skip one part of an insane grind entirely, for £25, using a skin you wanted since you were a child and can't get in game any other way.\n\nNo. No Frontier, you've burnt the last of the good will now. \n\nEDIT: As could be expected, due to community outrage, they swapped the permanent real money only for the Station to real money time gated. But the advantages (and insane price) remain, so they're only selling you, and only you the same pay to win just for a few months. And isn't that better guys? Isn't all forgiven now? \n\nWhy fall for this? Why be complicit in being the frog slowly boiled? You know they'll only try and sneak back to the same standard of exploitation after you normalise this principle; but don't you deserve better than this? No Man's Sky shows you can provide content without charging macrotransactions, just as we all enjoyed for decades before horse armor; and the firings at Rockstar just now show that the money you pump in isn't going to the people who make the games you love.

      "review": "[h1]Truly a game where it’s quantity over quality.[/h1]\n\nFor the first hundred or so hours, I had nothing but the biggest blast in the world… that is, until I had the unfortunate pleasure of being introduced to the Engineering mechanic. Players are incentivized to grind random special materials that only show up through sheer RNG. A bit of grind never hurt anybody, but this has become so tedious (and really always has been) to such a degree that you’ll find large YouTubers with up-to-date tutorials encouraging players to simply reload the game whenever a drop doesn’t appear, staring at loading screens for hours just to get the materials needed to upgrade your ships.\n\nIf your ship isn’t engineered a certain way? Say goodbye to any idea of enjoying combat, whether it’s on foot or in flight. The main demographic of space truckers might not share these frustrations, since engineering is essentially optional if you enjoy doing cargo runs for most of your night, but it becomes a thorn in anyone’s side if you intend to spec into anything combat-oriented or exploration-adjacent.\n\nAnd speaking of exploration..\n\nOdyssey introduced new materials, the entire first-person mode, and new planets to explore. However, the planets and settlements you can explore boil down to icy or rocky moons with a handful of random Fallout-4-esque settlements. That oceanic planet you see in the distance? Nothing but a pretty backdrop you can’t actually visit. The Earth-like world you discovered? Also just a backdrop. Have fun exploring the same three types of rocky moons on repeat. Considering Odyssey released four years ago as of writing this, and that nothing significant has been added since, it just feels like a cash grab.\n\n\"But those settlements you can explore - can’t you just have fun with that?\"\n\nWell! Like I said, certain materials used in Engineering can be found in those settlements, which requires you to break quite a few arbitrary laws just to get your hands on them.\n\nAnd yes, I do mean arbitrary. Let me paint an example: imagine yourself RPing as a bounty hunter, taking down players and AI alike. You land at a random settlement and notice NPCs use a scanner on you whenever they feel like it to ensure you don’t have outstanding bounties in the system. After a few seconds? You’re cleared. Then you use your own scanner on the same NPC and realize - wait a second - they do have a bounty. They instantly turn hostile and attempt to gun you down. If, by some stroke of luck (or by abusing the portable rocket launcher), you actually take your target down, you’re awarded their full bounty fee.\n\nBut then? The entire \"legal\" side of the outpost goes aggro. Now you’re stuck in a conflict with both legal and illegal members of the settlement, sometimes with no choice but to defend yourself. The automated system you scratched while returning fire? That’s a bounty attributed to you. Shooting back at the people trying to kill you, even in self-defense? Another bounty. And an even bigger one if you kill them.\n\nSo now you leave the outpost, having claimed your 2k credit bounty... and in return, you’ve gained a 25k bounty on your own head.\n\nNothing in either the base game or Odyssey seems designed with long-term play in mind. These features feel like they exist solely to entertain newcomers giving the game a passing glance and nothing more. The end-game of Elite boils down to tedious NPC trading for rare materials or quit-resume scumming to force certain drops in singleplayer. While some people might claim it’s reasonable to grind these materials over time, I’d rather not spend five whole evenings of my life trying to obtain a single material or one upgrade.\n\nOutside of Engineering being the biggest gut-punch I’ve seen in a game to date, where late-game progress comes to a complete halt while you grind materials and trade them on other players’ carrier ships (since P2P trading is somehow still not a thing), the game itself is just lacking. Illegal sneak missions might be the only excitement you’ll find if you don’t count how broken and lackluster the on-foot AI actually is. You can’t board other ships in combat, you can’t explore any proper cities or large settlements, and even boarding a space station boils down to the same two interiors you’ll see every time you step out of your ship. Not to mention… Frontier’s solution to curbing the engineering issue? Paywalling content. I’d rather take those 30 bucks and spend them on a different game entirely than buy a single ship that released ten years ago with some extra flair and guns slapped onto it.\n\nThe game has its moments, and I revisit it for nostalgia’s sake. Other than that? I wouldn’t recommend this game to anyone interested in space games. I’d sooner direct them to Elite’s competitors, because of how much more fleshed out those titles are in comparison. The game shows its true colors in time to anyone who picks it up: malicious paywalling, tedious content you can skip by throwing money at the screen, and no way to use your in-game currency to obtain similar items.\n\nDo yourself a favor - Consider finding out what competition Elite Dangerous has and buy those games. This is not what you're looking for.",

      "review": "Here’s a brutally honest, very negative review of Elite Dangerous:\r\n\r\nElite Dangerous is a mile-wide, inch-deep grind masquerading as a space sim. It promises a living galaxy but delivers an empty, repetitive sandbox where “emergent gameplay” mostly means doing the same dull chores in slightly different star systems. The flight model—while initially impressive—quickly turns into a slog of supercruise boredom, endless frameshift loading, and tedious station loops that feel like a second job. Core loops (trading, bounty hunting, exploration, mining) are all padded with time sinks and menu-hopping rather than meaningful decisions or satisfying payoffs.\r\n\r\nThe game’s sense of progress is glacial. Ships take absurd grind to afford, then demand more grind to outfit, and then you discover the “endgame” is just the same activities with bigger numbers. Engineering is a notorious timesink, sending you on scavenger hunts for obscure materials and RNG gates that add friction instead of fun. Powerplay is a confusing spreadsheet war that feels detached from your actions, and the Background Simulation—while clever on paper—rarely translates into impactful, player-visible outcomes. The galaxy is huge but feels lifeless: thousands of near-identical stations, copy-paste planetary outposts, and barren worlds that look great in screenshots but offer nothing to do.\r\n\r\nMultiplayer is flimsy and inconsistent. Instancing issues split friends randomly, PvP balance is a mess dominated by engineered meta builds, and Open vs. Solo undermines the idea of a cohesive shared universe. Community goals recycle the same gather-and-dump grind with slightly different flavor text. The Thargoid and Guardian arcs, hyped for years, unfold at a glacial pace and lean on opaque mechanics and fetch quests rather than compelling narrative beats.\r\n\r\nUser experience is clunky. The UI is nested and slow, mission boards are repetitive and bland, and basic quality-of-life features lag behind other modern sims. VR and HOTAS support are the only things that truly shine, but even they can’t mask the fundamental problem: there’s shockingly little game beneath the scale. Odyssey, the long-awaited “space legs” expansion, launched as a technical disaster and still feels like a shallow bolt-on—FPS missions are generic, AI is dim, performance is erratic, and the on-foot gameplay lacks the depth or polish to justify its existence.\r\n\r\nFrontier’s communication and direction have been uneven at best: long content droughts, half-finished systems, and a pattern of reworking the same mechanics instead of delivering new, engaging content. If you’re hoping for a rich narrative, meaningful choices, or diverse mission design, you’ll find a repetitive treadmill with gorgeous vistas and not much else.\r\n\r\nIn short: Elite Dangerous is stunning to look at and thrilling for the first 20 hours—then it becomes an exhausting, joyless grind through a sterile galaxy, a simulation of travel time and loot RNG rather than a compelling space adventure. If you want depth, variety, and payoff, look elsewhere.",

That being said the game obviously has promise but the tutorial is a horrible joke and should just be removed because there is so much to the game that it literally teaches you nothing by comparison.  \n\n2.  The game doesn't clearly state or truly warn you that is noticible that if you leave the new player area for any reason you lose your federation Permit and are now screwed because you are in a ship that is not ready for threat 3/4/5/6 at all and pirates steam roll you if you can't escape.  Not inclucing players easily take advantage of this. Sure pick your fights if you can, but a nice and big warning on screen flashing or something would've been more acceptable.  All I wanted was a damn Detailed Surface Scanner so I could start laser mining!  I almost had to use rats service for running out of fuel for this horrible trip that destroyed this amazing opportunity as well.\n\n3.  With above stated I chose to delete my save and start over so I can farm the new player area for all its worth instead of first day leaving it without realizing I did until it was already too late.  I looked on the site, forums, google searches and there is a ton of information stating that if you delete your save you keep your ARX bought pre-built ships but just lose all things purchase with in game currency.  Players are telling me this is not true at all and that if I do this I will lose all of my ARX that I purchased and I will lose my Type 11 Prospector that I bought with that ARX; which is very criminal because that goes directly against some online policies and bills set by the Government themselves.  I would not believe this, but the people stating this are overwhelming during the livestream I was hanging out in; stating things like company will not honor what their own site states is possible and the support is known for not honoring requests. Wish I knew this sooner... \n\n4. You can never tell where to go in this game.  Easily the worst navigation ever in a space game.  Sometimes missions to not mark planets, stations and areas to go for missions with the blue planet icon. Your modules and ship parts get damaged for no reason at times just from horribly set durability I am guessing?  You just fly from one System to the next and you somehow have 40% damage to an internal part and you did everything correct and in a way that causes no damage....so odd \n\n5.  The control in the game are easily the worst I have ever experienced, but to be fair after quite a few changes it was at least tolerable.  Dog fighting is different, but I would prefer old school Wing Commander over this mess.  Even No Man's Sky has a better dog fighting chance and no I do not like using the press S to auto follow targets I play manually.  \n\n6.  When the game first came out the reason i didn't play it is that literally all who i knew tried it hated it.  Plus back then i was professionally playing other games anyways.  I now see why with above statements. \n\n7.  Crashes due to game engine failure.  PC specs many generations past requirements!\n\n8.  Once I left the new player area without realizing it was a thing, my 20+ missions all failed simultaneously; which was the only real warning that mistakes were made, but this is a lifetime mistake that can never be corrected because they do not honor their own policy of ARX/ARX items staying account bound forever so i could delete my save and start over!\n\n\nThere is a bit more but trying to keep this to most hated things.  \n\n\nThe things I actually liked: \n\n1.  Ability to buy a ship for ARX so I can try to jump into being the miner I wanted to be without taking too much away from the game by purchasing the standard Type 11 Prospector that still needed modules and upgrades to let me still play the game and was not advanced like the others that literally and most likely kills the game for some by giving you all you need instantly with little need to do more by comparison.   \n\n2.  Game is not pay to win, due to weapons not being purchasable which is nice.  It is Pay to Advance with the ability to get where you want quicker; which I usually stay clear of but didn't seem to mind this time.  \n\n3.  The visuals in the game are simply amazing! \n\n4.  Music is surprising.  Especially the show tunes when you dock to stations...ha \n\n5.  Single player (solo) and Multiplayer (Open and Private) share the same universe!\n\n\nIN CONCLUSION:\n\nAll-in-All I would've powered through this game and eventually and most likely enjoyed it eventually.  With them not honoring their own policy on deleting a save and being able to keep your ARX purchases forever; this is the deal breaker for me.  Well they got my $13.99, in addition to purchasing this game years ago, and would've gotten more if I was able to restart and farm the new player area longer the second time around.  Regardless of my bad review the game would've been amazing with more time spent in new area so I could learn the game before going into areas I was not ready for at all.  I didn't die but I could see how overwhelming things where and I was not ready for them.  \n\nDifficulty is supposed to be based on skill or lack of skill to force practice and not just bad controls in general and horrible mapping/NAV all over the universe, which are the 2 biggest things in this game in order to do anything and everything.  I watched many streamers and could tell based on my previous space-based dog fighting experience that they are incapable of being as good in this game as I was in other games with space dog fighting and that concerns me greatly considering that means I can't be as good either even after years playing.  A couple were very good but they literally revamped every single keybind, so that tells you how bad the default setup actually is, but at least this one is fixable to some extent. I could state more examples, but this is already a long review and most won't even get to this point, but I hope some get the point of what I am trying to say.  \n\nTutorial:                     1.0/10.0  - Worst I have ever experienced\nMechanics:               2.0/10.0   - top 3 worst of all time \nFeatures:                  5.0/10.0    - not bad but not many unique or amazing \nControls:                   1.0/10.0   - Worst I have ever experienced  \nMapping/Pathing:     3.0/10.0   - Worst i have ever experienced \nShips:                       9.0/10.0  - Some of the very best looking designs I have ever seen \nStations/Planets:      9.0/10.0    - Some of the Best I have ever seen \nGraphics:                  7.5/10.0    - Decent, but not crazy \nConcept:                  8.0/10.0     - One of the greatest ideas, just very poorly handled...truly a shame \n  \nOverall rating:   5.0/10.0     - Promising but fails...5.1 would've been recommend technically",

Most of the \"gameplay\" sums up to big a** time wasters with no real reward minus a couple million which is nothing in this game. The different routes you can take to make your puny pesos are boring slog fest like cargo hauling, or flying through 15 systems only stopping to take a gas station fillup and moving your ship to the magic point. Mining which is the most random and unintuitive gameplay slop ive had to suffer through, Looking at 100s of identical rocks to find the one that glows just right to blast and make one of the few decent paydays left in the game. And the god awful combat that sums up to a wheel sim. Rotating 360 on a dime until you or the AI ship decides to leave or blow up. That's all there is in elite dangerous, its just boring and lame only held up by its good visuals and the illusion that the game will make some crazy comeback! When in reality the game has sat in a pathetic state for 20 years with barely any real content that makes it worth wasting your time playing. If i wanted to do a job after work Elite id just get a second job not waste my time playing this trash. Go play X4 instead",

      "review": "After about 300+ hours hours and I safely say this is a do-not-buy from me. The mechanics of the game are designed against new players and the community is embittered and toxic. It's easy to put 3-4 or even more hours of grinding in the game only to have it erased by a player who did it just to watch you cry in chat. You can only block them from smack-talking you. In my experience you cannot block someone from instancing you, you just have to stop playing the game. You cannot talk to other players while playing in solo. Solo is the way most players say you should play the game, in my experience.\r\n\r\nWorst of all, player faction wars are broken because of this. PVP is broken because of this. You cannot hold a blockade if the opposing faction can go into private and make deliveries. Immersion with the world and it's systems are sacrificed so that gankers can target players to erase their progress. There is no reward to them for doing this. There is no way to block this that works in-game. If you want to play a Space MMO with other people you should get No Man Sky, it sucks that Elite is so \"real\" with its 1:1 milky way but doesn't actually have anything to see or do. \r\n\r\nYou cannot land on planet that have an atmosphere. You can't even beam down like Star Trek. If it isn't a rock in space, you can't go there, you can't do anything with it. \r\n\r\nMaybe this will grow into a full game someday but right now it sacrifices it's cohesion to allow for players to be toxic to one another without even the ability for a player to put a bounty on a ganker. FDEV could create features to punish players being murder-hobos, you know, like every sci-fi galaxy has a bounty system and a most wanted list, but it's only against the law to kill NPCs and other players can't collect bounties on gankers who are killing people right now there is no SOS there is no recourse to actually learn PVP.  The only way to avoid a ganker who is targeting you at spawn is to log out and wait for them to be gone. This is a game other people decide if you get to play. \r\n\r\nBut there is nothing like that here and if you ask for help in the chat they just tell you to cry more. Who cares if you are trying to learning something new. Basically only get this game if you want to play solo. \r\n\r\nThere is zero RP. You can go to a bar and sit in front of a drink but you cannot drink it, bartenders do not sell drinks, your character never sleeps or lays down, there are no ship interiors, just chairs you sit in, you can walk around planets but they have less going on than Star Field. The only thing Elite has over Star Field is that it's online and there aren't loading screens. \r\n\r\nOnly get this game on sale and only get it if there is something cool going on you want to check out. Gankers will target you if you are new and you cannot stop them. There is nothing you can do. You are stuck at whatever star-port you spawn at until they are done with you. It's just how it is. \r\n\r\nI wish I could get my 10 dollars back.",

I had to rely on the voice cues to guess what to do next, and only several steps later would the game finally recognize the missed objective. I made it most of the way through before being told to “jump toward a nearby planet,” which promptly crashed the game and froze everything. That meant redoing a large portion of the tutorial.\r\n\r\nOnce I finally reached the main game, it crashed again — this time closing completely and displaying an error report. When I logged back in, the game claimed my character had died and respawned me so far from the starting area that it would have taken over 20 jumps to return. By then, I had exceeded Steam’s two-hour refund window.\r\n\r\nFor reference, my system specs are an i9-13900K, RTX 4090 (24 GB), and 64 GB of RAM — clearly more than capable of running the game. Yet even the “auto-detect graphics settings” feature didn’t work properly, setting my resolution to 1366×768 on a 4K monitor.\r\n\r\nIt’s frustrating that a game charging this much still feels so unpolished, and even more so that it pushes microtransactions on top of that. I strongly recommend avoiding this game. Just getting through the broken tutorial will probably take you past the two-hour refund limit — and by then, you’ll be stuck with it.",

In the era of light speed traveling, somehow, its realistic that a auto turret should be 10x weaker than a manual one. The game proud of it self for the realism... but its only in ...traveling in space. But when it come to gameplay, they nerf everything thats actually need realism. Like the one i mentioned above,. Imagine you have a transporter, a big one, what would you expect irl if you have a transport truck carrying all valuable in a combat zone? Thick plate, armed crews, good weapons, convoys. ETC. And in this game? best you have is one dude in a fighter thats best act like a bait for a fish. And a couple of turrets that deal little to no damage, due to transporter have really bad turn rate, you cant use manual aim turret.\n\nGrind without purpose other than making money. Mining > refing > selling. Or exploring > selling data. Or fighting pirate > bounty > selling ass resources. in general the money making rate is quite close to each others. However, the question \"why\" and \"For what\" will surely pop out more the longer you play\n\nFoot combat, endless spawn for a difficulty wreck, Worst? you cant LOOT ANYTHING, THERES NOTHING TO LOOT,  the items you get from salvage points are consists of: mission item, garbages, even more garbages, garbage that you think its not garbage, and rare item that you have to check if its needed for engineer which you end up selling anyway cuz you think its garbage\n\nSpace mining? Chill, relax, press mouse, drone pick up, refine trash from ores, sell.....thats it....Then you have the Advance mining, OHHHHHH. More left mouse button, but...WITH QUICK TIME EVENTs. MORE TEDIOUS GRIND WITH THE FEELING OF ADVANCE TECH\n\nAnd also ITS SPACE, why the hell does my 1000 tonnes space ship fly like a slug in the deep dark space CUZ ITS HEAVY? I understand if its slow near area with GRAVITY, BUT IN DEEP DARK SPACE!?\n\nNot recommend for people who have more than 1 game in their librady.

Cosmetics are absurdly expensive and only apply to a single ship, new ships have modules that can only be used on them, and the latest update punishes players who used the colonization system the way it was intended originally. There are so many ways to make money without aggressive and exploitative updates.\n\nElite Dangerous is a hugely mixed bag. This review focuses, in order, on money to value, activities, UI, and external tools. \n\nI got the game on sale for $2.50, and I got my value out of that for sure, even $20 would still be pretty good in my opinion, if not for the above. There are many activities such as mining, exploring, missions, as well as ground content & biology (with Odyssey), trading, faction influencing (minor powers and powers), combat, and improvements on your ships via buying better modules and upgrading via engineering. There is likely to be something you really enjoy about this game, and hopefully many things you enjoy! There are also options to play with only friends, and not interact with other players, if that's your style, and you can opt into playing in public at any time you want, or completely. \n\nWith that said, I cannot write a review without talking about the UI. It's an absolute nightmare, and has huge failures in terms of ease of accessibility and efficiency. It's so badly done that it gets in the way of having fun, of focusing on the game itself rather than a menu telling you about details.  There is way too much to say about it in the worst way, and everything about it wastes a massive amount of time collectively, and can be plain irksome. Just talking about the navigation tab alone: It's sorted exclusively by distance, there are no subcategories outside of a filter, which also mixes them / doesn't provide a way to sort first by station, then by points of interest, for example. Since they're exclusively sorted by distance, and since you're often moving in space, the listings can change, and move your current selection up or down, as well as the thing you want to select up and down, and can constantly keep doing so. Filtering is the best answer to this, but you can't divide sections by filter. You can't stop the listings from moving or \"freeze\" the listings, and you can't pin favorites to the top for quick access to what you want. The UI in general is beyond a failure in my view. It has a lot of features, but it seems like feature creep happened where more and more was added to the game over time, and the system now is beyond the point where it's anywhere close to good. Can you do what you want to do? Usually. There is almost always a way to do something, but it may be unefficient on many different levels. Honestly, the UI alone is a completely valid reason to not recommend this game to other players, it's truly atrocious. \n\nThe other major negative to bring up is that the design of the game is outdated in aspects, such that external tools, such as Inara, are constantly brought up to solve many issues present in the game. While I support external tools, love and appreciate the work put into them, the massive amount of features the various sites dedicated to Elite Dangerous provide really indicates how huge the issues that the game has are. On the plus side, at least there are solutions to them for the vast majority. Unfortunately, it's more system(s) you need to get used to related to the game.",

They have turned this game's progression into a tedious chore that just isn't enjoyable anymore. Several hours of WORK, just to afford a single fucking item to unlock an engineer. That's not to mention the time you're going to need to put in to get the materials to actually DO the engineering. They have turned this game into a full time job that DOESN'T pay.

Its missing some type of cohesive depth that would drive the average player to keep playing. The game has moments where it really shines, but its undergirded by hours of monotonous drivel that doesnt feel in any way rewarding. Once you have done any of the gameplay loops a single time you might as well have done it a thousand times. The same could be said about odyssey, moments where it really shines but undermined by convoluted in game systems that keep you from really enjoying the content. Colonization is just hauling with a re-skin and it gives you very little reward IMO as far as meaningful gameplay is concerned. Some of the most fun I had was from the tutorial odyssey mission, that was voice acted, that one mission seemed to give you interactive purpose. If their was more content like this, interconnected and meaningful, the game would be fantastic. Most of the content consists of going to the place, getting the thing, and bringing it back. I really hope they do something special with operations, otherwise this game very quickly becomes a monotonous slog that seems to punish you for wanting to enjoy the game.",
