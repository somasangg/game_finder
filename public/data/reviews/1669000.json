Apparently this has been an issue for years too so i dont understand why its not fixed yet? \n\nI love this game but please fix multiplayer thanks <3",

      "review": "Age of Wonders 4 expands on the foundations of Master of Magic and blends ideas from earlier AoW games, Civilization, and Heroes of Might & Magic 3 to create a uniquely rich fantasy strategy experience. Honestly, AoW4 was a pleasant surprise for me. While I’ve enjoyed the first two games in the series, the sheer number of society and character customization options in this one left me staring at the screen for a while before even starting my first campaign. That’s not a complaint quite the opposite. A game with this much depth shouldn’t limit you to a handful of options. The Tomes, along with the spells they offer, quickly become your best companions throughout the game. Make sure you explore all of them! The in-game systems, innovative mechanics, and the overall atmosphere supported by excellent music and art direction show how much care Triumph Studios put into the experience. One of my favourite additions is the Society Traits system. It’s not just a simple modifier; it’s a set of mechanics that can deeply affect how other factions interact with you. I won’t list them all here, but here’s one piece of advice: make sure the communities you plan to vassalize actually like you.\r\n\r\nI also found both the freedom on the campaign map and the tactical depth on the battlefield to be more than satisfying. Even siege battles feel dynamic you can bring in additional siege weapons (or “siege projectiles,” as the game calls them) that genuinely change the flow of combat. Another pleasant surprise was the narrative events. Characters act according to their own motives, leading to moments that genuinely caught me off guard like a quest involving a character searching for his lost brother. AoW4 is full of these little surprises.",

      "review": "This game has gradually become my favorite 4X game, and I tend to consider it a modern version of Heroes of Might and Magic. I also highly recommend it to tactical game lovers, as the battle system is based on this format.\n\nFor me, the first masterstroke is the creation of a 4X game where you actually finish the game. It's not too long, but above all, the pantheon system will make you want to play through the last few turns even when the outcome of the game is already known.\n\nThe second point is the role-playing dimension. I'm more of an optimization-minded person, but I still get caught up in the game because the customization system is so advanced.\n\nThe management is rich overall, but accessible. If I understand correctly, compared to other games I love, this one is more accessible and dynamic than Stellaris, without falling into a fake management system like Total War Warhammer (which I also love for its battle system, but whose management is as uninteresting as possible).\n\nBe careful with the economic model, though, as this is a Paradox game. I think that in this case, the value for money is pretty good, and I appreciate having a game that benefits from added content and follow-up, but keep in mind that you may end up paying every year once you get hooked!",

My problem is I get bored super quickly with them and they dont really capture my attention for long. War hammer 3 I have 16 hours in and I have played that game several times and quit. I say this because I have 7 hours in this game in just a single night. I bought the Throne of Blood DLC and the game in the same night. I am hooked. By far my favorite RTS so far. Allowing players to customize your leader was a great idea and the variety of races and factions you get from the DLC's is pretty awesome. Now, I do have 3 problems or minor annoyances. First, a day after I buy the game it goes on sale. That isn't anyones fault it was just bad timing lol. Second, The price of the DLC's are a bit rough but the Throne of Blood feels worth it so is what it is. The last one is the only actual complaint i have and it has to do with purchasing DLC. If you own the game or a DLC, the DLC packs wont account for it so you have to buy each one individually. There is no \"Premium edition upgrade\". A minor thing but still. The game itself is great coming from a PVE only player. 9/10 great game!",

Bought it, played, refunded. didn't like it.\r\nRecent free weekend, for some reason, it finally clicked. Maybe it was the patches? Rebought and now I'm locked in.\r\n\r\nI bought this game because the aesthetic/style reminded me of Heroes of Might and Magic (I played 3 and 4). It isn't the same as those games off the bat, there's no unit piling brute force play here.\r\n\r\nI spent 10 hours just losing game after game and restarting. Then I started accepting losses, into the defeat screen. Then, something clicked, the game suddenly made sense and I started to understand what I was trying to do. Overall I found videos or topics on this game outdated/old, not very helpful. It took me some time to understand the flow of the game. \r\n\r\nThere is a LOT of replayability to this game. I haven't even touched the customizability aspect yet. There's a VERY light Roguelike element in this game, within the Pantheon system.\r\n\r\nRight now it's my favourite game. I can see myself pouring hours and hours more into it. You don't need to buy the expansions, the base content is already very very good. You may be tempted to buy expansions once you figure it out.\r\n\r\nRead some of the reviews saying it's very combat focused, and in part I certainly agree. It isn't a chill Civilization game. That's the Heroes of Might and Magic part, you're going to win/grow by beating up monsters on the map, and other empires. You will feel accomplishment when you first start making builds that seem to make sense to you, and then next, reading what other people are doing and finally being able to understand what they're talking about.\r\n\r\nGreat great game.",

What sets it apart is how much love and care the developers pour into it, which shows in every update and expansion. The freedom to shape your own heroes, cultures, and magical identities is unmatched, letting you design anything from noble angelic empires to bizarre beastfolk warbands. That level of control gives the game a refreshing sense of ownership and keeps each run feeling new. The units and cultures themselves play in wonderfully different ways, with unique abilities that make every faction feel distinct on the battlefield. After more than a thousand hours, the charm has not faded. Instead, the replay value keeps growing, and the game continues to feel like a creative playground for fantasy strategy fans.",

      "review": "[code]Free Weekend Review: Played AoW3 and AoW:P. Had this game on my wishlist since release. Saw it on sale. Saw it on free weekend. Jumped in and completed short 1v2 game on a small map. Haven't bought the game though...[/code]\n\n[h1]Things I Like:[/h1]\n[b]+++[/b] The idea of AoW in general: It's kinda like Civilisation with a Dungeons & Dragons skin. I admit, I don't care about the AoW universe and even less about the lore/story because of how standard it is in style compared to Heroes of Might & Magic, Warhammer or LoTR, but I like games where you create your own faction and they give you lots of control and options for play. \n[b]+++[/b] Faction Creation: The biggest selling point for me tbh. In this game they give you many more options in the Faction and Ruler Creator than previous titles. There are more you can apply to your race/units during the game too through spells, for example: It's hard to find a game that lets you do it, but I love the idea of a good guy Necromancer. I created a human faction with Dark/Death culture style, but with Good Alignment trait. There was even the option of a Death Knight class for my ruler! During the game I specialised in Necromancy spells and it was perfect. And to add on to that, later I had the option to cast a spell to modify my race making them all Undead (turning them all ((including my heroes)) into cadavers!) There are still some issues with clothing clipping thru characters with certain bodies (even regular human bodies) that seems to me like there wasn't much effort put into rigging. \n[b]++[/b] You can unlock more options by playing. Faction emblems, ruler customisation items and some faction traits too. I've always said more strategy games need an overall progression system and while it's not that in-depth here, I do appreciate it. \n[b]++[/b] Lots of different units to keep it fresh. You can obtain units outside your starting race too through different events and actions. \n[b]++[/b] Lots of map creation options: Everything from map size and terrain to the types of units you'll find naturally inhabiting the world. \n[b]++[/b] Good art: Some good key art, loading screens art and button art. You can find the artists on Artstation. \n[b]+[/b] Better graphics. Characters look less cartoony. Some animations are low effort but overall an improvement. \n[b]+[/b] Researching spells instead of technologies: It just makes more sense to me than researching what a bow or wheel is for example. We're in a medieval fantasy setting, the world is established right there in the genre so no reason to research things that exist. \n\n[h1]Things I Dislike:[/h1]\n[b]---[/b] Given this Developer's past actions and especially the Publisher's past actions, I simply can't trust them not to do some anti-consumer shit down the line in the never-ending conquest us normies call 'Greed'. I don't like how many overpriced DLC they insist on having every game too. One DLC faction costs half the price of the base game. It's clear their strategy isn't to make a piece of truly special art, but to create a platform to sell off chunks of a game. \n[b]---[/b] It's basically AoE3...but better. And that's the real reason I decided not to buy. I've played a combined 50+ hrs in to AoE3 + AoE:P and after completing one game here, I feel like I've seen everything new they've added. Maybe I'll buy this in a couple years when there's an 'All DLC' edition on the cheap, but I might've moved on by then. These types of games are abundant now. \n[b]--[/b] Army Size still limited to 6 per stack: It gets tedious moving them around the map. \n[b]-[/b] Another of those games where their updates break the Steam Workshop mods and they don't do anything to help or support the modding community but also 'please keep playing our game, buying our DLC and our merch' but also 'we fixed 3 minor bugs that should've been fixed ages ago, so fuck your mods lolololol'.

      "review": "The presentation is great and flawless in all aspects.\nThe game is a result of great devotion to the detail!\nPersonally, I have not met any bugs or crashes at all. \nOn the tactical front, I feel I am right in the middle of the action; it is like a blend of Spellforce: Conquest of Eo (3 action points, with a maximum of 2 usable while moving, and the guard mode that prevents flank attacks) and Age of War.\n\n🧠The unit icons are very appealing, nevertheless, the fighting still appears to be more disordered than in Eo. There are some debuffs whose effects are hard to discern but they do give a more attractive vibe compared to the old Age of War fantasy games. Active abilities are still there for the units, but it's better to say that healing abilities for instance do usually provide \"temporary health,\" meaning they don't restore permanent health but give a boost during the combat that is just temporary. This makes you not to feel as if you are, at the end of a battle, \"farming health\" and that too as if it was some kind of a feat. So, for now, I might say that even if I find Eo's combat easier or faster, Age of War 4 still has its charm and is therefore enjoyable.\n\nThe tier system appears to be more alluring when it comes to basic units; I mean, without a doubt they still have some value. In fact, on some occasions we need to encounter really tough monsters, and the Tier 1 units will still have the role of restraining and grinding them down. Moreover, the difference in terms of damage and especially hit points between Tier 1 and Tier 2 is not that great.\nTo illustrate, I am totally extrapolating here, but I notice a Tier 5 unit has three times more hit points than a veteran Tier 1 unit!! Nevertheless, it has more area-of-effect powers and, I would say, it can take out five Tier 1 units with minor difficulty, or four Tier 2 units with much greater difficulty and three Tier 3 units on equal ground.\n\nThe \"context\" of the game is improved with a very detailed world creation system: the selection of a world or the creation of your own, together with race, culture, and magic. Besides the selection of a world, one may also pick a ready-made one with different difficulties.\nThe world creation is itself an extremely enjoyable process. It feels like race is just a \"skin\"; every race has two basic traits, but you can freely modify them. It's a skin with two exchangeable powers, still, it is stimulating and elaborate, and the powers are found in all soldiers.\n\nThe map is magnificently designed, and reducing the level of detail showcases an equally motivating strategic map. \nArmies go along with hexagonal areas; the units can smoothly start the constructing of roads. It costs 3 gold for each road hexagon but he does not ask for maintenance.\n\nThe land is divided into \"provinces\" which are small territories colored with several hexagons of the same environment and decorated with different items. Mice and other animals will also be guarding small treasures. Some of the sites are \"wonders\" of various ranks (bronze, silver, and gold) that allow you to unlock certain skills when you incorporate them into your cities. The wonders give you new units as well as lots of benefits, but to get them you have to first set them free (by fighting with your hero and their army) and then annex them.\n\nOutposts can be set up by heroes in every province. Settlers (or workers for roads) are no longer required.\nBunkers can be upgraded with essential gold investments that will not only improve their defenses but also allow them to have a small extra annexed province (making them two provinces in total). Besides that, there is a major investment in an empire autonomy resource referred to as \"Imperium\" to transform them into towns.\nThe map displays neutral cities of different races (your own race can be among them too), which adds more variety to the diplomatic gameplay. This means that you can make friends with them, do business with them, make them your vassals, and have events happening at times regularly.\n\nIn the same way, the diplomacy with the AI appears to be very much alive. The AIs are endowed with characteristics that prescribe their actions. I was able to do commerce with them and even form alliances, and to tell the truth, the AIs were, from an economic point of view, good at playing the game even at the normal level. One of the features of the game is a \"Grievance\" mechanism (in the case of a diplomatic mistake on your part) which may be converted into trade (meanwhile getting \"compensation\") or utilized as a justification for war.\n\nAdditionally, there is an alignment system simply characterized as Evil/Neutral/Good that transitions with time, but it still appears to be as black and white as portrayed. I am even now unacquainted with the effects of this system on the players. Usually, a tyrant's evilness and the resultant bad stability in their cities do not bring about any problems for them. A good relationship with the neighbors grants the tyrant the reception of diplomacy bonuses with neutral and good allies, but the stability must be positive, which means that the economic bonuses are also the same.\n\nA particular overlord-to-vassal system gives vassals the right to recruit troops, which revitalizes every 15 turns and lets you take units. On top of that, wonders contribute unique soldiers to this pool.\n\nWhat appears to be absent and comparable to Age of Wonders 3 without mods is the more profound contextualization based on culture. Playtime will confirm or refute this.\nThe game includes a system that is highly inspired by Warlock 2, where you take over and assign provinces around your city as farms (food), quarries (production) etc. Annexation does not cost anything but needs a population that is ready.\n\nMoreover, in the city, there are gold and production (number of towers) valued structures. All buildings of the first level can be erected, but for the higher levels, the provinces that are compatible are required and the other provinces can also \"boost\" them, in which case the cost is reduced by one-third. Maintenance costs are no longer applicable for buildings, but still by the time you reach the mid-game, you will have a lot of needs. Besides, the variety of structures is huge and they are well illustrated by the tooltip system.\n\n✅The Good.\n- Deep Strategic Gameplay\n- Customization & Faction Creation\n- Unique Racial Abilities & Units\n- Variety of Victory Conditions\n\n❌The Bad.\n- Slow Progression\n- AI and Diplomacy\n- Limited Unit Variety in the Early Game\n- Steep Learning Curve\n\n🧾In Conclusion.\nAge of Wonders 4 has successfully built up to the previous games' foundations while adding new and stimulating features to the strategy genre. It is an excellent game with deep customization options, worldbuilding that is ever-changing, and engaging tactical combat, so the longtime fans and newcomers alike will find it a great experience. The “Ascended” powers and the ability to shape your own faction's powers are the additions that bring in the highest amount of replayability ever, thus guaranteeing that no two campaigns will be the same. Sometimes the pacing might feel slow and the AI might be predictable, however, the variety of choices, rich lore, and changing game world more than compensate for any weaknesses. Whether you are defeating the entire map with brute force or outsmarting the adversaries with clever strategies, Age of Wonders 4 offers a rich and satisfying strategy experience, which is a worthy addition to the series. \n8.5/10🔚",

      "review": "💬As you may or may not already know, we're looking at arguably the best fantasy 4X game ever made. No kidding, Paradox Interactive and Triumph Studios have successfully produced a phenomenally engaging and quirky turn-based strategy game that likely has more potential than most could have imagined. It's the best installment in the series ever made!\n\n🎮At the same time, the issue cannot be glossed over like that. The majority of users will expect a confirmation and a reason. A simple argument, so to speak, as to why Age of Wonders 4 is worth your time, effort, and even - money. However, my point is: for those who enjoy fantasy-themed 4X games, this title is an unavoidable acquisition.\n\nIn 2019, Age of Wonders: Planetfall was received well by all, but it must be pointed out that Age of Wonders 4 has surpassed it in almost all aspects. It is a very large game that has picked up good things from its predecessors, and it is quite apparent at the very beginning that the developers have planned and are planning great things. Age of Wonders 4 is massively versatile and yet comprehensively massive; it takes genre tropes in the best possible way: allowing players to subvert them if they so desire.\n\nThe understanding of AoW 4 revolves around personalization and development. This is already a strong indicator of the game’s quality, even at this stage. It’s a title from Paradox Interactive. A publisher that usually, despite our love for it, produces content platforms of the highest quality that go through some delays at the beginning in terms of their full potential being realized. However, this time is not an exception. Players will get a robust and significant experience with high content from the very first day.\n\nAge of Wonders 4 is very much a strategy game that meets my need for experimentation and at the same time it is a strategy game that tempts me to new combinations of tomes and lead my empire to strange new places. And each time, I come back from my fantasy trip full of stories, like the time when I brought back to life a rival lord who had bothered me all the time during the game as an undead minion, who was forced to serve me forever.\n\nWhile I do find it fun to establish a legacy in a 4X game and then reboot, I find it much more gratifying to have my legacy accompany me in AoW 4. Indeed, it is really fantastic.\n\nIf you are curious about the source of such high praises, then you have found the right place. AoW 4 has made a very significant impact on the genre, and it sure did! To give some background to all this, one of the most crucial aspects of the game is its meta-progression feature. Some 4X strategy titles have experimented with this, the most noticeable being probably Humanity from a couple of years back, but AoW 4 has come up with a way that i have never witnessed before which is even more extensive and deeper.\n\nWinning a match in AoW 4, as clarified, does not mean the winning civilization gets to be forgotten, locked in a successful match, and having nothing to show for their efforts. On the contrary, the custom winners of a specific universe in the game can traverse the multiverse with you, occasionally showing up in future matches. The rulers I guided to the throne of glory really allied with a mighty pantheon and turned into the protagonists of the ensuing adventures.\n\nSuccess in matches brings new customization options and, thus, contributes to the already rich starting roster. Those who become attached to their characters do not have to be concerned since the game still gets easier as we make progress. The game’s free customization and empire-building tools enable players to organize their progress even two or three campaigns ahead. It is a very powerful and satisfying 4X engine that, hopefully, will keep on getting long-term support from Paradox Interactive.\n\nConversely, I have experimented with games where the significant factor was progressive flexibility and customization of the game. In fact, the creation of race does not stop at the beginning of the match; rather, it is only the beginning of your adventure. By selecting the physical form, traits, cultural leanings, and social quirks of your people, you can create different extraordinary empires from sinister moles with a penchant for cannibalism to hardworking goblins who only want to build magnificent cities and make friends.\n\nNevertheless, it is worthy to consider that the real variety of the game reveals itself afterwards. Via the magical research trees, players can choose their race of creatures in a number of different ways as never before. In addition to this, there are substantial changes. In AoW4 we will get new features, new powers, and new ways of endless advancement.\n\nAoW4 needs continuous playing since it provides many options to expand your kingdom. However, there is also a major progression system, the Pantheon, that makes you come back to the game. The consequence is a game that is always open and has endless options!\n\n✅Strengths\n- Comprehensive Unit Synergy\n- Stunning Visuals & Art Direction\n- Tactical Combat\n- Dynamic Spellcasting System\n\n❌Weaknesses\n- Complexity May Turn Casual Players Away\n- Tactical Combat Can Feel Repetitive\n- Overly Complex City Management\n- AI Diplomacy Can Be Clumsy\n\n🧾Summary.\nAge of Wonders 4 is very much like a magical feast where one can select from different options like world conquest with dragons, friendship with ancient tree-people or establishing an entire empire solely based on wizardry. It is a game in which a player will create his/her own fantasy race and then turn them into the most powerful (or weirdest) empire ever on earth. \nManaging cities, engaging in battles on extremely well detailed maps, and performing spells that might even make the gods envy are some of the activities to be performed in the game. And don't forget about the heroes, because nothing demonstrates \"I’m a world shaping mastermind\" better than dispatching your magic-wielding, armor-clad hero to stomp around the battleground like an overpowered, medieval superhero.\n\nWithin the world of AoW4, every gaming session turns out to be a new adventure. The players are allowed to establish, investigate, and eliminate (or not, in case they are in a diplomatic mood), and participate in the amusing disorder of being the supreme fantasy ruler, the very basic of the game. It is deep, it is enchanted, and it is suitable for everybody who does not mind a little bit of strategy mixed up with dragons.\n\n💬The nice part is that Triumph Studios has done an incredible job. No matter if you prefer fighting, researching, or expansion, Age of Wonders 4 is very likely to be your time-consuming habit for a long time.\n8/10",

The maps are also a highlight having different options to change the map keeps every playthrough fresh and different. Together, these elements make every new campaign feel unique, and that’s what makes the game so fun and engaging.\n\nIf I had to point out a negative thing I would say the clipping in the character creation, there is A LOT of clipping and misplaced hand positions for holding weapons, and helmets that are way too big or too small.",

      "review": "A frustrating and ever-changing game which I can't help but come back to. If you are coming to this with no preconceived notions, an appreciation of the fantastical, and a love of strategy, then you will certainly enjoy this game. However, you should know that the game you buy will not be the game which is available for you to play in 6-12 months time (there's no support of older versions).\n \nThe trend in the updates is to curtail the variability in the evolution of your characters. For example, I bought AoW in late 2023. At that time, godir and hero characters could fluidly change the weapons they used (ranged, magical, or melee). The upgrades and abilities available to characters were dependent on the research you unlocked.\nNow, characters are railroaded into specific classes preventing them from using certain weapon types, because many players disliked that their characters could use other weapons (my brothers, you were equipping the weapon). The abilities available for characters to unlock is now unrelated to your research tree and is restricted based on the class of the character, making research less meaningful and character upgrades less immersive. It also implies that millennia-old wizard kings who practice destructive magic completely bluescreen when handed a sword, which takes me out of the game somewhat.\n\nOn the other hand, the variability in the civilisations you can create is vast and has trended upwards, happily, and in general, updates have improved the balance between different cultures.\n\nThe inclusion of race transformations which are retained by your godir character into other games are extremely enjoyable goals to pursue in themselves.\n\nFinally, I have to praise the art, design, and worldbuilding. If I praised them to the extent they deserve, \nthis review would be far too long. The unit and location models are detailed enough to convey all the information needed, but leave enough ambiguity to fire the imagination. The pop-up lore tabs in particular are a superb detail.\n\nIn conclusion, I'm frustrated that this isn't the game I fell in love with, but gladly concede that this is a deeply lovable game.",

A fantastic universe with a lot of believable variance and color.\n\nWhile on the surface it first seems easy and simple, more and more mechanics unlock during and even after the game (yes, a little microprogression via the Pantheon is also included), and you mix and match differently each time if you're curious. Here, contrary to other contenders, the mixing and matching works out, and does not too often feel unbalanced in either direction. \n\nI cannot make definite statements about the difficulty, as I'm not far enough into the game, and tend to play them on medium anyway.

Combat is fun and strategic with alot of control options and letting the AI battle it out so you don't have to spend the time commanding every battle is quite viable. You can really feel the step up from AoW3 and its truly worthy of being a sequel to that excellent game. more customization, more locations, more mechanics, more spells, more ways to grow, better diplomacy, more ways to win. \n\nits all quite top notch for the genre and if you loved AoW3, there is no doubt you will love this just as much and probably more. it feels fresh yet familiar. the same game you know and love but polished and improved in almost every way.\n\nThat being said, all is not perfect and this part is a bit subjective. The DLC stuff is also more more more vs AoW3. some of this stuff should have been free. I feel like paradox is taking a page out of the sims for their DLC content strategy. it asks alot out of the player's wallet if they want to keep up with the latest stuff.\n\nIf the DLC is worth it to you, fine by all means that's your business but I don't recommend it honestly. the base game is more than enough for a great time. maybe do some research and buy a couple of factions that really appeal to you if needed. this strategy is not unique to AoW, its quite par for the course in 4x so most fans of the genre should be heading in with eyes wide open.",

I personally enjoy story campaigns the most, and I still had fun here despite the lack of cutscenes or voice acting.\n- compared to other paradox games the DLC pricing policy is much more friendly. \n\nA note on the learning curve:\nThe learning curve is relatively steep. Compared to other Paradox games, the game does offer plenty of in-game guidance, but it still takes some time to understand the interactions between systems and how to maintain the right in-game tempo (when to build what, and how to achieve specific goals efficiently).",

      "review": "I am honestly having so much fun with this game. Recently, I haven't had much luck in games all around due to lack of quality or perhaps in part because I haven't found a genre I've liked as much as whatever AoW4 is, but I can say for certain that this game is hella fun to play. I love customizing and creating new factions to use during play throughs. The only qualm I have with the game is not being able to have a custom \"Sandbox mode\" where I can pick and choose what people I face up against in terms of societies. Now, I haven't played the entirety of this game and I've still got much to find out, as this may already even be a feature. But even if it isn't, I still say this game is a top notch game. \r\n\r\nNow on a logical point of view, this is how I see the game:\r\n\r\nGameplay- I SOOOOO wanted to put this game at \"Very good\", but I can't in good faith. As much as I think this game's gameplay is a 10/10 in terms of actual playability, the game breaking bugs- such as softlocking at the \"waiting for opponents\" phase really drives me up a wall (If you're stuck at this and looking for a solution, be sure to quick save, and then click the exit game button on the escape key menu. Then alt f4 once it turns black after waiting a few seconds and click \"Resume\" once loading the game back up). It is because of this stupidly annoying bug that I have to knock this gameplay rating down :( ...\r\n☐ Very good\r\n☑ Good\r\n☐ Nothing special\r\n☐ Okay\r\n☐ Bad\r\n\r\nGraphics- This game's graphics are actually beautiful in my opinion. But, I have to reduce it to \"good\" considering the glitchy armor piece graphics when creating unique heroes / rulers. \r\n☐ Masterpiece\r\n☐ Beautiful\r\n☑ Good\r\n☐ Will do\r\n☐ Bad\r\n☐ Awful\r\n\r\nAudio\r\n☑ Amazing\r\n☐ Very good\r\n☐ Good\r\n☐ Decent\r\n☐ Not too bad\r\n☐ Bad\r\n\r\nAudience- Not good for kids due to some language and depictions of violence and bloodshed. \r\n☐ Kids\r\n☑ Teens\r\n☑ Adults\r\n☐ Everyone\r\n\r\nStory- Now I specifically say not great because it may have bad lore adaptations, but rather because it seems that the idea of a \"story\" in its traditional sense doesn't seem to apply here relatively well. As the story is typically what you create for each and every new realm. But likewise, since you do create the story for each realm as you play them, I can't exactly say its a \"none\" either.  \r\n☐ Lovely\r\n☐ Good\r\n☐ Average\r\n☑ Not great\r\n☐ None\r\n\r\nDifficult- Once going through the entire tutorial and playing this game for hours, you start to pick up on the game. I wouldn't say its perfect, but for 4th game in the series, I expect games like these to not be so beginner friendly. However, though the time it takes to learn the game is long, it's more than worth it. I'm still getting the \"mastery\" part down though haha. \r\n☐ Just press a bunch of buttons\r\n☐ Easy\r\n☐ Significant brain usage\r\n☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master\r\n☐ Not so easy\r\n☐ Difficult\r\n☐ Dark Souls\r\n\r\nGrind- Not necessary to play the game, but is necessary for \"Pantheon rewards\" (cosmetic and slight game altering items, but not drastically).\r\n☐ Nothing\r\n☐ Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks\r\n☑ Isn't necessary to progress\r\n☐ A bit grindy sometimes\r\n☐ Average grind level\r\n☐ Too much grind\r\n☐ Insanity\r\n\r\nGame Time- While the game time depends on you, it will almost certainly be almost always over 30 minutes long. I'm currently on a run that I've spent days playing. \r\n☐ Short\r\n☐ Average\r\n☐ Long\r\n☑ Depends on you\r\n☐ Endless\r\n\r\nPrice- So I have a big reason for the 3 check marks here. DLCs.... While the base game is DEFINITELY worth the price- and maybe I'd even say \"just buy it\" if there was slightly more base game content, but honestly, dlcs take the cake here. Yes the base game is great and is worth the price. But if you really want to have fun with a significantly larger number of features, consider waiting for the sale of DLCs or when you have the money to spend $80+ for this game. \r\n☐ Just buy it\r\n☑ Worth the price\r\n☑ Wait for sale\r\n☑ Maybe if you have some spare money left\r\n☐ Not recommended",

My only gripe is that the saves get filled up pretty quickly and you have to manually delete older saves:; surely this could be automated?\r\nI do get a bit fed up with the complaints from people about paying for DLC.

As someone that loves all the prior AOW games, it took me a while to get this one broken in.  I would have rated it 1 out of 10 stars had you asked me then.... Thankfully I did give it a \"third chance\" as it is turns out the game is well built and well worth the asking price.  The biggest issues I had (as many others reported) are random in game crashes. My hardware is on the older side (especially my GPU) so the issues I have could be more related to my setup and not the game itself. Not only did the game run sluggishly for me, the in game crashes made it impossible to play even after fixes and updates were rolled out. Here are a few things I would recommend people to do to prevent such crashes if you happen to be running older hardware or have tried everything else and still have issues.\r\n\r\n1) If you run multiple displays scale down to just one when playing the game (Trust Me on this)\r\n2) Run the game at 1080p (you have to set your display to 1080p in windows prior to playing)\r\n\r\nThat's it, nothing more nothing less... Makes 99% of the in game crashes go away as well as the lag. Windows 11 also detected that I was turning my main screen resolution to 1080p while also turning off my second display and created a profile for me, so now I only need to select a single display and it automatically changes my resolution from 4k to 1080p (not sure how windows did this (Co Pilot maybe?) but I am thankful as it limits me to one step!\r\n\r\nOnce you get the game running smoothly you will find it extremely addictive and very enjoyable.\r\n\r\nFeedback for the Devs: \r\n\r\n1) Bring back the pre launch tab game settings like you had with AOW3 and allow users to set a desired in game resolution.\r\n\r\n2) Bring back the classic campaign setup in which your Heroes and Items follow you through to the end of the game. Even if you have to change it up a bit like a trigger for previous items to be slowly delivered and/or purchased with-in the armory or maybe a selection option for only a few items that user are prompted to pick prior to starting the next map. I understand the need to keep the game balanced but one of the best things AOW3 had to offer was continuity with Heroes and Items in the campaign mode.",

The single player experience in this game is amazing and if you're just here for the single player stop reading here, because I'mma about to cry hard about PvP.\n\nI would give this game a thumbs up if it wasn't for the game balance and constant technical issues. Let's start with the game balance being constantly messed with to appease a very small user base of PvPers. Because of this group of people, Giants have been nerfed to the point they feel more like flavored Champions with some extra abilities, that also suck. Dragons will never get better or become stronger because of them because every time a buff is suggested it would “just be too good” and thus dragons since launch have and will always remain the worst pick.\n\nIf you like Vampires now (as of writing they just came out) then you might not in the future. I understand game balance is important but if you design game systems so terribly that they get abused to the point that you must nerf X thing because of extremely specific situation Y you end up with players, both PvP and PvE alike paying the price when the whole system gets slammed into the dirt.\n\nThe last thing I would like to talk about is the online experience; it's just horrible and has been since launch. If you play this game regularly with friends then OUT OF SYNC are words that haunt your every waking moment while playing. Crashes, sync issues, cannot connect, it just goes on and on and on like this. Have a friend who is on the other side of the world? Good luck playing with them at all, that's right this is a online [b]TURN BASED[/b] game that struggles to sync up properly in year of our gamer 20XX which  is just unreal. This type of game should be an easy slam dunk for playing with friends from far away.\n\nThe user base of this game, for some reason, is willing to absolutely take it and I have no idea why other than no one else has come along to dethrone them.",

Currently, I am plagued by a bug that simply interrupts all battles when anyone tries to shoot a bow, so I am perpetually stuck on an AI turn. \r\n\r\nIn general, AoW4 is like its predecessors, but this time there are no more different factions: All factions are basically identical, one can spend points (much like in most RPG systems) to craft one's own faction. Otherwise, each faction goes about the map in generic 4X style and tries to win by defeating the other rulers, having the most territory, or the most magic. \r\n\r\nPROS: \r\n- Fun faction building mechanic. \r\n- CItybuilding is mostly generic, but with just enough individuation that not every city looks identical to all others, with some exceptions\r\n\r\nCONS:\r\n- The AI is stupendously lacking -- even the easiest setting requires giving the AI additional resources to play. \r\n- The UI is a disaster. You'd have imagined they'd have learned a bit from making this franchise for decades, but the UI is mostly unchanged for the same amount of time and it is head-shakingly inadequate. \r\n- Paradox publishing pricing scheme, which gives you a standard game for about 50 Euros and then a dozen DLC, each of which cost between 15 and 25 Euros. \r\n\r\nThe rest is par for the course for most 4X games (graphics, sound, other mechanics). \r\n\r\nAll of this would make for a decent game if you could only play the damn thing without these horrid bugs.",

I’ve tried to give this game every chance on two different platforms – a PS5 and a brand-new high-end PC (i9-14900K, RTX 4090, Windows 11) – and on both systems the experience has been the same: constant crashes, broken sessions, and a game that simply refuses to be stable.\n\nOn PC I’ve done everything you’d expect and then some: clean NVIDIA driver installs, Windows tweaks, config edits, file verification, fresh installs, turning off overlays, lowering settings, you name it. It still crashes randomly – in combat, on end turn, loading saves – with no consistency except that it will crash. It’s the only game in my library that behaves like this, which tells me the problem isn’t my hardware.\n\nSo I tried it on PS5 thinking maybe the console version would be the “just works” experience. Nope. Different platform, same story: crashes and instability. When a game is this flaky on both a closed console environment and a top-tier PC, that’s not “user error,” that’s a fundamental problem with the game.\n\nWhat makes it worse is watching the developers pump out paid DLC and expansions while the base game still feels half-baked. Instead of prioritizing stability, bug fixing, and performance, it feels like all the focus is on selling the next pack. New content means nothing when the core game can’t reliably run long enough to enjoy it. At this point, it honestly feels like they’re building add-ons on top of a broken foundation.\n\nI wanted to love Age of Wonders 4. The concept and series are right up my alley. But after fighting with it on both PS5 and a monster PC, I’m just done. Stop adding new stuff and fix your game.

I am sure many people will find hundreds of hours of entertainment.  \n\nHowever for me, the game seems to focus too much on quantity and too little on quality. It is very wide but very shallow. And there are very few meaningful improvements over Age of Wonders 3. \n\nThere are a massive amounts of tomes, cultures, lord types, units, spells etc and they keep adding more and more via DLCs. However it all amounts of more of the same in new cosmetic packages. Slight variations of the same formula.\n\nInstead they should have focused on deeper mechanics, such as - \n\n[list]\n[*] Designing your own units mixing and matching cultures, weapons, equipment, technology etc progressively available to your faction. You'd have to observe the challenges you face in a realm, then strategize and refit your armies accordingly.\n[*] Heroes should have been designed like actual characters - unique individuals with agency, personalities, voice overs who take part in stories, and in activities beyond just leading armies - be diplomats, spies etc. Instead a hero, even your lord, is basically just another unit, just customizable. It is so lazy and silly that characters do not even have a voice beyond grunting like mutes.\n[*] There could have been a court system and in-faction politics based on inter-relation of heroes.\n[*] There could have been non-standard scenarios - such as playing as the ruler of a collapsing empire, or a vassal trying to break free from a cruel overlord, or rebuilding civilization in a post-apocalyptic tale. Perhaps there are some added via DLCs. I would not know.\n[*] Most of the above really build into one central flaw - lack of story and characters. Whether it is Lord of the Rings, or Dungeons and Dragons, or Game of Thrones - our love of fantasy is deeply rooted in story and characters. The game is utterly lacking in that regard. Without that - all the busywork in the campaigns feel meaningless. If you have played Disciples 2, you would know that story / characters and sandbox in a 4X game are not mutually exclusive.\n[*] Pantheon points is an abominable idea, locking lots of content behind massive amount of grind, punishing people who do not have that much free time to play videogames. It is emblematic of the ugly design approach of this game,\n[/list]\n\nIf you are a fan of Civilization and would like something very similar in the fantasy genre - this is perfect for you. However if you have spend a lot of time playing  previous games in the series, and other games like Total War (especially the Warhammer series), or turn based RPGs like Baldur's Gate series, or Pillars of Eternity or Pathfinder : Wrath of the Righeous etc - you will be disappointed.",

      "review": "Built on a solid formula, but just not that interesting to play. The initial impression of massive diversity in options collapses pretty quickly as you get used to each subcomponent of that diversity: there are 6 different civ types (Feudal, High, Dark, Mystic, Barbarian, Industrial). Each has its own unit roster. Mash that together with one of about 10 races (which just give 3 bonuses each and look different), a choice of spellbook, and a starting hero, and you have a theoretically huge amount of options - but actually you get used to each subcomponent pretty quickly and the factions feel samey as a result. Is there a huge difference between playing an Elf Barbarian versus an Orc Barbarian? One has more ranged damage and the other has more melee damage, but that's about it. Does it massively change your game to pick the lightning book instead of the fire book? Nope, your combat animations look different but you're still swapping some physical damage for elemental damage with an occasional bonus status effect.\n\nIn each playthrough, I found myself not thinking about how this game would unfold, but how I'd try it next time with a different race and different settings, because I was already getting bored of the one I was running. Oh, and there was this game-breaking glitch in combat that every time one of my support heroes attacked, it would inflate to fill the whole screen with seizure-inducing flashes and then lock out the turn for about 5 minutes... The champion himself had an animation glitch where he/she/it would raise his weapon, wait for several seconds, and then strike. Then do it again for however many strikes were left. So instead of a quick click-damage attack, each hero attack would take like 20 seconds.\n\nAll this amounts almost to 'buy it, try it, and see', except then you have Paradox's DLC addiction to contend with. Either you A) pay hundreds of pounds/dollars/pesetas to pick up every DLC, B) buy some kind of subscription pass so that you don't even own the thing you're paying for, or C) run an undercooked version of the game that's missing half the content and has 'buy this DLC now to play the real game' stickered all over it.

Honestly guys take a look at some other franchises, they will discount most of their previous DLCs into a nice catchup bundle with each new content release and make it affordable for new players to dip in.",

Attack an army? CTD. Enemy casting a spell? CTD. Select your town? CTD. I can't play 20 minutes without a crash. Worst is, most of those are caused by something in your army, city or enemy army so load and retry will CTD again, so I lost count of the times I decided to avoid fight an army and hope an AI player destroys it, or have to relly on auto-battle because manual battle map crashes.\n\nJust too unstable and seems to be abandoned at this point.

The developer logo is just sitting there for 5+ minutes while you're wondering if you've crashed.\n\nOnce you're in, the solo \"campaign/story mode\" feels like you're constantly starting each level from scratch (with lvl 1 heroes, and very little research/stats carrying forward even if you use a pantheon ruler) while your enemies get more and more overpowered. \n\nIn the later levels of the story mode it seems like certain enemy faction heroes are always 5-10 levels over you constantly, even when you select \"Easy Mode\" and push forward your armies as fast as you possibly can while your heroes move at the speed of a glacier on most terrains). \n\nThe pantheon points feel worthless at the end of the day. While the idea of being able to make your own race/faction that can specialize in different tomes or attributes seems like it should have been great for tactics against certain maps or enemies, it felt ineffectual in practice.\n\nI got tired of my units always seeming to do minor damage while the enemy was able to either kill them on the first turn, with high damage attacks or multi-unit attacks right at the start of a game (while I had to spend endless turns researching, finding better items, and leveling my heroes to get anything similar). When you find yourself simply trying to get massive army numbers to succeed on \"auto-battling\" instead of actually playing out the battles, I think that shows something is broken.

Staying connected in game has been an issue since day one, but not only that we like to ally together to do a little comp stomp, but the game on the easiest settings are difficult for the both of us.  Neither of us is inexperienced at RTS games but this game punishes the player left and right. If you plan on playing the game alone there seems to be no issue playing and can almost always squeek out a victory.\r\n\r\nModding certainly helps us with the difficulty but playing with mods is always an issue with this game in Multiplayer.  Honestly this game with all it's issues is not worth buying if you want to play with friends.  If you plan to solo the game it's not bad, its got a lot of cool innovative features and lots of replayability.\r\n\r\nIt also seems they have no interest in fixing the issues, just grabbing your hard earned $$$.",

Character and faction creation is nice but its not enough to balance out the dull slow game play and constant desyncing. I really wanted to like it and it has some potential but i'm not that invested in the experience that was delivered. I don't think its worth the ticket price unless its on a steep sale",

I COULD spend hours looking up wiki articles to see how to get the cool and fun stuff. I COULD spend 100 hours playing until I get to see all the tomes. Or the game could, you know, just show me the good shit so I can get excited about it and choose a path to work towards it right away.\n\nThen there's the combat. In isolation it's fine and fun. However, you're just asked to do way too much of it against too many trash mobs. And auto combat is liable to get one of your units you were trying to rank up killed so congrats, you get to go in and spend 5 minutes manually fighting your hundredth boring trash mob battle of the game. And then when you get to the grand late game battles that you've been preparing for, the unit count is so high that it's just tedious to actually control.\n\nAnd when the overscoped battles lose your interest, there's nothing that can fill the void. The city building is too shallow to make economic planning interesting. Strategic resources are more of a nice bonus than a hard requirement so you don't need to maneuver for them or deny them from your enemies. And you just kind of have to use the units the circumstances of the game leave you with and then rank them up, again unless you're looking up wiki articles or playing 100 hours to get to the starting line of fun. The overworld quests are shallow and generic. The wonders have mildly interesting vignettes with decent scripted encounters, but that's less than 1% of what you do and you're almost never going to be an appropriate level for the encounter to be a fun challenge.\n\nThe Paradox curse of taking a break and realizing you haven't had fun for the last 10 hours continues.",

Also the need to stop strategic map actions, when someone is having battle is making multiplayer very slow.\n\nThis worked fine in Steam deck for example, but last time I tried it was impossible to get game working as you can't login to the paradox account as it has issues with steam deck keyboard.
