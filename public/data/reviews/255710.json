      "review": "Cities: Skylines – The True Successor to SimCity\r\n\r\nCities: Skylines stands tall as the spiritual successor to the classic SimCity franchise, carrying forward everything that made city-building games special while expanding the genre in amazing ways. From the moment you start laying down roads and zoning districts, it becomes clear just how much depth and freedom the game offers. The city-planning tools are intuitive yet powerful, letting you craft everything from cozy suburbs to sprawling megacities with incredible precision.\r\n\r\nWhat really sets Cities: Skylines apart is the sheer level of detail. Traffic flow, public services, terrain, pollution, budgeting—every system connects and reacts in a way that feels rewarding and believable. It’s the kind of game where you plan one small change and end up happily sinking hours into improving your city's overall design.\r\n\r\nThe only drawback is the downloadable content. There’s a lot of it, and while much of it adds meaningful features or new layers of complexity, the total cost can add up quickly. Still, the base game alone is packed with content, and players who dive into DLC will find even more ways to shape their perfect metropolis.\r\n\r\nOverall, Cities: Skylines is a fantastic city-builder that fully captures the spirit of SimCity while evolving the formula into something deeper, richer, and endlessly engaging. A must-play for fans of the genre.",

This city builder, though only ten years old, is a timeless classic that absolutely obliterates the standard set by SimCity. This fun and addictive game will define the genre for decades to come. It is extremely satisfying when a problem in your city has just been resolved, whether it be traffic jams, lack of services, or budget issues. Extensive modding support gives the game endless possibilities. The only thing I could possibly have to say is that simulating the lives of 300,000 little AI humans (only a problem in large cities) takes a lot of power. I understand that it is impossible to reduce the power used, but maybe the recommendation of 16GB RAM for Windows, 8 GB RAM for MacOS, and 8GB RAM for Steam Deck/Linux is a little bit misleading. Also, make sure you have NVIDIA® GeForce™ RTX 30 series at least; you will be missing out on extremely detailed graphics otherwise. There are literally no other flaws to this extremely satisfying, award winning game, and I highly recommend this game to any fan of the city building genre",

It's therefore quite hard to write a review playing the vanilla or base game only when there is such a multitude of DLC that has been released in the intervening years (there is also a sequel, released in 2023).\n\nWith that in mind, I can say I did enjoy my playthrough - I built a single city (and a small second version as it's necessary to unlock all the buildings) and obtained all the achievements possible in vanilla bar one (I just didn't have the energy to rebuild everything to get Happy Town). I don't intend to play further, but there's certainly scope to sink a lot of hours into this if you have the will and patience to master all the systems, get your head around traffic flow and invest a lot of money into the add-ons.\n\nI personally think the best part of 30EUR for a game that is 10 years old is a bit steep - this is balanced by the strength of the modding community. The base systems are relatively simple to understand but the simplicity is also a source of some of the flaws - for example, I found watching buildings disappear and rebuild 'instantly' when you make a policy change really jarring and unrealistic.\n\nIt's a thumbs up if you want a long-term partnership, but this is not the partner for a short-term fling.",

I was holding off posting the review until i saw what paradox done with CS2 after a few years and this may age poorly (i dought it) but CS1 is the better game. 10 years of post launch support has given the game a lot of content most of it good some bad, if your buying for first time watch some yt videos on what dlc to get, you do not need to buy most of it to have a good chunk of content to get through. \n\nPlaying with mods is ESSENTIAL, unfortunately like a lot of paradox games the community has done a lot of the work needed to get the game optimised and add content. FPS boosters, move it, node controller, anarchy, graphical overhauls etc are must haves to build a good looking city that can run decently on a range of hardware. assets give endless buildings, roads, props, vehicles, landmarks whatever you can think of someone has probably made it, however this is highly system dependent once you get into the 500+ asset range loading times can get long and fps get seriously choppy when you place a significant number of them, this is when a good rig is needed.  \n\nOverall well worth the price, this is the game which made me switch from x-box (where i had 1,000+ hours on) to PC so i couldn't recommend enough. If your into this genre then its a must have and honestly this game has no competition in terms of immersion and content.",

My advice is to look up on google what the solution is, because most likely you will be experimenting for hours before comes up with nothing.\r\n\r\nalso, like the sims, this base game is a DLC farming. you will ran out of stuff to do in the base game in about 30 hours, and only the dlc keeps it going fresh.",

      "review": "Cities: Skylines is a city-building simulation developed by Colossal Order and published by Paradox Interactive.\n\nThe gameplay focuses on designing and managing a modern city from the ground up. Players control zoning, road layouts, public services, taxation, and infrastructure while maintaining citizen happiness and economic stability. The systems interlock—traffic flow, pollution, and resource management must all balance for sustainable growth.\n\nThe simulation depth is strong. Every citizen follows daily routines, traffic operates on a real pathfinding system, and city services respond dynamically to demand. Success requires efficiency and foresight rather than micromanagement.\n\nVisually, the game presents a clean, realistic cityscape with adjustable camera angles and day–night cycles. Buildings, vehicles, and landscapes are detailed enough for immersion while keeping performance stable across large city maps.\n\nSound design supports the relaxed tone. Ambient city noise, passing traffic, and background music blend smoothly, creating a calm management rhythm. Audio feedback from in-game events keeps the player aware of city conditions.\n\nModding support is one of its key strengths. The Steam Workshop integration allows players to add new assets, systems, and mechanics, turning Cities: Skylines into a nearly endless sandbox. Expansions and community mods have added seasons, transportation networks, and natural disasters.\n\nOverall, Cities: Skylines stands as the most flexible and polished modern city builder. It rewards careful planning, creativity, and problem-solving while offering immense customization. It effectively replaced SimCity as the benchmark for the genre.",

Thank's to it's sandbox nature, it's one of those games you can play for your entire life and never get bored.

Just go to Youtube and take a look at what crazy stuff people like to build. \r\n\r\nOne of my complaints is that, as a modder and asset creator, the shader the game uses is kinda crappy (visually speaking).

I never really enjoyed it until I saw you could get lots of assets, like businesses, parks, etc. But I have all this time invested in the game, and now I potentially could lose all my progress forever because of Colossal Orders stupidity and greed. While I would otherwise give the game a 10/10 (and without the VOLUNTEER work of the modding community, a 6/10), the developers have no respect for the fanbase and the modders, who fix what IS wrong in the game, and what SHOULD be part of the base game in the first place.
