I'm sure everyone has made the 'Animal Crossing' references to death, but it's definitely a good starting point to give an idea of what the game is structured like. \n\nI always had a passive interest in the Sanrio characters, which became more active when a friend taught me the lore. I think we often see these characters butchered in memes, but the lore is so cute, the characters are so sweet, and it's just such a FEEL GOOD game. It's about a bunch of friends, and they all love each other, and Pompompurin is FIVE BIG PUDDINGS tall. Like, what?! That's adorable!!! \n\nI enjoy signing in daily for bonuses and doing quests at a leisurely pace. A little bit of game time goes a long way! It's just a very positive game to play and super fun!",

I never expected to buy a Hello Kitty game, but I was completely won over.\nIt takes much of the Animal Crossing formula (with a bit less focus on farming), and expands it with some additional gameplay variety, including story and character quests, light puzzle elements, and exploration, on a much bigger, varied, open world map, where you can climb, dive to explore aquatic locations, or even visit... the moon.\nThere's a ton of stuff to do, be it quests, or a constant stream of seasonal events, and the game keeps expanding through updates, and the occasional DLC expansion.\nIf anyone is in the mood for a relaxing, cheerful game, that you can play at your own pace, the kind you can fire up a bit each day to do a quest or two, explore a bit, or just unlock a few more items, this one is a very solid option.",

You can grow friendships with daily gifts and by completing their requests. \nBeen playing for 15 days and already pretty close to being best friends with all characters, gotten 31 out of 53 (mostly challenges and quesline ones left) so its definately not grindy in any way. \nSaw some people also complain about resources - had no problem lacking resources for anything. Probably comes down to if you actually run from place to place you pick up stuff along the way anyway (even with fast travel).\nOnly complaint is a few minor bugs where characters bug out when you get too close while gifting or talking with them (turns around so im talking with their backs or run around me)\nOtherwise i reccommend the game to anyone who loves relaxing and cozy gameplay :)",

      "review": "I picked up Hello Kitty Island Adventure hoping it would be Animal Crossing for PC. It’s not, but it’s still fun. There’s no question that it has some similarities to Animal Crossing, but it just falls short in a number of ways. Most aspects just feel like they’re missing a little something when compared against Animal Crossing. That’s not at all to say it’s a bad game. I still very much enjoy playing it on my Steam Deck.\n\nLike Animal Crossing, you’re pretty free to go at your own pace, fishing, bug hunting, decorating, and chatting with villagers, although none of these aspects feel as polished or satisfying as Animal Crossing. However, this game is much more story and quest heavy than Animal Crossing. I wouldn’t call the quests amazing by any means, but they are engaging enough that I would say I spend most of my time doing the quests. The map is also a lot larger and more varied than Animal Crossing, which is cool, but it doesn’t seem to change at all as seasons pass, which feels like a downgrade. The game does use the real life date for certain things, as Animal Crossing did, but the in game time is not tied to real time. I do miss having the in game world mirror reality, but there is something to be said for not having to wait until a certain real life time for in game events. While you cannot decorate the island at all, there are dozens of cabins that you can unlock and decorate to attract additional villagers. It’s a neat mechanic, but it does bring me into one of my biggest issues with the game.\n\nOne of the biggest issues I have with the game is a lack of currency. Everything is traded. For example, you might go to the store and see a furniture piece needs 10 seashells and 5 pumpkins to trade for it. I much prefer just having 1 universal currency and allowing me to buy and sell as I wish. This makes it sort of annoying to collect clothing and furniture. There’s not a shortage of materials around to collect, I just find it annoying that I can’t just know that I have money and go spending. It also makes fishing and bug hunting feel sort of useless since they can’t be sold and they are less fun to do than in Animal Crossing. Fish can be traded in for a specific furniture set and there is a bug museum, but its sort of annoying to donate to.\n\nThe game also has a large focus on gift giving. Ever real life day you can give 3 gifts to each villager to raise their friendship level. It does feel a little repetitive and grindy at times, but it is pretty easy to level up friendship, so I can’t complain too much. Also I did enjoy trying different recipes at the various cooking stations to see what I could make and who would like it. I do think some of the invalid combinations felt like they really should have made something unique, but you never waste materials as you always at least get a generic item.\n\nIn terms of performance, the game runs pretty well. I think I just left the default settings on and I get a mostly stable 60FPS on my Steam Deck. Many areas can hold the full 90, but there were enough dips that I just set it to 60. Even at 60 there are dips, but much fewer.\n\nOverall, if you want Animal Crossing for PC, that is not what this is, but if you want a nice cosy game that runs well on Steam Deck, this is a solid purchase. I’m a little over 21 hours in and while I got the achievement for unlocking all the areas, I still feel like playing more and still have quests in my quest log.",

I will say after 11 months of playing this game, logging in for the daily rewards, unlocking most of what I can do and once aimed for perfection, it was a lovely game and I am just a bit burnt out by it.\n\nThe game follows the year with events and holidays, it always feels like there is an or two going on at once, new holiday furniture and clothings, island visitors can rotate which seasons they come around to visit, it feels like there is a lot in this game to explore. The daily quests help made it feel like there is meaning to each day, the dialog from the residents and visitors do get a bit repetitive though.\n\nThe amount of gudetama you can be searching for in each region of the map is really fun and had me going crazy looking for them.\nThe puzzle rooms around the map were also fun to do - albeit most of them felt rather easy\nOnce you crack the gifting guide, leveling up the residents went pretty quickly (EXCEPT YOU WISH ME MELL SCREW YOU)\nThe friend system is pretty fun, although I do think the beads are a little questionable - I haven't used them in literal months - and you can play this game solo as well.\n\nI am very fond of this game, and it holds a very special part in my heart spending as much time as I have in this game throughout the year. It has been with me as a lot has happened in my life, and I've managed to convince a couple of my friends to play with me a bit as well. \n\nIt's a very relaxing game, and very enjoyable to me.

Like, please, I don't want to log in daily to go find items for crafting.\r\n-I really do hate the \"wait until tomorrow\" quests locks.\r\n-Visitors that only appear once a year are super annoying.

      "review": "This game is absolutely 100% worth it if you want to spend the rest of your life dedicated to it. Half-joking... but it really is insane how much content there is. The price point is a little iffy, but compared to Apple Arcade, idk, I'd rather pay for it upfront I think.\r\n\r\nI've played this game (almost) every day since I got it in February. The one thing I'd recommend is don't think you'll be spending hours each day playing it; it's not a regular game like that. It is a game meant to be played for a little bit each day as you slowly work towards your goals overtime. That said, the beginning of the game offers a ton of content and I did find myself spending a few hours on it each day before I'd be done with all my tasks for the day. These last few months I've been spending around 5-10 minutes a day, just doing little daily things like watering flowers and doing visitor quests.\r\n\r\nThis game is definitely perfect for perfectionists. You can play it casually, sure, but there is just so much to collect and so many achievements to get...\r\n\r\nI'm amazed at how \"natural\" some of the quests feel. I don't know how all the friendship quests get unlocked, but I'll just open the game for the day and get a new quest randomly, seemingly out of nowhere. I really appreciate these little quests honestly, as they make the world feel much more alive.\r\n\r\nThis game is definitely brutal though with its events and other time-based things. If you stop playing for a couple weeks and miss an event, well now you have to wait a full year to get the items from that event. There are technically ways around this, though, but they mostly involve playing with other people enough times to unlock the ability to have someone else give you the event items, and that takes a shocking amount of time and also not everyone wants to do multiplayer, I'm sure.\r\n\r\nRegardless, this game is awesome, I've had so much fun with it, and also this is my first introduction to anything Sanrio-related. I had no idea who any of these characters were before this (except Hello Kitty ofc) and that is definitely fine. It's not a requirement to understand anyone, they will give you a brief introduction, and at this point it feels like I'm very familiar with everyone involved. This game is NOT childish, and frankly not even for children lol. I've been doing literal research for this game like how to crossbreed flowers and I've kept several notepads for collections I've been working towards. I love the feel of the game and it also gets updates fairly regularly!\r\n\r\nAlso as a side note, the DLC is also worth it, I'd say. It's expensive, sure, but it was a good amount of content, plus a new character and a new world, that both stick around forever. I still only have about half of the items in the DLC, but as for the actual story of it, it took at least 30 hours, and I enjoy all the new stuff that was added. It's very much like the rest of the game and felt very connected!\r\n\r\nOverall 10/10 would wait a year to unlock a baby named after a beverage again.",

      "review": "Has a similar vibe to Animal Crossing but plays very different. You kind of know what you're getting into: It's going to be a family friendly, safe, cozy game. It's not especially deep, but it's also not that shallow to the point only a child could enjoy it. It hits that happy middle ground of being just engaging enough\n\nThe first thing to get over is the games 'time'. There's in-game time and real world time. In-game time has day-night cycles over 4 periods (morning, day, evening, night) that all last 60 minutes. Creatures around the island will appear/disappear at certain periods. Real world time happens every 24 hours based on the location of Sunblink (the devs) studio. Every 24 hours a new 'day' starts. Island resources are finite and reset at the start of each real world day, and seasonal events are also tied to this\n\nThere's an overall 'plot' that keeps things progressing. It's not interesting in the slightest, but it's there. I found the dialogue enjoyable enough that I wasn't skipping it. You'll also get prompted for dialogue responses every now and then, however the response you pick doesn't matter. It's a little lame though it does make sense. The devs also make references to memes and movies in a subtle enough way that it got a smile out of me. I was not expecting an American Psycho reference when it popped up\n\nThe game has 13 main Friends that you start off with, with 6 additional ones unlocked later as you progress. The characters have defined personalities, hobbies, and interests. It makes them stand out against each other and you can find a favourite (mines Big Challenges). That said, they can at times feel like different shades of the same personality\n\nGeneral gameplay is what you might expect. It's talking to characters, collecting materials, crafting things, decorating etc. There's daily and weekly quests to give you a reason to log in every day. There's also seasonal events constantly happening. It's all pretty fun for the most part\n\nMy only major gripe with the game is that while the controls are fine overall, there are times where it can be a little clunky. For example there are Primary and Secondary seasonal Events that occur. Events have booths that you can purchase their seasonal items from located a few steps from each other. On Steamdeck, the interact button is X for one of these booths, and A for the other. Small things like this lead to moments where you'll press a button expecting one thing to happen and something (or nothing) else will. Small things like this can get annoying\n\nSometimes a game doesn't need to be revolutionary. It doesn't need to break the mold or redefine a genre. Sometimes it just needs to be enjoyable. This game is enjoyable, and that's all it needs to be",

I've also been shocked throughout with the amount of movie references there are, which has been very entertaining for me. Without spoiling them too much I'll list a few; Snakes on a Plane, Shrek, and my personal favorite; Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\r\n\r\nA lot of people have mentioned it's similar to Animal Crossing, but I'd say it's closer to Disney Dreamlight Valley. That said, I'm really hoping it doesn't lean towards so many expensive DLCs like DDV did.\r\n\r\nOne of the only downsides is that when you start playing you can essentially play however long you want and not run out of things to do, but similar to DDV eventually it'll get to the point where you can only do so much per day. Give 3 gifts to each character, collect x amount of materials etc. Quite a few of the quests require you to wait a day as well, which is good for a short session, not so good if you want to play longer like Animal Crossing for example. You *are* given items for logging in, including ones that let you reset gifts etc. but it only helps the slight grindy feel a little.\r\n\r\nWhile the limit on things initially bothered me, now it's more of a thing if I'm in the mood I'll log in to play for a little bit and then log off. Overall, 11/10 I'd recommend this any day over DDV or WoW.",

      "review": "Generally recommend if you like Sanrio, low stakes content, and small challenges overall. It's a good pick up and enjoy for a little type of game, as they do actively have new content added here and there. There's lots of characters to add to your areas and enough seasonal/events to keep things a little more fresh. The flower breeding system feels a lot like the RNG of animal crossing and I don't like that but others may.\n\nThe poorest sides of the game depend on your own playstyle and expectations from this game. Daily tasks are not too varied. It wouldn't hold up playing consistently ever day unless there's a few event schedules around with special event drops/item exchanges. You will be spending your time collecting the same materials, crafting the same items or waiting to build the next furniture to attract new characters, and gifting a ton to build friendship. As others have mentioned new content is time-gated and will come back eventually but don't you dare miss a day if you are a completionist collector of limited-time event items. You will miss out on something just for skipping one or two days. The general audience mostly going to be super patient / cozy so if you like to constantly be moving towards goals fast, I wouldn't reccomend you pick this up or at the very least expect to feel differently about it after trying.",

      "review": "Genuinely I wish I could recommend this game, but I cannot.\n\nThe parts it does are genuinely really good. It has a decent crafting system, clothing is cute even if the models for clothes are very simple, decorating cabins is okay, and in general the game is cute.\n\nThe problem comes from the sheer amount of time gating in this game. Almost every single goal in this game is time gated beyond belief. I have played MMO's with constant FOMO events that respect your time more than this game does. I'll go bit by bit with the most important parts of the game that are time gated.\n\nResources are spawned every single day, up to three days of stacking. You eventually can become best friends with the main cast of characters and they'll pickup items for you, but at the start of the game you will be absolutely desperate for resources and will need to go manually collect them. There will be days where you will have to throw up your hands and be like \"welp, guess I'll just logon tomorrow to be able to craft two iron bars!\" \n\nFriendship leveling is next. You get levels by doing weekly/daily quests and gifting them items of one to three heart levels, with three hearts being best value. You will NEED to level the friendship of other characters because besides making them collect items, they have various abilities that'll make your time in the game better considerably and give you various resources needed to craft items. Later on you can even bring two friends with you, and certain combos can massively boost you. \nThe problem though is this is slow, you won't have friend abilities at usable levels or at all for a long while, and best friend status genuinely can take months. There are also certain characters who can take even longer due to their three heart items taking a long time to be able even available to craft. A certain funny bunny being a particular issue, if you know you know.\n\nQuests themselves often have time gates, forcing you to \"wait until tomorrow\" frequently. This wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't possible to run out of quests to do very often, leading to just multiple days of hopping on and then hopping off. You will eventually reach a state where you literally have no quests to do unless a random time gated friendship quest appears. Quest design in this game is insanely boring though, and eventually I started skipping dialogue. Even worse is that this is acknowledged ingame with your character's useless dialogue choices often having a choice of \"okay I guess I'm gathering sticks again\", which of course is completely ignored by the cast. There is literally one quest series where you just follow a character around for five minutes with minimal dialogue breaks.\n\nThere are constant rotating events, and they are shockingly strict with how much time you have to get enough event currency to obtain items or even just do daily rewards. In a few of the events, missing even one or two days can completely blow your chance of getting every event item. Also before a recent update, older event items had to be obtained via random chance at Tuxedosam and My Melody's shops. That has been fixed though, with event stands allowing you to just get older items easily now.\n\nFinally the bit I hate most, the visitor system. A ton of quests, functions, etc are hidden behind the visitor system. If you are aiming to get the one hidden achievement, you will be waiting a full year as you are stopped by seasonally locked visitors, event item locked visitors, and literal months long waits for a few of the visitors. Visitors come for a \"week\" long period when their rotation happens. Some visitors appear anytime though. It is not a week however for rotation based visitors, it is five days from Thursday to Monday. You can \"max out\" their chances of appearing, but honestly it doesn't feel like it. Other people have noticed, but since a certain update visitors seem to have lower chances to appear, so realistically you will see them max twice a week. If you have many visiting at once though their quest to get stars (max five before being allowed to permanently stay) might not even appear due to the dailies having a max quest limit. On top of this sometimes they just won't give quests at all. Visitors will not appear two days in a row, and only leaving if their quest is done to hopefully visit another time in the rotation.\nThis leads to intense frustration, as some visitors only visit once a real time month as noted before, and those visitors often have some of the meatier content behind them including unlocking other visitors.\n\nI understand the goal of this game is to not rush, but they have done everything in their power to make sure you don't have a choice. \"Time travel\" (setting your clock forward) breaks large chunks of the game, including events and multiplayer. If you want to experience the game in full, you are forced to endure the constant time gating.\n\nOnce I get my final achievement, I'll probably put down the game, as it lost its charm many hours ago and is just exhausting me now. This doesn't feel as fun anymore, it feels like a chores simulator with a Hello Kitty flavoring. \n\nIf you do decide to get it, wait for the base game to be 20 USD (or equivalent in your local currency) or lower, and don't be afraid to quit playing if it starts to burn you out. My silly self is in too deep now.",

      "review": "I’ve put so many hours into this game, and honestly, I love it — but I can’t recommend it unless you’re ready to care for your save file like it’s your child.\n\nPros - Super cute! It plays like the game I wished ACNH would have been. New items and content are added regularly. I haven’t hit an item limit yet which is a big deal for a chronic hoarder like me. Tons of charm and cozy atmosphere — easy to get attached. \n\nCons - Super hard to play and accomplish goals if you can't play everyday. A lot of it's appeal is regular in game events with limited time items. If you can't play daily to collect the event items it can be really frustrating to watch events end before you get to complete everything you want. Or timed quests that show up while you're on vacation and unable to play. I've also had the disappointment of events ending while I was out of town so I didn't get to finish trading in event items. \n\nEven for some not limited time quests, it can still be frustrating to be told to come back to the game in x number of days in order to complete. Running around collecting the daily spawns gets monotonous. \n\nA lot of these frustrations are the same for other games that are tied to real world clocks and I'll admit I'm generally not a fan of the genre. I had access to this game briefly on apple arcade and I think the game is way more playable in that format. Plus apple arcade players get access to everything way before the rest of us players.\n\nLastly, I hate the fishing mechanic. I know it's supposed to be a cozy, laid back game but you literally need to be ready to spend hours if you are trying to collect certain fish. Info from the wiki guide is the only way I made any progress on fishing goals. They recently added using bait to the fishing mechanic and I personally can't decide if it improved it or made it worse.",

Well... If you want to unlock more content you have to farm your way to level 11 by giving gifts to her or getting a daily quest with her involved.\n\nThe problem is: You can only give 3 gifts a day that give you little to no friendship xp, meaning that you have to wait for a couple of days (IRL DAYS) to pass to finally get through those couple of levels.\nAnd I know that 'friendship blossoms' exist that refresh your gift limit, but they're not that common from what I know...\nAnd basically every character has this thing so the whole game gets pretty boring after a short time.\n\nOh and additional thing: Why was Retsuko made like that?

      "review": "Look, I loved this game hence my playtime hours, but the way the devs handle this game has completely soured my whole experience of it.\r\n\r\nThis is a $40 ($60 if you buy deluxe) fully priced game that feels incomplete and feels the need to bank on FOMO and grind mechanics to artificially pad the game. I have 100+ hours at the time of writing this review but to be honest I've barely progressed the game because every story questline is \"wait for the next day\". Even then, the game feels incomplete and the content doesn't feel appropriately distributed. What do you mean Kuromi, My Melody, and Cinnamoroll get almost 10 outfits and characters like Retsuko, Pekkle, etc get only two or three? The outfits are just recolors of the same dress model, and you'd have to wait for each monthly events to even get them. Big map areas with nothing to do in them but collect materials. Some areas are a nightmare to traverse like the Lava Caves because the map doesn't make any sense.\r\n\r\nThat's not even my biggest issue so far. My biggest issue is how the devs silence any fair criticism towards this game. They only announce content updates through Discord, and not everyone has access to that. Not only that, but they will delete and ban anything they deem \"hostile\" or \"toxic\", fostering a toxic positivity environment where the devs can do no wrong. How many $15 DLC are you going to release before you are satisfied?\r\n\r\nIt's a fun game but I can't stomach such blatant disrespect to the playerbase. Play other games that respect your time and money instead.",

      "review": "Genuinely I wish I could recommend this game, but I cannot.\n\nThe parts it does are genuinely really good. It has a decent crafting system, clothing is cute even if the models for clothes are very simple, decorating cabins is okay, and in general the game is cute.\n\nThe problem comes from the sheer amount of time gating in this game. Almost every single goal in this game is time gated beyond belief. I have played MMO's with constant FOMO events that respect your time more than this game does. I'll go bit by bit with the most important parts of the game that are time gated.\n\nResources are spawned every single day, up to three days of stacking. You eventually can become best friends with the main cast of characters and they'll pickup items for you, but at the start of the game you will be absolutely desperate for resources and will need to go manually collect them. There will be days where you will have to throw up your hands and be like \"welp, guess I'll just logon tomorrow to be able to craft two iron bars!\" \n\nFriendship leveling is next. You get levels by doing weekly/daily quests and gifting them items of one to three heart levels, with three hearts being best value. You will NEED to level the friendship of other characters because besides making them collect items, they have various abilities that'll make your time in the game better considerably and give you various resources needed to craft items. Later on you can even bring two friends with you, and certain combos can massively boost you. \nThe problem though is this is slow, you won't have friend abilities at usable levels or at all for a long while, and best friend status genuinely can take months. There are also certain characters who can take even longer due to their three heart items taking a long time to be able even available to craft. A certain funny bunny being a particular issue, if you know you know.\n\nQuests themselves often have time gates, forcing you to \"wait until tomorrow\" frequently. This wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't possible to run out of quests to do very often, leading to just multiple days of hopping on and then hopping off. You will eventually reach a state where you literally have no quests to do unless a random time gated friendship quest appears. Quest design in this game is insanely boring though, and eventually I started skipping dialogue. Even worse is that this is acknowledged ingame with your character's useless dialogue choices often having a choice of \"okay I guess I'm gathering sticks again\", which of course is completely ignored by the cast. There is literally one quest series where you just follow a character around for five minutes with minimal dialogue breaks.\n\nThere are constant rotating events, and they are shockingly strict with how much time you have to get enough event currency to obtain items or even just do daily rewards. In a few of the events, missing even one or two days can completely blow your chance of getting every event item. Also before a recent update, older event items had to be obtained via random chance at Tuxedosam and My Melody's shops. That has been fixed though, with event stands allowing you to just get older items easily now.\n\nFinally the bit I hate most, the visitor system. A ton of quests, functions, etc are hidden behind the visitor system. If you are aiming to get the one hidden achievement, you will be waiting a full year as you are stopped by seasonally locked visitors, event item locked visitors, and literal months long waits for a few of the visitors. Visitors come for a \"week\" long period when their rotation happens. Some visitors appear anytime though. It is not a week however for rotation based visitors, it is five days from Thursday to Monday. You can \"max out\" their chances of appearing, but honestly it doesn't feel like it. Other people have noticed, but since a certain update visitors seem to have lower chances to appear, so realistically you will see them max twice a week. If you have many visiting at once though their quest to get stars (max five before being allowed to permanently stay) might not even appear due to the dailies having a max quest limit. On top of this sometimes they just won't give quests at all. Visitors will not appear two days in a row, and only leaving if their quest is done to hopefully visit another time in the rotation.\nThis leads to intense frustration, as some visitors only visit once a real time month as noted before, and those visitors often have some of the meatier content behind them including unlocking other visitors.\n\nI understand the goal of this game is to not rush, but they have done everything in their power to make sure you don't have a choice. \"Time travel\" (setting your clock forward) breaks large chunks of the game, including events and multiplayer. If you want to experience the game in full, you are forced to endure the constant time gating.\n\nOnce I get my final achievement, I'll probably put down the game, as it lost its charm many hours ago and is just exhausting me now. This doesn't feel as fun anymore, it feels like a chores simulator with a Hello Kitty flavoring. \n\nIf you do decide to get it, wait for the base game to be 20 USD (or equivalent in your local currency) or lower, and don't be afraid to quit playing if it starts to burn you out. My silly self is in too deep now.",

Honestly I wish I could put a \"mixed\" option of this game, because clearly i have 400+ hours in this game - i enjoy it but would i recommend it to someone If theyre a completionist, probably not.\n\nThis game, and I say this as someone whos played fucking rust and enshrouded, two incredibly grindy games, is VERY slow paced and very grindy, almost TOO slow.  When you first start playing, you have about like 7-8 hours of content to do, after that, you need to acquire an item from kuromi that allows you to access the whole rest of the map... but this takes multiple days through gifting her. So basically you unintentionally get on just to gift her, collect items, then get off for the day until you can FINALLY get this item and go into the ocean maybe 4 days later lol. Basically the entire game is like this, whether its unlocking different parts of the map, or completing quests. There are some quests that last for A WEEK. I'm glad that its slow paced, but fuck... could you pace it any slower? lol\n\nAll the good things about this game you unlock after A LONG TIME... Cabins were unlocked after 2 weeks or so(which isnt terrible but its why most people want to play this game so when you're just getting on to gift other characters, its kinda boring..), flowers were unlocked after i think months... new characters as well take months, NOT talking about visitors. But some visitors do take a long time to show up as well... and whats worse is, lets say, you start playing this game in february and unlock a visitor that requires christmas furniture decorations... well you just have to wait a whole year to unlock her.. OR pay for the deluxe edition.... and THEN after that visitor becomes a resident, you can FINALLY start unlocking MORE visitors, but again, it takes months. Some visitors spawn every 2-4 weeks, and even then, will show up for a day, then leave. So then you're just waiting another 2-4 weeks lol. Which leaves you to get on, do a visitors quests, have nothing else to do, then get off till the next day.\n\nThe furniture in this game is its strong suit. very fun to collect, specifically the holiday editions. Now, when you first start the game, again, its very grindy... so you're gonna be poor for a LONG time and cant even buy alot of furniture pieces.... which again, hinders the player from decorating.. aka the main selling point of this game. There are also quests that will HEAVY tax you in regards to items you need, so if you're poor, then gg you're staying poor for even longer. But if you're someone like me whos played this since its PC release, items are no longer an issue, over time you will accumulate so many items you wont have to worry about how much you spend. \n\nThe clothing, imo, are not that great... occassionally when a holiday or event comes around, theyll drop some banger outfits... but in regards to the base outfits that tuxedosam sells... theyre kinda buns ngl. \n\nStory wise, its alright? Its a hello kitty game so obviously I wasnt expecting anything crazy, I just wanted a cute game to mindlessly play lol. But alot of the quests are boring, they feel really pointless. some quests are legit \"hey can u cook me an apple pie? thanks\" *quests complete* and other quests take a week?? Very odd pacing lol\n\nalso... theyve added new areas to explore, like the moon and winter village.... but there is literally nothing to do there? Like i was actually baffled.. maybe i just havent unlocked it yet but there is literally nothing? lol\n\nIf you're buying this for your kid then who cares right but  $40.... its fun if you're just getting on to do dailies and occassionally decorate a cabin, as well as try to get new flower colors, which is why i keep playing it. But its definitely a \"get on for 10 mins a day then get off\" type of game after a while unfortunately. :/\n\nIf you want mindless enjoyment and dont mind a VERY slow paced game, sure, buy it. otherwise, I probably wouldnt bother, Especially if you have, well, ample time. This game definitely feels good for people that need a quick game to play after work or before school.",

      "review": "I would only recommend getting this on a sale because effectively it was designed as a cash-grab semi scam on apple arcade. Until the start of this year and the game's release on steam you could only play it through paying a subscription on apple arcade (mobile iphone thing, idk). This isn't a biggie by itself but if you've ever played this or looked at it you'd probably notice that the game *forces* you to wait quite a lot, days to even *months* after ~15h of progression. Now as i've mentioned the way you formerly would play this game is through a monthly subscription, and after a very short amount of time the only way to even play this game is to wait a LOT in real-time. I think it's obvious what the scummy practices here are- the game is designed to force you to wait and pay the subscription fee to continue playing, basically just designed to be as stale and time-consuming as possible alongside just not letting you do anything for weeks just to get you to pay. Now you'd think it would behave differently once on steam or switch due to that buying this game is now a one-time payment, and there's no subscription to scam customers with, but instead you still just have to wait weeks or even months to progress in this game past the first ~15h. What type of design is this?? it was only put in place as a way to scam mobile customers into paying more money, and they keep it for other versions?\r\n\r\nAlongside this, this version is *Over a YEAR behind* the mobile version, with the switch version being even further behind, they ignore these versions of the game and only update the mobile apple arcade version (since they can employ their scummy business tactics better on the subscription version) and essentially leave the other versions to rot. This game was also released a year behind the apple arcade version. They released an unfinished version of the game that makes you purposefully stall out months.\r\n\r\nOverall, it's good for the first little bit or so, but not long into the game you are forced to just wait, and wait, and wait to only play for 10 minutes and then go back to waiting. It has potential and things that my partner and I really liked but the fact that it's an unfinished, un-updated and badly made port of a game designed around scamming the player just doesn't end out well. I hope to see this game in a better state in the future but i'm not convinced it will.",

If you buy the Deluxe, that's already $59.99. And then you keep adding on $20 per DLC, that's freaken crazy and not worth the price. \n+ You will hit a point where everything is explored and you have 5* all the visitors. There will absolutely be no content left. So I understand why there will be DLC BUT the DLC does not equal in value. And the islands itself is also already so bare. The snow village and The Moon has ZERO Sanrio characters (and that means zero visitors) at all. Not to mention, other places like spooky swamp and cloud island do not get many or have any visitors too (unless you assign characters there)! Most of the time, you get visitors because of the Sanrio characters that live on the specific island. Why don't the twins have any of their visitors at all? :( Some islands are so dead and there is absolutely no reason to even go there after you visit the first time. \n+ There is going to be another DLC coming soon (next year), City Town. If you don't know already, City Town is available for Apple Arcade players and they don't have to pay but other platforms? Yeah, we have to pay for that stuff. First of all, many people who knew of City Town thought this was going to be a free update to the game because apple arcade players situation. The devs said nothing about it being paid until now (since wheatflour wonderland recently dropped).\n*** The price of the DLC is too much for what you are getting for. Maybe if it was around $5-7 because you are really only getting maybe one new character? There 90% you won't even get a visitor(s). And it's very buggy. \n\n2. Not that much customization to your room. I wish they let us have homes instead of a single room to decorate. I want a house with it's own kitchen area, bedrooms, living room, etc... \n\n3. This Chelsea person. I think they are the dev. If you are in the discord server, you know/seen them around.\n+ \"so we are are going to give less frequent updates (or keep them to 'still working, nothing new to announce') and not provide as much transparency into our development....\"\n+++ absolutely no words. this is a response on City Town in the discord. \n\n4. So many bugs!\n+ recent example: a new quest about a black flower. If you did the quest, WM was supposed to give your a black flower seed but there was a bug and MANY people did not get it. Now most players have to wait for the next update, which I think it's in December(?).\n+ lots of visual bugs\n+ your game might crash\n\n5. Not enough Sanrio Characters.\n+ There are the main ones but Sanrio has such a large list that it's disappointing we don't see them in the game. I understand there might be issues with licensing but Sanrio has many characters. You're telling me you couldn't even get the less popular ones to be feature in the games? Oh I don't know, maybe pitch to the company that letting more characters show up in the game will boost some of these lesser known characters popularity? Just do something. \n\n6. The visitors needs more wardrobes and interactions.\n+ If they are lucky, they have one outfit (mostly a island shirt 🙄). Other than that, they are just naked LOL. Yes, I know, licensing. But still, this game cost a lot of money. \n+ Having the visitors around doesn't really add much to the island/game. They are mostly just there. I wish, sometimes they would be doing some random ass stuff like camping or fishing. Something that's not just standing there.\n\n7. More mini games please!\n+ Only a few spots have games. Icy peak needs a winter game (snow boarding, skiing, etc...).\n\nFinal thoughts: I am quitting this game after I 5* Milk. Cinnamoroll loves his little baby (and I also love this little baby too 😭). I can just see this game having 100+ DLCs with the laziest updates and ghost cities/towns/islands. I don't think the quality of life is that amazing in the game. They should add a weather system so it's easier to collect items if possible. And the visitors should also be able to help collect items. \n\nWould I recommend this game? yes and no. But overall, IMHO I do not think it's worth it and I have regrets on the DLC I bought. Yes if you only want to play it for maybe less than 100 hours and be done with it. No if you don't want to waste money on DLCs that  kinda doesn't add much to the story/content/characters. I already paid for the WW DLC but I won't be giving this company anymore money. Since they are not transparent and are bad at communicating with it's community. Yeah, this City Town thing pissed me off. And all the players should be treated equally. I understand that apple arcade players got the game first but other players on different platforms also paid money for this game. And the Sunblink should have been truthful from the start about City Town being a paid DLC months ago. I would be fine with some DLC (reasonably priced). Why are they adding more region if there are already so many quality of life issues and not enough characters per region? Seems very lazy and money hungry to me. What is the point of The Moon and Icy Peak when there are no content and characters for that region? Should have just focused on City Town and gave that free as an update (since apple arcade players already have that--no, I will keep repeating that until my dying breath!) than the 2 region given to us that was giving absolutely nothing!",

This review is for people who understand this game is:\n- one you have to play EVERY DAY to get all the things you want\n- originally a mobile game\n- made for kids\n- made by a small-ish dev team partnered with one of the biggest IPs on the planet\n\nIf you're fine with all these things (like I was) and want to play for cute cozy chill vibes, that's exactly what you'll find. There is A LOT of content that you have to work through slowly as the days and seasons pass. Each character has cute detailed quests, side characters and friends, and their own unique abilities. There is no shortage of content or things to do, and I honestly like playing the game.\n\nHowever, I can't in good faith recommend this game because of how predatory it feels. Each big content update was originally marketed to be free if you get the deluxe bundle, but they now cost 15 USD as DLC. Updates happen so frequently and on a scale where players aren't given time/resources to 'catch up' if you weren't playing since day one (the update schedule for platforms is different, so your mileage may vary on this). Missed a single day during an event or devs didn't give enough event currency? Too bad, wait until next year to get whatever you wanted (compensation rewards do NOT help nearly enough). I'm by no means a completionist, but this game still had me clawing at my hair at times. Finally, the dev team's reaction to community complaints has been nothing short of disrespectful. Even honest, helpful feedback gets shut down and only positive comments are allowed. This could be the fault of Sanrio Ltd and not Sunblink, but the player experience still suffers greatly. \n\nThe game is nice, but is a clear case of predatory FOMO design. If you're buying this game, be ready to be mildy annoyed often, or feeling like giving up after realizing you have to wait 365 days just to potentially have access to something again. And if you're getting it for your kid, be ready for 'the DLC talk' or a lot of complaining once they finish the main story.",

      "review": "I wanted to love Hello Kitty Island Adventure and it does have promise, but the devs have proven time and again they don’t care about their customers. They have glitches that punish the player and refuse to fix them. They have a ridiculous disparity between the various platforms you can play on, with some being actively worked on and others neglected. \n\nWhen they were supposedly working on in-game content for the base game, they apparently were working on a completely unknown, unnecessary, and underwhelming dlc which has been more of a pain than any fun to play. Then they announced that the planned content would also be a paid dlc and would not be released until next year bc it wasn’t up to quality, as if they have ever cared about that before. \n\nChelsea is the WORST, being downright rude when players ask questions on the discord. In a recent post, they said that they recognized one issue players have with them is that their communication is sorely lacking and in response have decided to tell players even less so as not to upset them. Clearly they care more about being inconvenienced by our concerns than providing a quality product. \n\nI would give zero stars if possible. This dev is awful.",

I didn't get far enough into it, but others commenting on things being locked for single player (requiring multiplayer mode to get everything) and some other pricing issues make it hard to not see this game as exploitative. I know the Hello Kitty licensing was probably expensive and inflated the price, but that is still no excuse for a game in this price point having so little actual game play.",

In order to do really anything you have to befriend the characters, which can take days or even months to max out (this is the reason its a \"grindy\" game\n- Giant map with... not much to do. And at times its terrible to traverse \n- Fomo events / DLC. Why are we adding micro transactions to a $40 game? \n- Even though I said theres decent customization, thats all it is. For a game that is all about decorating and collecting, the things you can get feel very lack luster and often like recolors. \n\nTDLR; If this game was $5 - $10 I could justify getting it. But it isn't, its just a cheap mobile game they slapped a big price tag on simply bc its hello kitty. It's a very slow grind and I can't say I recommend it.",

      "review": "I’ve put so many hours into this game, and honestly, I love it — but I can’t recommend it unless you’re ready to care for your save file like it’s your child.\n\nPros - Super cute! It plays like the game I wished ACNH would have been. New items and content are added regularly. I haven’t hit an item limit yet which is a big deal for a chronic hoarder like me. Tons of charm and cozy atmosphere — easy to get attached. \n\nCons - Super hard to play and accomplish goals if you can't play everyday. A lot of it's appeal is regular in game events with limited time items. If you can't play daily to collect the event items it can be really frustrating to watch events end before you get to complete everything you want. Or timed quests that show up while you're on vacation and unable to play. I've also had the disappointment of events ending while I was out of town so I didn't get to finish trading in event items. \n\nEven for some not limited time quests, it can still be frustrating to be told to come back to the game in x number of days in order to complete. Running around collecting the daily spawns gets monotonous. \n\nA lot of these frustrations are the same for other games that are tied to real world clocks and I'll admit I'm generally not a fan of the genre. I had access to this game briefly on apple arcade and I think the game is way more playable in that format. Plus apple arcade players get access to everything way before the rest of us players.\n\nLastly, I hate the fishing mechanic. I know it's supposed to be a cozy, laid back game but you literally need to be ready to spend hours if you are trying to collect certain fish. Info from the wiki guide is the only way I made any progress on fishing goals. They recently added using bait to the fishing mechanic and I personally can't decide if it improved it or made it worse.",

      "review": "Why Buy the PC Release of Hello Kitty Island Adventure When Apple Arcade Is Actually Cheaper Monthly! \n\nHello Kitty Island Adventure is a cozy, slow-paced collection and achievement based game that gives off strong Animal Crossing vibes while still maintaining its own unique charm. I love it so much but i cant recommend it.\n\nSo i first came across the game through a suggested YouTube video. The visuals were adorable and the world looked amazing!! I was immediately hooked! However, I didn’t want to commit to another subscription they add up so fast, and yet an Apple Arcade subscription, so when a PC and Switch release was announced, I was overjoyed. I even paid extra for the Deluxe Edition to support the developers, avoid microtransactions, and “own” the game permanently.\n\nSadly that excitement didn’t last. As lovely as this game is, the PC and Switch versions are not complete. It genuinely feels like only half the content was brought over, while Apple Arcade users continue to receive the full game and all new content at no extra cost.\n\nFor example, City Town was originally intended to be a free update, not paid DLC. Wheatflour Wonderland, while i really loved it, it also shouldn’t have been paid DLC. Meanwhile! Apple Arcade users received these updates for free as part of their subscription.\n\nIf you’re considering buying the PC or Switch version to “save money,” it’s worth doing the math. Apple Arcade costs $6.99 per month, which comes to $83.88 a year. If you share it with a spouse or family member (up to 5 users can share), the cost per person can drop significantly! $41.94 per year for two people, while also granting access to over 200 other games! So its not just Hello Kitty Island adventure theres so much more!\n\nThe PC/Switch release, on the other hand, is $39.99 for the standard version or $59.99 for Deluxe. DLC adds an additional $14.99, bringing the total to $54.98 for standard + DLC, or $74.98 for Deluxe + DLC. The release dates are January 30, 2025 for PC (Steam) and Nintendo Switch, and August 5, 2025 for PlayStation 4 and 5. The game hasnt even been released that long ago and we will be seeing more DLCs in the future?? Whats with companies not giving us the full game instead of releasing the full game as a DLC this has to stop!\n\nI learned standing up for myself from a certain Red Panda! Team RAGE!\nIt’s a bit disappointing to see such a lovely game split this way between platforms. I wish cozy games wouldnt fall into this never ending money sink.",

      "review": "Let’s not sugarcoat it. Hello Kitty Island Adventure is not just a game—it’s a syrupy slap in the face to anyone who grew up with dignity, grit, or an ounce of self-respect in their gaming diet. This isn't Animal Crossing. This isn't Stardew Valley. This is weaponized cuteness, and it's coming for your brain cells like a pink tsunami of mediocrity.\r\n\r\nLet me paint you a picture: You boot up the game and are immediately greeted by a pastel-drenched purgatory of talking cupcakes, smiling dolphins, and aggressively cheerful music that sounds like a xylophone had a nervous breakdown. The plot? Oh, it’s so compelling—some friendship-fueled nonsense about “rebuilding an island” and “spreading kindness.” I nearly threw my Switch into a blender just to feel something again.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay loop is what you’d expect from a corporate fever dream designed in a Sanrio boardroom after five too many bubble teas. Fetch quests. Decorating. Crafting. You can make tea parties for penguins. Actual penguins. And people are calling this a “GOTY contender”? Has the bar really sunk that low?\r\n\r\nMultiplayer? Sure, if your idea of fun is walking around with your friends dressed as cotton candy clowns doing synchronized emotes like you’re in a cult funded by Hello Kitty’s marketing department. There’s no challenge. No consequences. You can’t lose. And that’s the point. It’s not a game—it’s a plush-padded dopamine trap for serotonin-starved adults who want to feel “safe.”\r\n\r\nOh, and don’t get me started on the fanbase. If you dare express even a whisper of criticism, brace yourself for a tsunami of pastel-wearing defenders who act like Hello Kitty personally cured their childhood trauma. “It’s not supposed to be hard! It’s about vibes!” Yeah? So is a scented candle, and I don’t see anyone giving Yankee Candle a 9.5 on IGN.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion: Hello Kitty Island Adventure isn’t just a bad game—it’s a symptom of a culture that’s traded ambition for aesthetic. If this is the future of gaming, then hand me a shovel, because I’d rather dig up my old PS2 than play one more second of this weaponized glitter garbage.\r\n\r\nScore: 2/10",

If the game offered more features I wouldn't mind the cost as much. It feels like you're paying full price only to wait to play. I really don't enjoy having to wait an entire day to progress in a game I already paid for... \n\nAnother thing is how much the game was promoted, everyone was waiting for it to come out on PC. I was personally expecting some improvements compared to the mobile version, but unfortunately that wasn't the case. It still feels like a mobile game, just on a bigger screen :( (with not much new content...)\n\nI really wanted to love this game, but I feel disappointed  \n\n(not criticizing anyone who enjoys it ofc!)",

Well... If you want to unlock more content you have to farm your way to level 11 by giving gifts to her or getting a daily quest with her involved.\n\nThe problem is: You can only give 3 gifts a day that give you little to no friendship xp, meaning that you have to wait for a couple of days (IRL DAYS) to pass to finally get through those couple of levels.\nAnd I know that 'friendship blossoms' exist that refresh your gift limit, but they're not that common from what I know...\nAnd basically every character has this thing so the whole game gets pretty boring after a short time.\n\nOh and additional thing: Why was Retsuko made like that? She's the only one without friends at the beginning and Chococat even forgets about her when listing out everyone who fell from the airplane and got lost at the beginning cutscene!",
