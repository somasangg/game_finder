      "review": "I hopped into ASTLIBRA wanting a nice casual stint of a platforming RPG. I left with a game that is way too low on the general radar. It has been an absolutely amazing experience; from the wonderful gripping story to all the Action RPG gameplay mechanics evolving and linking together. \nEven more impressive after realizing it was a solo dev effort. It's made with a vision and very focused on realizing that. \n\nGeneral combat is that of a 2D side scrolling in the likes of Castlevania Symphony of the Night with the pacing of Megaman Zero and a very expansive progression. There are so many ways to craft the builds you want to progress through the story with. \nI've tried a few sentences to describe it, but I fail to properly describe the systems and how well they link together to give you that feel of eternal and rewarding growth without it becoming a essay.\nI played it on normal, because of what I was looking for when I was starting the game, but very much would have liked playing it on a harder setting to really let me engage in some of the systems more.\n\nStorywise it tackles a lot of subjects and themes and generally handles it well. The themes lean on the actions taken, their consequences and the growth you can take from them. There are a decent amount of very good twists that further emotionally invested me into the story and committing to doing the best ending. It is told in a very 90's anime style which I appreciate for the nostalgia of that period. Some jokes fall flat, but they're very few between. \n\nAbsolutely one of the best games I've played. Will definitely come back to play it on that higher difficulty.",

Behind the wheel you can tell there was a well thought out vision for player progression. In short, this very much feels like a game by gamers for gamers, and I can't recommend it enough. \n\nThe story and characters are very charming, like a 90s anime plucked out of time. There's a few fan service moments and titillation that might make you cringe unless you're into that, but they're rare. Just when you think the story is going in a certain direction, it defies expectations and suddenly you realize you're in the reverse castle from SOTN and there's way more ahead to look forward to.\n\nThe overwhelming praise is not misplaced, and if you're on the fence, consider the demo or get it on sale.

I've beaten the game, and my longest save is ~60 hours)\n\n\"If the Scale of Destiny favors a soul, it destroys the fate of another. Will you change this balance, or cast your eyes aside?\"\n\nChallenging fate is a recurring theme in Astlibra that resonated with me deeply when I first played. I strongly believe that your decisions are your own, and that something like a higher power should have no influence in controlling or swaying your actions. You are the author of your own fate, and if it happens to be that someone or something has already written it out, it is your responsibility to overwrite it.\n\nIn Astlibra, you, the speechless self-insert main character, are a nobody out to find a long lost girl from your childhood. Without going into too much spoilers, as you progress the story and uncover the secrets of what happened to your childhood friend, what begins as a simple adventure turns into an adventure where the laws of the universe itself get rewritten because of you challenging and defying fate. The story overall has a lot of weight and impact, and it all leads to an ending that makes all your effort worth it.\n\nGameplay is rewarding and fun. I enjoyed seeing my numbers go up, and obtaining new weapons felt just as good as the satisfying combat. Bosses were also just as fun as they were difficult, with some reminding me of Terraria boss fights.\n\nThe music and sound design in Astlibra is pretty goated. Not much to say here other than that. Also, hitting enemies and killing them makes your ears happy.\n\nFinal rating: 9.5/10 | despite being overwhelmingly positive I think it's still underrated and should be known more. (SPOILER: [spoiler]there's shadowy tendrils toward the end of the game that come out of the ground that stay even when you beat the game which is annoying so -0.5 points because of that[/spoiler]",

It pairs one of the deepest, most addictive 2D ARPG systems ever made with a divisive art style and a story that leans heavily on cringey anime tropes.\n\n[h2]The Takeaway[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*] [h3]What We Loved[/h3] The core experience is a trifecta of addictive systems. It blends fast-paced, 2D side-scrolling combat with a massive, branching skill tree for meticulous build-crafting. This is all fueled by a constant \"dopamine loop\" of grinding for materials to upgrade every piece of gear, weapon, and your companion, Karon.\n[*] [h3]Minor Annoyances[/h3] The \"Revision\" is held back by major presentation issues. Its inconsistent, \"amateur\" art style often looks like a Flash game. This is matched by writing that constantly relies on cringey, dated, and raunchy anime fan service. It also has an extremely slow, multi-hour story introduction that is a genuine chore.\n[*] [h3]What It's About[/h3] A truly sweeping, time-traveling epic about a man's unyielding will to save his loved one. It is a story about struggling against a cruel, pre-determined fate, and it skillfully contrasts its high-stakes narrative with deeply personal, human-level relationships.\n[*] [h3]How It Plays[/h3] The gameplay is the entire point. The story, while huge, is ultimately a vehicle for these incredibly deep ARPG systems. The slow, satisfying power creep reinforces the story's themes of growth and persistence, while the action-heavy loop provides a perfect, tactile counterbalance to the long, text-heavy story segments.\n[*] [h3]Core Tone[/h3] The game's tone is a jarring mix. It aims for a grandiose, high-fantasy adventure with a vast scale. However, this is constantly undercut by a \"90s trash-anime\" vibe, where sincere melodrama is placed right next to awkward, dated humor.\n[*] [h3]Series & Genre Context[/h3] A \"kitchen sink\" 2D Action-RPG that feels like a long-lost 90s classic. It combines the side-scrolling action of \"Odin Sphere\" or \"Castlevania: Symphony of the Night\" with the sprawling, menu-heavy progression systems of a \"Disgaea\" game. It is a true cult classic, made by a solo developer over 14 years.\n[*] [h3]Technical Snapshot[/h3] The \"Revision\" polish cannot hide its roots. It is a visual collage of clashing asset styles, from polished bosses to amateurish character portraits. This is paired with a functional but dense UI with tiny text. The one unqualified success is its brilliant, catchy soundtrack, which far outshines the visuals.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Main Review[/h2]\n\n[b]ASTLIBRA Revision[/b] casts you as a traditional silent protagonist, a blank slate survivor from a village consumed by demons. Your initial role is simple: as a man lost in time, you are driven by the singular goal of finding your childhood friend. This simple premise belies the game's true nature. It is the start of a massive, time-traveling epic about the struggle against a cruel fate and one man's unyielding will to save a person he loves, even when the odds seem impossible.\n\nThe gameplay is where [b]ASTLIBRA Revision[/b] earns its masterpiece status. The 2D side-scrolling combat is fast and tactile, focused on breaking guards and juggling foes. But combat is just the tip of the iceberg. The true game is in the menus. You will meticulously manage a colossal, branching skill tree. You will feed a constant, addictive dopamine loop of grinding for materials to upgrade hundreds of weapons, armors, and the \"Karon\" companion. The story is a vehicle for these systems. The gameplay's slow power creep perfectly reinforces the narrative themes of growth and persistence, providing an action-heavy loop between long, text-heavy story segments.\n\nThis is a world defined by its staggering scale and its tonal whiplash. The story unfolds in distinct, episodic chapters, building deliberately from a slow start into a complex, time-bending plot that spans 60+ hours. Unfortunately, this epic, high-fantasy tone is constantly at war with a \"90s trash-anime\" vibe. Sincere dramatic moments are often followed by awkward humor or cringey fan service. This clash is mirrored in the art, a collage of styles that never fully coheres. The one constant positive is the brilliant soundtrack, which sets a perfect mood even when the visuals and writing fail to.\n\nThis is a game of extremes. It has an incredible 60-80 hour main campaign, plus a massive 20+ hour post-game expansion. For its $25 price, it delivers the content of a full JRPG trilogy. But its value is tied to your tolerance. The playtime is inflated by a \"grind-heavy\" loop. The art is amateurish. The writing is often \"trash-tier.\" The game's opening hours are a genuine test of patience. [b]ASTLIBRA Revision[/b] is the very definition of a flawed masterpiece, a cult-classic-in-the-making whose incredible strengths are chained to equally significant weaknesses.\n\n[h2]The Verdict[/h2]\n\n[b]ASTLIBRA Revision[/b] is a must-play for hardcore ARPG and JRPG veterans, specifically those who value systems and depth above all else. If you live for complex skill trees, endless grinding, and a \"number-go-up\" feeling, this is one of the best in the genre. However, if you are turned off by dated anime tropes, cringey fan service, or amateurish art, you will be frustrated. The game demands you accept its significant flaws to get to its brilliant core. [i]For those who can, this is a uniquely rewarding, 100-hour-plus journey that is an easy recommendation.[/i]",

      "review": "I wish I could go back and start all over again!\n\nThis game was terminally fun.  It's been a long time since a game has given me the sort of feeling I had when playing through this one.  Perhaps nostalgia for games like this played a part in how strongly I reacted, but there is no doubt that it really was a great time.  \n\nThe narrative and characters were great, you really get hooked on the story and find yourself liking the people you spend time with.  Things can get a bit trope-y, but that's kind of par for the course here, so I can't hold it against the creator.  It's absolutely a one play through experience for the narrative though, since much of the fun comes from the unknown and constantly getting hit over the head with twists and new information.\n\nThe combat is a lot of fun, which is good because you will be doing a lot of it.  The design ethos certainly matches the era the art style is from.  You will be grinding quite often.  For item/weapon/armor drops, to master skills, for experience, etc.  This isn't really a bad thing as there is depth here and room for skill expression.\n\nThe only real negative for me was that it tended to drag a bit towards the end.  There are a few \"ending scares\" where it very much feels like you've finished and everything is about to wrap up, but then you'll be tossed into more content.  I think that perhaps if there weren't so many points in which it felt as though the game was going to end but then it just didn't that I wouldn't find much, if anything, to complain about in regards to the length.  In that same vein, there are a lot of reused locations that absolutely adds to the game feeling a bit stretched.  On that note though I cannot really complain as it's important to keep in mind that this was all done by one person...\n\nIf you're thinking of giving this a shot, just pick it up.  You won't regret it.   Hell, I've never before felt compelled to leave a Steam review.  I really cannot recommend this game any more highly.",

      "review": "ASTLIBRA Revision: One of the Best Games of All Time\n\nIn a world where games often follow formulas and trends, ASTLIBRA Revision feels like a breath of fresh air. It's a game that doesn't just show up to entertain—it demands your attention and rewards you for sticking with it. For those who love deep, emotionally rich experiences wrapped in satisfying action, this indie RPG stands out as one of the most impressive titles of its generation.\n\nA Labor of Love\n\nWhat makes ASTLIBRA Revision so special is the sheer dedication behind it. Created by a single developer, KEIZO, over the course of more than a decade, this game is the definition of passion. It began as a small, personal project and grew into something that is not just a great indie game, but a standout title in the action RPG genre. It’s clear from every pixel and every line of dialogue that this is a project made with love and attention to detail.\n\nCombat That Feels Perfectly Satisfying\n\nAt its core, ASTLIBRA is an action RPG, but it goes above and beyond the typical genre conventions. The combat is fast-paced, fluid, and deeply satisfying. Each weapon type feels unique. Whether you're wielding a giant sword, firing arrows, or whipping enemies across the screen, there’s a sense of weight and purpose to every action. The game also offers a “Feather Orb” system that lets you customize your abilities, meaning that your playstyle can evolve as you progress.\n\nBoss fights are where the game really shines. They’re challenging, but not in an unfair way. Every encounter feels like a test of your skill and an opportunity to learn more about the game’s mechanics. Even after dozens of hours, ASTLIBRA keeps you engaged by throwing new challenges your way, ensuring the gameplay never feels repetitive.\n\nA Story That Sticks With You\n\nWhat really elevates ASTLIBRA is its story. On the surface, it's a tale of a hero trying to piece together his fragmented past, but as you progress, it becomes something much deeper. The plot explores themes of loss, redemption, and the complexity of human emotion. It’s the kind of story that gets under your skin—quietly powerful and surprising in how it unfolds.\n\nWhat makes the story so effective is its pacing. There’s never a dull moment. It always knows when to slow down for a moment of introspection or to pick up the pace with a dramatic battle. By the time you reach the later chapters, you realize how much you’ve invested in these characters, making the emotional moments hit that much harder.\n\nGorgeous Art and Sound Design\n\nVisually, ASTLIBRA is a stunning game. It’s got that pixel art charm, but it’s not stuck in the past—every frame feels modern, smooth, and detailed. The environments you explore are rich and varied, from forests to dungeons to sprawling cities, each one more captivating than the last. The animations, too, are incredibly fluid, making the combat feel dynamic and satisfying.\n\nThe music is another highlight. It’s not often you get a soundtrack that you want to listen to even when you’re not playing the game, but ASTLIBRA’s score is that good. Every track complements the emotional weight of the story, with sweeping orchestral pieces that hit just the right note.\n\nWhy It’s One of the Best Games Ever\n\nWhen it comes down to it, ASTLIBRA Revision isn’t just a great game—it’s a masterpiece in the making. It’s the kind of game that reminds you of the reason we all love this medium in the first place: storytelling that resonates, gameplay that challenges, and a world that feels alive.\n\nThis is a game that doesn’t just want to entertain you—it wants you to feel something. And it succeeds. The passion that went into making it shows in every single moment, and that’s what makes ASTLIBRA not just one of the best indie games, but one of the best games period. If you haven’t played it yet, do yourself a favor and dive in.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nASTLIBRA Revision is a shining example of what happens when a single person’s vision comes to life. It’s an unforgettable journey that blends intricate combat, a heartfelt narrative, and stunning visuals into one cohesive experience. Simply put, this is one of the best games ever made.",

Out of the hundreds, if not thousands of games I've ever played, as a consistent gamer since the NES era, Astlibra: Revision is one of the best games I've ever played.  Starting as one of the early Flash/Newgrounds games from the early 2000's that never left Japan until recently, Astlibra:Revision is a masterpiece of a side scrolling action adventure RPG with crunchy combat and a mishmash of photorealistic backgrounds, pixelated anime characters, gorgeously rendered monsters, and a beautifully emotionally evocative story, it takes you on a wild ride that asks two poignant questions:\n\n1)  How far would you go for your childhood love?  and\n2)  If you had the power to change something the past, what sacrifices are you making along the way?  e.g. If you could save your mom's life, would that mean your child was never born?\n\nThe combat is deliciously weighty, being able to feel the impact of each hit.  The equipment collection, skill trees, and ability unlocks are satisfying, and each new twist is one that blows you away.  I absolutely recommend this to anyone who enjoyed old SNES adventure games like Secret of Mana, or thosewho enjoy side scrolling action RPGs like Odin's Sphere, Dragon's Crown, or Symphony of the Night or Super Metroid, especially if this is on sale for $5.",

It has been an absolutely amazing experience; from the wonderful gripping story to all the Action RPG gameplay mechanics evolving and linking together. \nEven more impressive after realizing it was a solo dev effort. It's made with a vision and very focused on realizing that. \n\nGeneral combat is that of a 2D side scrolling in the likes of Castlevania Symphony of the Night with the pacing of Megaman Zero and a very expansive progression. There are so many ways to craft the builds you want to progress through the story with. \nI've tried a few sentences to describe it, but I fail to properly describe the systems and how well they link together to give you that feel of eternal and rewarding growth without it becoming a essay.\nI played it on normal, because of what I was looking for when I was starting the game, but very much would have liked playing it on a harder setting to really let me engage in some of the systems more.\n\nStorywise it tackles a lot of subjects and themes and generally handles it well. The themes lean on the actions taken, their consequences and the growth you can take from them. There are a decent amount of very good twists that further emotionally invested me into the story and committing to doing the best ending. It is told in a very 90's anime style which I appreciate for the nostalgia of that period. Some jokes fall flat, but they're very few between. \n\nAbsolutely one of the best games I've played. Will definitely come back to play it on that higher difficulty.",

It's an exceptional JRPG.\nIt has good mechanics, build variety, gameplay, interesting progression, strong characters, tight pacing, and an interesting story.\nThe start is slow, and the tutorial/demo isn't very good for explaining the mechanics. So, I would avoid them and instead jump straight into the game. I would play the Demo first if you're on the fence about getting the game, but not for an actual tutorial on how to play.\nThe actual game explains different progression mechanics as they're introduced in your progression through the story, and they're far better explained there.\nThe story is very gripping and it continuously keeps hooking you back in once you let it get rolling, I will not be spoiling for obvious reasons. The soundtrack is also amazing and KEIZO clearly put a lot of work into his music selection to give this game its tone and feel.\nThe characters are compelling and given ample time to help develop them. There wasn't a single character that I wasn't at least a little invested in.\nLastly the actual gameplay has a lot going on in terms of build complexity, variety, styles of play, and methods of progression. It melds together quite well and makes for a very cohesive thinking side of the game. The combat is very satisfying, it has excellent feedback on-hit, and clear effects. Basically any instance where I'm hit, it feels like it was my fault, not the game's fault.\nI also can play in literally any way that I want, and it's viable. There's throwing/ranged weapon builds, magic, melee, and variations with or without shield. That's not even counting how much you can customize your techniques to suit variations of those playstyles too.\nIt's well worth the price, I doubt I'll ever stop gushing about Astlibra, get the game and play it. If you have any good taste in video games at all, you will not be disappointed.\nP.S. The DLC is good, but hold off on playing it until you've beat the main game.",

There's some very light Metroidvania mechanics like double jumps and bombs and a variety of weapons, with a real sense of progression when as you transition from carefully fighting one monster at a time to recklessly charging through hordes.\r\n\r\nThe plot as a whole is wonderful, and the less said the better.

Behind the wheel you can tell there was a well thought out vision for player progression. In short, this very much feels like a game by gamers for gamers, and I can't recommend it enough. \n\nThe story and characters are very charming, like a 90s anime plucked out of time. There's a few fan service moments and titillation that might make you cringe unless you're into that, but they're rare. Just when you think the story is going in a certain direction, it defies expectations and suddenly you realize you're in the reverse castle from SOTN and there's way more ahead to look forward to.\n\nThe overwhelming praise is not misplaced, and if you're on the fence, consider the demo or get it on sale.

It's been a long time since a game has given me the sort of feeling I had when playing through this one.  Perhaps nostalgia for games like this played a part in how strongly I reacted, but there is no doubt that it really was a great time.  \n\nThe narrative and characters were great, you really get hooked on the story and find yourself liking the people you spend time with.  Things can get a bit trope-y, but that's kind of par for the course here, so I can't hold it against the creator.  It's absolutely a one play through experience for the narrative though, since much of the fun comes from the unknown and constantly getting hit over the head with twists and new information.\n\nThe combat is a lot of fun, which is good because you will be doing a lot of it.  The design ethos certainly matches the era the art style is from.  You will be grinding quite often.  For item/weapon/armor drops, to master skills, for experience, etc.  This isn't really a bad thing as there is depth here and room for skill expression.\n\nThe only real negative for me was that it tended to drag a bit towards the end.  There are a few \"ending scares\" where it very much feels like you've finished and everything is about to wrap up, but then you'll be tossed into more content.  I think that perhaps if there weren't so many points in which it felt as though the game was going to end but then it just didn't that I wouldn't find much, if anything, to complain about in regards to the length.  In that same vein, there are a lot of reused locations that absolutely adds to the game feeling a bit stretched.  On that note though I cannot really complain as it's important to keep in mind that this was all done by one person...\n\nIf you're thinking of giving this a shot, just pick it up.  You won't regret it.   Hell, I've never before felt compelled to leave a Steam review.  I really cannot recommend this game any more highly.",

I've beaten the game, and my longest save is ~60 hours)\n\n\"If the Scale of Destiny favors a soul, it destroys the fate of another. Will you change this balance, or cast your eyes aside?\"\n\nChallenging fate is a recurring theme in Astlibra that resonated with me deeply when I first played. I strongly believe that your decisions are your own, and that something like a higher power should have no influence in controlling or swaying your actions. You are the author of your own fate, and if it happens to be that someone or something has already written it out, it is your responsibility to overwrite it.\n\nIn Astlibra, you, the speechless self-insert main character, are a nobody out to find a long lost girl from your childhood. Without going into too much spoilers, as you progress the story and uncover the secrets of what happened to your childhood friend, what begins as a simple adventure turns into an adventure where the laws of the universe itself get rewritten because of you challenging and defying fate. The story overall has a lot of weight and impact, and it all leads to an ending that makes all your effort worth it.\n\nGameplay is rewarding and fun. I enjoyed seeing my numbers go up, and obtaining new weapons felt just as good as the satisfying combat. Bosses were also just as fun as they were difficult, with some reminding me of Terraria boss fights.\n\nThe music and sound design in Astlibra is pretty goated. Not much to say here other than that. Also, hitting enemies and killing them makes your ears happy.\n\nFinal rating: 9.5/10 | despite being overwhelmingly positive I think it's still underrated and should be known more.

[spoiler]Well, until late game when you can get a karon skill that allow you to equip shield with big weapon[/spoiler]. Magic staff were pretty funny however as they allowed me to farm pretty easily the [spoiler]gods area[/spoiler] as i could always stay at a same distance. But the system of each weapon having it's own xp bar to get a reward from it however was really nice, i liked to be forced to switch weapon around to farm karon skills.\n\nArt wise, at first i was reticent, but the more i played it, the more i loved it, it really have it's own charm and it's fantastic.\n\nFor the osts, they are absolute banger, and seeing Ucchii0's music being used in a game does put a smile on my face.\n\nOverall, i highly recommend this game for it's story, the gameplay is fun as well if you enjoy mindlessly hitting mobs, and the game is pretty long as well so the prices is definitely worth it!",

About 36-hours of content, but will take you way longer as grinding is essential, even if you turn the difficulty down to Easy. If you've played this style of eastern, side-scrolling fantasy action before then you’ll know what to expect, but for me this is the best of them by far. Combat had some quirks to get used to, but it makes the most out of the mechanics it has and feels punchy, keeps you engaged, and is satisfying to grind. What kept me hooked most of all though, was the story constantly going in directions I never expected. I’m seriously impressed at how it kept adding layers and logically evolving in scale because, for a solo developer, the depth and execution was absurdly better than it had any business being.",

It pairs one of the deepest, most addictive 2D ARPG systems ever made with a divisive art style and a story that leans heavily on cringey anime tropes.\n\n[h2]The Takeaway[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*] [h3]What We Loved[/h3] The core experience is a trifecta of addictive systems. It blends fast-paced, 2D side-scrolling combat with a massive, branching skill tree for meticulous build-crafting. This is all fueled by a constant \"dopamine loop\" of grinding for materials to upgrade every piece of gear, weapon, and your companion, Karon.\n[*] [h3]Minor Annoyances[/h3] The \"Revision\" is held back by major presentation issues. Its inconsistent, \"amateur\" art style often looks like a Flash game. This is matched by writing that constantly relies on cringey, dated, and raunchy anime fan service. It also has an extremely slow, multi-hour story introduction that is a genuine chore.\n[*] [h3]What It's About[/h3] A truly sweeping, time-traveling epic about a man's unyielding will to save his loved one. It is a story about struggling against a cruel, pre-determined fate, and it skillfully contrasts its high-stakes narrative with deeply personal, human-level relationships.\n[*] [h3]How It Plays[/h3] The gameplay is the entire point. The story, while huge, is ultimately a vehicle for these incredibly deep ARPG systems. The slow, satisfying power creep reinforces the story's themes of growth and persistence, while the action-heavy loop provides a perfect, tactile counterbalance to the long, text-heavy story segments.\n[*] [h3]Core Tone[/h3] The game's tone is a jarring mix. It aims for a grandiose, high-fantasy adventure with a vast scale. However, this is constantly undercut by a \"90s trash-anime\" vibe, where sincere melodrama is placed right next to awkward, dated humor.\n[*] [h3]Series & Genre Context[/h3] A \"kitchen sink\" 2D Action-RPG that feels like a long-lost 90s classic. It combines the side-scrolling action of \"Odin Sphere\" or \"Castlevania: Symphony of the Night\" with the sprawling, menu-heavy progression systems of a \"Disgaea\" game. It is a true cult classic, made by a solo developer over 14 years.\n[*] [h3]Technical Snapshot[/h3] The \"Revision\" polish cannot hide its roots. It is a visual collage of clashing asset styles, from polished bosses to amateurish character portraits. This is paired with a functional but dense UI with tiny text. The one unqualified success is its brilliant, catchy soundtrack, which far outshines the visuals.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Main Review[/h2]\n\n[b]ASTLIBRA Revision[/b] casts you as a traditional silent protagonist, a blank slate survivor from a village consumed by demons. Your initial role is simple: as a man lost in time, you are driven by the singular goal of finding your childhood friend. This simple premise belies the game's true nature. It is the start of a massive, time-traveling epic about the struggle against a cruel fate and one man's unyielding will to save a person he loves, even when the odds seem impossible.\n\nThe gameplay is where [b]ASTLIBRA Revision[/b] earns its masterpiece status. The 2D side-scrolling combat is fast and tactile, focused on breaking guards and juggling foes. But combat is just the tip of the iceberg. The true game is in the menus. You will meticulously manage a colossal, branching skill tree. You will feed a constant, addictive dopamine loop of grinding for materials to upgrade hundreds of weapons, armors, and the \"Karon\" companion. The story is a vehicle for these systems. The gameplay's slow power creep perfectly reinforces the narrative themes of growth and persistence, providing an action-heavy loop between long, text-heavy story segments.\n\nThis is a world defined by its staggering scale and its tonal whiplash. The story unfolds in distinct, episodic chapters, building deliberately from a slow start into a complex, time-bending plot that spans 60+ hours. Unfortunately, this epic, high-fantasy tone is constantly at war with a \"90s trash-anime\" vibe. Sincere dramatic moments are often followed by awkward humor or cringey fan service. This clash is mirrored in the art, a collage of styles that never fully coheres. The one constant positive is the brilliant soundtrack, which sets a perfect mood even when the visuals and writing fail to.\n\nThis is a game of extremes. It has an incredible 60-80 hour main campaign, plus a massive 20+ hour post-game expansion. For its $25 price, it delivers the content of a full JRPG trilogy. But its value is tied to your tolerance. The playtime is inflated by a \"grind-heavy\" loop. The art is amateurish. The writing is often \"trash-tier.\" The game's opening hours are a genuine test of patience. [b]ASTLIBRA Revision[/b] is the very definition of a flawed masterpiece, a cult-classic-in-the-making whose incredible strengths are chained to equally significant weaknesses.\n\n[h2]The Verdict[/h2]\n\n[b]ASTLIBRA Revision[/b] is a must-play for hardcore ARPG and JRPG veterans, specifically those who value systems and depth above all else. If you live for complex skill trees, endless grinding, and a \"number-go-up\" feeling, this is one of the best in the genre. However, if you are turned off by dated anime tropes, cringey fan service, or amateurish art, you will be frustrated. The game demands you accept its significant flaws to get to its brilliant core. [i]For those who can, this is a uniquely rewarding, 100-hour-plus journey that is an easy recommendation.[/i]",

      "review": "ASTLIBRA Revision: One of the Best Games of All Time\n\nIn a world where games often follow formulas and trends, ASTLIBRA Revision feels like a breath of fresh air. It's a game that doesn't just show up to entertain—it demands your attention and rewards you for sticking with it. For those who love deep, emotionally rich experiences wrapped in satisfying action, this indie RPG stands out as one of the most impressive titles of its generation.\n\nA Labor of Love\n\nWhat makes ASTLIBRA Revision so special is the sheer dedication behind it. Created by a single developer, KEIZO, over the course of more than a decade, this game is the definition of passion. It began as a small, personal project and grew into something that is not just a great indie game, but a standout title in the action RPG genre. It’s clear from every pixel and every line of dialogue that this is a project made with love and attention to detail.\n\nCombat That Feels Perfectly Satisfying\n\nAt its core, ASTLIBRA is an action RPG, but it goes above and beyond the typical genre conventions. The combat is fast-paced, fluid, and deeply satisfying. Each weapon type feels unique. Whether you're wielding a giant sword, firing arrows, or whipping enemies across the screen, there’s a sense of weight and purpose to every action. The game also offers a “Feather Orb” system that lets you customize your abilities, meaning that your playstyle can evolve as you progress.\n\nBoss fights are where the game really shines. They’re challenging, but not in an unfair way. Every encounter feels like a test of your skill and an opportunity to learn more about the game’s mechanics. Even after dozens of hours, ASTLIBRA keeps you engaged by throwing new challenges your way, ensuring the gameplay never feels repetitive.\n\nA Story That Sticks With You\n\nWhat really elevates ASTLIBRA is its story. On the surface, it's a tale of a hero trying to piece together his fragmented past, but as you progress, it becomes something much deeper. The plot explores themes of loss, redemption, and the complexity of human emotion. It’s the kind of story that gets under your skin—quietly powerful and surprising in how it unfolds.\n\nWhat makes the story so effective is its pacing. There’s never a dull moment. It always knows when to slow down for a moment of introspection or to pick up the pace with a dramatic battle. By the time you reach the later chapters, you realize how much you’ve invested in these characters, making the emotional moments hit that much harder.\n\nGorgeous Art and Sound Design\n\nVisually, ASTLIBRA is a stunning game. It’s got that pixel art charm, but it’s not stuck in the past—every frame feels modern, smooth, and detailed. The environments you explore are rich and varied, from forests to dungeons to sprawling cities, each one more captivating than the last. The animations, too, are incredibly fluid, making the combat feel dynamic and satisfying.\n\nThe music is another highlight. It’s not often you get a soundtrack that you want to listen to even when you’re not playing the game, but ASTLIBRA’s score is that good. Every track complements the emotional weight of the story, with sweeping orchestral pieces that hit just the right note.\n\nWhy It’s One of the Best Games Ever\n\nWhen it comes down to it, ASTLIBRA Revision isn’t just a great game—it’s a masterpiece in the making. It’s the kind of game that reminds you of the reason we all love this medium in the first place: storytelling that resonates, gameplay that challenges, and a world that feels alive.\n\nThis is a game that doesn’t just want to entertain you—it wants you to feel something. And it succeeds. The passion that went into making it shows in every single moment, and that’s what makes ASTLIBRA not just one of the best indie games, but one of the best games period. If you haven’t played it yet, do yourself a favor and dive in.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nASTLIBRA Revision is a shining example of what happens when a single person’s vision comes to life. It’s an unforgettable journey that blends intricate combat, a heartfelt narrative, and stunning visuals into one cohesive experience. Simply put, this is one of the best games ever made.",

      "review": "ASTLIBRA Revision is a game about a boy having adventures in the Windows XP wallpaper. The use of real photography in the backgrounds combined with the anime characters is an odd pairing that works surprisingly well and gives the game unique character. The story is amazing and the world seems to have a lot more going on that it initially seems. It is a joy going through the game, as there are always satisfying story beats and mysteries around the corner. The game goes to some wild places. Music is, simply put, phenomenal.\n\nThe one big issue is that the environments are pretty small. And there is lot of repetition and running back and forth in these small environments. The combat is fine, but as the game is quite long, it too becomes repetitive. After 40 hours, I just put the difficulty setting to the easiest possible and mashed my way through all combat encounters as fast as possible.\n\nASTLIBRA Revision is an easy recommendation to all 2D action RPG enjoyers. The repetition takes some of the enjoyment away, but the story is a future classic that is worth experiencing. Can't wait to see what KEIZO cooks up next. 4/5",

It becomes a bit more annoying in post-game with \"boards\", but you can beat the game just fine while ignoring them.  If you want this and don't care about any of the cons, then you might actually want to play the game.  If you hate grind, then the game is probably not for you -- you could play on an easier mode to remove the grind, but then you'd might also remove too much challenge for it to be interesting.\n- Fun, if a bit janky, combat loop.  On Impossible mode, individual situations can be challenging and require understanding enemy layouts and patterns.  I'd compare the raw difficulty in \"Impossible\" mode to something like Dark Souls 1, although grindier.\n\nCons:\n- The dialogue and characters are straight up trash tier anime/manga trope childish terribleness. Sexist objectification of women and childish behavior are rampant.  Dialogue is boring and repetitive, characters are 0-dimensional.  This becomes straight up uncomfortable in many segments, but even if you're not bothered by it it's still just really boring and long.  You can skip all dialogue/cutscenes and that would honestly improve the experience, except you occasionally need dialogue to help you know where to go/what to do.  Do not play this for the story, characters, or setting -- there is no charm there whatsoever and it never gets better.\n- The jank re: controls and design is annoying in parts. Item and spell usage is sometimes frustrating because the game will drop inputs when you're actively hitting enemies. Impossible mode relies heavily on item usage (you can often take 1-2 hits max without healing). There's a delay after spellcasting before the spell comes out, but combat relies on precise positioning so spells will often come out the wrong direction because you need to micro-adjust that direction to avoid being hit.  In the \"post-game\", enemies turn into dark versions of themselves, but the backgrounds are unchanged making many enemies hard to see. Many weapons and techniques will thrust you forward when attacking, but you basically never want this since this throws you into enemy hitboxes -- it's a mercy when you eventually acquire a skill that turns this off.",

It becomes a bit more annoying in post-game with \"boards\", but you can beat the game just fine while ignoring them.  If you want this and don't care about any of the cons, then you might actually want to play the game.

I'd compare the raw difficulty in \"Impossible\" mode to something like Dark Souls 1, although grindier.\n\nCons:\n- The dialogue and characters are straight up trash tier anime/manga trope childish terribleness. Sexist objectification of women and childish behavior are rampant.  Dialogue is boring and repetitive, characters are 0-dimensional.  This becomes straight up uncomfortable in many segments, but even if you're not bothered by it it's still just really boring and long.  You can skip all dialogue/cutscenes and that would honestly improve the experience, except you occasionally need dialogue to help you know where to go/what to do.  Do not play this for the story, characters, or setting -- there is no charm there whatsoever and it never gets better.\n- The jank re: controls and design is annoying in parts. Item and spell usage is sometimes frustrating because the game will drop inputs when you're actively hitting enemies. Impossible mode relies heavily on item usage (you can often take 1-2 hits max without healing). There's a delay after spellcasting before the spell comes out, but combat relies on precise positioning so spells will often come out the wrong direction because you need to micro-adjust that direction to avoid being hit.

Overall, I don't recommend it.\n\nPros:\n- A long grind where you're continuously increasing in power -- this game has a fun power curve that rewards grinding for item drops (especially on Impossible mode). It becomes a bit more annoying in post-game with \"boards\", but you can beat the game just fine while ignoring them.  If you want this and don't care about any of the cons, then you might actually want to play the game.  If you hate grind, then the game is probably not for you -- you could play on an easier mode to remove the grind, but then you'd might also remove too much challenge for it to be interesting.\n- Fun, if a bit janky, combat loop.  On Impossible mode, individual situations can be challenging and require understanding enemy layouts and patterns.  I'd compare the raw difficulty in \"Impossible\" mode to something like Dark Souls 1, although grindier.\n\nCons:\n- The dialogue and characters are straight up trash tier anime/manga trope childish terribleness. Sexist objectification of women and childish behavior are rampant.  Dialogue is boring and repetitive, characters are 0-dimensional.  This becomes straight up uncomfortable in many segments, but even if you're not bothered by it it's still just really boring and long.  You can skip all dialogue/cutscenes and that would honestly improve the experience, except you occasionally need dialogue to help you know where to go/what to do.  Do not play this for the story, characters, or setting -- there is no charm there whatsoever and it never gets better.\n- The jank re: controls and design is annoying in parts. Item and spell usage is sometimes frustrating because the game will drop inputs when you're actively hitting enemies. Impossible mode relies heavily on item usage (you can often take 1-2 hits max without healing). There's a delay after spellcasting before the spell comes out, but combat relies on precise positioning so spells will often come out the wrong direction because you need to micro-adjust that direction to avoid being hit.  In the \"post-game\", enemies turn into dark versions of themselves, but the backgrounds are unchanged making many enemies hard to see.
