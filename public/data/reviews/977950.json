'아 깰 수 있을 거 같은데 내 손가락이 문제인가?' '내가 게임을 하는건지 훈련을 하는건지 모르겠네?' '왜 게임을 하는데 스트레스나 쌓이지?' 같은 생각에도 괜찮다 하시는 분들만 하세요. 다키스트 던전, 다크소울, 할로우나이트, 앙빅 같은 거 깨신 분들이면 아마 괜찮으실 겁니다. 물론 앞에서 나열한 게임 정도는 아니지만, 그 정도로 이 게임이 꽤 실력을 요구합니다.\r\n\r\n사실.. 재밌긴 합니다. 스트레스가 죽은 횟수만큼 제곱으로 쌓여서 문제죠. 그렇다면 어째서 비추를 주었느냐고 묻는다면, 사실 보통을 주고 싶은데 없어서 그렇기도 하고, 어느 누군가가 이 게임이 어렵다고 느껴지는데 주변에 보면 다 호평이고, 다 잘하고, 짜증나는 거 재밌다고 하는 반응만 보이고 하면 자책감을 느끼실 수 있을 거 같아 당신만 그러는 것 아니라는 위로(?)를 전하고 싶었습니다.",
