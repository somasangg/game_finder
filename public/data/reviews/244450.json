You can also play the vanilla missions, but they are all the same where you capture the points to gain more points to buy different troops, which to me is stupid. \n\nMajority of the modded missions are created to give you a SPECIFIC troop/unit that was modified to fix it's genre etc, like if you downloaded a star wars mission, you'd be given a clone squad and a AT-AT or AT-TE. Great game if you invest some time in the modded scene. Singular mods can be up to 20 gigs on average if your looking for a good, realistic mod. \n\nIf ur looking to have some fun and mess around, get this game.

Fulqrums \"control\" on the Gates workshop is restricting THEIR CONTENT FROM ANOTHER GAME. \"They have requested that all mods containing content from their games be removed from our workshops, this applies to Call to Arms and Call to Arms - Gates of Hell. Specifically, Fulqrum owns Men of War branding, missions and assets. They are in the right to enforce this request.\" \n\nWhy are we upset they want to keep the content they made for their game? I wouldnt be happy if someone was playing a story I put together for MY gamein someone elses. This isnt an attack on Gates of Hell, as some of you swear it is. It is a dev group not wanting there assets used in another game. Plus seriously, it isnt like they are wanting over 50% of the mods gone. Everyone review bombing a game, just because a dev group is wanting to protect their assets (even if they are from 2014) are genuienly sad, sad people. They are copywriting their own assets and their own creative works. \n\nThank you for reading",

But as newer, sleeker models and competitors come and go with their own problems, MoWAS 2 stays. For the record I want to say I started playing this game in 2021-2022, so I'm not biased by nostalgia going back to the Windows 7 days.\n\nThe game is janky (though pretty damn good for a game that's a decade old). It looks old, even for it's time. The engine sometimes has issues, but man the level of detail. Most of the environment is destructible, and depending on what kind of weapons used in a match a city can basically get flattened in the crossfire. Different parts of tanks will get damaged or break without there being a whole health bar (I still love you C&C) and you can even control tanks/infantry in case the AI decides to take a dump on you. It's been difficult getting into other RTS games because THIS one has so much to offer.\n\nI thoroughly recommend the \"World at War\" addon for MoWAS2. Get your RTS buddies playing the base game and then going onto the addon; it feels like a DLC that is worth your time if not money. There's ALOT of WWII RTS games out there, but the level of detail kept me coming back to this gem. \n\nFind friends to buy this game for. \n\nSearch for groups online to play this game with. \n\nEven if you're not a WWII enthusiast, there's also Star Wars mods out there that are also fantastic.",

But after playing a good 30 hours (some on my friends pc) I can say there is some minor hiccups that take away from it.  First is the positives which is unit variety and semi realism in unit/vehicle tactics, The variety added with a WW2 game was pretty refreshing. I'm so used to seeing re-skinned tanks that work nay the same as the enemies that jumping into this one i had to play around a bit to see what unit actual were good for. Sure they have similar one to one's like trucks and soldiers for the most part, but they also have a good list of unique country specific ones as well which added to the replay value. Units also not being a giant health bar was nice too because idk about other people but ive grown tired of the health bar sponges from games like the Warhammer series. Soldiers are the only exception in this game but it doesn't feel like it as soldiers die in three to four good hits. And vehicles work as they should requiring either a well thrown Molotov into the top of a troop carrier or some AP to take the buggers down.\n\n The downsides of this game though can shine through sometimes, first off is the balancing of the Skirmish mode. It's the multiplayer mode pretty much that has a few game-modes that i wont go into this review, But the balance is way off. Every match i've played against the AI and some players has devolved into tank/ artillery spam. It's bad enough trying to play the game well juggling roughly a hundred men and a handful a vehicles but add the brain dead AI in and all the sudden it's world of tanks lite. Dozens of fury's bulldozing over the hill against your well placed militia as they get mowed down by the ten's of dozen's might be tactical but ruins the idea of a well balanced roster. Unit caps would fix this and there might be a option but the UI is so bad it's hard to find the start button to begin with. \n\n Last thing ill add is that the campaign's although mostly easy are a nice touch especially being coop friendly. All and all id recommend this game too any hardcore RTS fan as i believe it to be the best out there. But be ready to tweak the Skirmish mode settings and hopefully drag a few bro's to play with you. A solid 8/10 for me just needs a better UI and unit caps for me.",

      "review": "Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is what happens when someone takes a WWII RTS and says:\n“Cool… now let’s give you full control of every single bullet.”\n\nThis isn’t Company of Heroes-style “macro with some cover”. This is hyper-detailed, squad-level warfare where you can:\n\nManually loot corpses for ammo and grenades\n\nDrag AT guns into position by hand\n\nTake direct control of a single soldier or tank and aim every shot yourself\n\nTurn a wrecked street into a kill zone with one well-placed MG and a couple of sandbags\n\nWhen it clicks, the game is pure tactical bliss.\nYou set up overlapping fields of fire, hide infantry behind a stone wall, ambush a tank with a single brave sapper, and watch entire enemy pushes evaporate because your plan actually worked.\n\nThe real strengths:\n\nSkirmish & co-op: This is where AS2 shines. Cooperative skirmishes against the AI are ridiculously fun – desperate, messy, cinematic in that unscripted way.\n\nDirect control: Being able to jump into a tank, manually aim HE rounds at infantry, then switch to AP and snipe enemy armor never gets old.\n\nPhysics & detail: Explosions matter, cover gets shredded, tanks lose tracks, and a single well-placed shell can change everything.\n\nBut it’s also absolutely not a casual game.\n\nThe downsides:\n\nThe UI and learning curve are harsh. There’s a lot of micro, a lot of hotkeys, and the game explains almost nothing.\n\nSome missions and skirmishes can feel like meat grinders – the AI just keeps coming, and if your lines collapse, they really collapse.\n\nThe progression/unlocks can feel grindy if you just want to jump in and play with all the toys.\n\nIn short:\n\nIf you want a relaxed RTS, Assault Squad 2 will probably just stress you out.\nBut if you enjoy painfully detailed tactics, improvising under pressure, and turning hopeless situations into heroic last stands through clever play and a few stolen Panzerfausts – this is one of the best WWII sandboxes out there.\n\nIt’s not pretty in a modern AAA sense, but the stories it generates on the battlefield? Those are unforgettable.",

Fulqrums \"control\" on the Gates workshop is restricting THEIR CONTENT FROM ANOTHER GAME. \"They have requested that all mods containing content from their games be removed from our workshops, this applies to Call to Arms and Call to Arms - Gates of Hell. Specifically, Fulqrum owns Men of War branding, missions and assets. They are in the right to enforce this request.\" \n\nWhy are we upset they want to keep the content they made for their game? I wouldnt be happy if someone was playing a story I put together for MY gamein someone elses. This isnt an attack on Gates of Hell, as some of you swear it is. It is a dev group not wanting there assets used in another game. Plus seriously, it isnt like they are wanting over 50% of the mods gone. Everyone review bombing a game, just because a dev group is wanting to protect their assets (even if they are from 2014) are genuienly sad, sad people. They are copywriting their own assets and their own creative works. \n\nThank you for reading",

Overall I think this is a great game that kills your boredom and loneliness when you have no friends to play with because your own friends ignore your calls and you have nothing to do but sit in your room in silence and watch your little virtual men die for no cause and you command them to charge just to win but in the end you ask your self what is the purpose.",
