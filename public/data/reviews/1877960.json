It made me fuck up my sleep schedule every single day because I kept waiting for a speedminer upgrade so I get more Metal overnight.

When I have it running, I'm alt tabbing every 30 seconds and trying to be efficient, I can't even focus on anything else despite it being idle. As I said, I've barely had it, but it's eating up so much of my time already I feel like a heroin addict and have to put it down early.

I've barely had it a week and I've only made it to Zone 33 at my highest, but I can already tell that I have to quit. It made me fuck up my sleep schedule every single day because I kept waiting for a speedminer upgrade so I get more Metal overnight. I wake up and instantly check it and spend way too much time on it when I have other shit to do. Every single portal I feel obligated to spend an hour or two micromanaging so I can get to the point where AFK-ing even makes sense, so to me it isn't even that idle. When I have it running, I'm alt tabbing every 30 seconds and trying to be efficient, I can't even focus on anything else despite it being idle. As I said, I've barely had it, but it's eating up so much of my time already I feel like a heroin addict and have to put it down early. None of these are faults with the game itself and it's why I'm not slapping a negative review, but if you're someone prone to get addicted to something like this, just don't even touch it.",

Just save, close the program, play for 5 minutes when you get home. Even when you portal and reset your run, it only takes about 5 minutes to get to the point where you can be full idle again. After a couple of days, you unlock something that automatically expands your storage when you're offline, so there's not even a reason to log on every 20 minutes. Truly as great idle game for someone like me that has a need to constantly log back on to do things. It eliminates this drive for me.\n\nThat being said, this is entirely text based. If you like seeing animations and cool models and stuff, there is none of that here. The gameplay loop is pretty simple. But, if you're like me and you just like to see numbers going up over time, this is for you.",

There are times where it gets boring, like when you get to the point when you need to run the same helium challenge about a dozen times. The features you unlock along the way mostly make up for this (z181< spoilers ahead) [spoiler] especially map at zone, autostructure, and autojobs. [/spoiler] \nThe UI is obviously outdated and there is no music or sound effects to my knowledge, but that's part of the charm. Learn to code and mod it for all I care. You don't need a dripfeed of dopamine for every game on the market, it's free and came out before 2015. Plus it's open source. \n\nMasterpiece. Will likely play for another 2k hours and then never play it again.\n\nEdit 2k hours later: Still playing. No end in sight. Must feed scruffy.",
