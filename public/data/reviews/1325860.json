Легко импортировать свои 2D модели (Live2D) и настраивать их под себя, а отслеживание лица (face tracking) работает на удивление хорошо, даже с обычной веб-камерой. Понравилось большое количество настроек, которые позволяют кастомизировать практически все – от чувствительности отслеживания до горячих клавиш. Есть даже возможность добавлять анимации и интерактивные элементы, что делает контент более живым и интересным. Единственный небольшой минус – для полного раскрытия функционала, возможно, придется приобрести лицензию, но стоит своих денег, если вы серьезно относитесь к VTubing.

Face tracking? Flawless. Blink once, she blinks. Sneeze? She explodes into ahegao particles (thanks, custom expressions). Lip-sync hits like autotune on steroids—mumble \"uwu\" and she purrs it back in 60FPS glory.\nHotkeys = godsend: Press F for emergency \"brb pooping\" overlay, or spam Spacebar to make her twerk through donation alerts. Steam Workshop physics? Boing-boing heaven—my model's chest defies gravity harder than my GPA. iPhone FaceID tracking works from the toilet (yes, I tested). Android? Free app, zero excuses for ugly rigs.\nPros: Live2D cubism integration smoother than your mom's alimony, Steam Overlay for mid-stream memes, dev updates faster than my caffeine crashes. Cons: Calibration takes 5 mins (cry about it), and if your mic sucks, she’ll mouth-breathe like Darth Vader on helium.\nSpent 300+ hours making my gremlin OC dab on haters—now she has more subs than my OnlyFans (it’s SFW, calm down). If you’ve ever wanted a digital girlfriend who never ghosts but WILL call you a degenerate, BUY IT. Zero regrets, infinite emotes. Highly Recommended! 🎤✨",

'Nuff said.\n\n...Well, it probably doesn't have to be, but it's interesting that plenty of included characters look like they should be featured in a manga. However, that's not going to be the focus of this review.\n\nVTube Studio by itself is free software, although you could pay for some models and the multiplayer collab DLC, but it's not really necessary. Also, if you don't mind cropping or using special OBS plugins, you can totally remove that watermark for free... 😏\n\nThe base software is actually pretty robust OOTB. You have a myriad of options to customize sensitivity, webcam, model positioning, and more. There's even the ability to add your own models, if you so desire. One drawback I can see is that they all have to be 2D, meaning it uses a series of images and simple animations instead of true 3D models. However, that could be seen as a benefit, because it would run better on lower-end hardware than something like Animaze.\n\nI'm not sure why it is tagged \"Mature\" or \"NSFW\"; all I can assume is that it has the potential of using some lewd models, but from what I've seen, it doesn't have that by default, so it should be fine for those who want clean-ish streaming software to replace their face with some character of their choosing.",

The software is incredibly intuitive and easy to set up, even for beginners with no prior VTubing experience. I was amazed by how responsive the face tracking is, capturing even subtle facial movements with impressive precision. The ability to customize hotkeys for different expressions and animations makes streaming feel dynamic and engaging. One of my favorite features is the item system, which allows you to add PNG props that interact naturally with your model's movements. The cross-platform functionality is brilliant, letting me use my smartphone as a tracking device without any noticeable lag. The developer DenchiSoft clearly listens to community feedback and regularly updates the software with new features. For a free-to-play application, VTube Studio offers professional-grade quality that rivals paid alternatives. The optional watermark removal DLC is reasonably priced and well worth it for serious streamers. I highly recommend VTube Studio to anyone interested in Live2D VTubing, whether you're a hobbyist or a professional content creator.",

I use this on Linux as well, so if you're an up and coming and want to play on Linux, I can confirm it's possible. They've also recently added mocap features as well for the truly insane. My only wish is that it was available to download on itch.io as well so I didn't have to depend on Steam since using a bat file isn't an option. In any case, happy Vtubing!",
