The way matchmaking works, you can have a build that beats 99% of boards played by people of your same rank, and it will still frequently match you versus a board that shouldn't even exist. The devs are utterly clueless when it comes to balancing and ranked gameplay, and \"bad luck prevention\" mechanics are relatively lacking.\n\nAgain, it's a great game when you're a noob, and the game becomes drastically less fun when you're a top 1% player due to the over-reliance on RNG. Optimizing your board (min-maxing) should be rewarded, but the fights are instead determined by who happened to roll into the flavor of the month overpowered build, exacerbated by the devs' incompetence around balancing.",

Been playing this game for a good long while and I can confidently say that it's changed multiplayer games for the better.  I don't know if anybody did it first, but the asynchronous gameplay is still highly competitive, but with much lower stress.\n\nThis game has inspired many others in the genre and I can securely say that the original is worth a playthrough.  With The Bazaar launching at $40, but getting knocked down to $20, I'm definitely willing to claim that the consistent low price of this game is the reason.\n\nIf you like strategy games, buy it.  If you like creative gameplay, buy it.  If you like a shifting metagame, buy it.  If you like PvP, but don't like the time pressures, buy it.  If you like the many games that this little masterpiece inspired, buy this one.\n\nNominate for Steam Awards 2025.  Revolutionized the autobattler genre.",

      "review": "Game is fun in theory but the enjoyment ends when you realize that when playing ranked at higher trophy level runs you will always encounter cheat builds that were achieved using unlimited shop rolls.  Seeing these builds at a glance it's instantly obvious that these item combinations are statistically near-impossible to achieve legitimately, but they bypass detection because the player is using the \"correct\" amount of gold in their bag despite being able to continue rolling until they found the exact items they wanted.  \n\nExample of a fake build:  Ranger with Hammer build, just so happened to acquire 4 Strong Heroic potions, 4 Lucky Pigs buffing Hammer, 4 Spectral Daggers -- All being buffed by a Hero Longsword, Mega Clover with exact amount of Clovers packing bag for instant buffs, extra Mana Orbs & Snowballs to fill in the gaps, and of course the kicker to prove it's fake -- The treasure item Pumpkin (1 out of 23 treasures) which provides Stun to synergize perfectly with the build.\n\nSome might say \"get good\" or \"those builds just were lucky and had good economy\", but understanding the breadth of the item roll pool, how often certain rarities appear, the likelihood of finding the right items at the early/mid/late rounds, makes it clear that these are most likely 1 in 1 million builds that weren't acquired legitimately.\n\nWill no longer be playing this game unless Devs properly address the issue.",

      "review": "Game is mid, too many trash synergies that get absolutely eclipsed by the more op options. This game also reeks of Algorithmic rigging that other games in this genre suffer from, much like Super Auto Pets. Things like, getting matched against players who have a deeper round count than you, meaning they have been through the shop more times than you have so they by default beat you via access to more items and this can happen as early as round 1. The game is only okay but the rigging sucks a lot of the fun out of the game.",

It has cosmetics and a leaderboard, but you start out with all classes and all items unlocked from the beginning. It seems like it would be really easy to lock some items and all but the starter class, to make it feel meaningful to play instead of being a trophy grind with a few useless cosmetics. I really just dont see myself putting any more time into this until there is some reward other than getting a better leaderboard position.",

Half the time you can't find bags to put your items in and end up with multiple item in storage or you skip over important key items because RNG is so bad.  RNG more bad and than good on average for me.  Game could be so good if you had more control over making build you want to try but if you try to do a build good luck because you wont find the things you want unless you play 10 games in a row trying.  Can't recommend a luck based game like this.",
