      "review": "3/5 Stars\n\nThis game is brilliant considering the size and effort put into work. \n\nThe graphics aren't so bad actually as far as environment goes.\nThe game itself really drags you in and it is definitely something you play to keep your mind occupied. I also feel like it will teach you to pay attention to small details and remember routine situations when it comes to actual work involving cars.\nI heard this one ranked highest on the charts in the list as far as the \"series\" goes, which is why I went with this one and not 2025.\n\nThe bad.\n\nIt is extremely repetitive but to counter that, there are options to do many other things if not the story, normal orders, auctions, or even building your own car as long as you purchased a body from a yard, barn, auction, or a dealer (auto salon).\n\nOnce you've played for hours on end, you realize that the parts are relatively simple. Not a whole lot going on.\n\nSome parts that would be commonly know to be upgraded for performance, just aren't there. Such as, brake pads, suspension parts, and the newer cars which I believe the latest model they have so far I have seen without any DLC, is 2016, have no body options other than stock. (Body kits would rock!!!)\n\nAll this and no car show!? No competition to compete with AI or even friends to see who has the best performance, or look, or originality, etc.?? This would be an amazing feature!!!\n\nThe race track has no competitors. The speed track sometimes just isn't long enough when you're trying to reach a fully maxed out performance car to top speed which one replicated the 2013-14 Camero. \n\nRunning into things doesn't damage the car but I am okay with this because the driving mechanics are really lacking when it comes to steering and handling!\n\nYou are the only one in the game. No other NPCs or anything around. Other than the occasional random empty car that passes by the shop.\n\nYou can't simply purchase a \"body\" frame to completely build a car from scratch from the store (in game online store) to start a new project. You MUST buy them from the junk yard, or barn or other places physically, and dismantle the entire thing. ALLOW BODY FRAME PURCHASES please =)\n\nI realize you are regional to your own country. We do have a huge gamer populous in the USA and we use STANDARD measurements here. Imperial. Most of us grew up with MPH instead of the world wide used KPH. Would be nice to have the option to switch between both instead of having to google calculate.\n\nA huge judgment on any game, hours into play and many attempts, where I am lost and have to use google as a tool to help understand how to locate or use something within a game, it takes away from the games reliability. I have had to use it 4 times so far. \n\nThere is no story progression bar, and sometimes the story orders just stop. So you do your own thing without knowing that the story continues based on your level (I assume) and suddenly you're bored enough to go do a couple of normal orders and POOF there is a story order on the list. No notification or anything.\n\nA welder doesn't fix rust spots. A sander does. Add that to the body shop. \n\nAlso, add an option to paint specific parts certain colors instead of one color or pattern to the entire car. If I want a red bumper and a black body, I should be able to paint it as such.\n\nAlthough that is a lot of \"complaint\" or critique, this game is actually worth the buck, maybe at $20 USD.\n\nI can't stop playing, if that tells you anything. I am a completionist, and I intend to own every car if I am allowed to, maxed out.\n\nThis definitely is a win for simulators.\n\nEXTRA NOTE: I am a mechanic by trade. A lot of things aren't going to click for you if you are a mechanic and most of this stuff is NOT going to teach you about the explicit details of how it is really done. HOWEVER... you will learn a lot from this about the basics and what the parts are for and where they typically go.\n\n(We all know oil pans don't only have 4 bolts... and lug nuts are a thing but not in this game as they are all bolts, which are used on older cars if anything, for example)\n\nAnyways, incredibly enjoyable! \n\nOh and don't panic when you enter into an AUCTION and your STEAM friends start bidding against you. That doesn't mean they own the game. Just makes you want to hurt your friends though when they unkowingly outbid you on a car XD",

But the fact is each of those features makes this game that much more relaxing. This isn't really a mechanic simulator, but a shop owner simulator. I spend my downtime at work wishing I was playing my save back home. Something about there being no quick time events makes this game super relaxing to play after work.",

HOWEVER you can install performance mods then upgrade them at a station for a performance increase.\n\nPersonally I am into fixing cars and a car guy so I'll leave this a 8/10.",

      "review": "🔧 CMS2021: The Sacred Rite of Wrenching\nA Review by Someone Who Has Murdered Real Cars but Found Redemption in Pixels\nLet me begin by saying: Car Mechanic Simulator 2021 is not a game. It is a miracle. A divine intervention. A sacred space where the mechanically unworthy (hi, it’s me) are reborn as grease-stained gods of restoration.\nIn real life, I’ve committed unspeakable acts against vehicles. I’ve ignored oil changes like they were spam emails. I’ve treated dashboard warning lights as polite suggestions. I once thought “timing belt” was a metaphor. But in CMS2021? I am The Chosen One. I wield socket wrenches with the precision of a surgeon and the flair of a Broadway dancer.\n🛠️ Gameplay:\nYou start humbly, with a garage that screams “aspiring serial killer of sedans.” But soon, you’re diagnosing engine problems, replacing brake pads, and whispering sweet nothings to carburetors. The game lets you earn tools, expand your shop, and eventually rescue rusted relics from barns, junkyards, and auctions—like a benevolent car whisperer who believes every chassis deserves a second chance.\nAnd the detail? Oh, the detail. You don’t just fix “the engine.” You fix the crankshaft, the pistons, the fuel filter, and that one bolt that’s always hiding behind the radiator like it owes you money. It’s so granular, I now believe I could perform open-heart surgery if the heart were a V8.\n🚫 No Violence, No Trauma, No Hate:\nThis game is a sanctuary. There are no guns. No explosions. No enemies. The only thing you destroy is rust—and even that feels like a gentle exfoliation. CMS2021 is the kind of game that says, “Hey, you’ve had a rough day. Want to rebuild a transmission and feel like a hero?” And I say, “Yes. Yes I do.”\n🐞 Glitches? Technical Issues?\nNone. Zero. Nada. This game runs smoother than a freshly waxed hood on a downhill slope. If there’s a hiccup, I assume it’s my fault for not spiritually aligning with the torque specs.\n🙏 A Personal Note to the Developers:\nI don’t know who you are, but I love you. You saw me—an automotive disaster—and said, “Let’s give this poor soul a chance.” You gave me a virtual garage, a dream, and the ability to identify a serpentine belt without crying. You didn’t just make a game. You made a redemption arc.\n🏁 Final Verdict:\nCar Mechanic Simulator 2021 is a masterpiece. It’s meditative, empowering, and weirdly emotional. It’s the only place where I can say, “I rebuilt a 1970s muscle car from the ground up,” and not be immediately arrested for fraud.\nIf you’ve ever wanted to feel competent, calm, and quietly heroic—without hurting anyone or being yelled at by a sentient AI—this is your game. CMS2021 doesn’t just simulate mechanics. It simulates grace.",

      "review": "As someone with virtually zero interest in cars and a commensurate level of knowledge about what makes them work, this game has taught me [i]a lot[/i] about automotive technology. When I accepted my first job in Career Mode, I didn't even know where to find the fuel pump I was supposed to switch out, and there were dozens of similar learning events in my first hour of playtime. And then suddenly I realized that I had come to understand the inner workings of a V8 engine, the most common types of undercarriages and suspensions, and a few more of the bullet points on my car's annual service report that tend to have those painfully high repair costs behind them. I would never dare to assume that I'm now qualified to service my car myself - the game is detailed, but certainly not [i]that[/i] detailed - but the educational journey I've had with this game is unlike any other simulator I've played so far, and I've collected quite a few of them over the years.\r\n\r\nAs for the game itself, I have very little to critique about it. I'm normally quick to install all sorts of QoL mods to iron out kinks I don't like, but the longer I played [i]CMS 2021[/i], the more I realized to my satisfaction that there are practically no kinks. Everything flows seamlessly into a well-crafted whole, the various minigames are simple, yet surprisingly enjoyable even after the 1000th repetition, there's a constant sense of progression, and the process of disassembling and reassembling cars and engines from start to finish is designed in a way that even a complete car noob like me can work it out in no time (just don't start off with a contemporary Jaguar or Aston Martin engine; those things must be any service technician's worst nightmare in real life).\r\n\r\nThe only real issue the game has is frequent, unpredictable crashes, or rather freezes. They happen often and during almost any type of assembly work, and with the game autosaving only when you finish a job, sell a car or switch locations, this can easily lose you an hour of progress. Fortunately you can save manually at almost any time, so this issue can be worked around without too much hassle, and the game boots up so quickly (about 15 seconds from desktop to loading the save file) that the annoyance of a crash is bearable when it happens, assuming your last manual save wasn't too long ago.\r\n\r\nTo wrap it up, [i]CMS 2021[/i] is perfect for anyone looking for something that provides a constant feeling of performing rewarding work. You can play as a commercial car mechanic, accepting randomly generated repair jobs for crappy pay, or you can engage in the real meat of the game: salvaging wrecks from the junkyard or barn sales and restoring them to their full glory. This is by far my favorite activity, and the satisfaction of admiring a beautiful oldtimer or classic muscle car that I, personally, have given a second lease on life, just never gets old. You can then take the car for a spin on the race track, sell it to finance more restoration projects, or stash them in your personal parking garage to have fun with later. Regardless of your choice, the game will always have something enjoyable for you to do, and that's exactly what a simulator game should be doing.",

I wanted to maximise immersion so for the first hour of the game, before even starting, I attempted to make the radio play live stations like the ETS 2 one does.\r\n\r\nI failed, miserably. So I sacrificed immersion for convenience and just started playing it from the browser in the background, so I just had RMF POPLISTA going while I was doing repairs. \r\n\r\nThe clients were absolute dipshits, and taking on their orders filled me with a slowly bottling rage, which would find itself at times bursting when I would make a mistake. This would cause me to string expletives in Polish harder than a counter strike player, leading to me receiving a formal noise complaint.\r\n\r\nOther than that the game is very peaceful and relaxing, and I feel great pleasure from when I'm tinkering with the cars and all the equipment in the garage, like the tire changer and the wheel balancer. The wheel balancer kinda reminds me of lockpicking minigames in KCD and I think that's quite fun.\r\n\r\nOverall, I give the experience a 10/10.",
