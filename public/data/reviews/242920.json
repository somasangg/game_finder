Just when you think you're in the clear a new problem sneaks up on you. That push and pull of balancing how much food you have with your tool production and your supply of firewood is tricky but rewarding when you nail it. This is sort of a one-and-done game for me though. I don't think there's nearly enough variety to make starting multiple saves worth it. I played one save for about sixteen hours but really after the first eight it felt like everything was already done, I could keep growing after that but it was just a matter of building more of what I already had and the same problems kept cycling around instead of anything new to catch me off guard.\n\nI don't know if I just got lucky but I hardly ever had any real issues; one disease cropped up but was immediately squashed because I already had a hospital built, only two harvests were infested with pests over the course of about sixty years which is almost none at all, and I never had any insane shortages. That's not to say the game played itself but I feel like a lot of the challenge does just come from experiencing a problem for the first time and not being prepared, so if you are prepared, there's essentially no problem at all. I wish there was bigger goals to strive for but maybe that's beyond the scope of a small colony building indie game from over a decade ago. Some of this game was pretty new for its time and that deserves respect. I liked it, I think you should play it, but probably only once assuming you don't starve your people or freeze them to death in the first few hours.",

I honestly really wish there was a really good remake of this game expanding it more and higher graphics!!

If you are just looking to waste some time, build a little village with very little turmoil, and watch your population grow while managing food, basic resources, and trade, then Banished might be for you.
