      "review": "If you love late age of steam and steel naval history, and have studied the tactics, ships, etc. of that period, this will scratch a particular itch for you no other game ever will.  It has issues, sure, and doesn't 100% accurately reflect history, but that's fine.  It's a video game; not a history book or documentary.\r\n\r\nIt gives you that *feel* of designing these behemoths and their support ships, of finding the balance of speed, armor and firepower, etc.  It asks you to make decisions like, \"Is this ship worth refitting, or should I scrap it, for instance.  This kind of question often comes up at moments when a war is definitely coming, or even ongoing.  So even though it's going to have limited utility, that hull may actually still make a difference with just a few upgrades, or might get sunk the first time it encounters stiff resistance.\r\n\r\nThe whole game is about making those decisions constantly, and while the combat is actually pretty excellent for what it is, once you grasp the nature of naval combat of this era, you'll find that it's very, very frequently your ship's designs and your overarching, admiral-level decisions that bring about victory or defeat.\r\n\r\nDid you balance the trifecta of speed, defense, and offense effectively?  Did you research the right technologies?  Did you allot your resources in a way that let you keep up with the technology of the adversary you now have to face?  Should you have put some of those resources you used to build two giant battleships into maybe more destroyers and light cruisers to give yourself better sea control, or will your two monsters showing up let you devastate the enemy fleet to such an extent they justify that expenditure?\r\n\r\nThere are more detailed sims of this type, but none that feel this satisfying.  This is the only one that gives you that graphical, 3D image of a turret being blown nearly into orbit after a magazine detonation, or of just sitting and looking at this *thing* -- this floating war crime -- that you designed.  That also has the effect of making it feel legitimately painful when you see one sinking; it hits your pride to know that you spent the brainpower, time, and in-game resources to create this beast that is now simply gone.\r\n\r\nThe design process itself is immensely fun; the game's greatest asset.  Ship components are based off their respective navies' actual designs, but allow for so much rearrangement that you can really come up with some interesting what-ifs, like, \"What if the BIsmarcks had three triples instead of four twins?\"  It also tends to teach you that history created the ships it did for reasons.  There's a definite advantage, in the endgame, to the general configuration used for the Yamato and Iowa class; the classic, \"Fast Battleships,\" for instance.  That doesn't mean you have to use that configuration, though.  You can do something wild, and might be shocked at how well it works.  Want to use a battleship hull to build what amounts to a slow, heavily armored, 20-inch gun Monitor?  Nothing's stopping you except whether you've developed the tech.\r\n\r\nI'll probably end up with at least another thousand hours in this game before I hang it up for good, and still might find myself coming back to it for a quick jaunt from time to time long after that.  It's just that good at being what it is.  If you love this period of naval history, you can't go wrong here.",

      "review": "I wish voting was on a scale rather than the y/n that Steam provides, because then I would give it a 3/5. I bought this game for the ship builder which I found to be lacking and restrictive, but kept playing it for the campaign. \n\n[b] TLDR: If you want a shipbuilder, [u]skip this one[/u], but if you want a cool campaign then it's fine (though you should probably use a modded version of the game to fix the AI's poor balancing) [/b]\n\nIt's worth mentioning that I have also only played the game with the \"Dreadnoughts Improvement Project\" mod as I was told to steer away from Vanilla due to it's ineffective AI, so all of my opinions are with that in mind. \n\nLet's start with the pros:\n- I've found the campaigns pretty fun, it feels like a naval version of Empire at War. It's worth mentioning that it's only worth playing at the hardest difficulty or else the AI will struggle to replace losses in battle. But the actual battles are really fun and so is managing all your fleets and ships on the map mode. I have heard that the AI is even worse in Vanilla but I haven't played with Vanilla\n- Battles on the Tactical level level are really fun, I like seeing my ships shoot things and when you actually concentrate a ton of battleships into a line formation against the enemy it is super satisfying \n- The game can be played over a 60 year span (1890-1950) and actually features playable nations like the Qing Dynasty (which is always ignored in most games like this)\n\nAnd now for the cons:\n- When it comes to the ship builder, I was disappointed. It's very restrictive and forces you to a few different hulls with specific snap points and doesn't like to let you go unconventional. The trailer is misleading. You can't really freely choose the exact shape of the hull and max displacement is tied with length when it should be a combination of length/width/beam. Nevertheless, there are a surprisingly large amount of different hulls with more than a few uniquely designed for specific nations and their building styles of the time. \n- The ship designer feels really clunky, sort of like some of the early Sprocket versions except Sprocket actually got way better and became what all of these in depth sandboxes should strive to be. If this game could follow a similar path it could become much better, but that seems unlikely due to drama with the production team. Currently, the designer almost feels like a chore to work with, I don't really have fun due to how it restricts my creativity and it still takes me an exhaustively long time to design vessels\n- There really needs to be a way to export my designs from the campaign to the shared designs, I want to be able to see my ships in use by AI nations during other campaigns but don't want to spend hours essentially reconstructing all of my ships a second time in the designer\n- This is a minor gripe but the map view cuts at the center of the Pacific. While this isn't game-breaking, ships can still teleport across the gap from the left side of the map to the right, but it's definitely very irritating and distracting. An infinitely scrollable map like in HOI4 would've been much better\n- A multiplayer mode is sold seperately as a DLC. I wasn't planning on playing with multiplayer but that alone feels scummy and held me off from purchasing the game for a long while because I didn't like where the morals of the studio were at.\n- The game has good bones and a lot of the major work has already been put in place. It has potential to be really good, but I doubt that the production team will put more effort into it, especially with them announcing a 'last update' already. We will likely have to rely on modders to make the game better.",

It's a video game; not a history book or documentary.\r\n\r\nIt gives you that *feel* of designing these behemoths and their support ships, of finding the balance of speed, armor and firepower, etc.  It asks you to make decisions like, \"Is this ship worth refitting, or should I scrap it, for instance.  This kind of question often comes up at moments when a war is definitely coming, or even ongoing.  So even though it's going to have limited utility, that hull may actually still make a difference with just a few upgrades, or might get sunk the first time it encounters stiff resistance.\r\n\r\nThe whole game is about making those decisions constantly, and while the combat is actually pretty excellent for what it is, once you grasp the nature of naval combat of this era, you'll find that it's very, very frequently your ship's designs and your overarching, admiral-level decisions that bring about victory or defeat.\r\n\r\nDid you balance the trifecta of speed, defense, and offense effectively?  Did you research the right technologies?  Did you allot your resources in a way that let you keep up with the technology of the adversary you now have to face?  Should you have put some of those resources you used to build two giant battleships into maybe more destroyers and light cruisers to give yourself better sea control, or will your two monsters showing up let you devastate the enemy fleet to such an extent they justify that expenditure?\r\n\r\nThere are more detailed sims of this type, but none that feel this satisfying.  This is the only one that gives you that graphical, 3D image of a turret being blown nearly into orbit after a magazine detonation, or of just sitting and looking at this *thing* -- this floating war crime -- that you designed.  That also has the effect of making it feel legitimately painful when you see one sinking; it hits your pride to know that you spent the brainpower, time, and in-game resources to create this beast that is now simply gone.\r\n\r\nThe design process itself is immensely fun; the game's greatest asset.  Ship components are based off their respective navies' actual designs, but allow for so much rearrangement that you can really come up with some interesting what-ifs, like, \"What if the BIsmarcks had three triples instead of four twins?\"  It also tends to teach you that history created the ships it did for reasons.  There's a definite advantage, in the endgame, to the general configuration used for the Yamato and Iowa class; the classic, \"Fast Battleships,\" for instance.  That doesn't mean you have to use that configuration, though.  You can do something wild, and might be shocked at how well it works.  Want to use a battleship hull to build what amounts to a slow, heavily armored, 20-inch gun Monitor?  Nothing's stopping you except whether you've developed the tech.\r\n\r\nI'll probably end up with at least another thousand hours in this game before I hang it up for good, and still might find myself coming back to it for a quick jaunt from time to time long after that.  It's just that good at being what it is.  If you love this period of naval history, you can't go wrong here.",

      "review": "I wish voting was on a scale rather than the y/n that Steam provides, because then I would give it a 3/5. I bought this game for the ship builder which I found to be lacking and restrictive, but kept playing it for the campaign. \n\n[b] TLDR: If you want a shipbuilder, [u]skip this one[/u], but if you want a cool campaign then it's fine (though you should probably use a modded version of the game to fix the AI's poor balancing) [/b]\n\nIt's worth mentioning that I have also only played the game with the \"Dreadnoughts Improvement Project\" mod as I was told to steer away from Vanilla due to it's ineffective AI, so all of my opinions are with that in mind. \n\nLet's start with the pros:\n- I've found the campaigns pretty fun, it feels like a naval version of Empire at War. It's worth mentioning that it's only worth playing at the hardest difficulty or else the AI will struggle to replace losses in battle. But the actual battles are really fun and so is managing all your fleets and ships on the map mode. I have heard that the AI is even worse in Vanilla but I haven't played with Vanilla\n- Battles on the Tactical level level are really fun, I like seeing my ships shoot things and when you actually concentrate a ton of battleships into a line formation against the enemy it is super satisfying \n- The game can be played over a 60 year span (1890-1950) and actually features playable nations like the Qing Dynasty (which is always ignored in most games like this)\n\nAnd now for the cons:\n- When it comes to the ship builder, I was disappointed. It's very restrictive and forces you to a few different hulls with specific snap points and doesn't like to let you go unconventional. The trailer is misleading. You can't really freely choose the exact shape of the hull and max displacement is tied with length when it should be a combination of length/width/beam. Nevertheless, there are a surprisingly large amount of different hulls with more than a few uniquely designed for specific nations and their building styles of the time. \n- The ship designer feels really clunky, sort of like some of the early Sprocket versions except Sprocket actually got way better and became what all of these in depth sandboxes should strive to be. If this game could follow a similar path it could become much better, but that seems unlikely due to drama with the production team. Currently, the designer almost feels like a chore to work with, I don't really have fun due to how it restricts my creativity and it still takes me an exhaustively long time to design vessels\n- There really needs to be a way to export my designs from the campaign to the shared designs, I want to be able to see my ships in use by AI nations during other campaigns but don't want to spend hours essentially reconstructing all of my ships a second time in the designer\n- This is a minor gripe but the map view cuts at the center of the Pacific. While this isn't game-breaking, ships can still teleport across the gap from the left side of the map to the right, but it's definitely very irritating and distracting. An infinitely scrollable map like in HOI4 would've been much better\n- A multiplayer mode is sold seperately as a DLC. I wasn't planning on playing with multiplayer but that alone feels scummy and held me off from purchasing the game for a long while because I didn't like where the morals of the studio were at.\n- The game has good bones and a lot of the major work has already been put in place. It has potential to be really good, but I doubt that the production team will put more effort into it, especially with them announcing a 'last update' already. We will likely have to rely on modders to make the game better.",

TRUST ME, IT'S WORTH IT!\r\n-make at least one alliance that's not in your home region (europe, america, asia), you can use their ports to resupply and repair, and they can use yours too.\r\n-try and take at least one canal quickly (suez, kiel, panama, etc.). it gives you lots of much appreciated control late game\r\n\r\nthe campaign only last until DEC 1965, so have fun, and try to gain as much safe glory as you can.\r\n\r\noh, and when you complete a campaign, it deletes the save file for it.\r\n\r\ncustom battles is the main reason you buy this game, as you have access to everything, and can use parts from other nations if you turn on unlock: all",

      "review": "Overall it is a good game. The developers spent some time ensuring accurate  ballistic performance and for the most part the hulls and attachments are historically accurate. There are some issues with the game. Some USA hulls have strange boxes where the superstructure should be. This detracts from the historical feel for those who like to play USA. The second issue is the fleet commands in battle are a little wonky. To center on a  division of a fleet requires a double click but often it combines the fleet into a single unit which requires breaking the fleet into individual ships then reforming it by divisions. A laborious process. Also the player torpedoes seem rather stupid, frequently failing to launch but the AI's torpedoes seem to always launch and are fired by Davy Crocket. In battle unless you hugely outnumber the AI fight you own battles. The AI auto resolve tends to break even or favor the AI. Most experienced players know to fight your own battles but that is the fun of the game anyway.  The ability to build warships is broken. Ship repairs in Puerto Rico count against you ship building tonnage which should be based on continental USA ports. This results in heavy penalties if you exceed the building limit. This SUCKS as ship repairs are auto completed in port and sometimes the ships are auto removed from the fleet and placed in a port. Also, sometimes I need that tonnage for an invasion but now I am short. The most aggravating issue is the AI pulling the players ships out of port on missions during war. That carefully  crafted exactly 100K ton fleet I need for an invasion is now 75K tons and when the ships come back, they typically need repairs so the IA takes other undamaged ships next turn. Now my 100K ton fleet is down to 50K tones and inadequate for the invasion I had planned.  This makes the game more active but overall really SUCKS.. I wish they would add a toggle to turn this off. Theoretically you can change the ships status in port to prevent this but most of the time the AI pulls the ships before the player has a chance to change the ships status. \r\n\r\nOverall this is a god game but needs some tweaks to be a great game. I started playing with beta and the devs did a good job, showed they really tried to get things right. But, they just stopped short of that finale polish to put the game over the top.",

Beyond that, the core feature of the game, building your own dreadnought battleships, is just.... flat without reasons to do it. But the campaign itself is half an idea, and the weakest overall feature. Dreadnought Improvement Project (mod) improves this a bit, but the core is just too thin to build on. Battles beyond a certain size are just a slog. And after two or three campaigns you realize youre basically building the same ships over and over and over gain. Predreadnoughts get a 12\" battery till you hit 14\" mk 2s. 14\" belt is optimal till then. 5/6\" casemates. Triple expansion engines. Over and over. On and on. Every nation.

This also goes for the other 2 sliders, transport capacity (increases gdp) and crew training, minus assignable priorities. There isn't much depth.\nYour port capacity is increased solely by GDP. This means you cant expand ports of strategic importance (i.e. Pearl Harbour) any meaningful amount. It might expand by 20k tons over the course of 10 years, but by that time you've gone from ~40k ton dreadnoughts to ~80k ton modern battleships. Small ports end up being largely useless because of this.\n\nThe AI just isn't really a good opponent. Their CLs and DDs will have high top speeds and next to no armor while also building hundreds of them. Which they will then send directly towards you in swarms in the hopes of getting some torpedo hits (which they hardly do - and if they do, they dont do much) to then get mulched by your battle line. Rinse and repeat. Many many times my ships have ended an engagement with >90% structural/buoyancy while having decimated a multitude of enemy ships. I'm actually at greater risk of running out of ammo.\nAs for their capital ships, they'll end up designing 'modern' battleships with 4 different calibers of secondary guns, all more or less randomly generated. Same for barrel length. And even if they have access to Modern II armor (the best and lightest armor available) they will still often go for Krupp III instead. Or Coinc. II rangefinders (max being V). They'll also block off significant portions of their turret traverse with 2\" guns. Or use Mk.1 guns which have terrible rates of fire and even worse accuracy.. and then try to snipe with it.\n\nNow for the campaign. Submarines are implemented terribly. You can't go to actual battle, instead all of it being auto-resolve. So your battleship taskforce surrounded with 12 destroyers all equipped with the most powerful depth charges available, RDF, and state-of-the-art sonar and radar can end up losing your brand new superbattleship to 3 enemy submarines. And then there's minefields. Again you cant do anything about these so your new modern battleship can get their shit rocked by minefields despite your ships having amazing minesweeping capability. And then theres land wars.. which you cant control at all. You can be losing provinces while dominating the sea and theres nothing you can really do about it. Honestly i think the game should have just said that land wars are trench warfare (unlike real life) so the seas make the major difference - or give us control over the army.\nEngaging enemy taskforces is awful - you can plot an interception course to engage their fleets while being closer to the interception point than them (and with higher cruising speeds) and they'll somehow slip right by with no combat. You also have no control over minor allies. You can play as the USA and Canada can end up allying with Italy due to random chance. There's no way to influence this.\nThe type of government you have (for democracy, who's voted into office) also affects gameplay, but theres no way to change this.\nThe map also lacks the most basic of QoL. It doesn't wrap around at all, and it doesnt even teleport your camera to the other side at bare minimum.\n\nOverall the best way to describe the campaign (as someone else put it) is \"watching TV\". You can't influence much of anything so you're just sitting there watching what comes on.\n\nDon't buy unless some modder comes along and fixes the game. Except pirate it instead of giving money to the developers who released this (\"\"finished\"\") product.",

      "review": "Ultimate Admiral: Dreadnoughts is a game I genuinely want to love. There’s a deep, satisfying joy in designing ships, testing them in custom battles, and seeing your fleets go toe-to-toe with AI adversaries. The ship designer is complex, detailed, and rewarding, letting you tinker with hulls, turrets, armor, funnels, and weight distribution in ways that actually affect combat performance. For anyone who gets a thrill imagining themselves as a naval genius, this game scratches that itch beautifully.\n\nUnfortunately, the campaign that ties it all together never quite feels finished, even in its “final” release state. The economy is a constant uphill battle. Your budget — supposedly tied to your nation’s GDP — almost never grows in a meaningful way. In practice, progress depends on random events rather than strategic management. You’re constantly scraping by, running deficits just to stay competitive, and the game punishes you for it. Go bankrupt and you’ll get bailed out, but at the cost of your nation’s GDP and a scolding reminder that you did it wrong.\n\nMeanwhile, the AI seems to play by a completely different set of rules. It never suffers from budget problems, fielding massive fleets and advanced technologies well beyond its means. You’ll get notifications of rival admirals being fired for incompetence, but they’ll still be back next turn with a stronger navy. If you suffer the same fate, it’s game over. The AI can lose entire wars and governments, but as long as it still controls one port, it never truly loses.\n\nThe game’s endless barrage of random events doesn’t help. Most of them feel irrelevant or punishing — decisions that boil down to “how much money or prestige do you want to lose today?” Rarely do these choices benefit the player, and they break up the flow of gameplay without adding meaningful depth.\n\nDiplomacy is, bluntly, a joke. Trying to improve relations is like rolling dice in a smoky bar — the results are random, arbitrary, and often illogical. Sometimes nations warm up to you, sometimes they’re insulted by your generosity. Prestige — another meter you can lose the game from — constantly hangs over your head like a guillotine. The result is a diplomacy system that feels punitive rather than strategic.\n\nThen there’s the war itself. Despite being “the Admiral,” you have little actual control over the wars you fight. You can design the ships, but you can’t influence when, where, or how battles occur. Land combat happens off-screen with a progress bar, and naval bombardment — something you’d assume would matter — seems to have no effect at all. Even peace negotiations are bizarre: you might crush an enemy fleet, only for them to refuse to cede territory despite total defeat.\n\nThe campaign map adds its own frustrations. It scrolls like it’s dragging an anchor, with sluggish movement and awkward UI placement. Naval invasions are guesswork — you don’t know how much tonnage you need until it’s too late, and the camera’s “springy” edge behavior makes navigating the map a chore. The International Date Line splits the map in half, but instead of looping naturally, you have to scroll all the way around just to reach the other side. It’s tedious, clunky, and baffling.\n\nThe tutorials, while extensive, feel outdated and occasionally broken. Some missions can’t even be completed due to changes in stats and game mechanics since their creation. While learning to build and fight doesn’t require them, the tutorials’ neglected state reflects the same rough edges seen throughout the campaign.\n\nThere’s so much potential here. The ship designer and combat engine are genuinely impressive — few games capture the majesty and brutality of naval warfare this well. But the campaign layer meant to give all that context feels like it’s constantly working against you. Between the broken economy, rule-breaking AI, shallow diplomacy, and a UI that fights for your attention, Ultimate Admiral: Dreadnoughts feels like a brilliant prototype trapped in development hell.\n\nScore: 6/10 – A naval dream weighed down by its own bureaucracy.",

Also, the design process the AI uses when it comes to building the ships makes them vulnerable as well, making them prone to flash fires, ammo detonations or just really badly armored making the battle boring and not challenging. Overtime as the months go on in the campaign and you unlock \"the best of the best\", the battles don't feel very fulfilling.

Beyond that, the core feature of the game, building your own dreadnought battleships, is just.... flat without reasons to do it. But the campaign itself is half an idea, and the weakest overall feature. Dreadnought Improvement Project (mod) improves this a bit, but the core is just too thin to build on. Battles beyond a certain size are just a slog. And after two or three campaigns you realize youre basically building the same ships over and over and over gain. Predreadnoughts get a 12\" battery till you hit 14\" mk 2s. 14\" belt is optimal till then. 5/6\" casemates. Triple expansion engines. Over and over. On and on. Every nation. Till you hit the next set of techs and move forward to the dreadnoughts, and start building *them* along your standard template. The battles dont change they just space out. DDs and CAs lose fleet share to CLs with long range torpedoes. And  if you wanna break the design system, its super easy to do (just build BCs with like 10 quad torp launchers). \n\nBuy this game, and dream of what could have been with a deeper, more replayable campaign mechanic. This game was a casualty of COVID lockdowns and never recovered from, its weird way-too-early hype cycle, the dev's stubborn refusal to put the game on steam while the hype was hottest, and the stubborn resistance to building a campaign in favor of patching in new hulls and constantly having to redo their esoteric ship balancing.",

I really love this game, and it would've been amazing if it were ever finished, but I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone. It's playable, though pretty non-intuitive and frustrating. \n\nThe ship designer lacks the hull designer shown in all their advertising media, you can only place components on top of historical hulls to design your ships. Placing components anywhere but where the game wants you to is nigh impossible (though can be done with enough finagling), so most ships you make look exactly like the historical ship the hull was based on. The enemy AI does not have this problem, and comes up with all kinds of abominations for you to fight that rarely work effectively and are never as good as player designs. Enemy ships tend to be less accurate and less survivable than player designed ships, making ships that should be contemporaries or even better than what the player can make easy to dispatch. \n\nThe campaign mode is an amazing concept executed poorly. the whole political system makes no sense and always snowballs into global conflict that never ends. It's basically a game of constantly asskissing every other country you're not at war with so they all don't dogpile you. I do like how the army (that you have no control over because you're the head of the navy) fights on land automatically and can even capture provinces, but there is no way coordinate with them. Attacking enemy fleets on the map is very difficult unless they are blockading you and not moving, You have to either bring your ships out to blockade waterways using their circles of control and hope they sail into you (this is never really explained and only kinda works), or leave your fleets in port, set them to sea control on the fleet menu and hope the game generates the encounter you want (it never does). As of the last update, it made training more sailors more expensive and slower, making manpower the limiting factor of having a large fleet instead of money, industrial base, or port space. \n\nThe actual gameplay is OK. Sometimes escort ships using the auto escort functions run themselves head on into enemy fire and kill themselves, but this was something that they actually (mostly) fixed before abandoning the game. The visibility stats of player ships are always much higher than the enemy ships ( IDK if it's just how the AI designs their ships or if they get an artificial buff to their reconnisance), so the enemy always seems to spot you first. While realistic, it's very frustrating when the enemy has a ship that's either the same speed or faster than you and just runs away, making you have to wait for the end game timer to pop up. Without the time compression, battles take a very long time, and the closer you are to the enemy, the less time compression you can use. This means if you wind up chasing an enemy that has the same top speed, you have to either get lucky and score a hit that damages their propulsion (which is very unlikely because you're at top speed and the target is also moving fast), or you have to wait even longer for the end battle option to pop up. This happens more often than you would think, especially after you defeat a country's heavy units and they only have destroyers and torpedo boats left. The campaign continues to generate encounters where you can't catch them, but you can't skip because they'll destroy your merchant ships (which can lead to an economic death spiral).\n\nAll in all, this game is a missed opportunity. Its not even that far off from being good and done. There aren't a lot of games centered around the Dreadnaught Era of history, and this could've been a great one. While the modding scene definitely makes the game better and fixes a lot of the issues, as consumers we shouldn't be encouraging devs to abandoned projects 3/4s of the way through.",

      "review": "While the ship designer and combat are great, just about everything else isn't. The campaign is deeply flawed (want to improve relations with France? roll a dice lmao) and if you're not one of the larger countries with giant GDPs your naval budget will suffer if you want to stay competitive, all while other countries admirals are sacked for excessive naval expenditures every couple months.. and then continues to spend excessively. Meaning the AI isn't punished for this at all because a new admiral gets into office and does the exact same things. Its a lose condition for you, though.\n\nThere isnt much player agency. Aforementioned dice roll relations, and you can only *influence* the government on certain things. I.e. peace treaties. After sitting in your 20-hour campaign you finally get to war, they fold instantly and lose a couple BBs (because the AI sucks at building ships - ill get to that later), ask for peace, but you want a greater reward at the end so you want to fight on. Tough shit because their admiral 'intervened' and managed to get a peace treaty, meaning you only get some 300M$ as reparations. Woohoo. The justification being \"you're only the head of admiralty, not the government\" - which is just terrible justification?? I should have more control - games are meant to be fun and this isn't it.\nYour research department is controlled via a slider and assigning priorities. You can't tell them to make a Mk.III 16\" gun, they have to make a 20\" Mk.I first. This also goes for the other 2 sliders, transport capacity (increases gdp) and crew training, minus assignable priorities. There isn't much depth.\nYour port capacity is increased solely by GDP. This means you cant expand ports of strategic importance (i.e. Pearl Harbour) any meaningful amount. It might expand by 20k tons over the course of 10 years, but by that time you've gone from ~40k ton dreadnoughts to ~80k ton modern battleships. Small ports end up being largely useless because of this.\n\nThe AI just isn't really a good opponent. Their CLs and DDs will have high top speeds and next to no armor while also building hundreds of them. Which they will then send directly towards you in swarms in the hopes of getting some torpedo hits (which they hardly do - and if they do, they dont do much) to then get mulched by your battle line. Rinse and repeat. Many many times my ships have ended an engagement with >90% structural/buoyancy while having decimated a multitude of enemy ships. I'm actually at greater risk of running out of ammo.\nAs for their capital ships, they'll end up designing 'modern' battleships with 4 different calibers of secondary guns, all more or less randomly generated. Same for barrel length. And even if they have access to Modern II armor (the best and lightest armor available) they will still often go for Krupp III instead. Or Coinc. II rangefinders (max being V). They'll also block off significant portions of their turret traverse with 2\" guns. Or use Mk.1 guns which have terrible rates of fire and even worse accuracy.. and then try to snipe with it.\n\nNow for the campaign. Submarines are implemented terribly. You can't go to actual battle, instead all of it being auto-resolve. So your battleship taskforce surrounded with 12 destroyers all equipped with the most powerful depth charges available, RDF, and state-of-the-art sonar and radar can end up losing your brand new superbattleship to 3 enemy submarines. And then there's minefields. Again you cant do anything about these so your new modern battleship can get their shit rocked by minefields despite your ships having amazing minesweeping capability. And then theres land wars.. which you cant control at all. You can be losing provinces while dominating the sea and theres nothing you can really do about it. Honestly i think the game should have just said that land wars are trench warfare (unlike real life) so the seas make the major difference - or give us control over the army.\nEngaging enemy taskforces is awful - you can plot an interception course to engage their fleets while being closer to the interception point than them (and with higher cruising speeds) and they'll somehow slip right by with no combat. You also have no control over minor allies. You can play as the USA and Canada can end up allying with Italy due to random chance. There's no way to influence this.\nThe type of government you have (for democracy, who's voted into office) also affects gameplay, but theres no way to change this.\nThe map also lacks the most basic of QoL. It doesn't wrap around at all, and it doesnt even teleport your camera to the other side at bare minimum.\n\nOverall the best way to describe the campaign (as someone else put it) is \"watching TV\". You can't influence much of anything so you're just sitting there watching what comes on.\n\nDon't buy unless some modder comes along and fixes the game. Except pirate it instead of giving money to the developers who released this (\"\"finished\"\") product.",

      "review": "Ultimate Admiral: Dreadnoughts is a game I genuinely want to love. There’s a deep, satisfying joy in designing ships, testing them in custom battles, and seeing your fleets go toe-to-toe with AI adversaries. The ship designer is complex, detailed, and rewarding, letting you tinker with hulls, turrets, armor, funnels, and weight distribution in ways that actually affect combat performance. For anyone who gets a thrill imagining themselves as a naval genius, this game scratches that itch beautifully.\n\nUnfortunately, the campaign that ties it all together never quite feels finished, even in its “final” release state. The economy is a constant uphill battle. Your budget — supposedly tied to your nation’s GDP — almost never grows in a meaningful way. In practice, progress depends on random events rather than strategic management. You’re constantly scraping by, running deficits just to stay competitive, and the game punishes you for it. Go bankrupt and you’ll get bailed out, but at the cost of your nation’s GDP and a scolding reminder that you did it wrong.\n\nMeanwhile, the AI seems to play by a completely different set of rules. It never suffers from budget problems, fielding massive fleets and advanced technologies well beyond its means. You’ll get notifications of rival admirals being fired for incompetence, but they’ll still be back next turn with a stronger navy. If you suffer the same fate, it’s game over. The AI can lose entire wars and governments, but as long as it still controls one port, it never truly loses.\n\nThe game’s endless barrage of random events doesn’t help. Most of them feel irrelevant or punishing — decisions that boil down to “how much money or prestige do you want to lose today?” Rarely do these choices benefit the player, and they break up the flow of gameplay without adding meaningful depth.\n\nDiplomacy is, bluntly, a joke. Trying to improve relations is like rolling dice in a smoky bar — the results are random, arbitrary, and often illogical. Sometimes nations warm up to you, sometimes they’re insulted by your generosity. Prestige — another meter you can lose the game from — constantly hangs over your head like a guillotine. The result is a diplomacy system that feels punitive rather than strategic.\n\nThen there’s the war itself. Despite being “the Admiral,” you have little actual control over the wars you fight. You can design the ships, but you can’t influence when, where, or how battles occur. Land combat happens off-screen with a progress bar, and naval bombardment — something you’d assume would matter — seems to have no effect at all. Even peace negotiations are bizarre: you might crush an enemy fleet, only for them to refuse to cede territory despite total defeat.\n\nThe campaign map adds its own frustrations. It scrolls like it’s dragging an anchor, with sluggish movement and awkward UI placement. Naval invasions are guesswork — you don’t know how much tonnage you need until it’s too late, and the camera’s “springy” edge behavior makes navigating the map a chore. The International Date Line splits the map in half, but instead of looping naturally, you have to scroll all the way around just to reach the other side. It’s tedious, clunky, and baffling.\n\nThe tutorials, while extensive, feel outdated and occasionally broken. Some missions can’t even be completed due to changes in stats and game mechanics since their creation. While learning to build and fight doesn’t require them, the tutorials’ neglected state reflects the same rough edges seen throughout the campaign.\n\nThere’s so much potential here. The ship designer and combat engine are genuinely impressive — few games capture the majesty and brutality of naval warfare this well. But the campaign layer meant to give all that context feels like it’s constantly working against you. Between the broken economy, rule-breaking AI, shallow diplomacy, and a UI that fights for your attention, Ultimate Admiral: Dreadnoughts feels like a brilliant prototype trapped in development hell.\n\nScore: 6/10 – A naval dream weighed down by its own bureaucracy.",

Also, the design process the AI uses when it comes to building the ships makes them vulnerable as well, making them prone to flash fires, ammo detonations or just really badly armored making the battle boring and not challenging. Overtime as the months go on in the campaign and you unlock \"the best of the best\", the battles don't feel very fulfilling. Even when you face another nation that's close to your strength, you can decimate them pretty easily if they use poorly designed ships.\n\n\nThere are still some bugs in the game that I've seen, though they don't effect the game performance in any way, just some cosmetic quirks here and there.

Beyond that, the core feature of the game, building your own dreadnought battleships, is just.... flat without reasons to do it. But the campaign itself is half an idea, and the weakest overall feature. Dreadnought Improvement Project (mod) improves this a bit, but the core is just too thin to build on. Battles beyond a certain size are just a slog. And after two or three campaigns you realize youre basically building the same ships over and over and over gain. Predreadnoughts get a 12\" battery till you hit 14\" mk 2s. 14\" belt is optimal till then. 5/6\" casemates. Triple expansion engines. Over and over. On and on. Every nation. Till you hit the next set of techs and move forward to the dreadnoughts, and start building *them* along your standard template. The battles dont change they just space out.

I really love this game, and it would've been amazing if it were ever finished, but I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone. It's playable, though pretty non-intuitive and frustrating. \n\nThe ship designer lacks the hull designer shown in all their advertising media, you can only place components on top of historical hulls to design your ships. Placing components anywhere but where the game wants you to is nigh impossible (though can be done with enough finagling), so most ships you make look exactly like the historical ship the hull was based on. The enemy AI does not have this problem, and comes up with all kinds of abominations for you to fight that rarely work effectively and are never as good as player designs. Enemy ships tend to be less accurate and less survivable than player designed ships, making ships that should be contemporaries or even better than what the player can make easy to dispatch. \n\nThe campaign mode is an amazing concept executed poorly. the whole political system makes no sense and always snowballs into global conflict that never ends. It's basically a game of constantly asskissing every other country you're not at war with so they all don't dogpile you. I do like how the army (that you have no control over because you're the head of the navy) fights on land automatically and can even capture provinces, but there is no way coordinate with them. Attacking enemy fleets on the map is very difficult unless they are blockading you and not moving, You have to either bring your ships out to blockade waterways using their circles of control and hope they sail into you (this is never really explained and only kinda works), or leave your fleets in port, set them to sea control on the fleet menu and hope the game generates the encounter you want (it never does). As of the last update, it made training more sailors more expensive and slower, making manpower the limiting factor of having a large fleet instead of money, industrial base, or port space. \n\nThe actual gameplay is OK. Sometimes escort ships using the auto escort functions run themselves head on into enemy fire and kill themselves, but this was something that they actually (mostly) fixed before abandoning the game. The visibility stats of player ships are always much higher than the enemy ships ( IDK if it's just how the AI designs their ships or if they get an artificial buff to their reconnisance), so the enemy always seems to spot you first. While realistic, it's very frustrating when the enemy has a ship that's either the same speed or faster than you and just runs away, making you have to wait for the end game timer to pop up. Without the time compression, battles take a very long time, and the closer you are to the enemy, the less time compression you can use. This means if you wind up chasing an enemy that has the same top speed, you have to either get lucky and score a hit that damages their propulsion (which is very unlikely because you're at top speed and the target is also moving fast), or you have to wait even longer for the end battle option to pop up. This happens more often than you would think, especially after you defeat a country's heavy units and they only have destroyers and torpedo boats left. The campaign continues to generate encounters where you can't catch them, but you can't skip because they'll destroy your merchant ships (which can lead to an economic death spiral).\n\nAll in all, this game is a missed opportunity. Its not even that far off from being good and done. There aren't a lot of games centered around the Dreadnaught Era of history, and this could've been a great one. While the modding scene definitely makes the game better and fixes a lot of the issues, as consumers we shouldn't be encouraging devs to abandoned projects 3/4s of the way through.",

I would 100% get a refund if I could but I had just over double two hours(Steam's refund policy).  Please don't waste your money on this piece of ****.",

      "review": "While the ship designer and combat are great, just about everything else isn't. The campaign is deeply flawed (want to improve relations with France? roll a dice lmao) and if you're not one of the larger countries with giant GDPs your naval budget will suffer if you want to stay competitive, all while other countries admirals are sacked for excessive naval expenditures every couple months.. and then continues to spend excessively. Meaning the AI isn't punished for this at all because a new admiral gets into office and does the exact same things. Its a lose condition for you, though.\n\nThere isnt much player agency. Aforementioned dice roll relations, and you can only *influence* the government on certain things. I.e. peace treaties. After sitting in your 20-hour campaign you finally get to war, they fold instantly and lose a couple BBs (because the AI sucks at building ships - ill get to that later), ask for peace, but you want a greater reward at the end so you want to fight on. Tough shit because their admiral 'intervened' and managed to get a peace treaty, meaning you only get some 300M$ as reparations. Woohoo. The justification being \"you're only the head of admiralty, not the government\" - which is just terrible justification?? I should have more control - games are meant to be fun and this isn't it.\nYour research department is controlled via a slider and assigning priorities. You can't tell them to make a Mk.III 16\" gun, they have to make a 20\" Mk.I first. This also goes for the other 2 sliders, transport capacity (increases gdp) and crew training, minus assignable priorities. There isn't much depth.\nYour port capacity is increased solely by GDP. This means you cant expand ports of strategic importance (i.e. Pearl Harbour) any meaningful amount. It might expand by 20k tons over the course of 10 years, but by that time you've gone from ~40k ton dreadnoughts to ~80k ton modern battleships. Small ports end up being largely useless because of this.\n\nThe AI just isn't really a good opponent. Their CLs and DDs will have high top speeds and next to no armor while also building hundreds of them. Which they will then send directly towards you in swarms in the hopes of getting some torpedo hits (which they hardly do - and if they do, they dont do much) to then get mulched by your battle line. Rinse and repeat. Many many times my ships have ended an engagement with >90% structural/buoyancy while having decimated a multitude of enemy ships. I'm actually at greater risk of running out of ammo.\nAs for their capital ships, they'll end up designing 'modern' battleships with 4 different calibers of secondary guns, all more or less randomly generated. Same for barrel length. And even if they have access to Modern II armor (the best and lightest armor available) they will still often go for Krupp III instead. Or Coinc. II rangefinders (max being V). They'll also block off significant portions of their turret traverse with 2\" guns. Or use Mk.1 guns which have terrible rates of fire and even worse accuracy.. and then try to snipe with it.\n\nNow for the campaign. Submarines are implemented terribly. You can't go to actual battle, instead all of it being auto-resolve. So your battleship taskforce surrounded with 12 destroyers all equipped with the most powerful depth charges available, RDF, and state-of-the-art sonar and radar can end up losing your brand new superbattleship to 3 enemy submarines. And then there's minefields. Again you cant do anything about these so your new modern battleship can get their shit rocked by minefields despite your ships having amazing minesweeping capability. And then theres land wars.. which you cant control at all. You can be losing provinces while dominating the sea and theres nothing you can really do about it. Honestly i think the game should have just said that land wars are trench warfare (unlike real life) so the seas make the major difference - or give us control over the army.\nEngaging enemy taskforces is awful - you can plot an interception course to engage their fleets while being closer to the interception point than them (and with higher cruising speeds) and they'll somehow slip right by with no combat. You also have no control over minor allies. You can play as the USA and Canada can end up allying with Italy due to random chance. There's no way to influence this.\nThe type of government you have (for democracy, who's voted into office) also affects gameplay, but theres no way to change this.\nThe map also lacks the most basic of QoL. It doesn't wrap around at all, and it doesnt even teleport your camera to the other side at bare minimum.\n\nOverall the best way to describe the campaign (as someone else put it) is \"watching TV\". You can't influence much of anything so you're just sitting there watching what comes on.\n\nDon't buy unless some modder comes along and fixes the game. Except pirate it instead of giving money to the developers who released this (\"\"finished\"\") product.",
