In a similar vein i made a User.cfg to use only 2/3rds of my cpu cores and threads -this also reduces CPU heat.\nThe only problem I think without doing these 2 things is the high CPU heat when playing game.\nThe GPU does not seem to overheat at all.\nIf managed then the game is great.",

They couldn't really do anything about the terrible theme of the game, but they addressed a lot of things and the game plays quite well on the classic maps.\r\n\r\nThe following is relative to other battlefields.\r\n\r\n+General in game graphics. For once they didn't desaturate and make every environment as unpleasing to look at as possible. Before we take a wrecking ball to everything the maps look nice.\r\n+Gun play. The gunplay feels more like the far older battlefields except smoother. its actually more reliable and consistent. Your weapons don't feel quite so unpredictable like they do in the other more recent titles.\r\n\r\n-New Maps. The new maps are mostly terrible. Way to big and empty. They look nice, but play like garbage.\r\n-Vehicles. The vehicles are far to annoying in this title. There are way too many and the over sized maps grant them complete dominance.",

      "review": "Battlefield 2042 – Review\n\nAt launch, Battlefield 2042 arrived with ambition but stumbled under the weight of its own contradictions. Set in a near-future world ravaged by climate disasters and geopolitical collapse, the game promised a bold reimagining of the iconic franchise: dynamic weather systems, globe-spanning maps, 128-player battles (on supported platforms), and the removal of traditional classes in favor of the Specialist system.\n\nVisually, 2042 is stunning—maps like Orbital (French Guiana) and Discarded (Antarctica) showcase DICE’s mastery of scale and environmental storytelling. The Hazard Zone mode experimented with tactical extraction gameplay, while Portal offered fans a creative sandbox to relive moments from Battlefield 1942, Bad Company 2, and 3.\n\nHowever, the game launched with significant issues: minimal narrative context, a shallow Specialist system that felt more like reskinned loadouts than meaningful roles, and a glaring absence of features expected in a modern shooter—no campaign, no voice chat at launch, and limited AI support for squad play. Server instability and balancing problems further eroded player trust.\n\nOver the following years, EA and DICE committed to a “Season 0” reset, overhauling core mechanics, reintroducing class-like roles, and improving map design based on community feedback. By 2024, Battlefield 2042 had evolved into a more cohesive and enjoyable experience—but for many, the damage was done.\n\nVerdict: A technically impressive yet deeply flawed entry that struggled to honor its legacy. It’s a game that could have been great—but only became competent long after players had moved on. For die-hard fans willing to forgive its rocky start, 2042 now offers chaotic, large-scale warfare with moments of genuine brilliance. But it remains a cautionary tale about launching too soon and listening too late.\n\nScore: 6.5/10 – Flawed but redeemable.",

I like the 128 player count but I just wish the maps were slightly smaller it's more chaotic and fun. It's still a decent Battlefield game as the core mechanics and gameplays are there. Not a huge fan of specialists but just look at it as cosmetics and just focus on the classes. 8/10",

      "review": "Battlefield 2042 is a first-person shooter developed by DICE and released in 2021. Set in a near-future global conflict, it abandons the series’ historical and modern-war settings for a high-tech battlefield featuring advanced gadgets, dynamic weather, and massive player counts. It was designed to showcase next-generation scale and chaos but launched with significant issues that affected its reception.\n\nThe game features 128-player matches on large, open maps, emphasizing vehicle warfare and player freedom. Traditional classes were replaced by a new “Specialist” system, where each character has unique abilities and equipment. This shift aimed to encourage flexibility but diluted team roles, reducing the tactical coordination that defined earlier Battlefield titles.\n\nCore gunplay and movement feel fluid, with improved weapon handling and traversal mechanics. However, balance problems, inconsistent weapon tuning, and erratic hit registration plagued the launch. The map design, while visually impressive, often felt too large and empty, leading to disorganized gameplay and long travel times between engagements.\n\nGraphically, Battlefield 2042 demonstrates the full capability of the Frostbite engine. Massive storms, tornados, and destructible environments create dramatic visual moments. Weather systems and map-changing events deliver spectacle but sometimes interfere with gameplay clarity. Sound design and atmosphere remain strong, maintaining the immersive audio identity of the franchise.\n\nAt release, the game lacked a single-player campaign, focusing entirely on multiplayer modes: All-Out Warfare, Hazard Zone, and Portal. All-Out Warfare provides the classic large-scale experience; Hazard Zone blends extraction-style mechanics with tactical objectives; and Portal allows players to create custom matches using assets from Battlefield 1942, Bad Company 2, and Battlefield 3. Portal became a highlight due to its flexibility and nostalgia value.\n\nPerformance and stability were major concerns early on, with bugs, UI issues, and server instability dominating launch feedback. Over time, DICE released extensive patches that improved optimization, restored classic class structures, and overhauled maps to increase combat density. The post-launch updates gradually transformed the game into a more stable and coherent experience.\n\nIn summary, Battlefield 2042 began as an ambitious but uneven experiment that traded structure for scale. While its launch was rough, consistent updates have made it more enjoyable and closer to the series’ roots. It remains visually stunning and technically impressive, but its design choices divided fans. For players seeking large, chaotic, modern battles with evolving support, it has matured into a solid—if unconventional—entry in the Battlefield series.",

The early experience delivered unpredictable moments and ridiculous vehicle plays that everyone loved, even if it wasn’t polished.\n\nA few months later the patches toned things down. The vehicle changes removed a lot of that launch-era craziness, and while the gunplay was decent, it felt more arcade-like and less true to classic Battlefield roots. After that, I stepped away from the game for about a year.\n\nComing back right before BF6 released, the game was in a much better place. It felt more balanced, more stable, and surprisingly captured the Battlefield vibe well enough to hold me over until the next game dropped. Overall, Battlefield 2042 became a solid stepping stone for the series—rough start, but it eventually grew into a fun, respectable experience.",

It's complicated. I don't think it's terrible but it's... meh. Especially after experiencing the BF6 Open Beta, the drastic difference in quality is uncanny. \n\nThis game got so many things wrong and it's sad because in my personal opinion, this is the most interesting concept of a Battlefield game that isn't BF1. Sometimes the game is actually fun to play but most of the time, it feels like a slog. ESPECIALLY because most of the maps are awful. Most of the 64 player maps feel like it was made for 128 people, and the 128 people maps feel like 256 people maps. The maps are just WAY too big. And even if you do get to the enclosed maps like REDACTED (which is my favorite map on this game), the game turns into a glorified Call of Duty which isn't too much of an issue? The bigger issue is that this is a Battlefield game and for a Battlefield game, this is a disappointment.\n\nI can't in full confidence say that this game is worth your time and I feel like if it wasn't for the BF6 exclusive cosmetics, I would feel like I wasted my life which to an extent I did. I appreciate the effort on the devs trying to turn around this mess but the damage was already done. And I am glad they learned their mistakes with this and now BF6 is turning out to be really promising. Though with the new EA deal that happened with the Saudis... it might blow over. Might.\n\nBF2042 was 3 dollars though so it was kind of worth it.",
