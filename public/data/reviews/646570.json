If you put the time into learning Slay the Spire it will hook you like no other game and give you an extremely satisfying yet very difficult challenge. This game is not easy, and yet I think that it is one of the most amazing things about it. There are so many games that have very interesting and deep gameplay mechanics that go completely unused and unappreciated because the game is easy enough that players will never have to meaningfully interact with every system to succeed. This is not the case for slay the spire. In order to succeed at the highest level of difficulty in this game one must use every single advantage that the game offers you. None even CAN go ignored because if you do not leverage every single gameplay mechanic to defeat your enemies you will not get anywhere, excluding any instances of incredible luck.\n\nAll in all, this game is a 10/10, everyone knows this. It is also the best roguelike and the best deckbuilding game. I love you megacrit and I cannot wait for sts2!",

I knew this walking in however looking at this from a casual player perspective they will almost NEVER go past ascension 10 so if they do that on all 4 characters that's still 1 hundred maybe 2 hundred hours just to experience half the game. and once you hit higher ascensions you are forced to choosing 1 of like 3 decks on every character if you want to win consistently. \n\ni would still recommend this to anyone in a heartbeat (pun intended) fantastic game with a fun modding community and great devs",

I've played for over 50 hours and done dozens of runs with all characters, unlocked everything, and yet my win rate is around 20%, probably less. I've never gone above Ascension level 1, and there's 20 fucking difficulty levels. I can't even imagine what it's like at its hardest.\nAre you supposed to spend the majority of your time playing the game HOPING you get the perfect combo going, and if you don't, wallow in frustration over the past hour or so that you just wasted in the attempt? It's unfair as fuck.\n- It's simply far too reliant on RNG. RNG of the cards you get, RNG of the relics you get, RNG of the cards you draw, RNG of the enemies actions. RNG of the map layout and which enemies you fight. If it's not enough that runs can be ruined by just a couple of random effects, making mistakes when playing the cards feels that much more punishing. \n- The concept of Crowd Control does not exist in this game?!?! No character has any ability to freeze, stun, banish, nothing.\n- I'm not kidding about the difficulty, if you don't have VERY good RNG in your run, you're not even reaching the final boss which is again, ridiculous.\n- Graphics are laughably basic and downright ugly to the point where you'd think a kid could have drawn most of the art in this game. There's barely any animation anywhere.\n- Coming from other/older card games like Hearthstone, the visual and sound effects of the cards themselves are really light and underwhelming. Every single application of block sounds the same, every single \"strike\" card sounds the same, across all characters..\n- There's only 4 characters which is too low, and because of the very bad balance, you quickly discover the \"build variety\" is a lie since nothing but a very select few OP combos will get you the win.\n- After the first 15 or so hours the progression completely stops. You learn nothing new, you unlock nothing new, you've seen all the enemies in the game, and that's when you start the downward spiral of \"I could have finished if my RNG was a little bit better\", and eventually end up realizing the truth of this hideous RNG reliance far too late, like I did.\n- Losing in this game feels like shit. And you will do that a lot.\n- Single-player only.\n- Achievement hunting is atrocious. You're not getting half of these achievements without the blessings of Allah, Jesus and Buddha COMBINED.\n\nPraise be the following, however:\n- The music in this game is so fucking good, it's easily the most memorable and best thing about it hands down, greatly helped to push through some of the frustration.\n- Unlike Hearthstone & all the other major card games out there, there is no such thing as \"running out of cards\", you simply reshuffle your discard pile and start drawing again. The idea is fantastic and allows for some matches to last far longer and do much crazier stuff in them than you would otherwise.\n- The thematic feel of each of the 4 distinct characters is very well done.\n- The daily climb mode lets you see combinations of different characters and get some really broken combos.\n- Potato graphics means this can run on a potato PC.\n- 500 MB size, lmao.\n- Cheap.\n\nI've lost too much time chasing that godtier run where everything clicks together so well, forgetting that you're supposed to be able to have fun in a roguelike even if the RNG is not that much in your favor. That you can still beat a game with a bad to average build if you have enough skill. Here, that's simply impossible.\n\nEven within the card battler roguelike genre, I've played far, far better games that are either less frustrating in challenge by default and/or can be experienced in co-op which mitigates the RNG factor, such that if 1 player has bad deck/card draw, another player can help carry the run to some degree with their better RNG. \nLike Hellcard or Battle Bands.\nOverwhelmingly positive steam rating??? What the actual fuck???",

It seems to me that a lot has been changed, and all for the worst: the game was already difficult, now It's insane. You won't win any run, even at level 0, unless you absolutely always make the best (and only) choice at disposal: get a \"wrong\" card, and you'll be screwed; meet the wrong enemy, and you're done. I'm not even sure if most of the runs are winnable. The game is not a deck builder anymore, it has become a puzzle game for people that enjoy the grind of trying all the possible combinations for a run until you get the optimal. Usual deck builder strategies do not apply here, you just need to know EXACTLY what is the only viable choice in every situation. And I'm not exaggerating: if you just add a card that won't synergize perfectly with the cards and artifacts you'll get in the future, in the third act you'll loose because of that card. If you don't add one because you're not sure if it will synergize later, you're screwed. If you don't do enough combat encounters, you will not find the cards that are indispensable; if you don't take enough events you won't be able to remove enough cards and you will loose. Unless totally everything is perfect (and I mean everything: speaking of the ironclad, you need a lean deck, at least 4 energy, a way to weaken stronger enemies, a way to hit enemy groups, a very strong attack to kill bigger enemies, a way to obtain enormous amount of shield and of course a way to be able to use all of your tools at the right moment) you will loose even at level 0.\r\nTo summarize:  a deck builder that plays more like a puzzle game: unless you're a fan of the genre, it's not fun to play, just frustrating.",

I've never gone above Ascension level 1, and there's 20 fucking difficulty levels. I can't even imagine what it's like at its hardest.\nAre you supposed to spend the majority of your time playing the game HOPING you get the perfect combo going, and if you don't, wallow in frustration over the past hour or so that you just wasted in the attempt? It's unfair as fuck.\n- It's simply far too reliant on RNG. RNG of the cards you get, RNG of the relics you get, RNG of the cards you draw, RNG of the enemies actions. RNG of the map layout and which enemies you fight. If it's not enough that runs can be ruined by just a couple of random effects, making mistakes when playing the cards feels that much more punishing. \n- The concept of Crowd Control does not exist in this game?!?! No character has any ability to freeze, stun, banish, nothing.\n- I'm not kidding about the difficulty, if you don't have VERY good RNG in your run, you're not even reaching the final boss which is again, ridiculous.\n- Graphics are laughably basic and downright ugly to the point where you'd think a kid could have drawn most of the art in this game. There's barely any animation anywhere.\n- Coming from other/older card games like Hearthstone, the visual and sound effects of the cards themselves are really light and underwhelming. Every single application of block sounds the same, every single \"strike\" card sounds the same, across all characters..\n- There's only 4 characters which is too low, and because of the very bad balance, you quickly discover the \"build variety\" is a lie since nothing but a very select few OP combos will get you the win.\n- After the first 15 or so hours the progression completely stops. You learn nothing new, you unlock nothing new, you've seen all the enemies in the game, and that's when you start the downward spiral of \"I could have finished if my RNG was a little bit better\", and eventually end up realizing the truth of this hideous RNG reliance far too late, like I did.\n- Losing in this game feels like shit.

You're not getting half of these achievements without the blessings of Allah, Jesus and Buddha COMBINED.\n\nPraise be the following, however:\n- The music in this game is so fucking good, it's easily the most memorable and best thing about it hands down, greatly helped to push through some of the frustration.\n- Unlike Hearthstone & all the other major card games out there, there is no such thing as \"running out of cards\", you simply reshuffle your discard pile and start drawing again. The idea is fantastic and allows for some matches to last far longer and do much crazier stuff in them than you would otherwise.\n- The thematic feel of each of the 4 distinct characters is very well done.\n- The daily climb mode lets you see combinations of different characters and get some really broken combos.\n- Potato graphics means this can run on a potato PC.\n- 500 MB size, lmao.\n- Cheap.\n\nI've lost too much time chasing that godtier run where everything clicks together so well, forgetting that you're supposed to be able to have fun in a roguelike even if the RNG is not that much in your favor. That you can still beat a game with a bad to average build if you have enough skill. Here, that's simply impossible.\n\nEven within the card battler roguelike genre, I've played far, far better games that are either less frustrating in challenge by default and/or can be experienced in co-op which mitigates the RNG factor, such that if 1 player has bad deck/card draw, another player can help carry the run to some degree with their better RNG. \nLike Hellcard or Battle Bands.\nOverwhelmingly positive steam rating???

It seems to me that a lot has been changed, and all for the worst: the game was already difficult, now It's insane.

I'm not even sure if most of the runs are winnable. The game is not a deck builder anymore, it has become a puzzle game for people that enjoy the grind of trying all the possible combinations for a run until you get the optimal. Usual deck builder strategies do not apply here, you just need to know EXACTLY what is the only viable choice in every situation. And I'm not exaggerating: if you just add a card that won't synergize perfectly with the cards and artifacts you'll get in the future, in the third act you'll loose because of that card. If you don't add one because you're not sure if it will synergize later, you're screwed.

I understand that as a rouge like game there is a certain randomness to the cards you get. And I really enjoy rougelike putting hundreds of hours into the Binding of Isaac and nearly 100% the game. But I feel the randomness is a detriment, some card combos create incredible gameplay loops with a good deck build, and as someone who plays many deck builders enjoy, I really feel this game would fit better as a build a deck and play through. More so if you had different starting decks that fit certain playstyles of the character and then went to deck building. I really cuts my motivation when I get a really solid playstyle that I really like but will never get to experience again. I think because of the card and turn based system it feels much worse than getting a bad or silly build in other realtime rougelike games.\nAn additional gripe I have which could be a skill issue, that this game really feels like you have to replay the game to complete it, in Issac when you start the game you don't just beat the whole game but there are small victories at first and it rewards skillful play, with slay the spire I feel like I just need to throw a run in order to somewhat progress enough to get to a further tier of the game.

It's unfair as fuck.\n- It's simply far too reliant on RNG. RNG of the cards you get, RNG of the relics you get, RNG of the cards you draw, RNG of the enemies actions. RNG of the map layout and which enemies you fight. If it's not enough that runs can be ruined by just a couple of random effects, making mistakes when playing the cards feels that much more punishing. \n- The concept of Crowd Control does not exist in this game?!?! No character has any ability to freeze, stun, banish, nothing.\n- I'm not kidding about the difficulty, if you don't have VERY good RNG in your run, you're not even reaching the final boss which is again, ridiculous.\n- Graphics are laughably basic and downright ugly to the point where you'd think a kid could have drawn most of the art in this game. There's barely any animation anywhere.\n- Coming from other/older card games like Hearthstone, the visual and sound effects of the cards themselves are really light and underwhelming. Every single application of block sounds the same, every single \"strike\" card sounds the same, across all characters..\n- There's only 4 characters which is too low, and because of the very bad balance, you quickly discover the \"build variety\" is a lie since nothing but a very select few OP combos will get you the win.\n- After the first 15 or so hours the progression completely stops. You learn nothing new, you unlock nothing new, you've seen all the enemies in the game, and that's when you start the downward spiral of \"I could have finished if my RNG was a little bit better\", and eventually end up realizing the truth of this hideous RNG reliance far too late, like I did.\n- Losing in this game feels like shit.

The idea is fantastic and allows for some matches to last far longer and do much crazier stuff in them than you would otherwise.\n- The thematic feel of each of the 4 distinct characters is very well done.\n- The daily climb mode lets you see combinations of different characters and get some really broken combos.\n- Potato graphics means this can run on a potato PC.\n- 500 MB size, lmao.\n- Cheap.\n\nI've lost too much time chasing that godtier run where everything clicks together so well, forgetting that you're supposed to be able to have fun in a roguelike even if the RNG is not that much in your favor.

Here, that's simply impossible.\n\nEven within the card battler roguelike genre, I've played far, far better games that are either less frustrating in challenge by default and/or can be experienced in co-op which mitigates the RNG factor, such that if 1 player has bad deck/card draw, another player can help carry the run to some degree with their better RNG. \nLike Hellcard or Battle Bands.\nOverwhelmingly positive steam rating???

I understand that as a rouge like game there is a certain randomness to the cards you get. And I really enjoy rougelike putting hundreds of hours into the Binding of Isaac and nearly 100% the game. But I feel the randomness is a detriment, some card combos create incredible gameplay loops with a good deck build, and as someone who plays many deck builders enjoy, I really feel this game would fit better as a build a deck and play through. More so if you had different starting decks that fit certain playstyles of the character and then went to deck building. I really cuts my motivation when I get a really solid playstyle that I really like but will never get to experience again. I think because of the card and turn based system it feels much worse than getting a bad or silly build in other realtime rougelike games.\nAn additional gripe I have which could be a skill issue, that this game really feels like you have to replay the game to complete it, in Issac when you start the game you don't just beat the whole game but there are small victories at first and it rewards skillful play, with slay the spire I feel like I just need to throw a run in order to somewhat progress enough to get to a further tier of the game.

Just a slot machine with a few extra mechanics and no real payout. \n\nIf you're looking for an unrewarding yet engaging addiction that will eat your time endlessly then be my guest. \n\nIt's a new trend I'm noticing among indie devs to just feed a small variety of assets into an RNG and call it a game. \nHades, Enter the Gungeon, Tiny Rogues, Slay the Spire, Baltoro, etc. \n\nThey're just time traps.
