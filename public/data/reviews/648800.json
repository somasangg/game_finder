It also has a puzzle element too (nothing too difficult).\n\nPros:   Can be played at your own pace good technology progression.  Good value.\n\nCons:  Combat is average, shark annoying early on.  Pointless tech discoveries at the end.\n\nSolid 8.5 out of 10.",

I think the crafting and inventory management system is the best of any game and the fact that this was just a small team of college kids blows my mind. I got the game when it was in early early access and the team was so great about releasing content and updating everyone on the progress. This is the best example of how to handle an early access/crowd funded type of game imo. If I had to complain about anything, I'd say the combat system is a little basic, similar to the fighting in Minecraft but that is such a minor complaint.

The in-game mechanics are very easy to understand, so you won't get lost (ofc is you do get lost, go to the Raft Fandom wiki).\r\n\r\nMy final rating for the game would be around 8,5/10. -1 point for some in-game bugs and unexplainable things, -0.5 point for how difficult the achievements are (some), for example, I played the whole story and have killed 1 thing and I need to kill 50 of those things for the achievement...",

If you enjoy a survival game where you need to craft, obtain resources, purify water and catch or grow food you will like the game. \nThe progression in this game is really slow, it is exciting when you get new blueprints to unlock build something else and you can do some creative things with your raft. \n\nThe game does not hold your hand at all, you are kind of left to figure things out on your own and actually need to build things in order to progress the game, it does make it challenging at first but once you get the hang of it its pretty easy.\n\nThe game pretty much gives you the blue prints for things to progress in certain areas, but you need to pay attention and really loot the areas to make sure you dont actually miss anything. Some of the blue prints you dont even get until end game which is frustrating unless you plan to continue playing the game after the story. \n\nSome resources are very challenging to obtain, maybe even too difficult or infrequent.\n\nThe combat in this game is mid IMO, the hit markers seem way off when using melee weapons and the bow is laughable.\n\nWeapons and harvesting gear wears out pretty quick, early progression in the game makes it challenging when forced to have to replace gear frequently and you dont find really good stuff until end game but that also requires some of the hardest resources to come by. \n\nI think the game was decent. The game had a lot of opportunities where it could have improved on things but I did enjoy playing. If I was playing solo this would probably be a different review as I would have seen the content way too slow paced for my liking.",

We played this game when it first launched on Early Access, made it to the first chapter, and really enjoyed it. I believe we had about 30 hours at that point.\r\n\r\nFour years later, and much procrastination (not any fault of the game, just mine!), we picked the game up again. After about 30 hours, we've completed the entirety of the game from starting from scratch, and that is with some light modding and such.\r\n\r\n⏳ Playtime & Value\r\nStory Length: The story offered about 30 hours for us in our play style. This can be highly subjective because we're not the best players, but I think 30 is respectable.\r\n\r\nCasual Play: If you're playing more casually and like the building and casually drifting aimlessly, you can get an infinite amount of enjoyment out of this game.\r\n\r\n✅ Conclusion\r\nOverall, I believe this game's story is really worth the price and the enjoyment that my community and I got out of this. I think it's really worth picking up. If you haven't already played Raft, then what are you doing?\r\n\r\n🦈 Closing Note\r\nFor my closing notes: Bruce, I will find you in the sequel.",

It is enjoyably one of the best and unique mechanics I've not seen in a while where you can truly build as crazy as you want and even decorate to your heart's content!\n- The progression you feel from improving your build, your weapons/tools, and you means of self-sustaining are present and you feel them.\n- The combat is very simple though and makes it feel like that 'first survival game' experience for someone who's never played one before or with a partner/friend who hasn't so it gets very easy very quickly for someone more experienced.\n- The story is SUPER interesting to experience and uncover but I wished it leaned more into the darker side of what has happened from this or to be able to actually see it versus through the notes and audio logs.\n- The final boss was more challenging in the sense of annoyance than an actual challenge to fight, in my opinion.\n- It feels as though there is no endgame progression at all other than getting the final tiered weapons/tools and that is it which is very lackluster. The grind is there and will still be very fun to grind for completion but the materials needed to earn these endgame items feels like a last-minute thought or not enough to feel like it'd be worth attaining.\n\nOverall, a very fun ship-building, survival experience to have nonetheless! I do hope and would love to see more from this developer on their next game and would love to see a Raft 2 with all of this expanded on!",

    {
      "review": "I enjoyed the game more or less, an don't exactly regret having played it. That said, there are a number of complaints:\r\n1. The game suffers from Early Access Itis. Even though I played once the game was fully finished and released, the content at each stage of the game was so clearly disconnected that I could tell exactly when something was part of a later update rather than part of the original plan. The story beats progress like someone who keeps pulling forward at a stop light - a tiny movement follow by breaks. At worst I would call it incoherent and inconsistent.\r\n\r\n2. The game styles itself a \"survival crafter\" while actually being a low quality adventure game. Many of these titles suffer from the same problem: They introduce all kinds of survival and crafting mechanics and then trivialize them to the point that the most effective way to play the game is to ignore those mechanics. The Forest and Green Hell are other great examples of this.\r\nSome examples from Raft that exhibit this:\r\n- After setting up a basic set of farm plots and a couple solar water distillers, the survival aspect reaches an equilibrium between ease of use and effectiveness. Upgrading your food or water generation becomes an active detriment as it will produce effectively the same result while requiring more time and inputs from the player. Upgrading to the later grills or trying to automate your crop watering feels like a ease of use downgrade. Using the juicer or cooking pot is a huge trouble for basically no real worthwhile reward. You will never see a more effective (in terms of time, resources, and end result) setup than a few potato patches, a grill, and a couple of solar distillers.\r\n- Once you have an engine, most upgrades to your raft will no longer have a meaningful justification. Building the raft [i]should[/i] be the primary gameplay loop. This game is centered entirely around the player base. It [i]should[/i] be the case that you are incentivized to build and upgrade your raft to progress in the game. The only case I can see that this is true is the radar that lets you find islands, and the engines. The raft is then relegated to a place to eat and drink before your next story island expedition. \r\n- Meaningful upgrades come far too late in the game. The titanium upgrades are introduced so late in the game that the only reason to even consider building them is because you think the game will go on for another 20 hours or so. The only thing they offer is reduced resource usage from not using wood as fuel - at a point in the game where realistically the only thing you need wood for is vanity projects and fuel.\r\n\r\n3. Crafting is tedious and inconsistent. A water bottle never breaks. Bowls and glasses used in cooking are single use. Crafting a player upgrade in the form of a respirator gives you 10 minutes of usage before breaking - and requiring 6 different ingredients, 2 crafts, fuel(about 8), and 9 smelting operations [i]every time.[/i] Never mind the resource usage; this will take several minutes of scrambling around the raft opening chests and smelting seaweed. It's tedious. This is an example where an upgrade to the raft in the form of an air compressor to recharge the equipment would have a meaningful impact - upgrading the player's ability to explore.\r\nMost animal resources have exactly one use and one animal that provides them. \r\nSome lights provide light while others don't.\r\n\r\n4. The writing and voice acting are genuinely cringe inducing. The plot borders on incoherent and the characters have less motivation than a typical Disney villain. The notes are a shoe horned way to make the game feel like the players aren't alone - always a few steps behind the cast. This simultaneously ruins any isolation the player might have felt in a flooded world, while robbing the game of a perfect opportunity to have NPCs that justified building and expanding your raft. Lock story beat progression behind providing an NPC accommodations and the tools they need to fulfill their part of the story. \r\n\r\nThe short of it is that The Raft is a game that forgot it was a survival crafter. It takes nothing from the genre/format that actually makes the format interesting or engaging. It sabotages its own mechanics by making them too tedious to care about. It centers the entire game around the base and then provides almost no incentive to care about the base. \r\nI played through without most character upgrades because they were too tedious to replace after 10 minutes. I played through without using the juicer or cooking pot because the reward for doing so was worse than just eating 6 pineapples. I played through only using 3 total batteries because there were no mechanics that used them that were worth the trouble. No healing items. No ziplines. No tradepost usage.\r\nI spent a ton of time building unnecessary stuff on my raft for my own amusement, but the most effective way to spend those resources would have been making a 10x10 square and putting up armor plates on the edges. Instead, I spent about 30% of my play time fighting a tedious shark off and hoping I could get to him with a spear before he broke a piece of raft and required me to go hunt down plastic and wood to fix it.\r\n\r\nThere were enough parts that were fun, but the more I played the more frustrating the game became. The  ocean may be deep in this game, but the game itself is shallow as a puddle.",

      "review": "So, this was an okay experience with a friend for a bit. However, the entire experience all the while had this air of sluggishness.\n\nMy first and probably biggest gripe is just how slow progression is - Some people like that, I also like it sometimes as a big survival craft fan myself. Unfortunately, Raft is different in the aspect that it isn't just slow because It's a grind, It's slow because of how non-substantial the results from that grind feels.\n\nThe biggest contributor of this is how fragile all the tools are, and how fast your thirst/hunger goes down - It feels like for every 5 steps you take in the game, you take 4 steps back to recraft all your tools and feed yourself, and then you have no materials left and have to get more, and if you're lucky, in that tool/feed cycle you'll make some progress, but sometimes you don't. Even if you do, it typically isn't a lot before you have to craft and feed yourself again.\n\nYou can't seem to meaningfully automate any resources either until late game, and your main source of gathering items (islands and drifting materials) only show every once in awhile. So you literally have periods where you are doing nothing, slowly starving and wasting time you could be spending progressing.\n\nAnd the thing is - The content in the game is rather shallow in terms of recipes and generated areas, so I can get wanting to drip feed it in the form of a long grind (If It's intentional) but it just leaves you with a beta-feeling experience.\n\nIt's a drag, which is a shame because It does certain things right. The building is very cool and flexible as evident by the trailers, and there's lots of decoration items to find. When you do find a big island, it fulfills a sense of exploration. It's just extremely rough around the edges when it comes to the main aspect of the game - survival craft.",

The game mechanics for this are just too brutal and punishing for what amounts to a lot of janky gameplay and poor UI. The hit boxes for boars and sharks are WAY too small with a wooden spear. You can be stabbing them and missing even though you can visually see it hitting. Meanwhile, if you die, you LOSE 2/3rds of your inventory forever! And then there's a big bird which drops big rocks on your head which also have huge collision areas. It's practically impossible to shoot with a bow. It's nothing but frustrating.\r\nOn top of that, you have a thirst and hunger system which is extremely punishing. The thirst and hunger bars go down fast, and when you're at 25%, your *movement speed* also slows down by like 50%. When your thirst or hunger reaches 0, you start losing hitpoints until you die. This amounts to about 5-7 minutes of gameplay, not at all realistic.\r\nThe shark is super annoying as well. Every few minutes, he'll come munch on a section of your raft and you have to rush over and stab it three times with a spear to make him go away.\r\nThis game is ultimately about using game mechanics to punish the player, and it's just not at all \"fun\".

Towards morning, the waves got rough, and because of the water level, the raft started glitching, appearing and disappearing. Then a shark attacked; I hit it with a spear, but right as I landed the second hit, the entire raft just vanished into thin air. :D Encountering such a massive bug in a $20 game within the first 10 minutes is unacceptable. Aside from that, it looks fun, but it is absolutely not worth the full price. Unless it drops below $5, don't bother. You'll probably play for 10 hours max and quit anyway. Go look for other games. Also, if you don't have friends to play with, single player might not be worth it. It really isn't that fun solo, so think twice before buying.\n\nTürkçe:\nOyuna girer girmez ilk 10 dakikada salı kürekle bir adanın önüne çektim ve lootlamaya başladım. İlk oynayışımdı. Sabaha doğru dalgalar artınca, suyun yükselmesinden dolayı sal bir görünüp bir kaybolmaya, buga girmeye başladı. Üstüne bir de köpekbalığı geldi; mızrakla saldırdım, tam ikinciyi vurdum ki koca sal komple gitti, yok oldu. :D Böyle bir bug var ve oyun 20 dolar. Onun dışında oyun eğlenceli gibi duruyor ama ilk 10 dakikada böyle bir hata görünce bu fiyata 20 dolar çok fazla, kusura bakmayın. Fiyatı 5 doların altına düşmezse oyun değmez, zaten maksimum 10 saat oynar bırakırsınız. O yüzden başka oyunlara bakın.

      "review": "It’s confusing and weird for someone with over 230+ hours of playtime to give a thumbs down. The Early Access version was truly amazing, and playing with mods was even better.\n\nFor me, the gameplay was more challenging in terms of building than in survival. I made a large raft and ship-like raft before. It massive, and I broke my ankles more than fighting sharks and pufferfishes. The raft itself isn't very accommodating, but it's a lot of fun when you play with friends. The same goes for the exploration and the story.\n\nThis is precisely why I can't recommend this game at its current price. The core of the game is about finding new locations, eventually finding a place to stop drifting, and searching for other survivors. But the funny thing is, the characters we meet and the scattered notes/clues never gave me a feeling of satisfaction, immersion, or emotional impact. I was eagerly waiting for the full game to deliver on the most crucial element of the game, the joy of seeing the end of our voyage. Yet, when the full version was released, almost nothing was different except for a few extra maps and character models that were so stiff they looked like they were just dropped there, and they even had some bugs.\n\nThat's why the Early Access was so much fun. But that fun instantly vanished once the full game arrived. I’ve put off reviewing this game for a long time to see if I would ever want to play it again, just like I have with other sandbox games that I might want to start over. But in the end, I never touched it again. The desire to get all the trophies is gone, even though I was so motivated to get 100% when I was playing with my friends.\n\nThis is one of those games where, while I don’t regret the playtime and feelings I invested in playing it, I regret the game itself for not delivering a truly impressive experience. Instead, it was my friends who I played with delivered that experience.",

    {
      "review": "I enjoyed the game more or less, an don't exactly regret having played it. That said, there are a number of complaints:\r\n1. The game suffers from Early Access Itis. Even though I played once the game was fully finished and released, the content at each stage of the game was so clearly disconnected that I could tell exactly when something was part of a later update rather than part of the original plan. The story beats progress like someone who keeps pulling forward at a stop light - a tiny movement follow by breaks. At worst I would call it incoherent and inconsistent.\r\n\r\n2. The game styles itself a \"survival crafter\" while actually being a low quality adventure game. Many of these titles suffer from the same problem: They introduce all kinds of survival and crafting mechanics and then trivialize them to the point that the most effective way to play the game is to ignore those mechanics. The Forest and Green Hell are other great examples of this.\r\nSome examples from Raft that exhibit this:\r\n- After setting up a basic set of farm plots and a couple solar water distillers, the survival aspect reaches an equilibrium between ease of use and effectiveness. Upgrading your food or water generation becomes an active detriment as it will produce effectively the same result while requiring more time and inputs from the player. Upgrading to the later grills or trying to automate your crop watering feels like a ease of use downgrade. Using the juicer or cooking pot is a huge trouble for basically no real worthwhile reward. You will never see a more effective (in terms of time, resources, and end result) setup than a few potato patches, a grill, and a couple of solar distillers.\r\n- Once you have an engine, most upgrades to your raft will no longer have a meaningful justification. Building the raft [i]should[/i] be the primary gameplay loop. This game is centered entirely around the player base. It [i]should[/i] be the case that you are incentivized to build and upgrade your raft to progress in the game. The only case I can see that this is true is the radar that lets you find islands, and the engines. The raft is then relegated to a place to eat and drink before your next story island expedition. \r\n- Meaningful upgrades come far too late in the game. The titanium upgrades are introduced so late in the game that the only reason to even consider building them is because you think the game will go on for another 20 hours or so. The only thing they offer is reduced resource usage from not using wood as fuel - at a point in the game where realistically the only thing you need wood for is vanity projects and fuel.\r\n\r\n3. Crafting is tedious and inconsistent. A water bottle never breaks. Bowls and glasses used in cooking are single use. Crafting a player upgrade in the form of a respirator gives you 10 minutes of usage before breaking - and requiring 6 different ingredients, 2 crafts, fuel(about 8), and 9 smelting operations [i]every time.[/i] Never mind the resource usage; this will take several minutes of scrambling around the raft opening chests and smelting seaweed. It's tedious. This is an example where an upgrade to the raft in the form of an air compressor to recharge the equipment would have a meaningful impact - upgrading the player's ability to explore.\r\nMost animal resources have exactly one use and one animal that provides them. \r\nSome lights provide light while others don't.\r\n\r\n4. The writing and voice acting are genuinely cringe inducing. The plot borders on incoherent and the characters have less motivation than a typical Disney villain. The notes are a shoe horned way to make the game feel like the players aren't alone - always a few steps behind the cast. This simultaneously ruins any isolation the player might have felt in a flooded world, while robbing the game of a perfect opportunity to have NPCs that justified building and expanding your raft. Lock story beat progression behind providing an NPC accommodations and the tools they need to fulfill their part of the story. \r\n\r\nThe short of it is that The Raft is a game that forgot it was a survival crafter. It takes nothing from the genre/format that actually makes the format interesting or engaging. It sabotages its own mechanics by making them too tedious to care about. It centers the entire game around the base and then provides almost no incentive to care about the base. \r\nI played through without most character upgrades because they were too tedious to replace after 10 minutes. I played through without using the juicer or cooking pot because the reward for doing so was worse than just eating 6 pineapples. I played through only using 3 total batteries because there were no mechanics that used them that were worth the trouble. No healing items. No ziplines. No tradepost usage.\r\nI spent a ton of time building unnecessary stuff on my raft for my own amusement, but the most effective way to spend those resources would have been making a 10x10 square and putting up armor plates on the edges. Instead, I spent about 30% of my play time fighting a tedious shark off and hoping I could get to him with a spear before he broke a piece of raft and required me to go hunt down plastic and wood to fix it.\r\n\r\nThere were enough parts that were fun, but the more I played the more frustrating the game became.

The lore progression didn't offer a lot of new things to craft and even the ones it did offer, were seemingly either not really useful, or could already be crafted from the materials you have stockpiled (no new materials are unlocked, besides one, so you don't even have to farm to craft the limited new recipes, making them less satisfying to get). The biggest example of this is the armor; the whole game has one type of armor and its durability is a joke. There are definitely materials that could be used for better armor, although armor is honestly not useful to begin with\r\n~ [b]Achievements.[/b] I am an achievement hunter, and these achievements are the most unfriendly and tedious I've seen in a game. I won't go further into detail due to spoilers, but basically the counters needed to be way lower\r\n\r\nMinor Drawbacks:\r\n~ [b]Solo Exploration in Co-op.[/b] Basically in normal mode, players can't split into different islands, because the only way to return to the raft is by dying, which has a penalty of losing your inventory. So If I want to loot some materials my friend is forced to come with me. Thankfully we played on Easy to avoid the death penalty, thus why this is only a Minor Drawback (still a drawback though, since a lot of players will probably play on Normal, and discover this drawback later on, where changing difficulty is not possible)\r\n~[b]Bugs in Co-op.[/b] Achievement counters, achievements in general, and looting enemies sometimes bug for non-hosts, and some are well known bugs for years. They happened a lot to me. Also, when my friend left me on an island, sometimes the island unloads momentarily because they went too far and I fall through the ground.",

However, the entire experience all the while had this air of sluggishness.\n\nMy first and probably biggest gripe is just how slow progression is - Some people like that, I also like it sometimes as a big survival craft fan myself. Unfortunately, Raft is different in the aspect that it isn't just slow because It's a grind, It's slow because of how non-substantial the results from that grind feels.\n\nThe biggest contributor of this is how fragile all the tools are, and how fast your thirst/hunger goes down - It feels like for every 5 steps you take in the game, you take 4 steps back to recraft all your tools and feed yourself, and then you have no materials left and have to get more, and if you're lucky, in that tool/feed cycle you'll make some progress, but sometimes you don't. Even if you do, it typically isn't a lot before you have to craft and feed yourself again.\n\nYou can't seem to meaningfully automate any resources either until late game, and your main source of gathering items (islands and drifting materials) only show every once in awhile. So you literally have periods where you are doing nothing, slowly starving and wasting time you could be spending progressing.\n\nAnd the thing is - The content in the game is rather shallow in terms of recipes and generated areas, so I can get wanting to drip feed it in the form of a long grind (If It's intentional) but it just leaves you with a beta-feeling experience.\n\nIt's a drag, which is a shame because It does certain things right. The building is very cool and flexible as evident by the trailers, and there's lots of decoration items to find. When you do find a big island, it fulfills a sense of exploration. It's just extremely rough around the edges when it comes to the main aspect of the game - survival craft.",

      "review": "I get what the devs were going for but man...\r\n\r\nFirst the shark makes it feel like you're being punished for even playing the game, especially when you don't know how to speedrun things like armor for your raft. It's not uncommon for the game to softlock itself by having the bastard shark eat your raft piece by piece. And if you lose the last piece of your raft, that's it, you can't build a new one.\r\n\r\nAfter you get past the skill-check that is the existence of the shark, the game still feels more like a chore towards the end. Especially when you need to survive 365 in-game days. No, you don't have to stay alive, you can die as much as you want. But the fact I spent the last +50 hours just lying dead on my raft as I waited for the days to tick by because there was practically nothing else left to do shows how much lack of content there actually is. By the time I otherwise completed everything else, I was around day 200. One in-game day takes 20 minutes, or about 13 minutes if you can be bothered to go to sleep every night. Which I wasn't. I left the game running for two days. Yes, I 100%ed Satisfactory and had the game idling for what might be weeks. But at least there it felt like I was making an investment and had made automated manufacturing, which I could've sped up by improving the factories. But then I would've been playing the game, not literally waiting for hours to tick by.\r\n\r\nRaft also lacks many QoL functions, like being able to change the settings of your save file. If you play alone, just play on Easy, otherwise you'll run the constant risk of losing at least 2/3 of your inventory and durability of your items. You cannot change this after starting the game.\r\n\r\nAnd some of the mechanics just don't make sense either. If you want to make yourself a bowl of soup, you need to find clay to make yourself a bowl first. You can find clay by finding islands, dive underwater to be harassed by the shark and then hope that you can find clay. Then you make your bowl, you scoop up your soup and you eat the soup. Whoops, you also ate the bowl. There are no other food bowls available besides the clay ones. Same deal with making fancier drinks. You eat glass. Granted, you can simply grill yourself some meat or potatoes and distill plain water but you need clay and glass to give yourself proper hunger- and -thirst bonuses.\r\n\r\nThat should sum up how much of a hassle this game actually is...\r\n\r\nOh, and the devs really like feet, apparently. Constant slapping of meaty feet with every step on pretty much everything that isn't grass/dirt, even when you have shoes on. And don't swim in 3rd-person view.",

My first playthrough was me mooching off my friend's completed world where I got a lot of her achievements from joining her.\n\nMonths later, another friend told us he wants to replay the game. He was eager to kill some sharks. I was like, \"Sure I'll be the host this time since I've never played it properly.\"\n\nI asked A LOT of questions when we first started. I hate how open ended the game is in terms of questing. I wish I am told what I have to do—I need to find this, I'm missing this. My friends told me the point is exploring. But to me it was quite stress inducing. When you're running around not knowing if you found everything or missed something. One friend keeps monitoring my note taking progress, while the other friend keeps our raft afloat (she's a builder).\n\nWe've only been up to Balboa and Caravan Town, but damn was it hell. One friend keeps saying to take things at my own pace, but I'm out here running around stressing myself that not even the peaceful music of the game can help. Oh, they keep saying the game is peaceful. Sure.\n\nIf it weren't for them, I wouldn't even reach 20+ hours into the game. They said I'm being spoonfed, that I didn't go through the hours of suffering they went through, but it was not me who decided to play! So they gotta help me!!! We spent 10 days on Caravan Town btw, and my friend said I will be spending longer days on the other islands. Great.\n\nAnyway, the game is great. I can see the appeal to people who love sandbox, open-ended exploration, building game. I enjoy the game with my friends, and I will never see myself going on the game alone. I'm mostly lost if not for them hahaha. Or maybe because I'm with my friends and I'm coddled. Or they told me of things on the game that I have to do, that I am missing a note so I have to run around looking for the missing ones. Either way... it's fine.\n\nSo, if you ask me would I recommend this game? No. But if you like this genre? Sure, good for you. I'm only here because my friends are here.",

      "review": "I like the game I really do. The only issues I have is that the islands are exactly the same. The shark attacks your raft for what reason? None, just to make your life harder. And, he is difficult to kill and does a ton of damage, killing you within 3 hits, so half your raft is gone by the time you can kill it easily. And don't get me started on that boar. The game is tedious and repetitive. I don't know about you but I like survival games with far less repetitiveness. Good solid foundation for a good game. Needs more updates, but sadly devs \"finished\" the game. Which is a laugh in its own.",

You spend most of your time on a Raft and have to rely on RNGesus to spawn you islands and hope you don't get killed as it'll potentially backtrack you several hours if you aren't careful. In my 7 hours I restarted about 4 times and found that once you get the Smelter, things feel even slower because of the gameplay loop of slowly riding on the raft, look for an island, hope to find some ore, hope to not get insta killed by hostile NPCs, and then repeat the cycle over and over. The raft gameplay is interesting, you can customize it any way you want but again, it takes FOREVER to get enough loot to make something decent. Sure, you can play on Easy and not lose anything on death, the gameplay loop remains the same.",

Hunger and thirst drain are annoying to work around and make any progress (this is on Normal difficulty with a group of 5). Fighting enemies is too time consuming with the early tools, and due to their health and mobility it feels almost impossible to take them down.
