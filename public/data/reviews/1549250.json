The end game, if you reach it is good.\n\nHowever the campaign has multiple episodes and each is longer than all 10 acts of path of exiles campaign. To skip that, you have to pay 22$. The battlepass is 36$ for a month. The inventory is heavily restricted and to get one of the most important tabs (essence) is rougly 21$ but you need to buy a 36$ currency bundle to get it.\n\nThe campaign is about 5x longer than all of path of exiles campaign.

Whoever was in charge of that needs to get fired, as that is the primary reason this game failed miserably. The game mechanics are nice, though a bit overly convoluted for their results. Not many players will ever get far enough to explore that complexity though because the marketing tactics give a strong impression of \"this is a shallow money grab like a generic mobile game\" and scare them off. Even me, who tried to ignore it all and move past it.

If you've seen the quirky looking skill tree setup, you're in for a disappointment as it's very basic when it comes down to it.\n\nGameplay is incredibly easy, most of the content is a faceroll. In fact, you will be playing through 10s of hours of a pretty underwhelming campaign before you're allowed to engage with any of the game systems (enchanting, crafting, power building). Unintuitively, you'll be getting materials for these systems from the first moment you start the game, clogging up the inventory with you never really knowing what you'll be needing later on.\n\nLoot is pretty underwhelming once you realize that you're not in it for gear items, but you're actually after ten billion different materials for crafting your own gear. This is the only point in the game you'll need help with and the resources for the game are relatively scarce. I said the game is easy but the power systems are incredibly convoluted and numerous, that most of your 300/400 slot inventory and storage will be swamped in various versions of materials you'll be hoarding for each individual system (there are also needlessly \"exclusive\" versions of items that don't stack with non-exclusive ones).\n\nNone of the things you do to get stronger are unique or innovative though, it's just different ways of getting the BIG NUMBER go up. There's very few conditional effects or things that will change how you play the game. Choose your main skill, set it on auto and tie it with another few skills and the game plays itself. You will stack the big number by grinding mats until your number goes into thousands/millions, then billions and then even TRILLIONS of DPS.\n\nThere are very few times where the game will test you for any sort of practical gameplay knowledge (other than your math and excell skills maybe) and you will either obliterate your enemies or you will be one shot by a regular mob that has 3000 times more damage than you have health. Very few in-between scenarios.\n\nCampaign and story are bland and lazy, there is maybe one chapter that's even remotely interesting. Game also has bugs that can and will kill you.\n\nOccasionally good art or design are overshadowed by the many flaws and shortcuts the game takes to either cut cost or make you buy into the plentiful shop where you can whale your brain off if you want to skip the grind. \n\nEasier to just skip the game altogether ;)",

The gameplay itself feels choppy, almost like you’re constantly experiencing connection issues even when everything on your end is fine. Movement feels off, combat isn’t smooth, and nothing about the moment-to-moment gameplay feels satisfying.\n\nBefore you can even get a feel for the game, you’re bombarded with an absurd amount of pop-ups — battle passes, limited-time discounts, seasonal bundles, “free” boxes that all require you to open different store pages. It’s overwhelming, intrusive, and genuinely headache-inducing. And once you close all that, you’re pushed into a long string of forced tutorial clicks that go on far too long and kill the pacing before it even begins.\n\nEven after escaping the tutorial treadmill, things don’t improve. Loot feels bland and unexciting, automatically vacuumed up just by running past it, with anything you miss being fetched by your pet. There’s no thrill in finding items, no meaningful impact from gear drops. The story didn’t offer anything compelling either — it felt too generic and uninspired to hold any interest.\n\nThe one system that [i]looked[/i] like it could have been interesting was the rune-based skill setup, with the potential for creative build crafting. But by the time I reached it, the rest of the experience had already soured so badly that I had no motivation left to explore it.\n\nOverall, [i]Undecember[/i] feels messy, aggressively monetized, and unpleasant to play.

Unintuitively, you'll be getting materials for these systems from the first moment you start the game, clogging up the inventory with you never really knowing what you'll be needing later on.\n\nLoot is pretty underwhelming once you realize that you're not in it for gear items, but you're actually after ten billion different materials for crafting your own gear. This is the only point in the game you'll need help with and the resources for the game are relatively scarce. I said the game is easy but the power systems are incredibly convoluted and numerous, that most of your 300/400 slot inventory and storage will be swamped in various versions of materials you'll be hoarding for each individual system (there are also needlessly \"exclusive\" versions of items that don't stack with non-exclusive ones).\n\nNone of the things you do to get stronger are unique or innovative though, it's just different ways of getting the BIG NUMBER go up. There's very few conditional effects or things that will change how you play the game. Choose your main skill, set it on auto and tie it with another few skills and the game plays itself. You will stack the big number by grinding mats until your number goes into thousands/millions, then billions and then even TRILLIONS of DPS.\n\nThere are very few times where the game will test you for any sort of practical gameplay knowledge (other than your math and excell skills maybe) and you will either obliterate your enemies or you will be one shot by a regular mob that has 3000 times more damage than you have health. Very few in-between scenarios.\n\nCampaign and story are bland and lazy, there is maybe one chapter that's even remotely interesting. Game also has bugs that can and will kill you.\n\nOccasionally good art or design are overshadowed by the many flaws and shortcuts the game takes to either cut cost or make you buy into the plentiful shop where you can whale your brain off if you want to skip the grind. \n\nEasier to just skip the game altogether ;)",

      "review": "[i]Undecember[/i] left a bad impression almost immediately, and it never recovered. The gameplay itself feels choppy, almost like you’re constantly experiencing connection issues even when everything on your end is fine. Movement feels off, combat isn’t smooth, and nothing about the moment-to-moment gameplay feels satisfying.\n\nBefore you can even get a feel for the game, you’re bombarded with an absurd amount of pop-ups — battle passes, limited-time discounts, seasonal bundles, “free” boxes that all require you to open different store pages. It’s overwhelming, intrusive, and genuinely headache-inducing. And once you close all that, you’re pushed into a long string of forced tutorial clicks that go on far too long and kill the pacing before it even begins.\n\nEven after escaping the tutorial treadmill, things don’t improve. Loot feels bland and unexciting, automatically vacuumed up just by running past it, with anything you miss being fetched by your pet. There’s no thrill in finding items, no meaningful impact from gear drops. The story didn’t offer anything compelling either — it felt too generic and uninspired to hold any interest.\n\nThe one system that [i]looked[/i] like it could have been interesting was the rune-based skill setup, with the potential for creative build crafting. But by the time I reached it, the rest of the experience had already soured so badly that I had no motivation left to explore it.\n\nOverall, [i]Undecember[/i] feels messy, aggressively monetized, and unpleasant to play. Whatever potential the skill system might have had is buried under poor presentation, clunky gameplay, and an exhausting barrage of monetization tactics.",
