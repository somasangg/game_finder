Pretty much any board game you can think of has been ported to Tabletop Sim, and most of them are free community mods. If you want to play any tabletop game with your friends who may not live near you (or who may have impairments that makes it hard to do in-person tabletop sessions), this is your game. Also, if you want to prototype your own board game/card game/tabletop game, Tabletop Sim has easy to understand tools which will enable you to create basically anything you can imagine, and even has scripting tools which you can use to create rule simulations if you need to.\n\nI was a hater for a long time, but honestly considering what you actually get from this game, it's hard to [i]truly[/i] hate it.",

This pathetic excuse of a piece waddles around the board like it's trying to find its glasses at 3AM. One square at a time? We have got queens moving around the board like hot knives through butter, bishops pulling off long-range diagonals like snipers in a stealth op, knights doing parkour, and then... there's the king. The royal potato. The supposed \"most important piece\" in the entire game, and yet it moves like it's late for bingo night and forgot its cane.\r\n\r\nHow does that even make sense??? The fate of the entire game rests in the hands of this trembling piece who couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag. Everyone else is out here doing tactical sacrifices, forks, pins, brilliant plays, and the king just chills there in the corner like “I sure hope nobody notices me 🥺👉👈.” You'd think someone so important would at least know how to defend himself, but nope. One square. No diagonal hops. No teleports. No fireballs. Not even a stern look. Just that sad little shuffle like he's trying to avoid stepping on legos in the dark.\r\n\r\nYou’re telling me the King! the sovereign, the ruler, the big cheese, the important cucumber can be checkmated by a literal pawn that made it to the other side and got an upgrade? This is like watching a CEO get overthrown by an unpaid intern who showed up to the meeting with a better slideshow. It's embarrassing. He’s supposed to be royalty, not royalty-free. And don’t even get me started on castling. Oh wow, congrats! You moved TWO squares like a big boy! What a game-changing mechanic! Wow! Incredible! Revolutionary! Bro, the rook literally carries the king like it’s babysitting a toddler on a leash.\r\n\r\nAnd the worst part? If the king dies, the game ends. That’s it. All the drama. All the strategies. All the sacrifices. All of it thrown away because Grandpa Royal decided to stroll into check like he was going out for milk and forgot there’s a war going on. It’s not even funny anymore. It’s tragic. A disgrace. Why not just replace the king with a rubber duck at this point? At least that would be honest, and it could quack atleast.\r\n\r\nSo yeah. I'm not sure why the king is even in chess. It's SO useless. It can’t even do anything. It's like playing tag, but one kid is wearing a crown and if you even look at him too long, the entire playground explodes, recess is canceled forever, and the principal calls your parents to tell them you lost at life. The king is the human equivalent of lag. It’s not just useless, it actively drags the game down.",

      "review": "Tabletop Simulator is pretty much an established staple of gaming today, a popular bridge between video gaming and board gaming.\nSo long as you understand english, you'll be able to play almost any game in existence - the workshop community is wild, whether it is to recreate real life games and their expensions, or to make their actual custom content for existing games! (just look at the amount of community content created around the Pokemon Master Trainer game, it's insane... Or speaking of insane, Insane Monopoly which nobody in their right mind would play.) Not that it's not a thing irl, but TTS makes it quite easy. A bit of graphical skills, a few models perhaps, an idea in mind and you can create your own board game prototype virtually.\nNow it doesn't recreate 100% of the the fun of playing board games with friends, but it is close enough. And it mostly does spare the task of setting up the game... and mostly, of putting it away, the one most painful of things about board game. Also, you're free of cats potentially invading the game table or the boxes (unless there's a mod for that...?)\nNow one may be concerned about this game's impact on actual board game sales - in fact there were a few cases of games published by the community having been taken down from the workshop. These are rare instances though, and I will say that I have bought many board games in material format [b]after[/b] trying them on TTS and being pleased with them (Such as Nemesis, Massive Darkness 2, DMC Bloody Palace and others). For people who do real life board gaming, it can indeed serve as a test software, so that you know if that board game you've seen in your local shop will be worth the investment for you and your friends.\n\nBasically, if you have any enjoyment for tabletop games, even mild, there's no reason to not get Tabletop Simulator during a sale. One day or another, you'll be happy you grabbed it!",

Its very fun game and has so many quality of life features that make playing 40k a lot quicker and easier but definitly shouldnt be used to substitute the real game. \nIts also very easy to make your own custom mods for the game like datacards or codexes, or any kind of text or data document you want really, you literally just need a PDF image and you can upload it to a custom template then save it, posting social media is probably harder!\nThe amount of different map packs the community has made is unreal, it would cost you a lot of money to play on some of the map designs i have seen in the game.\nThe whole experience is basically your warhammer 40k dream with no financial constraints, you're free to make the biggest most expensive army you can and play it for free.\nIf you like 40k this game is a no brainer like why do you not own it already?",

The controls are unintuitive and difficult to explain, which made it challenging for everyone to get started. I spent hours trying to help others understand how everything works. This issue may be related to the paid DLC I purchased, but regardless, the experience was not enjoyable for me. Improvements to the controls or better tutorials would make the game more accessible.",
