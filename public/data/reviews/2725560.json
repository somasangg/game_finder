With the Excavation update this game is no longer Idle, so if you want an idle game this is absolutely not what you're looking for. The Excavation update requires you to not only have the game running in the background but to be actively playing it in order to make any progress and I mean any progress at all. nothing happens with this part of the game unless you're actively playing it, other then you gain some mining points that you spend, you get 40 to start. you will use more then 40 in 1 excavation \"map\", it takes roughly 200 seconds (3 minutes 20seconds) for you to get this and then you will not gain more unless you buy the first upgrade which lets you up the amount by 10, which buys you another 50 seconds you can \"Idle\" for. meaning that if you leave the game for lets say 24 hours, in the original idle fishing you get regular idle game benefits, but for this excavation you gain nothing more then you would for being idle for 200 seconds. It's designed for you to spend IRL money on Diamonds with which you can (given enough IRL funds) finish this \"mini game\" in a matter of hours. otherwise you can expect level 3-4 to take you somewhere around the 8-10 hour mark with it only increasing drastically even just from 4-5 and it goes all the way up to 9\n\nUpdate December 1st 2025\n\nA lot of good changes have been made to excavation making it more afk which I think matches the purpose of an idle game, I don't mind that excavation takes such an incredible amount of time to complete, that's generally on theme with idle games, however excavation at least to my knowledge have no form of progression unless you have the game open which does feel a little off. I'm swayed enough to change my recommend to a yes but with the caveat that there are still elements that I would still want to see changed.",

It's designed for you to spend IRL money on Diamonds with which you can (given enough IRL funds) finish this \"mini game\" in a matter of hours. otherwise you can expect level 3-4 to take you somewhere around the 8-10 hour mark with it only increasing drastically even just from 4-5 and it goes all the way up to 9\n\nUpdate December 1st 2025\n\nA lot of good changes have been made to excavation making it more afk which I think matches the purpose of an idle game, I don't mind that excavation takes such an incredible amount of time to complete, that's generally on theme with idle games, however excavation at least to my knowledge have no form of progression unless you have the game open which does feel a little off. I'm swayed enough to change my recommend to a yes but with the caveat that there are still elements that I would still want to see changed.",

It's just people mad that there's a new (FREE) update, and they lost their precious 100%.  That being said, you can totally 100% it without spending a dime, I'm closing in on the 100% in under 1,000 hours which (to me) is short for an Idle game.    The new Excavation \"mini-game\" has to have the game opened to use, but that's no different than the base game achievements, such as active catches, chest hunts, etc they had to have the game open and actively doing to achieve.  \r\n\r\nYou won't be doing a lot of fishing, though.  Mostly you just set up your lil dude and boat in whatever zone is hot for the day, you can hold spacebar to make him fish faster, and outside of special mechanics (active catch, chest hunt, fishing \"contest\", and Excavation) that's about it.  You \"level up\" so to speak, spend money on upgrades, bigger boats, more crew to fish for you with their own bonuses, collect pets you can swap in/out with bonuses, etc.  Lots to keep you busy if you want to play active, or you can just check in periodically and spend currencies.

In theory they're supposed to give you extra bonuses, but in practice they barely make a dent.\n\nThe problem is that by Tier 14 of the skills you buy with Silver every run, you get stuck.

Above Quest in Excavation is to use GEMs the real money stuff to get Excavation Buffs that make the Excavation playable.\n\nExcavation Is NOT a idle system its a active system within the game meaning you have to have the game loaded up in order to use Excavation its a mode where it breaks the whole Idle design for the core gameplay and brings nothing FUN to the game. \n\nExcavation is a completely Pointless system that brings nothing to the game, this game worked fine before Excavation was added and like i said Excavation is designed around Spending Real Money on GEM Buffs in order to play it.

Buff system that requires real money. \n\nthis is the same dev that also was selling AutoClickers for £5 something in this game when on PC Auto Clickers are free\n\nDaily Quest Rewards have also been nerfed due to Excavation Quests replacing Normal Fishing Quests so you are getting less rewards for the same amount of time seem the Excavation Daily Quests takes 12x to 13x longer to complete.\n\nUpdate: The dev is now banning people from Steam Discussions who are giving feedback on the Excavation update.\n\nthat's now another reason NOT to support this dev seem they don't like Feedback on what's wrong with the game.\n\nNow i'm just going to blacklist the dev and publisher from my account and remove this game from my account seem its pretty clear that the dev don't care about the community or feedback from the playerbase who are giving actual feedback and not kissing up to the dev.\n\nUpdate: the dev has removed my whole Post in the steam discussions going over everything about Excavation after banning me for giving feedback about it. \n\ni made a whole post going over everything Bad and Good about Excavation even going into a detailed breakdown on it and giving feedback on how to improve the system and make it more rewarding for normal players who are not spending alot of real money or have alot of spare time to play the game. \n\nthis is wild seem nothing in my post broke any rules on steam or did it break any rules on the discussions so it does seem this dev is deleting feedback that is making the Excavation Update look bad. \n\nI guess the dev can't remove Game Reviews Right seem the Excavation Update is just a CASH GRAB Update for the dev team seem it turns the whole game into a active game instead of a Idle Fishing game but i guess you can now report the game for falsely Tagging and Advertising seem the game is no longer considered a Idle Game.\n\nits good to see that alot of Honest Gamers are pointing this stuff out seem alot of Players who have 300+ hours on the game are lying and spreading Misinformation about the Excavation Update almost like they have been paid off by the devs to spread misinformation and to mislead people. \n\na User called \"rdkehoe\" who is a Twitch Streamer and Youtuber who purposely goes around spreading misleading information or Misinformation about the Excavation Update and then lies about using Real Money to speed up progress then tries to say that the game has no Pay For Progression Systems in the store even when it takes no less then 5 mins to figure out that's not true seem the store sells Boosters that speed up how much stuff you get. \n\nhe has 404 hours on the game and defends the dev for no reason that i can tell unless he is someone who has been paid to play the game or paid to defend it \n\nhe makes up stuff from out of nowhere and seems to think that a player who has 100+ hours on the game does not understand how to play the game or understand systems within it even when 100+ hours into it i have over 750+ achievements and almost hit 800+ in that time. \n\nthis user is not the only one who is spreading misinformation and saying there's nothing wrong with the Excavation Update and then says he has spent No money on the game in 404 hours and having almost every achievement seem anyone with 2 brain cells would be able to tell that he is instantly lying seem playing the game without spending money would take you years to get almost every achievement seem it takes over a month just to get half of the tech tree done and that's with real money spending. \n\nUsers like rdkehoe are what's wrong with this game seem they defend it and purposely spread misinformation about the game and anything they are involved in \n\nit seems like this user and many others including the game dev are abusing the Steam Report system and using it as a weapon towards others seem almost every post about the Excavation Update that goes into what's wrong with it gets

It's not too hard to start making the pickaxes generate faster, and even upgrade your bank with it. To bring the time down to something like 10 minutes for a full bank. This means that in order to have any semblance of progress, you have to be clicking on this game every 10 minutes. If you have saved up gems to buy some boosts, it's even less time than that. \n\nThe bank for excavation tools is simply too low and needs to be multiplied by at least 10.

the game. \n\nExcavation for Normal Players is not designed to be FUN or even that worth it due to all of the Upgrades being useless and the only way to really do daily quests if you get a Purple or Above Quest in Excavation is to use GEMs the real money stuff to get Excavation Buffs that make the Excavation playable.\n\nExcavation Is NOT a idle system its a active system within the game meaning you have to have the game loaded up in order to use Excavation its a mode where it breaks the whole Idle design for the core gameplay and brings nothing FUN to the game. \n\nExcavation is a completely Pointless system that brings nothing to the game, this game worked fine before Excavation was added and like i said Excavation is designed around Spending Real Money on GEM Buffs in order to play it. \n\nthis is also the same dev that said to the playerbase no new achievements would be added and now they have added alot more achievements to the game that are based around Excavation and the GEM Buff system that requires real money. \n\nthis is the same dev that also was selling AutoClickers for £5 something in this game when on PC Auto Clickers are free\n\nDaily Quest Rewards have also been nerfed due to Excavation Quests replacing Normal Fishing Quests so you are getting less rewards for the same amount of time seem the Excavation Daily Quests takes 12x to 13x longer to complete.\n\nUpdate: The dev is now banning people from Steam Discussions who are giving feedback on the Excavation update.\n\nthat's now another reason NOT to support this dev seem they don't like Feedback on what's wrong with the game.\n\nNow i'm just going to blacklist the dev and publisher from my account and remove this game from my account seem its pretty clear that the dev don't care about the community or feedback from the playerbase who are giving actual feedback and not kissing up to the dev.\n\nUpdate: the dev has removed my whole Post in the steam discussions going over everything about Excavation after banning me for giving feedback about it. \n\ni made a whole post going over everything Bad and Good about Excavation even going into a detailed breakdown on it and giving feedback on how to improve the system and make it more rewarding for normal players who are not spending alot of real money or have alot of spare time to play the game. \n\nthis is wild seem nothing in my post broke any rules on steam or did it break any rules on the discussions so it does seem this dev is deleting feedback that is making the Excavation Update look bad. \n\nI guess the dev can't remove Game Reviews Right seem the Excavation Update is just a CASH GRAB Update for the dev team seem it turns the whole game into a active game instead of a Idle Fishing game but i guess you can now report the game for falsely Tagging and Advertising seem the game is no longer considered a Idle Game.\n\nits good to see that alot of Honest Gamers are pointing this stuff out seem alot of Players who have 300+ hours on the game are lying and spreading Misinformation about the Excavation Update almost like they have been paid off by the devs to spread misinformation and to mislead people. \n\na User called \"rdkehoe\" who is a Twitch Streamer and Youtuber who purposely goes around spreading misleading information or Misinformation about the Excavation Update and then lies about using Real Money to speed up progress then tries to say that the game has no Pay For Progression Systems in the store even when it takes no less then 5 mins to figure out that's not true seem the store sells Boosters that speed up how much stuff you get. \n\nhe has 404 hours on the game and defends the dev for no reason that i can tell unless he is someone who has been paid to play the game or paid to defend it \n\nhe makes up stuff from out of nowhere and seems to think that a player who has 100+ hours on the game does not understand how to play the game or understand systems within it even when 100+ hours into it i have over 750+ achievements and almost hit 800+ in that time. \n\nthis user is not the only one who is spreading misinformation and saying there's nothing wrong with the Excavation Update and then says he has spent No money on the game in 404 hours and having almost every achievement seem anyone with 2 brain cells would be able to tell that he is instantly lying seem playing the game without spending money would take you years to get almost every achievement seem it takes over a month just to get half of the tech tree done and that's with real money spending. \n\nUsers like rdkehoe are what's wrong with this game seem they defend it and purposely spread misinformation about the game and anything they are involved in \n\nit seems like this user and many others including the game dev are abusing the Steam Report system and using it as a weapon towards others seem almost every post about the Excavation Update that goes into what's wrong with it gets

      "review": "I enjoyed this game at first but it's totally worn me out. And I say this as someone who plays too many idle games.\n\nEach run, you generate Silver and Gold. Silver is the temporary currency you use to buy fish, skill, and stall upgrades, anything tied to that specific run. These skills are arranged in tiers, and each time you complete a tier, a new one unlocks. The new tier usually has some permanent unlock that goes along with it, so not only does completing tiers help future runs go smoother, but you gain something new which gives you a tiny dopamine hit. Silver always resets when you Ascend so there's no reason to hold onto it.\n\nGold is bankable. You generate it during the run but you can't touch it until you Ascend. When you Ascend, the game finally gives you the Gold you earned so you can spend it on long term improvements in the Ascension Tree. These include permanent bonuses that are supposed to make future runs stronger, as well as new fishing locations and upgrades to your fishing boat so you can hire more crew members to auto fish for you.\n\nYou also earn medals from repeating fishing contests. In theory they're supposed to give you extra bonuses, but in practice they barely make a dent.\n\nThe problem is that by Tier 14 of the skills you buy with Silver every run, you get stuck. No matter what you've bought with medals and Gold, you just don't seem to get any closer to finishing Tier 14. I think I've been stuck on Tier 14 for several weeks now. I don't even know how many times I've Ascended. And by this point, when I do Ascend, it doesn't feel like I'm banking enough Gold to get through the absolutely [i]huge[/i] Ascension Tree so I have to save up and do more runs. Each upgrade I buy just feels like a drop in the ocean now. The game becomes sluggish and heavy.\n\n[strike]The dev added an excavation minigame recently that's fully manual, which hasn't been popular since it requires active play in a formerly 100% idle game. I'm a relatively newer player so I'm not as upset about this change as older players are, although I understand their irritation, but I still don't understand what excavating fossils has to do with fishing. So I'm just like, \"Mmmkay...\"[/strike] (Update: excavation now has an auto feature. I'm sill not sure what excavation has to do with fishing though, and I'm still stuck on tier 14. Lol)\n\nWhat makes all of this even stranger is how late the game waits to give you a real prestige option. In most idle or incremental games, you get some form of prestige early so you can wipe everything for a stronger permanent boost. In IF, this appears to be the Rebirth feature, which you don't unlock until you finish the entire Ascension Tree. Once you Rebirth, you lose all your Ascension upgrades and start again with the Amber Tree instead, or so I've read. I'm nowhere near Rebirth with almost 60 hours logged. I don't think I'm even halfway there. I can't imagine doing all of this again. I don't trust that the dev has his math right.\n\n[b]TLDR[/b]: Tier 14 kills the fun, I'm not even the only person to bring it up on the forums (dev said it's operating as expected). Progress stalls, Gold upgrades feel useless, and the loop gets stale. I can't help but feel like the developer put some decimals in the wrong place.",

Without the upgrades or pets you need to play excavations every minute. GL. For the achievements (which also boost your progress ingame with +% stuffs with each unlocked achievements) you need hell lot of excavations. Offline progress lost its meaning.

the game. \n\nExcavation for Normal Players is not designed to be FUN or even that worth it due to all of the Upgrades being useless and the only way to really do daily quests if you get a Purple or Above Quest in Excavation is to use GEMs the real money stuff to get Excavation Buffs that make the Excavation playable.\n\nExcavation Is NOT a idle system its a active system within the game meaning you have to have the game loaded up in order to use Excavation its a mode where it breaks the whole Idle design for the core gameplay and brings nothing FUN to the game. \n\nExcavation is a completely Pointless system that brings nothing to the game, this game worked fine before Excavation was added and like i said Excavation is designed around Spending Real Money on GEM Buffs in order to play it. \n\nthis is also the same dev that said to the playerbase no new achievements would be added and now they have added alot more achievements to the game that are based around Excavation and the GEM Buff system that requires real money. \n\nthis is the same dev that also was selling AutoClickers for £5 something in this game when on PC Auto Clickers are free\n\nDaily Quest Rewards have also been nerfed due to Excavation Quests replacing Normal Fishing Quests so you are getting less rewards for the same amount of time seem the Excavation Daily Quests takes 12x to 13x longer to complete.\n\nUpdate: The dev is now banning people from Steam Discussions who are giving feedback on the Excavation update.\n\nthat's now another reason NOT to support this dev seem they don't like Feedback on what's wrong with the game.\n\nNow i'm just going to blacklist the dev and publisher from my account and remove this game from my account seem its pretty clear that the dev don't care about the community or feedback from the playerbase who are giving actual feedback and not kissing up to the dev.\n\nUpdate: the dev has removed my whole Post in the steam discussions going over everything about Excavation after banning me for giving feedback about it. \n\ni made a whole post going over everything Bad and Good about Excavation even going into a detailed breakdown on it and giving feedback on how to improve the system and make it more rewarding for normal players who are not spending alot of real money or have alot of spare time to play the game. \n\nthis is wild seem nothing in my post broke any rules on steam or did it break any rules on the discussions so it does seem this dev is deleting feedback that is making the Excavation Update look bad. \n\nI guess the dev can't remove Game Reviews Right seem the Excavation Update is just a CASH GRAB Update for the dev team seem it turns the whole game into a active game instead of a Idle Fishing game but i guess you can now report the game for falsely Tagging and Advertising seem the game is no longer considered a Idle Game.\n\nits good to see that alot of Honest Gamers are pointing this stuff out seem alot of Players who have 300+ hours on the game are lying and spreading Misinformation about the Excavation Update almost like they have been paid off by the devs to spread misinformation and to mislead people. \n\na User called \"rdkehoe\" who is a Twitch Streamer and Youtuber who purposely goes around spreading misleading information or Misinformation about the Excavation Update and then lies about using Real Money to speed up progress then tries to say that the game has no Pay For Progression Systems in the store even when it takes no less then 5 mins to figure out that's not true seem the store sells Boosters that speed up how much stuff you get. \n\nhe has 404 hours on the game and defends the dev for no reason that i can tell unless he is someone who has been paid to play the game or paid to defend it \n\nhe makes up stuff from out of nowhere and seems to think that a player who has 100+ hours on the game does not understand how to play the game or understand systems within it even when 100+ hours into it i have over 750+ achievements and almost hit 800+ in that time. \n\nthis user is not the only one who is spreading misinformation and saying there's nothing wrong with the Excavation Update and then says he has spent No money on the game in 404 hours and having almost every achievement seem anyone with 2 brain cells would be able to tell that he is instantly lying seem playing the game without spending money would take you years to get almost every achievement seem it takes over a month just to get half of the tech tree done and that's with real money spending. \n\nUsers like rdkehoe are what's wrong with this game seem they defend it and purposely spread misinformation about the game and anything they are involved in \n\nit seems like this user and many others including the game dev are abusing the Steam Report system and using it as a weapon towards others seem almost every post about the Excavation Update that goes into what's wrong with it gets deleted and users get banned from posting... very strange that is happening.",

      "review": "I enjoyed this game at first but it's totally worn me out. And I say this as someone who plays too many idle games.\n\nEach run, you generate Silver and Gold. Silver is the temporary currency you use to buy fish, skill, and stall upgrades, anything tied to that specific run. These skills are arranged in tiers, and each time you complete a tier, a new one unlocks. The new tier usually has some permanent unlock that goes along with it, so not only does completing tiers help future runs go smoother, but you gain something new which gives you a tiny dopamine hit. Silver always resets when you Ascend so there's no reason to hold onto it.\n\nGold is bankable. You generate it during the run but you can't touch it until you Ascend. When you Ascend, the game finally gives you the Gold you earned so you can spend it on long term improvements in the Ascension Tree. These include permanent bonuses that are supposed to make future runs stronger, as well as new fishing locations and upgrades to your fishing boat so you can hire more crew members to auto fish for you.\n\nYou also earn medals from repeating fishing contests. In theory they're supposed to give you extra bonuses, but in practice they barely make a dent.\n\nThe problem is that by Tier 14 of the skills you buy with Silver every run, you get stuck. No matter what you've bought with medals and Gold, you just don't seem to get any closer to finishing Tier 14. I think I've been stuck on Tier 14 for several weeks now. I don't even know how many times I've Ascended. And by this point, when I do Ascend, it doesn't feel like I'm banking enough Gold to get through the absolutely [i]huge[/i] Ascension Tree so I have to save up and do more runs. Each upgrade I buy just feels like a drop in the ocean now. The game becomes sluggish and heavy.\n\n[strike]The dev added an excavation minigame recently that's fully manual, which hasn't been popular since it requires active play in a formerly 100% idle game. I'm a relatively newer player so I'm not as upset about this change as older players are, although I understand their irritation, but I still don't understand what excavating fossils has to do with fishing. So I'm just like, \"Mmmkay...\"[/strike] (Update: excavation now has an auto feature. I'm sill not sure what excavation has to do with fishing though, and I'm still stuck on tier 14. Lol)\n\nWhat makes all of this even stranger is how late the game waits to give you a real prestige option. In most idle or incremental games, you get some form of prestige early so you can wipe everything for a stronger permanent boost. In IF, this appears to be the Rebirth feature, which you don't unlock until you finish the entire Ascension Tree. Once you Rebirth, you lose all your Ascension upgrades and start again with the Amber Tree instead, or so I've read. I'm nowhere near Rebirth with almost 60 hours logged. I don't think I'm even halfway there. I can't imagine doing all of this again. I don't trust that the dev has his math right.\n\n[b]TLDR[/b]: Tier 14 kills the fun, I'm not even the only person to bring it up on the forums (dev said it's operating as expected). Progress stalls, Gold upgrades feel useless, and the loop gets stale. I can't help but feel like the developer put some decimals in the wrong place.",

As a developer, there must be some incentive to having your steam game open and lots of hours played or something, because that's the only thing that's happening with excavation and all the updates after. \nYou could get 99 agility in Runescape in less clicks and less time than it would take to get the achievements related to the amount of pickaxes needed. \n\nPeople defend this as a \"slow-burn\" idle game. This game is not idle when you include excavation, and the updates are always making it less idle. There is actually an idle mode for excavation now, and it punishes you for using it. There isn't a 'boost' to your resources for being active, there's a nerf to them for being idle. Oh, and it uses twice the number of pickaxes to utilize this 'smart' idle mode. \n\nDev has lost sight of the grand picture. Achievement hunters aren't complaining because an achievement will take some time to get, it's because it's ludicrous to say \"Give me 200,000 clicks, but you can only click 500 times every half hour\".  200 hours just to get the chisels done - and that's if you have all the pets upgraded like me and already worked through all the awful excavation upgrades. So a new player? Good luck! \n\nIf you are new and looking at this game - save yourself the trouble of a dev that's just trying to add content for the sake of putting you on the hamster wheel. Did I mention that post got deleted from the forums? The dev said they would never add achievements just to keep the wheel spinning, but yet, here we are, with that post deleted. Very interesting...\n\nI had 100%'ed this game prior to today's excavation update.\nWhile excavation itself is not a bad addition, it completely ruins what this game has going. \nThis is no longer an idle game, it's a full on clicker game in excavation. \nThe bank for the resources is way to small, it starts at 100, where you generate 1 pickaxe every 10 seconds, which means you have a full bank in about 16 minutes. It's not too hard to start making the pickaxes generate faster, and even upgrade your bank with it. To bring the time down to something like 10 minutes for a full bank. This means that in order to have any semblance of progress, you have to be clicking on this game every 10 minutes. If you have saved up gems to buy some boosts, it's even less time than that. \n\nThe bank for excavation tools is simply too low and needs to be multiplied by at least 10. Or give us some rebirth upgrades to assist it. Really anything besides the pets which seemingly only make the process worse because of how they affect the speed and totals.\n\nI didn't start playing idle fishing because I wanted to play a  clicker game. I started it to play an idle game. It was a great idle game before, and now it's an active clicker game.",
