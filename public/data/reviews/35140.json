The combat feels smooth and satisfying, and the predator sections genuinely make you feel like you’re hunting your enemies one by one.\n\nThe voice acting, music, and environmental detail all work together to create a fantastic experience that never really feels outdated. Even today, the game runs well, plays great, and reminds you why the Arkham series became so iconic in the first place.\n\nIf you’ve never played it: do it.\nIf you have: it’s absolutely worth revisiting.",

      "review": "Arkham Asylum is a game that I keep coming back to. Back when it came out, it surprised people with it's high quality production, the fun Batman The Animated Series plot and the return of Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark  Hamill as the Joker.\n\nThe plot is pretty simple. The Joker gets himself captured as a ploy to get himself into Arkham Asylum, where he quickly breaks free, taking over the building and releasing all the prisoners. Batman naturally takes it onto himself to correct this issue. Generally by breaking every bone in the bodies of 95% of the inmate population. We see returning characters from popular lore like Riddler, Bane and Scare Crow. There's nice nods to other characters and easter eggs dotted all around.\n\nThe game play is very fun and extremely addictived. Basically, the combat is rhythm based. Instead of mashing the  attack button. You slowly push it in a pulsing rhythm. This has Batman flying all over, knocking the teeth out of everything in arms reach. When a bridge light pops up above an inmates head, you push the parry button and he breaks an arm. It's good simple stuff and it doesn't stop being fun. \n\nI've seen a lot of people criticise this game in recent years. Mostly because the game is quite linear and doesn't have the giant open world of it's sequel, Arkham City. This is actually why I prefer this game over the follow up. Both are very good games but I personally prefer the linear more focused story with the hub setting. It's a shorter but considerably more focused game. This is all down to taste. \n\nI do however prefer the combat as a whole. Both games play great but there's a small difference in how the action plays out. I can't honestly describe it but I feel this game is smoother in combat to the successor. I think the sequel was tweaked to a little more challenging, where this game is a Batman themes ego trip. Quick, easy but extremely satisfying. \n\nThe good news here is that the game plays without any problems, or at least it did for me. I've played it on my home PC multiple times and just finished it on the Steam Deck. Each play through has been smooth, without so much as a stutter. Thanks to the Steam Deck's many features, it help up rather well and on full graphics settings too. \n\nWhen it comes to XBOX 360 era games, I think this one is easily in my top 10. I've played it multiple times and I haven't got bored of it yet after all these years. It's a great game to have on the go too. I couldn't recommend this game more.",

Mostly the combat is too simple to be interesting but since the game isn't long so it doesn't hurt it much (aside from the Titan units).\n\nOverall I'd probably rate it around an 9/10 (for its age, 8/10 if you don't want to be as generous)",

To put it bluntly, I barely got it to work, but it was still a bit of a charm. Of course, later I replayed it a few more times, only with a stronger computer configuration, like now, the last time but in the digital version.\r\nBefore this video game, I was never interested in batman or the universe in general, but I can say that after this game I could hardly wait for the next one, looked at the lore on the net, of course I played every next one. Yes, one detail, after this game, batman's right hand is enlarged in all subsequent titles, except origins, precisely because of the titan that the joker injected him with at the end of the game.\r\nNow as for the rating, in my opinion this one is somehow the best because of the nostalgia, also the gothic architecture and so on, it's a bit of a horror at times, especially for me who was in elementary school at the time. Of course, Arkham City is better and bigger in every way, it just worked on improving the formula, so I think most people choose this as the best, and as for Batman Arkham Knight, of course the graphics. This is like the Assassin's Creed series. In my opinion, the Ezio trilogy was the best. First AC2 as the beginning, then Brotherhood which improved a lot of things and finally Revelations which just added a lot of little things just so there is some progress, Hook Blade is great, but the tower defense and the pile of bombs is something that I don't think most people liked that much. Of course, younger generations who didn't grow up with this, but with the RPG model of the Assassins Creed series, think that these are good games, but tastes differ.\r\nA huge recommendation for this game, it's not expensive, there are usually a lot of discounts for the trilogy (except for the originals), buy it, try it, you will have an incredible experience if you plan to play the other sequels, this is like an introduction to the main story, especially since there is an easter egg with a map of the next game and of course the continuation of the story.",

A lot of it still really holds up, mostly in graphics. Beautifully detailed environments. Excellent character animations, especially in cutscenes and combat. Though, the lip sync is pretty rough throughout. Great music and sound. Writing and premise is overall campy, very much like the classic comics that inspired it. If it weren't for the top-notch voice cast, it would be more unbearable. But if that's totally your thing, I can see why some would favorite this one.\r\n\r\nGameplay is a little rough. They discovered a brilliant combat system and laid the groundwork for the future installments to evolve with. But it is WAY too easy to lose your combo. Especially when the key to counter is the same key to aim your tool. And ESPECIALLY when your attacks can be interrupted by just about anything else. Stealth holds up much better. But there's no smoke pellets, so if you're caught, there's often very little you can really do to get away and/or into hiding again.\r\n\r\nMost boss battles are repetitive and underwhelming. Aesthetically, I LOVE the Scarecrow encounters. But mechanically, they are my least favorite part. Killer Croc's section took way too long. Same with Poison Ivy's fight. Hate her plant pods that appear around the island. Final boss with Joker had cool contextual moments and details, but it was a very basic fight.\r\n\r\nRiddler's \"challenges,\" outside of the visual scanning puzzles like riddles and question marks, are mostly uninspired. Over 100 trophies just lying around in plain sight, with most of them behind walls that only the upgraded Batclaw can break through, in sections that take a LOT of backtracking to get to. None of them are genuine puzzles or challenges.\r\n\r\n7/10 Overall, I still enjoy Asylum, especially in context of the Arkham trilogy.

The best BATMAN game out there that lead to a marvelous 4 game series. This game redefined the stealth and combat mechanics of  stealth action adventure games. Many games that came later were inspired by the combat system of the Arkham games (The Shadow of Mordor/War games, Spider-Man games, Ghost of Tsushima games etc). The story is peak. The voice acting is on point (RIP Kevin Conroy), the graphics still hold up almost two decades later. A must play title and series.

      "review": "Some games are just lightning in a bottle. They stick with you long after the credits roll, and for me, one of those defining titles was Batman: Arkham Asylum. I remember playing it when I was younger, the darkness and gothic architecture of the island feeling massive and terrifying. Now, revisiting it years later, I'm genuinely surprised by how profoundly well it holds up. This isn't just a great superhero game; it’s a brilliant piece of interactive storytelling.\r\n\r\nThe premise is simple but genius: Batman traps himself in the asylum with all his greatest foes. This isolated, claustrophobic setting is the engine of the game’s enduring success. The atmosphere is thick with menace, perfectly blending the Caped Crusader's gritty reality with the gothic horror of Arkham itself.\r\n\r\nThe Perfect Blend of Tone\r\n\r\nWhat really makes Arkham Asylum shine is its masterful control of tone. It’s undeniably dark—the Joker’s plan is horrifying, Killer Croc’s lair is genuinely unnerving, and the psychological profiles of the villains provide a deep sense of dread. Yet, nestled within that darkness is the signature, biting humor that defines Batman’s universe. Harley Quinn's manic dialogue, the Joker's twisted monologues, and the constant back-and-forth between Batman and his rogue's gallery provide necessary, sharp levity, ensuring the relentless atmosphere never becomes exhausting.\r\n\r\nThe Voices of Gotham\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of those monologues—you absolutely cannot talk about this game without celebrating the voice acting. Kevin Conroy is Batman, delivering a performance that is firm, weary, and utterly iconic. Mark Hamill’s portrayal of the Joker is arguably his best; he oscillates between playful clown and homicidal psychopath with terrifying ease, defining the character for a generation of players. Their chemistry is the soul of the game, elevated by stunning performances from the entire cast, including Arleen Sorkin as Harley Quinn. These voices are the reason the game felt so cinematic and real, and they still sound pitch-perfect today.\r\n\r\nThe Enduring Legacy\r\n\r\nBeyond the story and the performances, the core mechanics laid the groundwork for the modern action-adventure genre. The \"Freeflow\" combat is still satisfyingly brutal, making you feel like a martial arts master, and the \"Predator\" stealth challenges remain tense and clever puzzle boxes.\r\n\r\nBatman: Arkham Asylum is more than just a nostalgic trip. It is a benchmark of comic book adaptation, a masterclass in atmospheric design, and a reminder that when you nail the fundamentals—great story, perfect casting, and satisfying gameplay—you create something truly timeless. It holds up not just as a wonderful memory, but as a masterpiece.",

The story is still nice and tight, the combat still flows well and encounters are still great. The island is still just as nice to look and there is plenty to explore. The voice acting remains on point as well and I don't think there is a performance that really misses its mark.\r\n\r\nThe only real complaint I have is that the boss fights can feel a little trivial sometimes. A lot of the fights rely on fairly similar gimmicks using the batarangs. Partial spoilers for a game that's more than a decade and a half old at this point. For example the encounter, while not technically a fight, with Killer Croc springs to mind. The set piece of the fight is nice but all it takes is throwing a batarang to send him back into the water. The encounter ramps up a little there after but isn't super difficult. The actual boss fights of the game, for the most part, can kind of function the same ways.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Arkham Asylum was a great showing of what superhero games could be when it came out and it still holds up well today. Its not the longest game in the world, even if your 100% the Riddler trophies, but I would argue that for the money even back in the day its not a lacking experience in any shape or form.

I thought this title would be a open world action game (something like Mad Max, Sleeping Dogs) or perhaps a good stealth game like Dishonored or Styx:Master of Shadows, or perhaps an RPG with main and side quests.  But this is just a cartony action-adventure detective game with many platforming elements and a combo-based combat. \n\nIt's not a bad game mind you, it's actually solid and polished for the time it was made. The story is decent, they invested alot in voice actors and cut scenes, but it's mostly made for the die-hard fans of the Batman cartoon. It's not something that would be exiting for anybody else, in my opinion. \nGraphics is surprisingly bad. It's dimly, devoid of details. It's night during the entire story. Sound is good. \n\nThe thing that I really didn't like is the combat. It's just combo-based button mashing. It's clearly adjusted for gamepads. You can beat the game with keyboard and mouse on normal but it becomes a little tedious towards the end when you have to fight entire groups of thugs. The block and counter mechanism is key but many times the game didn't register my block. I had to re-do many fights, some a few times. Batman has some gadgets but they don't do any damage to enemies, they are only there to distract the enemies. I never understood why in the cartoon batman fights barehanded all the time. Why not using a high tech melee weapon or firearm? Also it's ridiculous how Batman doesn't ever kill those persistent criminals who do mass murder or destruction to Gotham City. He just incapacitates enemies, locks them up in a jail or mental hospital, but they always escape and the entire cycle is repeated.\nAlso I don't like the checkpoints saving system and the fact that you can't heal yourself (you heal only when a certain fight or subsection of the story is over).  You can level up and unlock some skills but they are mostly irrelevant. \n\nI found the gameplay only mildly entertaining. It's always a bad sign when you can't wait to be done with a game. The core of the mechanics is searching for clues, stealth parts ( you are put in a large location with many enemies and you have to incapacitate them quietly one by one), combo-fighting large groups and fighting bosses (there is always only 1 way to beat each of them, so it's meh). \nAll that is heavily flooded with boring side activities like solving puzzles and finding trophies, because without them the story would be actually pretty short. Most of the puzzles aren't hard to solve, but I didn't like how you have to backtrack a lot to find those \"secrets\", because in the beginning you don't have the required gadgets to reach many parts of the map. \n\nTo conclude. It's a mediocre game. There is a lot of production value. Solving secrets unlocks 3D models and many biographic cards/reports (presentations of every batman villain in history). So you can learn alot about the world of Batman. There is a subsection with challenges, and those are extra fights and stealth parts that you can play for a high score. But certainly it's not something I would specifically recommend to anybody except the fans of the cartoon.",

He just incapacitates enemies, locks them up in a jail or mental hospital, but they always escape and the entire cycle is repeated.\nAlso I don't like the checkpoints saving system and the fact that you can't heal yourself (you heal only when a certain fight or subsection of the story is over).  You can level up and unlock some skills but they are mostly irrelevant. \n\nI found the gameplay only mildly entertaining. It's always a bad sign when you can't wait to be done with a game. The core of the mechanics is searching for clues, stealth parts ( you are put in a large location with many enemies and you have to incapacitate them quietly one by one), combo-fighting large groups and fighting bosses (there is always only 1 way to beat each of them, so it's meh). \nAll that is heavily flooded with boring side activities like solving puzzles and finding trophies, because without them the story would be actually pretty short. Most of the puzzles aren't hard to solve, but I didn't like how you have to backtrack a lot to find those \"secrets\", because in the beginning you don't have the required gadgets to reach many parts of the map. \n\nTo conclude. It's a mediocre game. There is a lot of production value. Solving secrets unlocks 3D models and many biographic cards/reports (presentations of every batman villain in history). So you can learn alot about the world of Batman. There is a subsection with challenges, and those are extra fights and stealth parts that you can play for a high score. But certainly it's not something I would specifically recommend to anybody except the fans of the cartoon.",

But if you are like me visiting a family member with spotty internet, the game will kick you from the game if you drop your network connection for a second. I would much rather be told I lost internet connection and continue on with the game, but for some reason it will send me back to main menu forcing me to select the save file I was working on and spawn me to my last check point. Some times that check point is really far from where I was. I hope they fix this because I am sure plenty of people are having this issue but don't comment on it. (Negative review only for the PSA)",
