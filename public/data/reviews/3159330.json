I'm enjoying exploring, and doing side quests, and sneaking around as Naoe the way Assassin's Creed games are supposed to be.\n\nThat being said, whoever designed the combat for this entry forgot what Assassin's Creed is about. Playing on normal difficulty, the combat doesn't feel like AC. It feels like a soulslike game. If this was a soulslike franchise I'd understand, but I don't play AC for forced boss fights that are 90% dodge rolling while you slowly, excruciatingly, chip away at someone whose skin is made of steel. If I wanted soulslike, no offense but there are better options. \n\nAnyways, since you can tune combat difficulty separate from the other options, it's at least salvageable, but I sincerely hope this kind of design doesn't become their new trend.",

But if you put all that aside, it’s actually quite an interesting game.\r\n\r\nThe story is solid engaging enough.\r\nThere are plenty of side quests and contracts, and I really like how well they’re put together.\r\nThe combat system is a mixed bag: sometimes it shines, sometimes it frustrates. Still, it’s flashy, and I’m usually excited to get into a fight rather than annoyed by it.\r\n\r\nThe only real downside for me is the level-gating. High-level areas simply aren’t worth visiting ahead of time.\r\nStealth is the weakest part of the game: sometimes it’s trivial, and sometimes hiding becomes impossible, even when no one is actually looking at you.\r\n\r\nThe world has become more complex and varied - lots of activities, seasonal changes that enhance both visuals and gameplay.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are bugs. A game of this scale simply cannot exist without them. I’ve never seen a completely bug-free open-world game. Even the much-praised RDR2 is full of bugs - we just tend to overlook them.\r\n\r\nThe music is excellent, though Ubisoft rarely misses the mark in that department.\r\n\r\nI’d give this game a 7 out of 10 \r\n not perfect, but undeniably engaging.",

      "review": "Shadows — the Assassin’s Creed of feudal Japan.\nNaoe and Yasuke. Between Kuji-kiri and Katas, between corrupt bandits and samurai clans, between conspiracies and dark secret organizations working against the empire.\n\nFor me — and of course in this review I am speaking only for myself — Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the best Assassin’s Creed I have ever played.\n\nI can’t relate to all the “criticisms” and reviews from gaming journalists. Most of them are completely exaggerated, and the community often just repeats what they hear instead of forming their own opinion.\n\nA quick word about myself: I discovered AC around 2012 and started with AC III. Definitely one of the great entries, but in my personal ranking it’s fairly far down the list. I played AC Black Flag only during long gaming nights at a good friend’s house, never on my own — but it was still a unique Assassin’s Creed. After that, I took a long break and truly came back with AC Origins. And I was hooked. I’ve always been fascinated by history, and seeing Assassin’s Creed brought to ancient Egypt was simply brilliant. It’s definitely one of the most beautiful AC titles ever released.\n\nWith Origins followed by Odyssey, Ubisoft did so much right, and I played both entries for countless hours. But an Assassin’s Creed with samurai and ninjas had always been a “childhood wish” of mine. I’ve been fascinated by that era of human history since I was young, and I always hoped Ubisoft would give us exactly that kind of Assassin’s Creed. Few settings fit the Assassin’s Creed fantasy better than feudal Japan.\n\nAnd finally, it’s here.\nThe story is incredibly well written. The emotional journey with Naoe — dealing with the murder of her father, the brutality of war, the destruction, and the suffering of civilians — combined with the story of the unusual samurai Yasuke, constantly motivates you to keep going.\n\nThe combat mechanics and finisher moves are consistently fun every single time they happen. The game keeps offering challenges, and the balance between a stealthy assassin silently eliminating targets and a samurai who can crush five or six enemies at once is just awesome.\n\nThe hideout-building system offers hours of satisfaction as you construct your own little “domain” in the middle of Japan.\n\nThe world looks absolutely beautiful. Roaming and riding through the landscapes is pure joy. The seasons and the corresponding loading screens during transitions are visually stunning — like walking through a living painting.\n\nAt the time of writing, I haven’t finished the Claws of Awaji DLC yet, but even the beginning and the new island continue to add excitement to the game. After AC Valhalla, this feels like the right answer. Valhalla wasn’t bad, but it was clearly a step back compared to its predecessors. Shadows, for me, makes it a delight to jump back in again and again, and it fulfilled all my expectations, hopes, and wishes for an Assassin’s Creed set in Japan.\n\nFor me personally — a fully subjective opinion — this AC is number one and definitely my favorite in the entire series.\nI hope Ubisoft continues on this path and that the upcoming titles will be just as good as AC Shadows.\n\nWith that said, thank you for taking the time to read this review. Feel free to check out my profile, and I wish you all the best — stay healthy!\n\nKDB",

      "review": "Why do we continue to play Assassin's Creed franchise?\nMaybe it's not wrong to oppose Ubisoft's policies in the first place, but we shouldn't forget that Assassin's Creed, with all its shortcomings, has given us beautiful years, and perhaps after all these years, it is still very enjoyable to experience a new work from this popular franchise, at least for me.\n\nShadows, unfortunately, is far from the core of Assassin's Creed, as if it were a prelude to a more detailed game that has not yet been released. I understand that Japan fever and samurai and shinobi culture have been sweeping the world for some time, and Ubisoft wanted to get a share of this trend.\n\nAfter all this, Assassin's Creed Shadows has become a good game in its own right. An attractive combat system with unique weapon and clothing designs for both characters.\nSide missions that this time were not boring to me like in previous games, and a deep and extremely beautiful design of the environment that dazzles the eye, although the weakness of parkour in navigating this environment should not be overlooked.\n\nThe stealth system and many options for doing it caught my attention a lot. Even up to this point, after 150 hours of game experience, I still haven't gotten enough of the game's attractive stealth tricks.\n\nThe great attention to the character's personality, especially Naoe, makes the player not take the story lightly and try to get to know each character and their relationship with the main character of the game. However, the motion capture of the characters often appears disappointing, and the voice acting of the game, at least the English dub, is such that the characters' voices do not dissolve in the ambiance of the environment, and as a musician and sound engineer, this weakness of the voice acting was very clear to me.\n\nOverall, for me, who has been immersed in the world of this franchise for nearly 20 years, the game was extremely enjoyable and I recommend it to action-adventure fans.",

Being able to play stealthy one moment and then switch to a more direct combat approach keeps it fresh and fun. Both styles feel refined, not like one was just added on top of the other.\n\nThe game looks fantastic, The visuals are truly stunning where the atmosphere pulls you in immediately, and the soundtrack supports everything without overdoing it. Parkour and stealth finally feel closer to what AC used to be while still feeling modern. I haven’t had any performance issues and even the smaller side content has been worth my time.\n\nIf you’ve liked any of the stronger and older AC titles or just want a well-made open world action game, I’d honestly recommend this.",

      "review": "I bought this game on sale because i wanted something to hold me over until i can play ghost of Yotei. I had completely written this game off, as I've grown tired of the Ubisoft open world formula and microtransaction filled shops, but figured I'd give the game its fair shot once it hit a sale. I have to say, I'm having fun. Is it as good as its competition? not really. Ghost of Tsushima has smoother combat that feels more grounded (most of the time) and better world design. But the combat is still fun, kicking people 30 feet backwards as yasuke is infinitely entertaining, and the steal gameplay with naoe is probably the best it's felt for me in a long time for this series. The story is the weaker part, its very predictable and feels like a story i've seen played out dozens of times, but its not necessarily bad (so far) and the voice acting is good enough, nothing glaringly bad that's taken me out of it. \r\n\r\nI've seen some reviews talk about poor performance, i haven't run into this but I do have a pretty beefy machine with a 4080 graphics card. The soundtrack is pretty good especially in combat engagements. \r\n\r\noverall its a solid game, and probably one of the better assassins creed games in recent years.

      "review": "[h1] Canon Mode and Instant Assassinations Are Your Friends [/h1]\n[h2] turn these on and you'll have a more true Assassin's Creed in a modern world of open world slopfests [/h2]\n\nLet me start of by saying that you should not buy this game unless it's on sale. For what it manages to accomplish as the best option of the Open World RPG Looter AC games, it's story falls very-very-flat until the 11th hour, as it makes it glaringly obvious that the Open World RPG Looter AC Games (yet again) fail to capitalize and capture the essence of what makes Assassin's Creed \"[b]Assassin's Creed[/b]\".\n\nI sunk a total in-game hours at around 73.5hrs with total play-time at 101.5hrs, between my lengthy pauses, other idling, in-game time is measured by active in-world time. Let it be known I played with the new Advanced Parkour update, Canon Mode, and Instant Assassinations turned on. I am a core believer that you cannot have an Assassin's Creed game where you cannot [b]assassinate[/b] your target. In a game. About Assassins. and killing targets. As well as removing dialog options from Assassin's Creed 'cause that's not what The Animus is supposed to be. You don't get to choose history, it already happened. Also social stealth was once again abandoned. \"hide in plain sight\"....yeah....lol. Also Animus Confession scenes still don't exist.\n\nAn Assassin's Creed game that forgets entirely what Assassin's Creed is about.\n\nThis brings me to my first hatred that modern-day AC games need to stop, excluding Mirage from this conversation.\n\nIn regards to the main antagonists, \"The Shinbakufu\", only 1 out of the entire 12 are you actually allowed to Assassinate freely as if it were a Black Box mission from previous entries like Mirage, Syndicate, or Unity. But it was ULTRA stripped down where you can bait the guy to you, and kill him. The rest of them are open combat boss fights with giant pools of health. For the love of all things Assassin's Creed [h3]STOP. DOING. THIS.[/h3] I don't care how many side-objectives there are in the game that allows me to Assassinate the target without an open boss fight, if the main targets say \"Assassinate [Person]\" as the objective, LET. ME. ASSASSINATE. THE. TARGET. IT'S NOT THAT HARD. The only other time it let me do this pulled me into a cutscene death of the target. Which is novel, sure, BUT I DIDN'T GET TO ASSASSINATE ANYONE ELSE.\n\n2nd problem I have with AC: Shadows is the music. There's nothing memorable about the music, and quite frequently pulls me out of the moment when some cross-genre music starts playing between traditional instruments and hip-hop. The only time I actually felt like the music fit properly was in the Epilogue of the game where Shadow's version of Ezio's Family plays. Ezio's Family is timeless, and occasionally the open world ambient music will play a few cords from it. But otherwise it's forgettable.\n\n3rd problem I have with Shadows is in regards to the story. Nothing about the story feels coherent enough to be a narrative driven AC game, 'cause the game bombards you with so many side-quests and Organizations that you have to take down. There are 17 side-organizational circles that are not The Shinbakufu. And the story doesn't follow a narrative structure at all until Act 3 and the Epilogue, which by that point the game is basically finished. Templars are relegated to side plots and THE LITERAL END OF THE GAME, and so are the Assassins. Don't expect this game to be about Assassins vs Templars, because it's not. Ignore the fact that this takes place after Ezio's and Shao Jun's time and the Assassin Brotherhood vs Templars has been going on for HUNDREDS OF YEARS BY NOW. At least you play as an Assassin this time, or the descendent of one. But you don't learn anything about the Japanese Brotherhood or Naoe's Assassin heritage until the 11th hour of the game. Also the Japanese Brotherhood, by time of the game, is already destroyed because of a twat's inability to reconcile with the fact he's single and socially inept that you, once again, don't learn about till the 11th hour of the game. Basically everything Assassin and Templar related activities are not until the end of the game, and when it was doing it...the game felt like Assassin's Creed again. But then the game ended.\n\nWhere's the rest?\n\nThe game just also...significantly lacks any cinematics at all, or maybe it was just too spaced out given how expansive the game world is. The majority of engagement you have with the game will be two characters talking face-to-face (standing or sitting) with no other animations other than their face with procedurally generated movements. There's no walking and talking, nor set pieces engaged with.\n\nWhile I can continuously go on about how bad modern-day Assassin's Creed games have become, but I will talk about the good.\n\nI like the characters (except Gennojo), but the vast majority of them, including the antags, were forgettable. At least the way they were laid out, the allies are okay. Canon Mode completely disables romances in all forms, which I'm glad 'cause I don't care about that. Anyways, Gennojo sucks. He's some developer's self-insert asshole who's trying to be Robin Hood but kills himself in a fit of rage and starves poor people as an act of sticking-it-to-the-man and the game wants us to feel bad about it? He's also a womanizer. The game literally labels him as a womanizer in his description. Worst alley in the history of Assassin's Creed.\n\nThe Ally System returns, but it needs some TLC. Characters aren't Assassins. They do not act as such. Only one of them actually is, but all the characters just spawn in with a cloud of smoke when called instead of running in from off-camera.\n\nThe armors and cosmetics in the game, really good. Naoe's especially. Wish there were some with a little less rope and knives everywhere, but overall no complaints. I got the Assassin Initiate and Apprentice Robes and never took them off until the end when I got Naoe's Master Assassin robes.\n\nThe parkour was...better and then got some TLC from the devs post launch, which Mirage will also be getting, and it made it felt good again. Parkour gave us autonomy again. Expression. Though the world itself didn't allow for much, I hope the changes are carried into the future. So it's less thinking about \"why wasn't this in the game at launch\" and more appreciation that Shadows got it when it did to future proof the series. Parkour and Social Stealth are key foundations of the Assassin's Creed series. Now we're finally back to a reasonable and enjoyable version of Parkour. Let's bring back Social Stealth again.\n\nDon't really have any complaints about the world design other than how ridiculous it is to try to go from viewpoint to viewpoint in mountainous regions that can slide you all the way back down, making the only reasonable path to travel is the one the guidance path sets for you.",

This game is not innovative in the ways some probably hope, but it is still a good game and as you can tell by how many hours I've put into it, I enjoy it a lot. \n\nUbisoft did a really good job with designing Japan. It's one of the most beautiful games I've played and that makes it even more fun to explore. Stealth is fun, combat is fun, the story is decent, side content is meh, and I found the character progression and gear system to be fun.\n\nIf you're not a fan of the AC RPG games, then this review doesn't matter anyways because the odds of you buying this game are slim, but I would recommend this to fans of AC, as well as fans of the setting. Everyone who says this game is terrible are lying. It's flawed, but it's not terrible.",

      "review": "The entire conversation around Ubisoft and assassins creed is so muddy. People have trouble separating the company from the game and their own weird hang ups on social stuff.\n\nAs far as Ubisoft is concerned I'm totally on board with the hate. Personally I don't care enough to boycott because this is my hobby and at the end of the day Im not looking to to turn my hobby into social/economic activism.\n\nAs far as the weird discourse around yosuke in ac shadows... Idk, from what I've seen most of the discourse has to do with his race and whether or not the historical figure existed or not. Not too much commentary on the character himself. He did exist (read the Wikipedia entry) and the only way I can see using that as an argument is to back pedal so you can claim your not racist. This is the only part of the discussion I completely disregard as absurd and not worth entertaining.\n\nThen we have critic of the game itself, which is the only part I care about. To be completely fair and objective, none of the AC games are terrible. Some are better than others, sure, but if the franchise existed seperated from Ubisoft and we looked at any particular entry to said series as an individual game and not the repeated formulaic  vash grab that it is, they are all just kinda okay. The only exception being the first few which were actually doing something new and interesting, so more than okay I'd say.\n\nMy main beef with the game franchise itself is reusing the same formula over and over with very little innovation. The entire abastergo plot was obviously stretched for the sake of continuity (it was supposed to end with the third game) was really holding the series back. The main story itself always seem to play things very safe and stay away from anything too deep (hard to fault them for this though considering all it took was having a black MC for people to have a fit).\n\nOverall I think shadows is the best AC game we've had since Black flag. Its still not great In the sense it's not doing anything ground breaking, and much like other iterations it plays things very safe with the story. But at least as far as the franchise is concerned they are trying some new things and the stealth is actually good in this one! Something I personally really appreciate as a fan of the mostly dead stealth game genre (like thief and splinter cell). Playing as Naomi really feels like an actual stealth game not just a game where stealth is an option.",

The main story however feels cut off in the end, and is just not satisfying. The character's IMO are pretty well written and interesting, especially for the two leads: Naoe and Yasuke. The open world content really mixes well with this game's strengths. When you play as Naoe, the stealth and parkour options are amazing, the best in the series by a mile. Her combat capabilities are also great upon leveling up. Using Yasuke in the other hand, you can brute force your way to a target or castle/fort. His stealth and parkour capabilities unfortunately, are almost non-existent so I pretty much play as Naoe throughout the game. The seasons are also greatly implemented, changing not only the environment but also your playstyle since it affects enemy visibility (both ways), patrol patterns Never much bothered with the base building, but from what I've experienced, there are a ton of customization options for them like putting a cat with Ezio clothing (upon unlocking in the Animus Anomaly section).\n\n---{ Graphics }---\n☐ You forget what reality is\n☑ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Bad\n☐ Don‘t look too long at it\n☐ MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n☐ Very good\n☑ Good\n☐ It's just gameplay\n☐ Mehh\n☐ Watch paint dry instead\n☐ Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n☐ Eargasm\n☑ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n☐ Kids\n☑ Teens\n☑ Adults\n☐ Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n☐ Check if you can run paint\n☐ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☑ Fast\n☐ Rich boi\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Game Size }---\n☐ Floppy Disk\n☐ Old Fashioned\n☐ Workable\n☐ Big\n☑ Will eat 15% of your 1TB hard drive\n☐ You will want an entire hard drive to hold it\n☐ You will need to invest in a black hole to hold all the data\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n☐ Just press 'W'\n☐ Easy\n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☑ Significant brain usage\n☐ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n☐ Nothing to grind\n☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isn't necessary to progress\n☑ Average grind level\n☐ Too much grind\n☐ You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n☐ No Story\n☐ Some lore\n☑ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☐ It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee\n☐ Short\n☐ Average\n☑ Long\n☐ To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n☐ It's free!\n☐ Worth the price\n☑ If it's on sale\n☐ If u have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☐ You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n☐ Never heard of\n☑ Minor bugs\n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ ARK: Survival Evolved\n☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n☐ 1\n☐ 2\n☐ 3\n☐ 4\n☐ 5\n☐ 6\n☐ 7\n☑ 8\n☐ 9\n☐ 10",

I've been a long time AC fan, and I must give AC Shadows (and the dev team behind the game) its due credit for evolving the game even further while still keeping the core stuff intact. No doubt everything looks and feels much more refined than previous games with fresh new game mechanics like the weather system. The game is huge and I'm one of those who won't complain that the map is massive, that there's too many things to do, or that the game just takes too long to finish. I typically play during my free time, and I enjoy exploring the map, visiting towns, while going about doing one of the many side quests or main missions. Notably, the game is really fun with all the parkour goodies, the sword fights are refreshing compared to previous settings, the graphics are amazing, and I have to say, upping the stealth difficulty makes it more realistic. Honestly, this game is not meant to be finished in record time; explore at your own pace, feel the world and all its quirks (sometimes even bugs because we don't live in a perfect world, so just restart the game or your PC altogether, and quit complaining like a spoiled brat), and ultimately it's about making sure you get your hard-earned money's worth knowing that it's time well spent during your downtime before you have to get up and face the world again.

Is it the same Assassin’s Creed I fell in love with years ago? Not really. Shadows drifts even further away from the spirit of Valhalla and Mirage, carving its own path in a way that might feel strange to long-time fans. Yes, it’s slower, yes, it’s a bit duller in places, but it’s definitely not trash. As someone who’s been a fan of the series from the very beginning, I still find something to love here.

Every swing feels heavy, grounded, and brutal in the best way.\n\nNaoe is the exact opposite: sneaky, patient, stealth-focused, and just as deadly. Her toolkit feels believable, grounded, and incredibly satisfying when everything clicks.\n\nThe story has a Game-of-Thrones vibe — lots of political tension, shifting alliances, and character-driven moments that make the world feel alive. And the world itself? Massive, beautiful, and atmospheric. Every region has its own mood, and the graphics really push the sense of place.\n\nWhat this reminds me of most is Odyssey’s freedom — that same feeling of approaching any challenge however you want, without the game forcing a specific style. Shadows gives you the freedom to be a ghost, a tank, or bounce between the two.\n\nIf you like big, open-world adventures with great characters and tons of ways to play, I absolutely recommend this game.",

Now, i fully recognize that i did not fully play the game as intended by the creators, but i feel that if the option to play a certain way is there, it should still be a good experience. \n\nThe story of the game had some stronger points but overall was very weak to me. I felt unable to really care about the characters and thus i didn't feel invested in the story at all. \n\nThe gameplay was where i started to get annoyed. As mentioned before i didn't play in the intended \"exploration mode\" (i played with guided exploration on) as to make the game easier for myself. The gameplay of both the story and side content felt very repetitive, most of the gameplay felt like travelling with some cutscenes in between trips. I think at the very least 40% of my playtime consists of walking/riding to the next marker on my map, watching a cutscene and going to the next marker again. This is why it took me around 6 months to complete the story. I could just not get myself to keep playing for more than 1-1.5 hour(s) without getting bored of walking.\n\nHowever Ubisoft has been great in listening to their fans with this game, the amount of things added/tweaked after fans asked for it is absolutely great. I also enjoyed the free content they added with collabs etc. I have yet to start the free dlc i got with my pre order since im afraid it will consist of more travelling. \n\nOverall i'd give this game a 6.5/10 therefore i clicked recommend and if you really want to play it i'd recommend buying it on sale.",

Até o momento, o jogo conta com dois: o de Dead by Daylight, trazendo o temido Oni como killer, e o melhor de todos, o crossover com Attack on Titan, que ficou simplesmente excelente. Essas jogo foi capaz de reacender a esperança de quem jogar ele e deram novo fôlego à saga dos Assassinos.",

And if you look for the culprit of this visual splendor, your gaze involuntarily turns to her heart — Japan.\r\n\r\nUbisoft developers have invested in the setting not just love, but deep respect for the aesthetics and atmosphere of the land of the rising sun. From the snow—capped peaks of Kyoto to the misty bamboo groves, from the graceful Zen gardens to the bustling streets, every pixel here breathes harmony, contrast and the restrained power of Japanese culture.\r\n\r\nLight and shadow, rain and sakura, silence and a sudden storm — everything works to create a world that you don't just want to play in, but into which you want to immerse yourself over and over again, as if flipping through an ancient scroll. Even comparison with such visual masterpieces as Ghost of Tsushima does not look like rivalry, but like a dialogue between two poets of the same era.\r\n\r\nAssassin's Creed Shadows is not just a new chapter in the series. This is a visual manifesto that proves that the open world can be not only large-scale, but also truly beautiful. And yes, most of this beauty is due to Japan, its aesthetics and spirit.",

Yasuke's playstyle does not fit in with any of the Assassin's Creed games at all. Having said that, Naoe, the female shinobi has a very subtle and stealthy playstyle and has been very enjoyable to play.

It does get somewhat repetitive but it's mostly interesting and fun to explore. Naoe and Yasuke are also nice characters and some of the story scenes are well done. Overall the story wasn't always landing for me though, devolving into excuses to go fight different people despite some interesting character stories.\r\n\r\nYasuke's gameplay feels kind of odd for the kind of game this is. It's fun a few times but rarely is going in swinging the approach that makes sense. I found myself mostly playing Naoe and avoiding Yasuke unless he was required for quests. For a while the stealth assassin gameplay is fun but it quickly gets tedious and almost everything you do for the entire game is walk to where a target is and assassinate or fight them. Combat is okay but your choice is either easy or tedious settings for difficulty.\r\n\r\nIt's also been a struggle just to run the game sometimes with the Ubisoft launcher failing to start for no real reason. At least on Steam it would be great if Ubisoft just supported standard cloud saves and had the option to skip their launcher.\r\n\r\nA lot of nice things that don't really come together is how I would describe this overall.

It's a bad review because I disagree with fundamental game design choices that Ubisoft has continued making. I paid for the game, so of course I'm going to complete it, but I have many gripes about it. I disagree whole heartedly with company direction and choices being made from the top down.\n\nEarlier Assassin's Creed titles were fantastic for their story telling elements. The gameplay was boring and repetitive but we suffered through them for the story elements. I have in several times in my life summarized the first AC title as \"Climb a tower, eavesdrop, kill someone. Repeat.\" What made the game fun was the concept. Ever since the games have gone to this \"open world RPG\" model, we have seen the AC main story elements take a backseat to whatever regional/cultural story, which I can only assume is an attempt at better character and world building. In my eyes, this fails as an Assassin's Creed title. Much like Valhalla could have just as easily been a stand alone title viking game outside of the AC universe, Shadows could have easily been just another feudal Japan ninja game. With neither of your main characters having any solid foundation with the Assassins Brotherhood, there is no emotional connection to the creed. They're literally making it up as they go, with just some random text documents they find along the way.\n\nBring back the creed and stop selling us side story filler episodes.",

While the game has an appearance of a piece of entertainment trying to tell a story, the game itself and how they tell the story do not respect your time or intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe map is way too big and divides and bloats the story and gameplay in unnecessary ways. You will need to travel great distances in order to continue the story. Most areas will be too high level so you will need to do side missions liberate castles to get experiences. Naoe is too weak in combat but Yasuke is too strong. While Naoe can do amazing parkour, she will go jump or fall down places you won't want her too. Yasuke, will just charge and break things like the Incredible Hulk.\r\n\r\nEven during cutscenes you can't take this game seriously. You will notice poor animations on NPCs or characters doing things they shouldn't in the background. Some cutscenes, Ubisoft uses music that is very out of place and ruins the mood of the action or story telling. There was even a point where Yasuke reminisced about a past event where he had to kill assassins in the castle he was in. When the past event was over, I went to that area where in the past he killed the assassins and the bodies where there..in the present! I even had to do a mission involving a duel and the game played a cutscene leading up to it. When the fight began, out of nowhere, two guards appeared , ignored my opponent and joined him in fighting me despite the fact this supposed to be an honorable duel between two samurai. I died and when the game reloaded, it forced the cutscene and the two guards appeared again. \r\n\r\nAs for the stealth, the enemies will see you way too fast and Naoe is so weak in the beginning that the best thing to do is stealth kill as much as you can but when, not if, but when you are noticed, do damage and run away and hide and repeat. The AI is very dumb you can just attack, run away and attack again. Just don't take this game serious and you will be rewarded. \r\n\r\nI did love this game when it first came out but Ghost of Yotei came and it really showed me how much of a joke this game is in comparison. I have been saying for a long time that Assassins Creed was my guilty pleasure game series and I have played them all but I think I am done. I may still try to beat Shadows but I haven't heard a single person say anything good about how this game ends. \r\n\r\nIn case you forgot, since Assassins Creed 3, the modern day is still waiting for the human civilization to be reset by the god from the first civilization and the modern day protagonist got replaced by Basim who is Loki reincarnated. I'm about 20 hours in and Shadows hasn't even acknowledged any of that. Ubisoft, you had a chance to change your formula and suckers like me bought into you finally taking Assassins Creed to Japan but you guys just need to go away.

For reference, I used to be obsessed with the AC franchise growing up; I played 1-3 and everything in between (Revelations, Brotherhood, etc). This game is a bit more enjoyable if you pretend it's just some adventure RPG held in feudal Japan. Other than that, it lacks a lot of aspects that I would've expected from an AC title; you can't even do the leap of faith from a sync point.\n\nThe story doesn't feel that captivating. I tried to be immersed and pay attention in the beginning, but at some point I just ended up skipping dialogue. The only thing that I would watch were the actual cinematic cut scenes. The side missions are so easy to dismiss that they don't feel worth doing unless they have equipment as reward.\n\nIf you don't have the fast travel unlocked, I hope you have a 2nd monitor or your phone nearby. I'm glad they give you a mount to use, and on top of that, allow to auto follow the road. Unfortunately, if the location you have to go is far without a fast travel, your horse is gonna be galloping for some time. There was a point where my destination was at a whole different, undiscovered area so I set my horse to auto-follow. I went downstairs to use the bathroom, prepared some food and eat, just to come back and find that I was barely passed halfway.\n\nSome things that I did like:\n\nI actually enjoyed the movement for Naoe. When I saw the trailer for movement, I was genuinely interested in the game. Even though it's not as fluid as I thought, it was still very enjoyable. \n\nThe inventory/customization has got to be my favorite feature in this game. I really appreciate being able to equip items and customizing them by using other pieces from items you have, and I mean OTHER PIECES. I like how you can change things from the handle, stilt, blade, and even sheathe of your katana, etc. to make it your own while keeping the stats of your equipped item.\n\nThe game does look nice. It did take some tweaking in the setting to prevent it from crashing all the time, but once I was able to play a few hours with no crash, it was enjoyable. \n\nAnyways, the main reason for the negative review is because Ubishit strikes again. I haven't played in about a week and I wanted to resume my playthrough. I had to log back in to my Ubisoft account and from then I was no longer able to open the game; not through Steam, Ubisoft client, or even the .exe file.

His backstory makes sense in the setting, and it doesn’t feel like he was just dropped in for the sake of it.\n\nI like that you can approach missions with either stealth or brute force depending on your playstyle. When it works, it feels like classic Assassin’s Creed.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe material grinding is atrocious. I spend more time farming resources to upgrade weapons than actually enjoying the story or exploring the world.\n\nThe Animus “gold” system makes it feel like the game is designed around time-gating and engagement metrics rather than fun. Logging in once a week for rewards feels more rewarding than actually playing, which is the opposite of how a game should feel.\n\nPerformance is rough, even on strong hardware. For a game this grind-heavy, the technical issues just make it worse.\n\nFinal Thoughts:This should have been the dream Assassin’s Creed set in Japan. The world is beautiful, the dual protagonists are interesting, and the stealth mechanics occasionally shine. But all of that potential is buried under endless grind, monetization hooks, and poor optimization.\n\nEven on sale, it’s not worth it. Once again, Ubisoft's greed ruins what could've been an amazing game.\n\nPlus: The cancelled ac game pmo\n\nHOWEVER! \n\nVisually, the game is great... If you've got a system that can handle it, and you are a more visually inclined gamer maybe this is for you...",

But all of that falls of when accompanied with a world that by today's standards, feels stale and repetitive, and it sucks because the environment is so dynamic and beautiful. But I do think the biggest problem is with how the main story missions are being done, giving us the choice to assassinate main targets in a non-chronological order makes it so that the story is not evolving, which is what makes the recent games so forgettable (but the first act was great with how linear it was).\n\nThese problems were okay with the first few RPG games, but repeating the same patterns just makes it worse and I'm hoping the next ones will change the formula.",

The views, graphics, seasonal changes and other aesthetically pleasing effects in this game are astounding. Ubisoft still outperforms with its world designs.\n\n2. Fighting is pretty good. Crisp, mostly smooth and the finishing techniques are brutal, especially with Yasuke. I do wish they added a few more animations for Naoe. \n\n3. Objectives, side  quests and main quests are plentiful. I'm definitely squeezing out a ton of hours in this game which makes the price tag a little more understanding. \n\n4. Yasuke's aura farming in this game is insane. Dude drips with the best gear, best moves, great acting and storyline. I don't mind forgetting this is an assassin's creed game as long as I can run through more doors and play baseball with the heads of my enemies.  \n\nCon's:\n\n1. The voice acting is absolute DOGWATER in this game. I listened to the English voice actors for all of five minutes before beating my ears with dubstep and a mallet so I could forget what I just heard. Even a lot of the Japanese dub in this game is unenthusiastic. Tons of missed opportunities to show some emotion. I can't really get into the characters aside from Yasuke who honestly carries the entire story so far. \n\n2. They 6-inch-punched the animation budget. By that I mean you can tell where animation was on point and then where Ubisoft said stop. By comparison, Mass Effect 3 had like 6 animations when having a conversation with NPC's and This game had like 3. \n\n3. The main quest storyline is pretty boring. Naoe's questline so far is just vengeance against some main antagonists. I'm sure there will be more to it later on in the story, but I am not really drawn into it. Like I said before, Yasuke's storyline is more enticing. \n\n4. I don't feel the risk of just walzing through an enemy camp and straight bludgeoning a primary target and then walking out like nothing happened. I'm not playing at a higher difficulty, but I sincerely miss the intense feel of escaping from a crime scene with dramatic music in the first Assassin's Creed. Should have just spawned endless hordes of enemies until you get bored/couldn't handle the amount and find a way to escape.  \n\n5. Music is meh. Some of the scores are cool, like activating a viewpoint. But you get random techno scores sometimes and it pulls me out of the immersion. Should've gotten the OG Jesper Kyd to compose some if he hasn't in this game. I'm too lazy to look up who all were included, seems like there were a ton.",

      "review": "Hello, I would like to advise both Steam employees and the majority of the community who frequently play open-world video games. I have been playing Assassin's Creed since I was very young, and I have been hearing about a decline in the franchise's quality. While I doubted it at first, I decided to give the new one a shot. Much to my surprise, I did not know how severe the downfall really was. The game's controls on the mouse and keyboard were so horrendous that I could not even change them, even to make a difference. The most logical option would be to switch to the controller. When I did this, I was met with the most atrocious key-bind setup that I have seen in decades. As I ventured around, I played the game, incorporating stealth and strategy as intended, only to realize it was me crouch-walking through bushes for ten minutes. The gameplay is unrewarding and forces you to take fights head-on, like in any other game. I would rather consume a vast amount of chemicals, go outside with a stick, and try to \"assassinate\" trees while hiding in bushes for three hours straight, then I would have more fun than a game with a vast number of both developers and financiers. For anyone reading this review, I would rather you give me $70 for nothing in return than buy this game, because that would be a better way to waste your money. Or, if time allows, get $70 and go to the casino, put it all on red, where you would be able to get at least your money's worth, even if you lose it all. If you win, just light the money on fire in front of one of the developers that made the game just for them to understand how much of a waste their abomination of a game truly is. On the other hand, the best thing about this game is that it will make you spend time with people around you, it fixes sleep schedules, and can help appreciate every other game that was created since the 80's for the sole reason that it is so horrendous of a game.",

This is a game that tries to check every possible box there is, trying to please every possible group, casting a net so wide that everyone should at least find SOMETHING of interest there. But this is exactly why Shadows fails on every front. \nWhen you make something for everyone you make something for no one. \nShadows has so many interesting ideas which never leave the idea stage during the game. Building your hideout: provides passive bonuses which can be neglected except for the smith to level up your gear; \ndual protagonist: one character excels at fighting (and is somewhat likeable) whereas the other can explore, sneak and decently fight (and is quite unlikable) BUT both are sooooo bland and have no character development at all; \nan objective board with many targets to find and assassinate: which results in 3 hints and you drop a scout into an area to give you the questmarker (or you disable that function and the game immediately gives you the questmarker skipping the unnecessary part).\nI am trying really hard but I cannot put into words how bland this game really is. During my roughly 78 hours there was not a single memorable moment, no music track that stood out, no area that was nice to look at, no mechanic that was insanely cool to use. Everything was just... there? The whole experience can be summarised into 3 steps: a passable intro --> busywork --> sudden, unsatisfactory end. \nIt really baffles me that people looked at this product and actually greenlit the ideas. Even while writing this review I have trouble figuring out who the actual target audience for this game is?\nAnyway... I would give this game a 2.5/10. If you don't know anything about Japan and maybe play one game per year you might want to try this game but only at a very high discount.

I have to say I really enjoyed the gameplay in this installment. Especially the moments when I had to sneak into enemy-restricted areas as Naoe. Ubisoft did a great job with the stealth mechanics, making them genuinely fun.\r\n\r\nThe world in this game is absolutely beautiful. They created a stunning depiction of feudal Japan—everywhere you go feels like a perfect photo opportunity. On top of that, they added seasonal and weather systems, which greatly enhance the beauty of the game world.\r\n\r\nHowever, the game also has many flaws. The world is vast and gorgeous, but it feels “empty.” Locations often come with repetitive tasks like gathering scrolls or paying respect at shrines,.... which quickly become boring.\r\n\r\nAs for the story, I have to be honest—it’s disappointing. The ending isn’t even clear; to me, it doesn’t feel like an ending at all. Where is the Isu technology? Where is the Assassin Brotherhood vs. Templar plot? Where are the modern-day connections? The villains in the game are not interesting and left no lasting impression on me.\r\n\r\nOverall, Naoe’s storyline feels unfinished, and Yasuke’s doesn’t really go anywhere either. That’s why Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, to me, isn’t special—it’s just a mid-tier game without anything remarkable.\r\n\r\nMy rating: 2/5.",

      "review": "Just another flop from Ubisoft, what a surprise...\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, this is much better than the last four \"Assassin's Creed\" \"games\". But it suffers from the fact that this is still not Assassin's Creed and the fact that this \"game\" is just another graphical showcase. If Ubisoft would spend five fucking minutes on ANYTHING other than graphics, then we would be good, but no.\n\nTo Ubisoft's credit, I actually don't outright hate the combat in this game. The combat is actually a little fun and engaging instead of outright enraging. I also Appreciate the customization in the settings. The fact that combat and stealth difficulties are separate, Canon Mode to give us the Assassin's Creed feel, Guaranteed Assassinations, etc. But that reminds me of a point I want to make. \n\nI like the fact that we can choose to make the hidden blade instakill (like it has been able to do for a decade straight for the first nine AC games...). But with the change to the combat system introduced in Origins, the drawn out fights with obnoxiously tanky enemies is getting really fucking old. Look, I get it. Combat for the first nine games was extremely easy (*cough cough* almost like the focus of Assassin's Creed is the story and not the combat *cough cough*). But being able to stab all the way through an enemy, deliver a salvo of devastating slashes, or shoot someone in the face, etc, and them continue on shafting you like nothing ever happened is a fantastic way to break the immersion. If you want difficult combat, then make combat focus on dodging, parrying, and penetrating armor instead of massive health pools. You know.. the historically accurate way to portray combat... \n\nSpeaking of historical accuracy...\n\nYou know what? I could go on and on about the roots of Assassin's Creed and how it's always been about sticking purely to historical accuracy (with a few \"minor\" caveats). But that is just fruit hanging so damn low that it's practically a tripping hazard in hell. So I'll leave that point alone.\n\nThe two character system. It's much better than the two character system from Syndicate. But once I was able to play as Yasuke, I only did so for about 5 hours. The Yasuke play style is very different from Naoe's. It's actually really cool to play as a tanky Samurai with a flashy fighting style, cool animations, and good voice acting (in Japanese anyway. I turned on the Immersive Mode once I heard how terrible the english dub was). But Naoe is just the superior character since she has Eagle Vision, the Hidden Blade, and her grapple hook. She's also much better at parkour and stealth. It could be argued that Yasuke has his place since he's such a powerful warrior. But once you get good with the (rather complex) combat system, he just becomes almost completely irrelevant if it weren't for the story, side quests and side activities that require you to play as him. Plus, let's be honest here. This is Assassin's Creed. There is absolutely no place for a warrior with nigh to nill stealth and assassination capabilities.\n\nLet's talk about graphics. Yeah. They're great. What do you expect? That's literally the only thing game developers have cared about for almost a decade at this point.\n\nStory? Now THAT is a juicy topic! Assassin's Creed 2, Brotherhood, Revelations, 3, Black Flag, and Rogue were fucking MASTERPIECES. Ubisoft's story telling ability upright vanished over a decade ago. Or so I would believe if they didn't disprove that... It's not that they can't write a story. Hell, just about every single game with Assassin's Creed slapped on the front of it actually has a pretty good story, mediocre in the worst case scenarios. It's the fact that Ubisoft fucking REFUSES to present the story in a way that's comprehensible. Ubisoft has a fucking hardon for taking a perfectly good story and shuffling it around in such a way that it's nigh fucking impossible to understand it in the order that it's presented. So much fucking potential shot dead in the face because someone at Ubisoft is allergic to basic storytelling. Sorry for all the un-gentlemanly language in this section. But you can tell that I've been rubbed raw from years of games that could have been good if at least one person in charge of development didn't have a room temperature (or below) IQ.\n\nPhysics and parkour. Parkour is just about the only thing that has improved over time, aside from graphics. I remember being beside myself with rage when it came to the parkour in Black Flag and Rogue because Edward and Shay had a mind of their own. Which made chasing bad guys and sea shanties almost impossible. In Shadows, there are still a few rough spots, but it is much better overall. The physics is where I have an issue. the fact that momentum just isn't at all a concept when it comes to swinging on Naoe's rope, jumping into water from heights, and more, is yet another great way to instantly shatter any immersion that you once had. \n\nAnimation. Great in most places, fantastic in some places, d0g$#1t in more places than it needs to be. I could go into detail, but I'm getting too tired to care. Ubisoft knows what they did, and if they don't, then it really doesn't matter. Because I'm pirating their titles until they unfck themselves to the point that Jesus Christ, the Lord and Savior himself, comes down from heaven just to nod his head in approval right before returning to the holy kingdom from where he came.\n\nOther points. World: boring. Story (main and side): ignoring. Level system: snoring. Gameplay loop: choring. The Sake I bought to drink while playing this game: pouring. \n\nI probably only covered half of what I actually wanted to discuss. But I would much rather be playing a game that is actually fun instead of writing a review for a game that is little more than a sorry little cash grab.\n\nConclusion: Don't play unless you can find it for 90+% off or if you can find a pirated copy. I regret spending $40 for this less than mediocre game.",

Neither intuition nor eagle vision are available to you, unlike with Naoe. In essence, you are basically fighting all the time. There was absolutely no finesse about Yasuke. In simple terms, you are acting like a human tank, blasting your way through everything. The two charters are so out of balance. One of them is so overpowered that he only spends time trudging around, while the squishy one can only exist in stealth. \r\n\r\nI won't even begin to discuss the construction of the hideout. In comparison to what you really need to upgrade your hideout buildings, the quantity of loot you acquire after you clear a castle is negligible.
