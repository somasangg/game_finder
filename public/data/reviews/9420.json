      "review": "This game was my first experience with an RTS, and it has ruined all other games of the genre for me. I simply cannot imagine RTS games without features this game has. Supreme Commander is very macro oriented, all the while keeping micro elements, i'd say it strikes a very healthy balance between them. Unlike in many other games of the genre, SupCom simulates each projectile properly, and often you can dodge projectiles if they are slow enough. Lasers and homing munitions on the other hand cannot miss, which makes sense since they are designed to always land a hit. However the game heavily relies on intel and offers counters to what your opponent is doing that are usually cheaper to make than whatever the enemy is up to. Having a solid plan/build for the game helps, but towards the end you inevitably will end up not noticing something on the battlefield, simply because of how many things can happen at the same time as the game progresses. For me personally this is more of a frustrating aspect of the game, because if your opponent can run more things than you simultaneously (properly command more units than you at the same time), most likely you are going to lose, no matter how hard you try. Losing in this game is feels pretty devastating, often starting with slight losses at the front leading to total collapse of your operations. I found myself sometimes being unable do anything about it, and you sit there, watching as your empire crumbles, waiting for the inevitable. It's emotional, really.\r\nFactions in game have both similar and unique units, making them have subtle differences that are usually unnoticed if you're just starting to play the game. Before you play, i highly recommend at least playing trough campaign to get an introduction to the basics.\r\nThe game itself doesn't have online support anymore, so the community runs servers it instead. Visit faforever.com to play online, they offer a free game client as well as regular balancing updates for the game.\r\nOverall, i have not seen anything come close to strategy genre masterpiece as this has. Try it out, the game often goes on 90% sale for literal cents.",
