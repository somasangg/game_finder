The price being 42 euro is kinda high, but atleast they don't take every opportunity to shove paid services and DLC down your throat, except for the Clear Pass, which is them begging for money. It is also important adding that the game does often get on sale, so if you are considering buying it (which you probably are) i would recommend putting it on your wishlist and waiting until it's on sale.\n\nOverall the gameplay is really good, and the game comes with plenty for songs that you don't have to pay extra for, ofc they have plenty of DLC, but they are easy to ignore if you don't want them.\n\nOne thing I wish there was in the game would be to change all the Menu Keybinds, I am a person that uses keybinds often, and it would be way easier if I would customize the keybinds to get through the menu easier.\n\nThe difficulties are confusing since some of the songs on hard just has (occatsionally throughout the song) randomly spammed notes that don't actually match up with the songs. I am not saying all of the songs are like that, but it just confuses me, it's probably a part of a difficulty aspect but that doesn't really excuse it.",

IT'S LIKE A WHOLE DIFFERENT GAME!\r\n\r\nI was doing 10 difficulty on 4-button, but I had to start all the way back at 2 difficulty for 6-button. I think the point I'm trying to make is that this is the sort of game you can play forever. The skill ceiling is incredibly high. There are lots of different modes and ways to play. And tons of tunes. It's expensive, but if you love rhythm games, it's worth it.\r\n\r\nOne thing that makes DJMAX feel much better than some similar games (like Quaver, for instance) is the key sounds. Each button is mapped to an instrument in the song, which really makes it feel like you're playing along. I haven't played many other rhythm games that feel so tactile.",

But I don't like the way this game monetizes itself. The base game is already expensive (so get it on sale if you can), and so is the DLC. On top of that, the game has a free currency you gain from playing, and a premium currency you pay real money for. Of course you can also buy the free currency if you want to. It's really only used for cosmetics, but that's important to some people. The in game store also cycles through items, which causes FOMO. I was lucky enough to see the only item I cared about when I had enough free currency to buy it. Not only that, but there is a season pass; a free one and a premium one. Once again, it's all cosmetics, but I know some people don't like season passes to begin with. Something else to consider is the premium season pass unlocks a bunch of songs, but you lose those songs once the season is over and have to buy their relevant DLC to play them again if you liked them.\n\nNow for something a little less serious. Some songs don't have hit sounds. It was kind of jarring for me at first, but I got used to it. Keep in mind that a lot of the cheaper DLCs (or at least the ones I have) don't have hit sounds at all. Kind of to be expected, but that is something to be aware of when you make a purchase.\n\nI was really teetering on whether or not I should recommend this game for a long time purely because the monetization made me feel concerned for certain kinds of people. I think that overall I do recommend it since most of it is just cosmetic, and the DLCs are purely optional.",

I think the point I'm trying to make is that this is the sort of game you can play forever. The skill ceiling is incredibly high. There are lots of different modes and ways to play. And tons of tunes. It's expensive, but if you love rhythm games, it's worth it.\r\n\r\nOne thing that makes DJMAX feel much better than some similar games (like Quaver, for instance) is the key sounds. Each button is mapped to an instrument in the song, which really makes it feel like you're playing along. I haven't played many other rhythm games that feel so tactile.",

I love the game mechanics, the songs, etc, but it really sucks the disrespectful practices NEOWIZ does to the consumer, always unpunished. I really hope Steam doesn´t allow them to eventually do the same unethical scam here as well if it come to it, cos last app they did it was with TAPSONIC TOP that last some fair years, but again they just closed the game just like before, past year, while games like Cythus and Deemo that has same style just kept there on air as usual.\n\nWould be rather more acceptable if they wanted to terminate support to older versions to just release an offline standalone version for everyone who already had those, and eventually just had lauched new versions over it for those who wants it instead of just removing the only option we have, so we end up not having other option if not downloading the new one and buying everything again. Or rather that players who had bought everything from past versions would be rewarded with their previous stuff on the new version.\n\nTherefore unless NEOWIZ release an offline mode capable to just stay still even if they decide on the future to cease support to this version, that players keep being able to buy it and play it, this will remain here.",

I love the game mechanics, the songs, etc, but it really sucks the disrespectful practices NEOWIZ does to the consumer, always unpunished. I really hope Steam doesn´t allow them to eventually do the same unethical scam here as well if it come to it, cos last app they did it was with TAPSONIC TOP that last some fair years, but again they just closed the game just like before, past year, while games like Cythus and Deemo that has same style just kept there on air as usual.\n\nWould be rather more acceptable if they wanted to terminate support to older versions to just release an offline standalone version for everyone who already had those, and eventually just had lauched new versions over it for those who wants it instead of just removing the only option we have, so we end up not having other option if not downloading the new one and buying everything again. Or rather that players who had bought everything from past versions would be rewarded with their previous stuff on the new version.\n\nTherefore unless NEOWIZ release an offline mode capable to just stay still even if they decide on the future to cease support to this version, that players keep being able to buy it and play it, this will remain here.",

What does this mean? It means you can't play it when the servers are offline, period. \n\nI was gifted this game and was excited to play it and got to for a few moments, liked it, even if the songs were so far, mid. But logging out and logging back in a few hours later, I haven't been able to log in due to Maintenance. On top of that, the game is near 90 GB of download space, and I got another 7 GB update earlier before the Maintenance was put up.\n\nDoesn't seem to offer a whole lot of Max Respect for the consumer.\n\nIt's fun, when you can play. Community seems pretty genuine an friendly, but one day it'll most likely be unplayable. I don't see the reasoning behind being live service when I don't wanna play comp.",

Ah well, time to find something else :/ Edit: still having this problem months later. Contacted support, no response. Fuck this game",

I love visuals, GUI is banger, but the game just doesn't work at all when it's about gameplay process. Gameplay is boring and slow, all patterns mapped like to not be played via keyboard, but on touch screen. The game is not fun enough for me, unfortunately. Too many paid content repels as well (won't be this bad if the game was fun from the beggining).",
