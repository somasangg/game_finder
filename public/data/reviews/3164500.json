As it stands right now, it's not perfect but definitely promising. Some of the features could be improved before the final release of the game such as:\r\n\r\n- Making the Cartel have more of a presence in Hyland Point\r\n- Quality of life improvements to the Delivery and Dealers apps (which are confirmed to come in the future)\r\n- Making employees faster and smarter (Chemists are expensive, yet lazy)\r\n- More level up rewards for the late game (I'm sure this will come eventually though with new weapons, improved workstations, etc)\r\n- Bug fixes (I'm sure 99% of the bugs will be fixed before release though)\r\n\r\nMaybe the Cartel could have \"events\" around the map, like maybe if your dealers are being attacked, you have a couple hours to go and defend them or else your dealer will lose their product. And if you fend them off, you can lower their influence over the area. Stuff like this could help alleviate the problem of the Cartel dealers only showing up at 11:59 pm, and very occasionally ambushing you. The ambushes are very rare as of right now, which makes it harder to reduce the Cartel influence and unlock new areas. \r\nI actually got stuck in my first save file because I had unlocked all the customers in Westville and then betrayed the cartel, forcing me to wait every night at 11:59 for a Cartel dealer to pop out of their hideout so I can attack them.",

      "review": "I can't recommend this game enough. Tyler (the developer) is so transparent and communicative with his community in informing us of delays in updates and letting us have a voice in what update will be worked on and released next. \n\nYou can easily put hundreds of hours into this game, and the fact that it's still in early access baffles me to this day. You can play single player or with friends. I enjoy playing single player because I like playing all of the roles in the game and learning all aspects of it. You can make marijuana, cocaine, meth, and soon shrooms (in the newest update coming early to mid-December 2025). You can create so many different strains and combinations by mixing ingredients and name all the different strains yourself. This game just has everything you can possibly think of; I can't speak positively of it enough. Tyler recently released a cartel update, so now there is a cartel (Benzies) that warns you of selling drugs on \"their\" turf. You can either reject their proposal to work for them or accept. It makes the game feel more dangerous and fun, honestly. If you reject their proposal, they make your job of selling drugs a lot more dangerous for not only you but also your distributors.\n\nAgain, I love this game so much. I go through bouts where I get a little bored and then come back a couple of months later to new content and get addicted again. Is it worth the money? 100%, absolutely. You're also supporting a really awesome dev.\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/9057282/] ⭐ While you're here, why don't you follow me on my Steam Curator page? ⭐[/url]",

Content is still limited at the moment (pre-Shroom update, post-Halloween update), but even in its current form it easily offers 100+ hours of gameplay if it grabs you. \n\nOf course, being early access means there is still a long way ahead, but that’s part of the fun. The developer is very transparent with the process, sharing progress openly. The community is active too, and and watching other people's creativity in their builds/run and playstyles makes it even more engaging.\n\nAll in all, Schedule 1 is already a strong game that has a lot of potential, and I cant wait for more. *violently milking the H*.",

It's pretty in depth for what it is and needs some planning how to progress and sell your drugs.\n\nBuilding up your empire feels rewarding too, you start small and become powerful step by step. Progression is somewhat time-gated but it's not too annoying or harsh.\n\nI like the updates that are coming out albeit they feel a bit slow and rushed at times. The game became quite buggy in multiplayer which makes only the host eligible to pay off debt, pay the cartel, buy property, etc. That really sucks but can usually be fixed with restarting the session or waiting for a bug fix update.\n\nFor the price it's great value and I really wish for the game to get harder and more risky. Police feels braindead at times - they are no threat. Maybe a helicopter or SWAT units could mix things up? The cartel is a great idea, just not that fleshed out sadly.\n\nAll in all, despite my criticism, it's still a recommendation!",

It really captures the thrill of living like a cartel lord or feeling like you're in the Breaking Bad TV show sitting on piles of cash, hanging out with your crew, dodging cops, and delivering your goods. The game makes you feel like you're breaking the rules, doing things you probably shouldn’t, like mixing gasoline into your concoctions and hoping the customers don’t notice.\n\nIt brings back memories of classic gangster games, similar to the earlier Saints Row titles, where you truly felt like part of a gang. The gameplay is satisfying and immersive, especially in co-op mode, where playing with friends creates memorable moments that you find yourself sharing in real life, sometimes making people question what you were up to the night before.\n\nOverall, I give Schedule 1 a 10 out of 10. It’s fun, engaging, and the cooperative play amplifies the chaos and enjoyment.

Second try I burned all my spraypaint before going against the cartel.  Wasted it all and couldn't get it back by erasing all the graffiti.  Third time bought the laundering properties before moving on to the barn and docks, and betrayed the cartel before turning the city into my own art canvas.  Game went much smoother after that.  Another lesson learned: if you're having issues with influence, just camp the cartel spawn points at .05 seconds til midnight and kill them right as they spawn.  Also first thing in the morning, you may find one (or two) of them bugged out at the entrance to their hideouts just waiting for you to knock them out.

They only disappear when we sleep, and if we kill the cops at night, the whole place becomes safe. When cops die, I think new police should arrive at patrol positions a few hours later.\n\n- The tutorial section is weak; players learn by searching the internet or watching YouTube. (I'm not talking about recipes. I just want to assign tasks to workers, how to use which stall or product, etc.)\n\n- NPC animations need to be improved.\n\n- The Benzies family is my enemy, but I rarely see anyone from this family in the city. Every two or three days in the game, three or four people attack me or my vendors. Other than that, they have no other activity. I gave my vendor a weapon, but he still sometimes says he can't defend himself and loses supplies and money.\n\n- A new city, a new cartel, or a new street gang could be added. The city's thugs will grow from small to large, and we'll either get along with them or we won't and make enemies.\n\n- NPCs should be careful after 6:00 PM during curfew. They should walk on streets and other places where the police can't see them. But they just walk right past the police, and the police don't do anything.\n\n- When NPCs attack us, the police don't do anything, but when we attack them, they chase us away.\n\n- Sometimes it would be nice to have different NPC scenarios. Fights between our vendors and Benzies Family vendors, fights with the police, etc.\n\n-Gunshots, echoes, etc. need to be improved.",

The naming and list of products is very nebulous and it's easy to get lost looking for your mixes.\n\nFor instance, if I create an 8-ingredient mix, I'd like there to be an inventory screen that shows the mixing order visually, rather than just naming the upgrade on the tool tip, because then you have to search your whole list for the next mix that can be anywhere in the list.\n\nAlso, the speed of production is much faster than the speed of procurement of ingredients, even with deliveries. It becomes a massive chore to restock. Basically, the product creation is extremely streamlined and automated, but the restocking of goods has no automation for it really whatsoever. You use all available employees to create a robust mixing automated process where you have very little left over for the limited methods for restocking. Perhaps have managers have 8 delivery paths (because there are up to 8 ingredients able to be mixed in a product), or have the delivery spots have some menu options on what items that come in should be dropped off to what shelves, and then have a manager be able to be assigned to that delivery spot. Or, have a \"Driver\" employee that can take care of it outright.\n\nIt is these two reasons mentioned that I have not come back to the game after \"completing\" it.",

      "review": "This is definitely an instance where I wish I could give more than a simple up down, yes no review. Right now, I am leaning no until some things are fixed (I am aware this is early access). \r\n\r\nFirst, the pros. The mini-games are addicting as hell. New mini-games and products are unlocked at a pretty good clip, so it hasn't gotten boring yet. The gameplay loop is satisfying as well, for the most part (caveat below). Experiment with different concoctions, expand your operation, become a kingpin. Fun, straightforward, and clean game loop.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is the recent cartel update that has pushed this to a no for me (for now). Simply put, the cartel update is broken. The general idea is that there's a cartel in town and you need to reduce their influence (by tagging buildings, fighting off ambushes, dealing with the cartel dealers, etc.) in order to expand your operations into different parts of town. On paper, it is a cool mechanic that I am excited to see them continue to expand. \r\n\r\nIn practice, however, this mechanic as it currently stands is broken to hell. Tagging is supposed to reduce cartel influence, and it does, but not in the starting area. So you have to fight off ambushes and take out the cartel dealer to reduce influence. Should be easy, but ambushes are so few and far between that I've been playing for several in game weeks between ambushes. When I am ambushed, its by four, five, or six dudes and I just get mowed down before I have a chance to defend myself. There doesn't seem to be much of a rhyme or reason to how ambushes work. I've seen folks say that ambushes are more likely after completing a deal, however, I played several days where I was slinging the rocks like crazy and I wasn't attacked once (although my Westview dealer, despite being strapped, gets assaulted CONSTANTLY and loses me a ton of product and money). I now spend most of my day running around town to all the ambush spots and then going home disappointed after not getting ambushed. This makes the mid-game a grind, in a very bad way. I feel stuck with really no way to move into other territories. I'm still making money hand over fist, but without expansion it just seems like a waste. \r\n\r\nCartel dealers are another way that you are supposed to be able to reduce influence and after running around town, waiting at the places they supposedly spawn at for days (before midnight, at midnight, after midnight, I've tried everything), I have yet to see a single dealer let alone have the opportunity to eliminate one. I've removed customers from my dealers, still nothing. \r\n\r\nTo the developers, you have an amazing game here. Truly, it is so fun and engaging. However, until the cartel mechanic is fixed I cannot recommend this game. For suggestions:\r\n\r\n- I would make ambushes slightly more common (not a daily thing certainly but often enough to make the progression meaningful and exciting)\r\n- I would overhaul the cartel dealer mechanics. For instance, they could be more visible and be taunting you  and stuff but you can't touch them during the day because cops and witnesses etc. You could hunt them down at night\r\n- Don't tie spray paint to level achievement. Currently, spray paint is granted at level. Instead, I would recommend having it refresh daily (or weekly). This way if all else fails, you can slowly start to reduce influence even if ambushes and dealer stuff is getting slow. \r\n\r\nTL;DR Cartel update broken, wait for them to fix it before buying",

We have been loving it and spent almost 70 hours in game on our save, had everything unlocked, beat the main story, had a full automated set up in each location and when we went to load our save everything was gone. EVERYTHING. We don't own any locations anymore, not even the motel, all our stock, items, everything are all gone. I tried verifying the files and opening and closing the game multiple times incase it just loaded bad but nothing worked, all our progress is gone.\n\nI'm so disappointed because we've been loving the game and been spending so much time playing it. There have been numerous bugs, including our workers constantly saying they haven't been paid to work and not working till you reset the game, and not being able to unlock the docks area to get those customers, falling through the map constantly etc, which was annoying but not the end of the world and we understand it's early access so we figured that would be fixed eventually and it didn't take away from the game. THIS however is deal breaker... To spend 70 hours in a game to have everything erased is incredibly frustrating.\n\nWe would love it if there's a way to recover our save because we do love this game and I'd be happy to reverse my review if something can be done but that's a major issue to just lose your entire game, that's not just a small bug. I don't know if anything can even be done about that but I sure hope it can because we won't be playing again until something is done.",

However, later in the game the repetitiveness hits hard. You can employ workers that do the repetitive tasks for you and let the stuff get distributed by your dealers, but if you do that then there is nearly nothing for you to do anymore. The world feels pretty empty, rivaling gang members pop up very rarely and the endgame is just: Buy bigger real estate and control a new district by handing out free samples, spraying graffiti and killing rivals (if you find them). I found most of the tasks not very enjoyable, but rather laborious always expecting to see the next exciting part of the story that never came.\nDuring our game we even ran into some kind of softlock. We needed to get rival influence down in our district, but we already acquired all the customers, there were hardly any rivals and the graffiti spots were really limited. We did everything, but is wasn't enough. So, we googled if there is a solution. The solution was to wait in front of a door at 00:00 at night to shoot a rivaling dealer that appeared in front of it for barely a second. We had to do this every night and it felt just buggy and stupid. The solution that we used was posted over half a year ago. That means this did not get fixed for months.\n\nMy summary is: The game is still in early access and one day it might really be a good and interesting game. In the state that it is currently in, I unfortunately cannot recommend it. It just had too many flaws and a gameplay loop that you get tired of rather quickly.",

The bad news is that when I joined my friends the game failed me by making it appear everyone's cell phone was the exact same number.

And there was no easy way to learn how to get from base drug, to a mixed drug easy. Made it so I couldn't just jump in and help make the drugs she needed. Especially with the fact you can rename a drug and then no playthrough is the same. Forget memorizing recipes.  \r\nThen the bugs of deals you do, then sometimes the NPC doesn't make it then it counts as a missed deal.

Nothing works.\n-Any NPC will just be stuck standing still the entire day in their spawn location, even some shop owners which makes it impossible to even buy from them sometimes.\n-Dealers (Particularly Wei Long) who are dealing products but never making profit, nothing I have done fixes it.\n\nThis just makes the game unenjoyable when you end up paying for someone to do a job they won't do, so you have to do it yourself anyway and then the dealers will in turn give away product you had to make anyway, which makes no profit.

But i did buy this game after looking through the frequency of patch notes and updates, and at the time (back in April/May), i think it was once every few weeks, which i figured was pretty good even [i] if [/i] the game wasn't completely perfect, it'd get there in due course - i bought this game thinking its development cycle was going to be (generally) smooth.\n\nThe problem is, is that the updates are super slow and what updates we [b] DO [/b] get - are left to [i] 'community votes' [/i] , which are the [i] stupidest [/i] thing i've seen, we DO NOT need 'shrooms' right now, [i] why? [/i] because this product will suffer the EXACT same bugs, issues and flaws that currently burden mid to late game for EVERY other product already in the game, for instance, supposing drivers were released and on top of that we got recurring deliveries, this would alleviate the hassle of travelling between multiple properties - taking inventory, and ordering more supplies, it would make the game arguably [b] way [/b] more fun.\n\nIf you look at the newest update, it adds the sewers: an alternative way to travel that avoids police and cartel - that is utterly pointless and no player will ever use with the current state of police and cartel. I'm being rather anecdotal here - as im not sure how others experiences with the cartel have gone, but ambushes happened to me AT MOST - once a week and allowed you to run away or fight (rather easily). The police are no better, if you literally kill all of them - or block the pathfinding of police, they cease to be a problem or challenge; i highly doubt a police overhaul would ever fix this, given that the cartel update really didn't live up to people's expectations.\n\n[b] [i] I get that Tyler is working by himself and he has made a great game, but if you're going to dripfeed content to a game, [u] commit to it [/u], don't just disappear for months. [/i] [/b]\n\nObviously there's other issues, that i'd figure should take WAY higher priority over new features, like fixing worker AI, increasing worker limits (more than ten) and making the game a bit more streamlined.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n                                   \nIf you're going to get this game - anticipating that it's development cycle is smooth and steady, maybe reconsider; but if you [b] DO [/b] get this game, you wont be disappointed, its soundtrack and early game are genuinely 10/10, but the mid to late game lets you down [i] (a bit like the last few seasons of prison break or the walking dead!)

(again the netcode hasn't been fixed since the launch, which is a massive game breaking bug)\nim leaning on the side of incompetence rather than neglect, but it could very well be both.",

I know it's in early access and it's just one guy so it's kind of expected, but at the end of the day my review is based on how much I enjoy the game. When it's working, it's a solid 9/10. But unfortunately when my friends and I are dealing with bugs or disconnects where items and money get deleted, it's a 3/10. So overall I like the game, but the playability for multiplayer is rough a lot of times, making this a \"buyer beware\" type review. As the game gets more patches and updates I'll continue trying it with my friends and I genuinely want it to succeed.",
