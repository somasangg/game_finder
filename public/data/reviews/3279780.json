The gacha can be used by two currency, the rare one done by slowly playing the game and the common gold currency used for everything. This makes obtaining enough pulls for a character really easy, while you can also get free tickets for pulls too. The character banners and weapons are guaranteed, no gamble on getting something you don't want just gambling against pity, which is like 40 pulls if you win at the casino kind of odds but the other direction. They also put the characters into the standard banner with their weapon, so everything just gets lumped into one banner eventually. Best odds getting what you want is waiting for the reruns so you aren't fighting against other characters and weapons.\n\nThe casual grind is extremely easy, since this game is made to be an auto battle mobile game. You can auto battle your daily quests in a few minutes and that is all, but you should be progressing as much as you can since it effects the rewards you farm. Which is also easy if you have the right team that you can leave on auto, some teams will need you to play manually. Later on when you reach towards the end goal you will naturally come to a crawl and halt, but there isn't a need to push yourself since this game has zero online aspect, you will not interact with other players in any way not even a friend system exists kind of nothing.\n\nCharacter balance is not bad at all, but also not great. Their aren't too many useless characters, but there are a few that are so broken it would be foolish not to use them. So you go from using whatever to using the same team for everything because they break everything. There are only some cases that you should pick the right team for the right situation, but for the most part just use the broken characters on auto. Which is a shame considering every character gets a skin, so there will be people who want to use their favorites over meta if they can.\n\nSkins are well... A treat to say the least, most of them are fan service and very few are just cute. They do hand out free skins on special occasions, but for the most part they are obtained by paying/grinding really hard. This game also does really well with FOMO, skins that are in the battlepass or events will eventually cycle into the shop for you to get for free if you have the currency. These skins are present in the story, so you will see the skins you have equipped for each character when watching the story, which you could argue adds a bit more value to the skin knowing they are used everywhere not just gameplay.\n\nFan service is well one of the stronger points of the game, the story uses it heavily and can be funny at times with small jokes nothing to give an award for. Skins and interactions all aim towards that goal as well. What sets Horizon Walker's fan service apart from other games, is that you can interact with the characters more deeply (in both ways). You get to pretend text and use social media with the characters, to doing stuff. Each character has an affection level, and once you reach level 5 the max, well let's just say you shouldn't open that in public. Its essentially almost full nudity with the exception to the crotch for laws in the game's native region. That is the extent they go, no actual action happens you just get to admire anatomy.\n\nStory is well... What you would expect for one focused on fan service, nothing that would capture you in it nor is it incoherent you can't try it even if you wanted to. If story carries a lot of weight in your enjoyment instead of minimal thinking auto press kind of game, then you will most likely find it hard to enjoy especially if you aren't a fan of shallow fan service. Think of trashy harem anime with that kind of comedy and a minimal character lead.\n\n[h3] TLDR [/h3]\nIt is an auto battle mobile game, which really nice systems in place to make it fun and casual with tons of fan service. Story isn't too interesting, but can be funny with the characters interacting with each other. True enjoyment is minimal thinking, look at hot anime women say and do things, which you get to dress up if you spend money or grind for it. Almost no FOMO in this gacha game if you can wait about 1-2 months for stuff to comeback for potentially free if you play enough, banners take longer since each one lasts a long time. Difficulty = reeeaaallly casual, Casual grind = easy, Gacha = get everything if you play enough, Skins = all free if you play enough/wait, Fan service = peak, Gameplay = auto mode, Everything = free if you play a bit.",

Mix of sci-fi and fantasy in post-apocalyptic setting. Lore can be dark at times, but not overwhelmingly so. Humor is far more prominent, although often silly not to the point of being annoying.

      "review": "[h1]The Short Review[/h1]\nIt's fine despite a lot of gripes. You'll get what you want out of the game for free and nothing is inherently wrong with the gameplay loop, but your mileage varies based on your tolerance for monotony.\n\n[h2]The Long Review[/h2]\nHorizon Walker is probably everything you've heard from word of mouth and other reviews: a generous, f2p friendly gacha game, a surprisingly deep strategy game, a treasure trove of mature booba...\nIt is also a game I don't take too much issue with, but at the same time don't feel like playing much anymore. Hopefully I can explain why.\n\n[b][u]The Pros[/u][/b]\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] The strategy gameplay loop is strong for something in the gacha space. Usually these games let you roll the newest SSR character and just autoplay through all the content. Horizon Walker relies more on team cooperation and combos to keep you interested in the combat. Sure it has an auto mode but unless you're vastly overstatted it's not a free win.\n\n[b]Generosity:[/b] Horizon Walker's gacha system is rather unique. You roll for vanguards using a ticket resource and recruit them by paying in-game currency or items. Paid currency is only a fall-back option (of course a f2p game is going to have a pay4everything option). Thanks to in-game events it's very easy to hit the 10-roll pity on any vanguard you could ever want. Additionally the story throws a plethora of vanguards at you for free, some of which are quality choices in endgame teams.\n\n[b]Cheesecake:[/b] This is the full disclosure on the content everyone wants to here about - this game features topless women, clothing that barely qualifies as such, and implied sex with your max affection vanguards. It's rare for a gacha available in english to offer anything outside of baiting and cheap live2D, so when you hear this game has fans you will see why pretty quickly.\n\n[b][u]The Cons[/u][/b]\n[b]Implementation:[/b] This is a minor one and I'm really only putting this for disclosure. This is a mobile game port handled by a small localization team. Additionally it uses an anti-cheat despite the lack of multiplayer features. Take these for what you will.\n\n[b]Story:[/b] Your eyes may glaze over depending on your tolerance for Korean webcomic schlock. So you died (maybe) and devoured a dark god, becoming a living god that all the women love. And you must help the vanguards to stop Cronenberg monsters emerging from hell portals into a post-apocalyptic world. Also there are portals to an isekai dimension that some of your waifus come from? Don't think about it too hard because the writers sure don't. Plot threads are only developed far enough to establish the next plot thread to chase with no sense of over-arching narrative or conflict to act as a throughline. Probably a smyptom of the typical gacha tactic of write-as-you-go \"infinite story\" design.\n\n[b]Systems Gating:[/b] As with any live service Horizon Walker is absolutely inundated with overlapping systems and they all restrict the player in different ways. You have to manually level your vanguards with materials, but only as high as your Human God(the MC)'s level. The Human God levels up with experience from missions or tribute (a passive income based on real time that increases based on story progress). You can level up weapons without such a cap, but every ten levels you need to use a different material that is available based on story progress. Stigmas (equipment) have level caps based on rarity, and rarity is another thing gated by story progress. And if you guessed all three of these things had different materials spent to level up, you'd be right!\n\n[b]Affection:[/b] If you want to get to the good stuff (aka the booba) you need to learn how to raise affection with your vanguards. This is most directly done through the gifting of affection items. As far as my 33 hours into the game can testify these are gained through daily rewards and events. Meaning that if you only care about specific girls and not minmaxing the gameplay there is no meaningful recourse to grind out affection through playing. This was one of my deciding factors for uninstalling alongside...\n\n[b]Monotony:[/b] Story is not this game's strong suit. Neither is game balance. Getting a decent team comp built around the right EX vanguard with high AoE damage will let you breeze through battles utilizing the same combo every time. And therein lies the problem. Enemy comps and strategies are never varied enough to challenge your winning strategy or require you to adjust at all, making battle very samey (outside of content that explicitly locks you out of units) and content a slog to get through. This might be where autobattling would come in but unfortunately the combo/systems-heavy gameplay works against itself here, with the AI unable to properly use most vanguards and only help in pure stat check situtations.\n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\nSo why am I recommending a game I spent so many words slagging off? Because overall the time I spent with Horizon Walker was entertaining. It was fun. The problem is that it was not engaging; not addictive. In an industry rife with live service games vying for your time games like these are either hard to put down... or they are put down. Enjoy it for a while. How long that while is will vary but it won't be time wasted.",

Amazing character design, solid gameplay, and one of, if not the best, gacha games I have ever played when it comes to monetization and F2P friendliness, Horizon Walker is great for anyone interested in giving it a try.\n\nFirst off, this is indeed a gooner game, but it's all pretty softcore, there's character affection which is raised by different methods (all free of course) and that leads to massage, hot tub, or pillow talk scenes in the nude but no actual doing of the dirty deed. That being said, the outfits and character design are incredibly eye catching. \n\nThe gameplay itself is turn based combat, think something like a more simplified version of Baldur's Gate or Divinity. It's not anything ground breaking but it's done well and satisfying. Each character has an archetype of tank, support, or DPS which are broken into further subclasses. Leveling the characters is pretty simple, just using mats from dailies or story missions, but building them can get more in depth, with different equipments and give various stat boosts and set bonuses, making for some pretty crazy turn one clear comps. Every character is easily obtainable for free once you get to a certain point in the game, and at no point do you feel pressured to spend to progress the regular story. Which brings me to the monetization. \n\nUnlike other gacha games, Horizon Walker uses the regular in game currency of gold, which is earned from just about everything, to let you pull for characters. 4 pulls guarantees an SS, and 10 an EX. Character repeats do offer advantages but you can use dupes of any character to level any other character. There's still a premium currency you can use in place of gold but it's optional and mainly used for buying cosmetics, or whaling if you like. \n\nAdded note, if you start on the Steam version, or already play the mobile version, you can link the accounts to one another.",

      "review": "One of the best F2P gacha games out there that falls behind NIKKE in its storytelling, but goes above and beyond for its fanbase in terms of its artstyle. This game caters to men and women who enjoy ladies who have curves, a huge chest, and at some points, a nice butt - never straying from this very fact. The game is in need of a better localization, however, as there may be some parts of dialogue that either do not make sense, or could be worded better in English. On the phone, this game is censored, and poorly optimized. On the PC, I could say it needs more work to be able for me to say that it runs smoothly. But, man...\n\nHonestly, it comes down to personal taste. Some people like Zenless Zone Zero because there's jiggly things in your face for everyone, and some people like Azur Lane because of the crazy 2D/3D art and costumes they release of their shipgirls.\n\nHorizon Walker, though, likes to join in on this gooning mess of a genre we know and love; being playful in terms of their characters's curves and figures by putting them in lingerie, swimsuits, and nightgowns. These ladies have it in for you, and as it is quickly established that you play as the handsome \"Human God,\" destined to save the Earth because there are some people who want to disrupt things... it does its genre and audience well enough for people to like the game and its characters. You're handsome, you're a gentleman with a mission, and you are reliably strong - that's it. Horizon Walker does not hide that you have relations with a lot of the characters, and gameplay-wise, it is indeed a turn-based RPG (on 4x speed). It does not help that this game is growing, and rumored to already have a marriage/proposal system in the works. God forbid a man just wants to stuff his face in something soft and take care of it.\n\nAnyways, I invest only 20 minutes a day in this game. Sometimes less, because collecting dailys and doing things at a casual pace is that fast. I am the type to enjoy the affection events and stories, and with new characters, it could literally take me about 4 - 7 days to get a new EX unit that I'd find later to be broken. The grind, compared to all these other gachas, is unbelievably forgiving and easy on the player, and it is precisely (one of) the main reason(s) I like Horizon Walker. Plus, the only grind that is notable is saving up in-game currency to buy outfits that are tasteful/depraved and play on lots of cutesy/hot stereotypes.\n\nFind out if you like it, and of course, judge for yourself. If not, don't play it. Have fun.",

      "review": "60 Hours into the game and I'm really enjoying it. This is a Free to Play gatcha game with Ecchi to softcore themes with attractive waifu characters. It starts out as Ecchi themed then as you progress your relationships its moves more into \"i cant believe its not a gentai\" territory. Meaning its not as hardcore as a h-game, but has very borderline scenarios. Sex is more a off screen occurrence. (Korean company so they have to unfortunately, otherwise im sure they would have added full on h-scenes if they had a choice which they dont)\n\nThe gameplay is like XCom with waifus each character unique. Instead of grid map, its free roam, so you can use gamepad or WSAD to run around with the characters. So some rare times you can somewhat bug/glitches on the map if you are straddling the walls and debris. But that has been few and far between for me.\n\nAnd its extremely F2P friendly, meaning you can eventually unlock ALL the characters without spending a cent and it wont take YEARS. Thats a huge plus for a Gatcha game.\n\nQuite a few hours in and I got a ton of characters, still getting a lot of stuff and I didn't spend a cent. Felt I did want to support the devs so I got a black friday deal on the premium currency (which you can earn by just playing the game) that is used to buy skins, clothes, costumes etc. You CAN use that currency to buy other stuff, but all that stuff you can earn in the game so its recommended to use only use the premium on cosmetics like clothes. Unless you are a whale then go crazy\n\nThe story is up to you if you are going to get into it or not, but I am liking it so far. Its very harem power fantasy which funny enough is not really my thing. BUTT the characters in the story are endearing. Even a good amount of them I thought would be annoying turned out to be quite endearing, cute or adorable that I didn't mind or sometimes even glad to see them pop up in the story. \n\nYou are a god that needs to save the world on the brink of extinction from mutated beings coming from a different dimension. These being are slowly corrupting anyone in contact with them till they eventually become mutated beings as well. You have the power to void that corruption so you are gathering Vanguard warriors to save the world, being big, medium and normal tidday waifus. Who all are in awe of you, and you can build your relationship with them.\n\nThere is a TON of missions and story missions. Even if you just get the game for the tactical turn based RPG and story. You have hours and hours of content to go through without spending a single cent.\n\nThe story unfolds in a very visual novel style but it's 3D and animated. Which I like very much. So if your characters have different clothes on it will appear so in the game and in the story. Except for minor times it's CG, but the CG are very few and far between\n\nAll in all, I recommend highly. Its very rare I recommend a F2P gatcha game, but this one I do recommend. Something like Raid shadow legends isnt gambling addict friendly. This game is gambling addict friendly. Its not trying to nickle and dime you, its just trying to keep you entertained and it does a good job imo\n\nEspecially because the game can be played very casually or you could really push yourself and make the game intense. \n\nI'll address some of the critisms I've seen other reviews put on the game at the time of playing. One person complaining about how expensive it is to pull characters. That is a rookie mistake. Should only spend credits on pulls if it's an special event with a Garunteed EX Character. The regular fairy network search should ONLY be done with fairy tickets which you can get quite a lot of just playing the game and buying them from the Credits shop. Which you should clean out daily if you can with your daily credits. There is tickets to get the different ranked pulls instead of using credits. These tickets can be slow to come by. So for the lower ones I do end up spending Credits. Special Events for garunteed characters is the only time he should be spending Credits for a new pull. Because Special Event Fairy tickets are slow to build up.\n\nAnother critism the game doesn't repsect your time. I've been playing now over 60 hours and still doing story, hard missions, side missions, getting automatic loot while im not logged in. I have to disagree with this statement. Much much more friendlier to get top characters like EX characters with set events compared to other Gotcha games. Theres honestly too much to do at the moment for the short time I'm logged in and get tons of stuff for doing things. Maybe that time waste happens later down the line? But not at the current moment and I'm 60 hours into the game. So alone getting 60 hours of completely free fun game play for a game not costing a cent doesnt seem to me like a waste of time at the current moment. \n\nAnother critism is the game does data collection, my brother in christ the paid games now all do data collection. In Gotcha games specifically its to give you push notifications for in game events as well to collect data if the game runs into issues or not. Dispatch does data collection from what people are doing in the game, where is the outrage there?\n\nAnother critism, someone finally max levelled a relationship and didnt get a full blown h-scene but a borderline scene. My brother in christ go look at the LAWS in Asian countries, its much more strict for smexing in games. In the west you can make a game with full blown smexing, in the East you can land in Jail. There are people in Jail in those countries for not censoring their games enough. Also Steam is now under pressure from payment processors to be much more strict towards adult game especially asian adult games. Having a borderline scene is not the end of the world and quite enjoyable. There are tons of Echii anime which is not full blown hanime and they are great. This is game is like that.\n\nI completely recommend the game for anyone into Gatcha, Ecchi, Softcorish, Tactical RPG, XCom ish gameplay, Visual Novel style story of group of characters trying to save the world(s). Oh yeah thats a another thing. The mutations is going across dimensions which is why you have magical characters, modern day gun characters as well knights, barbarians, fairies, elves etc. I think it fits the story well.",

The girls wear next to nothing at all times and talk about how sexy you are while practically peeling their clothing off for you. Areola are almost always on display, Nip slips might be possible, and camel toe is common... but public displays of full on nakedness aren't really expected... or discourage.\n\n::EDIT::\nSECONDLY: I have decieded to put this at the top of the review as this is my biggest issue witht he game and i want you to know aboutit incase it  a definite deal breaker as i know it will be for some. This is an on going issue thoughi am not sure if it just me or if its an all around thing.\n\nBiggest Con:\n\nHORRIBLY LONG LOAD SCREENS. \nI am talking about 5-10 MINS sometimes o.o I have NO IDEA, why the loading screens take FOREVER... but they do. Its is literally the worst part of the game. I had wondered why people dont stream this game and other than the obvious gooner aspect of the title... yeah... no one is waiting for those loading screens.\n\nWhat can you expect to find in this game girl wise?\n\n1. Mutiple Waifus  \nAbsolutly no need for explinations here.\n\n2. Flat Justice Girls\nNot really... Some of the female who might fall into the catagory are maybe a C-cup at the worst.  =/\n\n3. Motherly character\nWe absolutly have a mommy type character in the elemantal magic queen.\n\n4.  Teen girls\nNot Only Teen girls but Isakaied Teens... that one kinda threw me a bit.\n\n5. Monster Girls\nWe have cat girls and elves of variable backgrounds... a dog girl [ which i am guessing is a male turned to a female for sake of the community.\n\n6.Big booty Girls\nYYEESSSSS! I have notice that for a good long while. Wide hips where popular somewhat popular in Asian title [Usually flat justice girls have a better chance of having big hips] yet round dump truck booty was admittedly abscent. This game however does have the thicc hips from all angles. So you booty lover still have something to look forwards to.\n\n::Game Review ( Minor Spoiler)::\n\nHorizon walker is a Turn based Battle game similar to titles like Xcom, Girls Frontline, Valkirie Profile, with a Himbo Savior twist. You are given the choice between 4 females you may want to join you at the start of the game.\n\nBut don't lose heart! This is just a minor choice to get the ball rolling... you will still obtain the other 3 girls after some story gameplay... so you won't be forced to pick the \"best combat ready\" character for progress. Get who you like the most and your will get the rest shortly after.\n\nYou characters arrive in a specific location on the combat map with the camera casting a top down view of the combat area. You then spend ACTION POINTS to chose how far your character moves, and after your movement you determine if you character will stay put or activate an ability. Your ability range from attacks, to healing, buff or debuffs, Attacks/Actions can be\nA. focused one a single target and only hit that target\nB. focused on single target but hit multiple targets\nC. non-focused attacks that hit in a chosen direction or area\nD. require multiple turns to fully charge before being cast\nE. activate passively under varying conditions. {incoming attacks, out going attack, Etc}\n\nThe most noteable thing about the combat is the inclusion of critical strikes and the possibility of \"back-attacks\" that promise a criticle strike which avoids enemy defense and can boost your dmg output. Taking advantage of back-attacks may not only increase your chances of victory in some fights... but may greatly reduce the amount of turns require to complete a mission as well. There is an auto combat button in case you believe you characters might be powerful enough to just Unga bunga smash their way through a fight... but the COMABT A.I. DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE INCREASE IN DMG FROM BACK ATTACK. So Auto combat could actually take far more turns to complete... and might actually take longer to claim victory than the player taking control of the fight themselves.\n\nSTORY\n\nYou are a Human God [ they literally call you this and say it over and over in the game]  and you job is to protect humanity from some alien abominations that have already claimed one world [ dimension?] before the one in which you currently reside. How the previous world was defeated is a bit fuzzy one details but we do know that multiple factions from the world where save and guided to this current world by another deity... and many of those factions consist of extremely busty, buxom, and big booty females. All of which seem to be haevily invested in the idea of serving under you as your vanguard... one of which openly states she is willing to provide all manner of \"services\" the moment you meet her and without going in to details has no problem with other seeing said service as she basically says she assumed such service was just part of the job.\n\no.o...\n\nThat being said the story for the game can be rather funny and the females join inthe goofiness as well. There is obvious moments of ecchiness including an in game social media site where pictures are posted that may or may not include some very candid picture of the girls [tastfully shot so as not to break TOS of course]\n\nGACHA SYSTEM\n\nThis is a GACHA GAME... But,,, the Gacha system is VERY DIFFERENT from other gacha games.\n\nYou do a single roll for 5 items using in game credits, in game special currency, or tickets you obtain from gameplay and/or cash shop.\nThese 5 items can then be obtain by choice using credits, special currency, or tickets the corrospnd tot he rarity of that item [you cannot use higher rarity tickets to obtain lower rarity items... that way you wont waste  better tickets of worse items]\nEvery 1-10 pulls get you an EX... which is the highest rarity you can obtain Via gotcha.\nMultiple cards of rarity A and above are needed to upgrade certain aspects of the  character or items pulled.\n\nIts an interest Gacha system and feels very rewarding while also allowing you feel  like you aren't just wasting pulls or missing out on things. You choose what stuff you want with every pull... but you do have to use credits to purchase them if you don't have the other forms of currency... and that is the difficult part of the Gacha system.",

Beside Story mode, other daily stuff seem only take you 15 min each days at best. There should be more Weekly or Monthly Active.\n- IMO, Passive income model (like Nikke) isnt fit very well to this type of game.\n- A bit mirror bug and thing that need to be smoother.\nGame still a bit raw atm, but have lots of potential, Hope it will turn better in future",

The gacha can be used by two currency, the rare one done by slowly playing the game and the common gold currency used for everything. This makes obtaining enough pulls for a character really easy, while you can also get free tickets for pulls too. The character banners and weapons are guaranteed, no gamble on getting something you don't want just gambling against pity, which is like 40 pulls if you win at the casino kind of odds but the other direction. They also put the characters into the standard banner with their weapon, so everything just gets lumped into one banner eventually. Best odds getting what you want is waiting for the reruns so you aren't fighting against other characters and weapons.\n\nThe casual grind is extremely easy, since this game is made to be an auto battle mobile game. You can auto battle your daily quests in a few minutes and that is all, but you should be progressing as much as you can since it effects the rewards you farm. Which is also easy if you have the right team that you can leave on auto, some teams will need you to play manually. Later on when you reach towards the end goal you will naturally come to a crawl and halt, but there isn't a need to push yourself since this game has zero online aspect, you will not interact with other players in any way not even a friend system exists kind of nothing.\n\nCharacter balance is not bad at all, but also not great. Their aren't too many useless characters, but there are a few that are so broken it would be foolish not to use them. So you go from using whatever to using the same team for everything because they break everything. There are only some cases that you should pick the right team for the right situation, but for the most part just use the broken characters on auto. Which is a shame considering every character gets a skin, so there will be people who want to use their favorites over meta if they can.\n\nSkins are well... A treat to say the least, most of them are fan service and very few are just cute. They do hand out free skins on special occasions, but for the most part they are obtained by paying/grinding really hard. This game also does really well with FOMO, skins that are in the battlepass or events will eventually cycle into the shop for you to get for free if you have the currency. These skins are present in the story, so you will see the skins you have equipped for each character when watching the story, which you could argue adds a bit more value to the skin knowing they are used everywhere not just gameplay.\n\nFan service is well one of the stronger points of the game, the story uses it heavily and can be funny at times with small jokes nothing to give an award for. Skins and interactions all aim towards that goal as well. What sets Horizon Walker's fan service apart from other games, is that you can interact with the characters more deeply (in both ways). You get to pretend text and use social media with the characters, to doing stuff. Each character has an affection level, and once you reach level 5 the max, well let's just say you shouldn't open that in public. Its essentially almost full nudity with the exception to the crotch for laws in the game's native region. That is the extent they go, no actual action happens you just get to admire anatomy.\n\nStory is well... What you would expect for one focused on fan service, nothing that would capture you in it nor is it incoherent you can't try it even if you wanted to. If story carries a lot of weight in your enjoyment instead of minimal thinking auto press kind of game, then you will most likely find it hard to enjoy especially if you aren't a fan of shallow fan service. Think of trashy harem anime with that kind of comedy and a minimal character lead.\n\n[h3] TLDR [/h3]\nIt is an auto battle mobile game, which really nice systems in place to make it fun and casual with tons of fan service. Story isn't too interesting, but can be funny with the characters interacting with each other. True enjoyment is minimal thinking, look at hot anime women say and do things, which you get to dress up if you spend money or grind for it. Almost no FOMO in this gacha game if you can wait about 1-2 months for stuff to comeback for potentially free if you play enough, banners take longer since each one lasts a long time. Difficulty = reeeaaallly casual, Casual grind = easy, Gacha = get everything if you play enough, Skins = all free if you play enough/wait, Fan service = peak, Gameplay = auto mode, Everything = free if you play a bit.",

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) There are also girls with more modest proportions but still really attractive and feminine.\r\n+ Realistic breast shapes; characters with larger breasts have the natural teardrop sag as their breasts are appropriately affected by gravity. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\r\n+ Huge variety of female characters to suit every kind of fetish. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\r\n+ Jiggle physics with realistic inertia. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\r\n+ Impressive physics for the entire body including hair and accessories like bunny girl ears.\r\n+ Great optimization; stable uncapped framerate (144Hz monitor) on max graphics settings on RTX 3070 with zero framerate drops and no screen tearing.\r\n+ Generous gacha; pity for EX characters/weapons is guaranteed after 10 pulls. Progress towards event banner pity carries over to the next event.\r\n+ Extremely free-to-play friendly; your idle income will eventually reach a point where you are guaranteed to pull every newly released event character and you can reasonably acquire every character in the game without spending any money.\r\n+ Event characters get added to the permanent pool after their event is over. No character is permanently missable.\r\n+ Enjoyable tactical turn-based combat where you can move units around the battlefield to outflank enemies for positional damage bonuses and counterattack opportunities.\r\n+ Autoplay combat available for handsfree gameplay, but manual play will always be more effective and rewarding because the AI does not control characters optimally to take advantage of positioning on auto.\r\n+ Visually appealing sexy skill animations thanks to the jiggle physics. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\r\n+ Fast forward animations available to speed up combat.\r\n+ No stamina system.\r\n+ Idle gameplay mechanics that accumulate resources passively over time; up to 24 hours' worth of resources can be stockpilled at once. The amount of resource generation depends on Devotion Level which can be increased by clearing main story stages.\r\n+ Pulls can be made using farmable ingame currency and do not require tickets.\r\n+ Frequent events that introduce new characters, story content and rewards every 2 weeks.\r\n+ All characters can eventually be promoted to the highest rarity via Ascension regardless of starting rarity.\r\n+ Deep progression systems that greatly reward diligent gameplay.\r\n+ Extremely sexy and revealing outfits that show tantalizing details such as nipple bumps, areola, cameltoe and panty shots; certain outfits come with a breast size modifier and you can further increase the girl's already massive breasts into gargantuan proportions. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\r\n+ Ingame social media and messaging systems provide immersive side stories and additional lore for each character.\r\n+ Affection system that unlocks a variety of interactive intimate scenes that allow you to touch and rub the girls. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\r\n+ Realistic sexual interactions; the girls' nipples harden and become erect when you play with them repeatedly in bedroom scenes. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\r\n+ Breast collision and skin indentation. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\r\n+ Visual novel cutscenes are engaging thanks to the animated 3D character models and their generous jiggle physics. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\r\n+ Enjoyable Korean voice acting, especially the erotic voice acting in intimate scenes. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\r\n+ Good story and worldbuilding.\r\n+ Incredibly based and entertaining writing; dialogue has plenty of comedy, gaming/anime references and sexual innuendo. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\r\n+ Loveable and endearing characters.\r\n\r\n- The sexiest and most arousing outfits (including the ones with breast size modifier) are locked behind premium currency on the cash shop. (╥_╥)\r\n- Characters and weapons share the same gacha pool; several male characters pollute the gacha pool and drastically reduce the probability of pulling an attractive female character.\r\n- Minor UI bugs in certain dialogue-heavy cutscenes.",

      "review": "I'll give my view and review of the game. As someone who just now starting to play this game, don't know the situation with the Korean server since they'd be the one to have gotten the game longer, but as it stands. It has potential. But it is held back by lack of content very early on. You have few ways of leveling outside of waiting for the offering to fill to the max (If any of you play NIKKE you'd know the mechanic) bad part is that it doesn't go beyond 24 hours. At best I gotten to level 21 then had to collect it FULLY twice to level up to 22 and so on. The story is so-so I wish they lean more on the post apocalyptic theme of the game more than have light-hearted moments in between but too many goofy stuff, mind you I haven't progress far into the story but that's the vibe I'm getting. The Gacha is good it does show you a clear indicator on when you will be able to obtain an EX-rank operative/weapons. Most of the time you are getting SS-rank operatives/weapons. The pool is still low so its easy to get great operative. \n\nWhat they need to fix if they want to sustain this game long term is adjust the rewards, EXP, and materials you can receive. Make it easier to increase the \"Devotion\" level since its only increase with the story and not any other action, like the WISHES which are the \"farming\" version of the game. Which isn't much to be honest. They need to also adjust the power level of the MC to compete with the EX operative since he'd suppose to be this Human God so it needs to show that they are powerful, no broken mind you, but fulfil a bunch of roles as support/attacker something as we the players can feel that this character is worth self-insert which will help with the longevity of the game. \n\nNeed also a way to better increase affection of the operator since aside from leveling the weapons, skills especially, and over leveling as far as you can that's where there other strength is.\n\nLastly the scenes, its alright. Its so-core porn at best. Low-Echii. So over all I'd grade this game a 7/10 at best maybe in the future it'll get gud but as it stands it may not last long if it doesn't get generous.",

This kind of extensive, third-party tracking is not in line with strict privacy standards.\n\nLack of clear opt-in consent: While the policy mentions opting out, it doesn't clearly state that users have to give explicit, affirmative consent before their data is collected and used for these purposes, which is a key component of modern privacy laws and standards.\n\nBroad data collection: The policy describes collecting a wide range of personal and technical data, including player IDs, device identifiers, and game usage data, which is then used for advertising. A privacy-forward approach would aim for data minimization, collecting only what's necessary for the game's core function.\n\nThe provided privacy policy is more in line with standard, ad-supported business models, not a more restrictive privacy standard.",

      "review": "I don't recommend this game. Not because of the absurd privacy policy or the rightfully criticized kernel level anti-cheat, but because it fails to deliver what I hoped for from a harem game.\n\nDon't get me wrong; the characters are visually stunning and the gameplay is serviceable, but all of that is meaningless when we're forced to play as a useless mouth-breather of a MC who just stands around while the other characters do and solve everything.\n\nThe story flow goes as follows: There's a problem that needs to be solved, usually in the form of an enemy group, so our characters go there and talk among themselves about the best course of action. Yeon Chaeyoung is the mediator/leader in 99% of all conversations while the Human God (you) just watches and occasionally chimes in with a \"Mhm.\" Then the characters talk for a bit longer before turning to you and saying \"Give the order, Human God,\" to which you reply with \"Let's do this.\"\n\nIf you can't see why I have a problem with that, let me put it this way. I can count on one hand the amount of times the Human God was [b]alone[/b] with another girl. And even when he was, someone quickly arrives to do all the talking for him. It genuinely feels like you're playing as a small toddler who needs his mom to drive every conversation for him. The result is a very passive and uninteresting protagonist who never [b]earns[/b] the girls' affection or goes out of his way to help them. Even in the individual character stories (private chats and VN-style sequences), there's always a group chat with three other girls doing all the talking and solving the problems of the girl you're \"bonding\" with. I have nothing against group interactions, but when the protagonist feels like a cardboard cutout with zero presence or leadership, it feels less like a harem game and more like an all-girls cast occasionally glancing at an empty husk meant to represent the player. I kid you not, there are many scenes where the girls literally say \"Oh, Human God, you were there the whole time?\" or \"Oh, we didn't see you there, Human God.\"\n\nI was putting off writing this review because I genuinely hoped not all character stories were like this. But what broke the camel's back was Everette's story. Without spoilers, what I can say is that the Human God vowed to help her solve a very serious problem of hers, only to let a literal child take the lead and summon a divine being, then proceeding to tell HER to talk to the divine being in his stead. And when they finally get what they wanted, the Human God can't even be bothered to hand the thing to Everette himself. He tells the little girl to do it, because for some reason this game is afraid of showing any scene where the MC takes the lead at any point.\n\nSure, there are the massage/bath/bed scenes where we can touch and talk to the girls one-on-one, but that's completely isolated from the story and 100% optional. It's just there to showcase the admittedly beautiful models and impressive physics, but it doesn't change the fact that we didn't [b]earn[/b] this. We just nodded and grunted our way into the girl's heart. Here's an assortment of the MC's greatest hits: \"Mhm\" \"...\" \"Yep.\" \"k\" \"??\" \"...!\" \"Let's go\"\n\nAnd look, even though I focused on the MC's complete lack of presence and authority in this review, that doesn't mean it's the only problem in this game. The story itself is... empty. I know it's still at a very early stage, but I reached the end of all available content and I'm left genuinely confused as to what we're even doing. There's no goal or even a faint idea of what to do next, just the protagonist being led around by his unearned harem while doing odd jobs. As for the character stories, some are good and spicy (Lisandria, Cora), but most are incredibly forgettable (Olivia, Vlissing, Fammene) or even offensively bad and half-baked (Korabi). For a harem game that prides itself on the shameless fanservice, the actual [b]bonding[/b] experience is embarrassingly bad. Pretty much every other waifu collector I've ever played had more care put into the characters' stories. Horizon Walker, on the other hand, feels disjointed and empty in comparison.\n\nOf course, not all is bad. This is a very generous and F2P-friendly game. So if you're just here for the beautiful character models and blatant fanservice, go right ahead. I'm pretty sure you can get at least one copy of every character as a F2P player, as the monetization is focused on the skins. And save for a few exceptions, dupes aren't very important. But do be warned that the game has weapon gacha. Normally I wouldn't even touch a game with weapon gacha, but there's no 50/50 here, so you're guaranteed to get the banner character/weapon within 50 pulls. With that being said, the lack of regional pricing makes a lot of things ridiculously expensive if you happen to live in the wrong part of the world. I really wish they'd change that, but unfortunately I don't see it happening.\n\nThe gameplay is fine, but I do have many gripes with it. The game features aggro adjustment, but most bosses and even regular enemies are designed to ignore aggro. The AI will casually walk out of melee range from one of your characters before nuking your back line, and there's nothing you can do but brute-force your way through with upgrades or a reduced formation, This means that there's no real sense of strategy in this game, just turn manipulation and raw stats. Some enemies are very frustrating to deal with unless you have a specific unit, so in that sense, the game does feel a bit \"pay-to-progress\" when it really shouldn't have to be that way.\n\nAs a final note, this review could very well change to a positive one if they simply start putting more care into the character stories and how the protagonist interacts with his harem. They really took the \"Blank Slate MC\" trope to the extreme, and it's unacceptable how little presence we have in the girls' lives. I don't know if it's because they're afraid of breaking the self-insert fantasy or what, but I've played countless self-insert games where no one complained about the protagonist having more agency and authority. I say this because it's clear that they [b]know[/b] how to write an assertive MC (as seen on Lisandria's bond story), but they intentionally choose not to.",

Which segues nicely to the writing: Sex. The punchline is always sex. It's funny the first handful of times before you realize this is the only joke they have. This is on top of the player-insert being yet another plank-of-wood void of personality or charisma.\n\nCredit where credit is due, as far as a 'gatcha' is concerned there really is no trouble at all acquiring all the characters available.

After learning the game a bit more, your moves relay on AP. The more you move the late you get your turn unless you move less and sit in standby mode then you get your turn more often unless the stage is mega big and you need to walk quite alot.\n\n[h2] The Roles [/h2]\n\nNow like every RPG gacha game we got class role. Now since I spent 5 hours into the game I will tell you what I've learn from those 5 hours of gameplay.\n\nWe got\n-Riflemen Class\n-Dual Pistol Class??\n-Tank Class (The Claymore)\n-Assasain Class (Dual Blade)\n-Mace Class??\n-Swordsman Class\n-Mage Class\n-Orb Class\n\nNow there's alot of explaining to do in each of this class of what they do but I'm gonna leave to people who pick up the game explore because it is ALOT of explaining to do.\n\n[h2] The Story [/h2]\n\nSince I only played for 5 hours I only got to experience the Chapter 1 Story, so take it with a grain of salt if you don't agree with me complain about the story in Chapter 1. After the intro of Chapter 1, we get to meet your squad and their personalities are a bit unique if I say so. This story after going through and finishing Chapter 1 is like watching High School DxD being made in 2025.\n\n[h2] Skins & Microtransaction [/h2]\n\nLike all gacha game this game skins is quite uh [b] BOLD [/b] y'know what I mean? Anyways the skins probably cost around $20 - $35 I think?\n\nAnyways the good thing about this game is you can roll gacha using coins and not the premium currency like other games but hey that's only the good part about it in this game.\n\n[h2] The Anti-Cheat? [/h2]\n\nReminder what I'm going to say is my personal opinion and though it's weird to implement this thing in the game.\n\nLook I get that Anti-Cheat is important in some games but a gacha singleplayer game with Kernel Anti-Cheat? Look I get games like multiplayer like HellDivers 2 using it because it's a multiplayer game but on a singleplayer game? It really confused me why they are using this.\n\n[h2] Conclusion [/h2]\n\nThis game is really interesting in someways but it isn't my type of my game to be spending my time on.

I was eventually getting stomped and figured, no bigee, I'll just grind away at the previous stage. Beat it 10 times and realized I earned no XP from any of it, and if I did, I'm certain it was like 1% of what you earn from 1st run. I had to wait on the game to GRANT me free XP from a collective pool (some devotion or worship thing idk), floored all the enemies on the stage I was stuck. Tried beating the next stage...and was stomped again after three attempts. Back to waiting, I guess.\n\nThis was manual combat with a team of 3 SS units and S rank materials, btw.\n\nSpeaking of the units, the whack semblance of the seemingly \"gracious\" gacha doesn't mean anything when you can't earn experience replaying stages with them. It's strange how much leveling resources are thrown at you, but you can't make use of it until you raise your own level. It's like the devs expect you to log in, collect the XP pool, take on a few stages, then close the game and wait another 24 hours. That or just pay money upfront to advance.\n\nIt doesn't help that there are many alternatives that also have questionable or adult-oriented material, but have more unit attributes and skill trees that incentivize players to be mindful of squad arrangement and equipment. Even most idle games have you assess what units and equipment you deploy, so there's SOME level of strategy. Meanwhile, Horizon Walker threw up a barrier 45 minutes in, and the barrier wasn't \"difficult\", just an artificial wall that became a molehill when I rose a single level over the expected/required level.\n\nIt's a glorified model viewer, and a lackluster one at that. Save your time and don't bother with this one. Go play any other of the free turn-based, shooter, or action gachas out there.

And the game couldn't even be launched for the first couple of days of its release, which is abysmal for a game that 1) isn't even an early-access title 2) had launched previously on other platforms in Asia, so they should've had the time to iron the kinks out. \n\nNext, the game has a sort of cool premise, but the execution is the definition of 'generic'. It's just a very basic harem anime. You play as some god dude who is protecting the remnants of manking from some sort of monsters in a post apocalyptic future. The game tells us at the beginning that things are very bad, there is only one human city remaining, and the monsters are close to winning. Don't worry though, none of this will ever impact your actual game experience. You are going to spend plenty of time on dumb dormroom-esque shenanigans with a bunch of big-titty anime women. You can go on dates, go get a message. Everyone is always clean and well-dressed, there doesn't seem to be any shortage of food, water, electricity. This whole \"incoming exctintion of mankind\" thing is actually no big deal. We can relax.\n\nFrom the promos I thought that this was going to be like an Xcom style strategy combat game. It's not that. It's just a JRPG with a typical combat for the genre. You have a team of fighters, each one with a set of abilities, and you use those abilities to fight monsters in turn-based battles. Thinking is not really required here. Your team is almost always very overpowedered and crushes the enemies with ease. Once I decided to check my socials on my phone while I was waiting for the enemies to do their turn. And then suddenly I saw that we won that battle. Your heroes have an ability to atuomatically counter-attack when the enemy is close enough, so they just killed all the enemies without me. My input wasn't even necessary.\n\nThe game is also a very shoddy port from mobile phones. Even here on PC you control the game as if you have a touch screen, but you use your mouse instead of your real-world fingers. It's as if they forgot that keyboard exists, or maybe they just didn't care at all.\n\nFinally, let's talk about the main reason most people play this: the gooning material. The oversexualization in this game is ridiculous. Every female character has gigantic milkers with jiggle physics cranked up to 11. I think a few of these characters should be able to accidentally punch themselves in the face with their own breasts if they were to make a sudden wrong move.\nI am not sure if this is supposed to be genuinely titilating for someone, or is this a self-parody of how videogames often handle fanservice. It doesn't really work either way, honestly. \nLook, I get the gooner logic. I am not above this stuff. But I feel like this game has no variety of character designs for gooning purposes. There's only 2 body types for women here: attractive woman with big breats, and an attractive woman with giant breasts. I love me some titties, but when every single character has them exposed, and they shake in every direction at the slightest provocation, then I quickly lose all interest in them titties. \nLet me explain this with a food metaphor: I do love me some mac'n'cheese, it's probably my favorite food. But if I had to make it my entire diet, I'd loathe even the idea of another mac'n'cheese after just a week of eating nothing but that.\nSame with big honkers. They're great, but if everyone has them, it's like what even are big honkers anymore?\n\nIn short, don't play this game. Yeah, it's free, but it's not worth it even for this price. In general you should play real, good games instead of this Gacha gooner-bait, but even if you are into this sort of stuff, there are so many other better Gacha gooner games out there that are also free. \nHorizon Walker? I hardly know her.",

      "review": "I don't recommend this game. Not because of the absurd privacy policy or the rightfully criticized kernel level anti-cheat, but because it fails to deliver what I hoped for from a harem game.\n\nDon't get me wrong; the characters are visually stunning and the gameplay is serviceable, but all of that is meaningless when we're forced to play as a useless mouth-breather of a MC who just stands around while the other characters do and solve everything.\n\nThe story flow goes as follows: There's a problem that needs to be solved, usually in the form of an enemy group, so our characters go there and talk among themselves about the best course of action. Yeon Chaeyoung is the mediator/leader in 99% of all conversations while the Human God (you) just watches and occasionally chimes in with a \"Mhm.\" Then the characters talk for a bit longer before turning to you and saying \"Give the order, Human God,\" to which you reply with \"Let's do this.\"\n\nIf you can't see why I have a problem with that, let me put it this way. I can count on one hand the amount of times the Human God was [b]alone[/b] with another girl. And even when he was, someone quickly arrives to do all the talking for him. It genuinely feels like you're playing as a small toddler who needs his mom to drive every conversation for him. The result is a very passive and uninteresting protagonist who never [b]earns[/b] the girls' affection or goes out of his way to help them. Even in the individual character stories (private chats and VN-style sequences), there's always a group chat with three other girls doing all the talking and solving the problems of the girl you're \"bonding\" with. I have nothing against group interactions, but when the protagonist feels like a cardboard cutout with zero presence or leadership, it feels less like a harem game and more like an all-girls cast occasionally glancing at an empty husk meant to represent the player. I kid you not, there are many scenes where the girls literally say \"Oh, Human God, you were there the whole time?\" or \"Oh, we didn't see you there, Human God.\"\n\nI was putting off writing this review because I genuinely hoped not all character stories were like this. But what broke the camel's back was Everette's story. Without spoilers, what I can say is that the Human God vowed to help her solve a very serious problem of hers, only to let a literal child take the lead and summon a divine being, then proceeding to tell HER to talk to the divine being in his stead. And when they finally get what they wanted, the Human God can't even be bothered to hand the thing to Everette himself. He tells the little girl to do it, because for some reason this game is afraid of showing any scene where the MC takes the lead at any point.\n\nSure, there are the massage/bath/bed scenes where we can touch and talk to the girls one-on-one, but that's completely isolated from the story and 100% optional. It's just there to showcase the admittedly beautiful models and impressive physics, but it doesn't change the fact that we didn't [b]earn[/b] this. We just nodded and grunted our way into the girl's heart. Here's an assortment of the MC's greatest hits: \"Mhm\" \"...\" \"Yep.\" \"k\" \"??\" \"...!\" \"Let's go\"\n\nAnd look, even though I focused on the MC's complete lack of presence and authority in this review, that doesn't mean it's the only problem in this game. The story itself is... empty. I know it's still at a very early stage, but I reached the end of all available content and I'm left genuinely confused as to what we're even doing. There's no goal or even a faint idea of what to do next, just the protagonist being led around by his unearned harem while doing odd jobs. As for the character stories, some are good and spicy (Lisandria, Cora), but most are incredibly forgettable (Olivia, Vlissing, Fammene) or even offensively bad and half-baked (Korabi). For a harem game that prides itself on the shameless fanservice, the actual [b]bonding[/b] experience is embarrassingly bad. Pretty much every other waifu collector I've ever played had more care put into the characters' stories. Horizon Walker, on the other hand, feels disjointed and empty in comparison.\n\nOf course, not all is bad. This is a very generous and F2P-friendly game. So if you're just here for the beautiful character models and blatant fanservice, go right ahead. I'm pretty sure you can get at least one copy of every character as a F2P player, as the monetization is focused on the skins. And save for a few exceptions, dupes aren't very important. But do be warned that the game has weapon gacha. Normally I wouldn't even touch a game with weapon gacha, but there's no 50/50 here, so you're guaranteed to get the banner character/weapon within 50 pulls. With that being said, the lack of regional pricing makes a lot of things ridiculously expensive if you happen to live in the wrong part of the world. I really wish they'd change that, but unfortunately I don't see it happening.\n\nThe gameplay is fine, but I do have many gripes with it. The game features aggro adjustment, but most bosses and even regular enemies are designed to ignore aggro. The AI will casually walk out of melee range from one of your characters before nuking your back line, and there's nothing you can do but brute-force your way through with upgrades or a reduced formation, This means that there's no real sense of strategy in this game, just turn manipulation and raw stats. Some enemies are very frustrating to deal with unless you have a specific unit, so in that sense, the game does feel a bit \"pay-to-progress\" when it really shouldn't have to be that way.\n\nAs a final note, this review could very well change to a positive one if they simply start putting more care into the character stories and how the protagonist interacts with his harem. They really took the \"Blank Slate MC\" trope to the extreme, and it's unacceptable how little presence we have in the girls' lives. I don't know if it's because they're afraid of breaking the self-insert fantasy or what, but I've played countless self-insert games where no one complained about the protagonist having more agency and authority. I say this because it's clear that they [b]know[/b] how to write an assertive MC (as seen on Lisandria's bond story), but they intentionally choose not to.",

Now I for once don't really care if a game is a gooner or not but after playing this game is not really my cup of tea.\n\n[h2] The Gameplay [/h2]\n\nThe gameplay in this game is quite [b] complicated [/b]. After learning the game a bit more, your moves relay on AP. The more you move the late you get your turn unless you move less and sit in standby mode then you get your turn more often unless the stage is mega big and you need to walk quite alot.\n\n[h2] The Roles [/h2]\n\nNow like every RPG gacha game we got class role. Now since I spent 5 hours into the game I will tell you what I've learn from those 5 hours of gameplay.\n\nWe got\n-Riflemen Class\n-Dual Pistol Class??\n-Tank Class (The Claymore)\n-Assasain Class (Dual Blade)\n-Mace Class??\n-Swordsman Class\n-Mage Class\n-Orb Class\n\nNow there's alot of explaining to do in each of this class of what they do but I'm gonna leave to people who pick up the game explore because it is ALOT of explaining to do.\n\n[h2] The Story [/h2]\n\nSince I only played for 5 hours I only got to experience the Chapter 1 Story, so take it with a grain of salt if you don't agree with me complain about the story in Chapter 1. After the intro of Chapter 1, we get to meet your squad and their personalities are a bit unique if I say so. This story after going through and finishing Chapter 1 is like watching High School DxD being made in 2025.\n\n[h2] Skins & Microtransaction [/h2]\n\nLike all gacha game this game skins is quite uh [b] BOLD [/b] y'know what I mean? Anyways the skins probably cost around $20 - $35 I think?\n\nAnyways the good thing about this game is you can roll gacha using coins and not the premium currency like other games but hey that's only the good part about it in this game.\n\n[h2] The Anti-Cheat? [/h2]\n\nReminder what I'm going to say is my personal opinion and though it's weird to implement this thing in the game.\n\nLook I get that Anti-Cheat is important in some games but a gacha singleplayer game with Kernel Anti-Cheat? Look I get games like multiplayer like HellDivers 2 using it because it's a multiplayer game but on a singleplayer game? It really confused me why they are using this.\n\n[h2] Conclusion [/h2]\n\nThis game is really interesting in someways but it isn't my type of my game to be spending my time on.

      "review": "Oh boy...this one is a mess, man.\n\nSo, let me begin with the obtuse choice to prevent XP grind. I was eventually getting stomped and figured, no bigee, I'll just grind away at the previous stage. Beat it 10 times and realized I earned no XP from any of it, and if I did, I'm certain it was like 1% of what you earn from 1st run. I had to wait on the game to GRANT me free XP from a collective pool (some devotion or worship thing idk), floored all the enemies on the stage I was stuck. Tried beating the next stage...and was stomped again after three attempts. Back to waiting, I guess.\n\nThis was manual combat with a team of 3 SS units and S rank materials, btw.\n\nSpeaking of the units, the whack semblance of the seemingly \"gracious\" gacha doesn't mean anything when you can't earn experience replaying stages with them. It's strange how much leveling resources are thrown at you, but you can't make use of it until you raise your own level. It's like the devs expect you to log in, collect the XP pool, take on a few stages, then close the game and wait another 24 hours. That or just pay money upfront to advance.\n\nIt doesn't help that there are many alternatives that also have questionable or adult-oriented material, but have more unit attributes and skill trees that incentivize players to be mindful of squad arrangement and equipment. Even most idle games have you assess what units and equipment you deploy, so there's SOME level of strategy. Meanwhile, Horizon Walker threw up a barrier 45 minutes in, and the barrier wasn't \"difficult\", just an artificial wall that became a molehill when I rose a single level over the expected/required level.\n\nIt's a glorified model viewer, and a lackluster one at that. Save your time and don't bother with this one. Go play any other of the free turn-based, shooter, or action gachas out there. They may not grant you big-boobah SSRs all the time, but regardless if they do, they at least have a game you can play to boot.",

      "review": "First of all, the technical perfomance of this thing is horrible. The cutscenes skip frames and stutter so much that the audio straight up desyncs from the video. It also updates constantly, and overall the game doesn't even look all that good (it looks like a PS3/360 title), so I have no idea why it's perfomance is so bad. And the game couldn't even be launched for the first couple of days of its release, which is abysmal for a game that 1) isn't even an early-access title 2) had launched previously on other platforms in Asia, so they should've had the time to iron the kinks out. \n\nNext, the game has a sort of cool premise, but the execution is the definition of 'generic'. It's just a very basic harem anime. You play as some god dude who is protecting the remnants of manking from some sort of monsters in a post apocalyptic future. The game tells us at the beginning that things are very bad, there is only one human city remaining, and the monsters are close to winning. Don't worry though, none of this will ever impact your actual game experience. You are going to spend plenty of time on dumb dormroom-esque shenanigans with a bunch of big-titty anime women. You can go on dates, go get a message. Everyone is always clean and well-dressed, there doesn't seem to be any shortage of food, water, electricity. This whole \"incoming exctintion of mankind\" thing is actually no big deal. We can relax.\n\nFrom the promos I thought that this was going to be like an Xcom style strategy combat game. It's not that. It's just a JRPG with a typical combat for the genre. You have a team of fighters, each one with a set of abilities, and you use those abilities to fight monsters in turn-based battles. Thinking is not really required here. Your team is almost always very overpowedered and crushes the enemies with ease. Once I decided to check my socials on my phone while I was waiting for the enemies to do their turn. And then suddenly I saw that we won that battle. Your heroes have an ability to atuomatically counter-attack when the enemy is close enough, so they just killed all the enemies without me. My input wasn't even necessary.\n\nThe game is also a very shoddy port from mobile phones. Even here on PC you control the game as if you have a touch screen, but you use your mouse instead of your real-world fingers. It's as if they forgot that keyboard exists, or maybe they just didn't care at all.\n\nFinally, let's talk about the main reason most people play this: the gooning material. The oversexualization in this game is ridiculous. Every female character has gigantic milkers with jiggle physics cranked up to 11. I think a few of these characters should be able to accidentally punch themselves in the face with their own breasts if they were to make a sudden wrong move.\nI am not sure if this is supposed to be genuinely titilating for someone, or is this a self-parody of how videogames often handle fanservice. It doesn't really work either way, honestly. \nLook, I get the gooner logic. I am not above this stuff. But I feel like this game has no variety of character designs for gooning purposes. There's only 2 body types for women here: attractive woman with big breats, and an attractive woman with giant breasts. I love me some titties, but when every single character has them exposed, and they shake in every direction at the slightest provocation, then I quickly lose all interest in them titties. \nLet me explain this with a food metaphor: I do love me some mac'n'cheese, it's probably my favorite food. But if I had to make it my entire diet, I'd loathe even the idea of another mac'n'cheese after just a week of eating nothing but that.\nSame with big honkers. They're great, but if everyone has them, it's like what even are big honkers anymore?\n\nIn short, don't play this game. Yeah, it's free, but it's not worth it even for this price. In general you should play real, good games instead of this Gacha gooner-bait, but even if you are into this sort of stuff, there are so many other better Gacha gooner games out there that are also free. \nHorizon Walker? I hardly know her.",
