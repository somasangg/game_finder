      "review": "As may be guessed by the hours played, I do really like the game, though not everything about it. So let me break it down, both from the perspective of someone coming in new to the franchise, and a vet Diablo player. \r\n\r\nStory - (4/5 for newcomers, 1.5/5 for vets) - Blizzard probably assumes no one currently gaming played Diablo 1 and 2. Otherwise, they wouldn't have copied the plot ending of D1 and part of D2 into D4. As it is, the game has a limited and recurring cast of baddies, and a plot that repeats the Hero/Mysterious Wanderer's endgame (albeit with a different outcome) is bound to feel jaded. \r\n\r\nFor newcomers, though, the biggest question is why this game is called Diablo. There is no Diablo in the picture (so far) and instead we get Lilith and Mephisto. Otherwise, the story is decent. Lilith comes across as perhaps the most morally ambiguous antagonist, which makes lack of any meaningful decisions in the game makes the game feel like something out of Sunday School. You can probably predict the ending of the story halfway through the game, with only minor variations dragged in. That said, if you don't use your brain too much, the game has a fairly engaging storyline IF you joined the bandwagon with D3 or this is your first Diablo game. \r\n\r\nGraphics (4/5 for all) - It's a point and click game so breathtaking details are probably not what anyone expects. They're a climb up from D3, and that is probably all that matters. Max settings at 4K don't really demand a beast of a GPU, though you'll need a fairly beefy CPU for those Infernal Hordes waves when there are dozens of enemies on screen. Effects have been improved, and the transitions are also better. Together with some excellent background scores, they provide excellent atmosphere. \r\n\r\nGameplay (2.5/5 for newcomers, NA for vets) - Those unfamiliar with point and click games would probably have some difficulty persuading their wrists to click hundreds of times per gaming session. Beyond that though, the gameplay is, well, classic Diablo. Nothing much has been changed since D3, or even D2 for that matter, in terms of core gameplay mechanics. You choose a class, and depending on it, you have some core mechanics that you have to repeat time and again with better and better gear to take down more and more powerful enemies. The skill trees are simpler than POE/2, but they can be daunting at first. My advice would be to use your common sense to build your first seasonal toon, and then go for build guides in the endgame. \r\n\r\nThe endgame used to be a long slog to Level 100 after Level 50. That has been replaced by the more familiar (and comfortable) Level 60 + 300 Paragon levels. Most players don't manage to go beyond Paragon 250 in any season, as it takes an insane amount of xp. But by that time, you should have filled up everything on your skill tree and paragon board (a kinda extended skill tree) to make you truly badass. \r\n\r\nThe gear system is even more complicated than in D3, with lots of percentages, ranges, this effect procs on that, etc. etc. It takes a while to figure out, but these days, that's your lot if you go into any major RPG. Overall, returning players won't feel too overwhelmed, since the expansion has now added back mercenaries and runes to complete everything you got in D3. \r\n\r\nFinally, the difficulty system has been made even more convoluted, and not necessarily for the better. Normal is very easy, Hard is easy, expert is hard, penitent is very hard, and then you have the torment difficulties where difficulty rises exponentially. The goal is to get better gear, hone your stats and push the pit till you unlock the next difficulty. Reach the highest one, and you're facing tormented bosses that can drop mythic items. Collect mythic items to complete your gear journey and then melt everything on the map that has a red health bar over it. \r\n\r\nNext season, rinse and repeat. \r\n\r\nConclusion - Diablo continues to do what it has done for the past decade - churn out what was a decent story once, and keep making variations of it as if the scriptwriters were asked to work on half pay. At the same time, the game remains engaging and the progression feels meaningful. Once you're at the peak though, it just feels good to let off steam after a long day at work by melting metric tonnes of infernals. Not everyone will want to \"just let off steam,\" and it will get boring for some after a season or two. But that's what Diablo has always been about, and D4 can be seen as a continuation of the same.",

Better than D3 in my eyes, and it has a lot of content..

Lilith is waiting, but so are approximately ten thousand side dungeons.\n\nDiablo IV is the triumphant return of the franchise after the divisive D3 era. The game is GORGEOUS - like, genuinely stunning. Sanctuary has never looked this oppressively beautiful, with gothic environments that make you feel like you're stomping through a metal album cover.\n\nThe gameplay loop is classic Diablo: click demons, collect loot, get stronger, click bigger demons. It's simple, it's satisfying, and it's dangerously addictive. The class designs are solid, and building your character feels rewarding.\n\nWith only 4 out of 35 achievements, I've clearly got a long road ahead. The seasonal content keeps things fresh, though the battle pass can feel a bit grindy if you're not careful.\n\nThe always-online requirement is annoying if you're in rural Ontario with spotty internet, but when it works, it works well. Co-op is seamless, and encountering other players in the open world adds to the atmosphere.\n\nIs it better than Diablo II? That's heresy to even ask, bud. But it's a damn good ARPG that'll consume your evenings faster than you can say \"just one more dungeon.\"",

      "review": "Some games scratch an itch. Call of Duty scratches the \"FPS/Paintball\" itch, X-Com scratches the \"turn based strategy\" itch. Diablo scratches that \"I wanna absolutely destroy a screen-full of enemies with big bouncy numbers and special effects\" type of itch. Sometimes I just wanna play a game like that, and that's what this is. Sure, there are a few games that do this type of thing, but I have a history with Diablo that goes back to the first game, so I chose this one.\n\nI unironically enjoyed the campaign. If you take away the parts of the story that were like--\"So, we've reached our destination, but oh-no, we need XYZ to make the story happen, go get that and come back\" parts, it's actually not that bad. It's a bit Hollywood, and not as nuanced and thought-provoking as one would like, but it's fine. The main villains are the best part. Lilith and [spoiler]Baal[/spoiler] are both on point.\n\nGameplay wise it's exactly what you would expect: Start off a shrimp dealing two-digit damage numbers, gradually improve your gear, get uber powerful, and then pump up the difficulty till you're not so powerful again, then gradually get even MORE powerful, etc. By the end of it all, you're doing 7-figure damage numbers. Feels good, man.\n\nThe post-game stuff is a tad insane at first glance. It kind of throws all of these events and currencies, systems and subsystems at you; some explained, some explained poorly. You mostly just need to do the things, and everything eventually clicks.\n\nOverall, if you got that gameplay itch, this one does the job just fine.",

By the time I got to Paragon 50-100 it was fun again, Now on Torment II it's very time consuming. If T1 was easy T2 takes forever to beat a boss or a dungeon and basically no improvements to get a better drop. Fun game tho, I would say 7/10.",

      "review": "This is basically an updated version of Diablo 3. It has improved on a lot of areas, but it has some dawnsides as well, compared to 3. The main things that got improved are obviously the graphics, the atmosphere is dark and gothic again, and the classes and the gameplay loop seems more refined. On the downside, while the graphics are definitely improved, they have massively more powerful requirements from your pc, and in many ways feel like the difference in quality is not worth the hefty requirements. Also, the game is very zoomed in most of the time which can cause dizziness to some people, including me, depending on what monitor you are playing. I would have wished for a more zoomed out camera by default. Though, you can get used to it, somewhat, it is not ideal. Other than that, the game has some nasty moneytisation scheme with the battlepass. I suppose Blizzard wants people to moneytise Seasons in D4, unlike D3 where the Seasons were paid by those who bought the game. It is not a cheap game, and it will have expansions, so it is a little shady on their part. In any way, those are basically cosmetics so who cares. Do i recommend the game? Yes. It is not a life changing game, but it is fun to play, it is fun to experience the story and the various classes and participate in a few seasons here and there. Definitely get the base game and expansion on a sale.",

However, Diablo 4's music is stellar, much better than 3 and slightly better than 2 honestly.   \n\nThe story is well fleshed out, and with quite a lot more game than the others, the size of this game is the size of all the other Diablo games put together.   The lore is dark, introducing many new characters, while referencing known ones.  The pacing for how much of a game it is, is done well enough, and allows you to decide a large portion of grinding through plenty of side quests, and side dungeons.  Even a lot of the side quests feel like the main ones in previous games. \n\nThe world is designed rather well. It is dark and varied, with plenty of places and reasons to explore.  The game is very loot friendly, and designed in a way when you play with friends you don't have to fight or choose loot, it does it all for you in a way.  \n\nIt is best played with a friend, like all Diablo games. The trade and loot system is efficient. Mounts allow fast travel when you are not teleporting.  The weapons are fun to upgrade, and the skins that you can design your outfit with give a lot of reward for quests, especially nightmare dungeons. \n\nThe atmosphere and setting is probably the darkest of the series, even darker than the first.  It is really well done in some areas. Meh in others. But the world did feel alive, and full of dread.   Some of the dungeons and areas they took great pride and passion with, and you can tell. \n\nThe combat is nice, and well thought out, It feels powerful. The progression of skills is both layered, and intuitive. The classes are well varied, though I do miss a classic paladin style class with shield/sword, and holy magic. Other than that I really like the classes, and they are well though out, especially the rogue, and druid. The enemies, and monsters, are the best in the series. (though I miss not having any pharaohs, and mummies) Lilith is an amazing antagonist, and I really enjoyed following the story up to the main battle. She is my favorite main boss enemy of the series aside from Diablo himself.  They did a hell of a job designing her. \n\nDiablo 4 was a massive step in the right direction after Diablo 3.",

Is this the best Diablo game ever made? Absolutely not. It is, however, a massive leap forward from what I played at launch. The game at launch felt unfinished at best, and I didn't return until a few weeks back when I saw several content creators praising this season. I'm glad I did!\r\n\r\nI actually enjoyed the vanilla story. The cutscenes were solid, and I actually followed everything and played through it again when starting back up. It isn't ground breaking, sure, but it was dark and felt very fitting for the brand. The VoH story, on the other hand, did not hold up so well. Why the heck does every major company devolve into these sappy \"we can do this because we have each other,\" bs so frequently? I enjoy that stuff in JRPG's, but it felt out of place here. Mephisto was intriguing, but that's about it. The ending \"twist\" was also pretty crappy.\r\n\r\nLuckily, this game is made for the game play and the loot, both of which are major steps up here. Chaos armor feels great, and the seasonal powers are awesome. I have one of everything at max, and every class has at least one fun build and several viable builds. Really great spot to be in! \r\n\r\nSeason 10 is almost over, and I'll likely wait until the expansion to play again. Worth a try regardless and would recommend.",

I didn’t like Path of Exile — got overwhelmed early, too many enemies, too messy — and I wasn’t sure I’d even adapt to the top-down camera. But Diablo IV surprised me in the best way possible.\n\nThe combat feels smooth and satisfying, almost like a slower, darker Hades. The world and atmosphere scratch the same dark-fantasy itch I get from Elden Ring and Bloodborne, but without being punishing. The story has just the right amount of cutscenes — way more than Elden Ring, but not too many — and the real-time cinematics with your character actually feel great.\n\nIt’s accessible, not overwhelming, and every fight feels good. It hit the exact spot I wanted: something with dark vibes, fun combat, and enough story to pull me in without drowning me in lore.\n\nIf you want a game that’s easy to get into, fun to grind, and gives you that “one more dungeon” feeling… yeah, this delivers.\n\nSuggestions\n\n• Try a couple classes — they feel very different.\n• Play the campaign first — it’s short, clean, and sets the tone.\n• Don’t stress your build early — the game’s super forgiving at the start.",

There’s Hordes, Lair Bosses, Undercity, Helltides, capstone dungeons, the pit, it just keeps going.\r\n\r\nThe Open World aspect sucks. It’s just a way to get me to waste time sprinting back and forth on my horse. I'm convinced the entire open world-ness is there for padding time. \r\n\r\nThe game desperately needs better itemization. You cannot have legendary items be the base. To the point the game automatically gets rid of white and yellow items (which matter for all of 20 levels?). If nothing else that is a failure of the crafting system. And while there seems to be a decent variety of uniques, later on during the end-game activities the drop rate is absurdly high and begin to see the same ones over and over.\r\n\r\nAnd that brings me to the story. The story is atrocious. Not only are you endlessly sprinting, escorting, and fetch questing, you also get to watch Mephisto walk through portals for 20 hours. A few fantastic cutscenes though.",

      "review": "I really wanted to enjoy this. I mean, it's more Diablo. My first physical PC game is Diablo 3 and I've likely put a thousand hours into it. I also had some time in D1 and 2. Part of this is a personal thing about the gameplay feel, but also it just being a straight up worse experience. \n\nTo start with, I want to say that I like the story presentation. It's quite unlike the previous games and in a way it does rob the franchise of its unique storytelling style, but it's fine. I found myself having fun adventuring with Lorath again, as I found him interesting in 3 and wanted to see more of him. He's the highlight of this game's story. The story itself isn't perfect by any means but it was enjoyable for what it was. That being said, they really just slapped a ''to be continued'' in other words and never intended for it to feel finished there. Say, if you watched The Walking Dead series, they split the season releases in two. The base game felt the way the first half of a season there did. I haven't played Vessel of Hatred as of writing this and at this point I'm not sure I would until many years from now. There is a bit of storytelling each season, but it does feel like it expects you to have experienced the expansion as it more or less tells you important bits. Say, 'are we going to fight Mephisto?' Yeah, the seasons spoil that. \n\nSpeaking of seasons: The game is now set up as a live service, however it also releases expansions. The fun part is though, just about everything released is in the base game, so people who bought the first expansion aren't really getting any exclusive content and the new area is just being ignored as a place to release new content in. I'm not sure it was a well thought out idea. It hurts the game to have these expansions really.\n\nOn the looks side of things I'm mixed. The scale is closer to negative than positive though. It kind of feels like it tried to copy other games that..copied the Diablo games before them, as the style feels closer to those. Everyone's beloved Diablo 2 had a lot more colour and even then it managed to sell us on just how dark the place is. Style over realism always. It also did a lot of environmental and gameplay storytelling, something that 4 never managed to do for me. 4 can't sell me on how scary hell is when this boss they're building towards/ an enemy we're supposed to be afraid of as they'd just killed a major character in the story just dies in 5 seconds. Sure, since I did the story they reworked the difficulties, but again, the ''intended'' difficulty 2 is still just too easy, difficulty 3 *may* be satisfying, but if you play that while leveling, the bosses very much don't feel like they've been intended to be played at that difficulty. Your regular enemy will most likely die quickly enough, but then they set up a boss with an enormous health bar you'll likely need 2-3 minutes of fighting to down and you take 80% of your health per hit. Something in the middle, please? Something like Expert-Master of Diablo 3(again, during leveling), where everything has the ability to kill you, but you're also a threat to them as well.\n\nOn the visual topic, I also want to address the fact that visibility is poor for a lot of abilities. The highly saturated and very clear visuals of Diablo 3 are gone, leaving those muted and often hard to see enemy abilities that to me feel like their main difficulty is in seeing them. Also, say, the explosive affix had a very obvious explosion sound, the poison effect had a very obvious contrasting green that you can quickly see and get out of on top of the sound it made. Realism hurts this game so much.\n\nMy main gripes, however, come from gameplay, UI and systems.\n\nUI: I often feel like I'm playing one of those free Asian games, where you have 45 events going, with 3 menus for each, as well as notification dots to clear that drive you insane. Speaking of, WHY the notifications? Do I really need to open the title menu after every achievement to check that out? Do I really need to check every single legendary power I salvaged, as if I hadn't already checked them out before salvaging? The game has no option to hide them. Awful. Absolutely awful. Next, they've added a battle pass (my feelings on that are very strong and negative but it's not so much about that now). Okay, fine, so we're adding cosmetics to the shop. Why does their quality just feel higher? Why are they more than the obtainable sets in the game? Why is there only a single obtainable pet when Diablo 3 had dozens, why did they add the shop cosmetics to the wardrobe window even if you don't own them? The first two seasons of the game that I played's battle pass did give us sets that were really cool, honestly. This pirate-themed thing they had was gorgeous. That being said, these sets are now not free to obtain by playing anymore(on top of the FOMO system) The new system gives you a portal, a few weapons. That's all, folks.\n \nI am very disappointed. And the reason why this matters more than, say, the story, is that they expect you to come back to this game often. They try giving you reasons to. The story you'll likely do once or twice if at all.\n\nOn the gameplay&systems side: Skills and Paragons are overdesigned. I feel like especially at the early paragon levels I spent more time clicking stuff to remove level-up notifications than actually play the game. And they make enough of a difference especially early on that you do want to do this. Simultaneously the nodes are so incredibly boring. Have a few points of (main stat), have a few points of health. Occasional ''legendary'' node that actually does something interesting. It's just so bloated. Initially itemisation was even more bloated, but people pushed back against it and they changed it. Took them a very long time though.\n\nI hate the loot so much. B l o a t. What is so legendary about legendaries that drop from every other pack of enemies? (A common complaint with D3 as well) What is up with uniques that you can just get multiples of by killing the same boss over and over. You're not excited about the loot. You're excited about getting high stat lines. (Gives me those Drakensang Online flashbacks with the yellow lines people would spend hundreds of hours on. Not positive flashbacks, mind you.)\nWhy are there 45 things dropping all the time? Why do I need to sort through everything or just ignore loot/collect everything without looking and just click the ''salvage all'' button once I get my legendary powers going by lvl 30?\n\nRenown system is awful and it also hurts starting new characters (and seasons!). So they decided to have you treat the game like an MMO, dropped the wow reputation system and gave you very clear gameplay benefits in the form of skill points to make you do all of this. At the same time, they've created so many copy-paste dungeons, hundreds of side quests, an enormous map. Nothing really feels memorable. There were very small amount of interesting side quests, the incredibly rare butcher encounter and it all kind of just expects you to turn your brain off and play on autopilot. I hope there are people who enjoy this. I'm not one of them. There's also the ''altars of lilith'' thing, that has you find a ton of these so that you can get the majority of your renown &some permanent buffs. \n\nSo, on the class gameplay side, I don't really like the skill tree. The skills and runes, with the 4 passives of Diablo 3 felt much more involved and intuitive to me. I don't have anything else to add, I just don't like this system.\n\nOverall, there is some % of the game that tries its hardest to show itself and make you love it, but you have to fight through many many issues and annoyances to get to the core fun. I wish I didn't have to say negative things about a franchise that has given me so much to love and so many fun moments and memories. Because I really tried to love it, despite the fun more or less ending for me the moment I finished the game's story.",

Sell your stocks.\n\nIt's so damn boring after the lacklustre story. You could do so much more with Lillith and the other evils storywise, but all the fights seem so useless. They're just bullet sponges, just another bump on the road. I suppose that's where the x-amount of difficulties come up, but what happens? Now every enemy is a sponge. Fuuuuck!\n\nSkills are eh, whatever. I suppose in Diablo 5 there's no need for skills, just press mouse button and it does things. It would be different If I could use more of them, but that's just upholding the D2 bar.\nSame with classes. Why bother with different classes, just go back to Diablo 1 with melee, mage and range. /s. Fucking hell.\n\nMercenaries are behind a DLC wall. Trash. Fuck you.\n\nEven the equipment seems so \"Eh\". If it fits your skills, you'll equip it. Yay. Gems? Doesn't matter. Fucking meh.\n\nAlways online \"mmo\" is super trash, pure garbage barbecue. (Just like D2 resu.) Especially when I didn't see or meet anyone in my 2-3x playthrough of the whole story. I just went to kill my first world boss, but I was there alone and the boss escaped with couple of pixels of health left. Lovely. Oh right, everyone's in the super mega apocalypse difficulty in the DLC map. So bring a friend to make things less boring and laugh together. Or join a party with randoms. Oh fug ::DD:D\n\nWhy is my character trying to take selfies all the time? The camera is TOO DAMN CLOSE! Only in big battles the camera zooms out and you'll go \"Oh, so they can do that, but wont...\" Fuck you.\n\nAlso Diablo without Diablo isn't Diablo. Fuck you.\n\nCutscenes are great. Fuck me!",

      "review": "Hello dear Diablo enjoyer,\nThis game is just bad. \nI really enjoyed Diablo 2 and I am one of not too many Diablo 3 apologists. \nHaving said that, lemme discourage you from buying this nothing burger. \nThis game bumps into a three body problem. It wants to be Diablo 2, Diablo 3 and PoE at the very same time. \n\nStory: \nSleeper. DLC story is just LOL at this point. To be honest, it makes Diablo 3 timeline look as if it was written by Quentin Tarantino. \n\nCombat: \nThe skill tree structure is just plainly stupid. Why would you make anything about character progression counter-intuitive or simply incomprehensible without an hour long tutorial on specific gear+rune+skill combo? On top of that, repetitive and low-speed fight is NO FUN.\nLet me give you examples from previous parts: \nDiablo 2 - choose sorceress ==> get teleport (passively) ==> spam teleport ==> spam skills ==> improve character ==> be unstoppable \nDiablo 3 - choose barbarian ==> go for whirlwind build (set) ==> run at Usain Bolt's pace through rifts ==> farm gear ==> become a nuclear bomb aftershock \nBoth of these games had something this game doesn't, which is ability to break the game. \nThis installment is basically a Soyjack meme of a basement dweller telling you either no-hit Dark Souls or you do not get the FuLl eXpErIeNcE. I believe that the ability to overcome any challenge thrown in by the developer consistuted the beauty of this series. \n\nMap/World: \nDesign choices seem to be taken from MMOs such as Lord of The Rings Online, where siege system has been a vibrant highlight for a while. Nevertheless, in LOTRO your class of choice makes any difference and max raid capacity is 48 people. I didn't feel thrilled whatsoever whilst playing this game. I believe it has more to do with open world structure. Games such as diablo ought to be linear. Maybe it is a hot take, but I believe that if Diablo 2 or Diablo 3 were open world games they would lose quite a lot in terms of their value (definitely diablo 2, as we all know we were just no-life rift grinders in D3). With such a bold move to make it an open-world game designers forgot that the narrative loses its primary significance to the players journey. It is beyond me how a story-driven masterpiece can stoop so low. \n\nProgression: \nThis is the hardest no I have given to any game within last 10 years. How can you push people to farm hundreds of hours to just get an item with bad specs and then limit rerolls, for example? Make them gradually more expensive. There is plethora of such anti-player choices it is literally mind-boggling at this point. Character progression until it hits paragon levels is a garbage fire. After that it becomes a bio-hazardous landfil wildfire. Trying to emulate PoE is the biggest sin of this game. Diablo and PoE have definitely different targets. PoE will never hit dad-gamer market and PoE holds zero nostalgia-bait value. As I am not a dad-gamer myself I still believe that there is a huge value to musou power-trip games, especially if they depict some elements of dark fantasy mixed with judeo-christian landscapes. Someone looked at last 25 years of Diablo and said \"naaah, we good. Have you played PoE,though?\". Utter disgrace. \n\n\nEndgame: \nPoE ctrl+c ctrl+v with a hint of D3 rift system (without the fun of it) \n\nLoot: \nThe irony of this game having a tag \"loot\" is immeasurable. Basically all the tags for this game are probably just things you would like this game to be.\n\n\nConclusion: \nI know this game is tempting you to risk it all (like 40$ on discount) like a goth latina baddie who just got off her meds, but trust me, just like with this chick - you will not fix it. It will drain your energy, it will make you reconsider your life choices at 3 AM, will make you go to forums for advice and will make you go see mental counselor just to evaluate if it all was your fault. \nOverall this game is a guy with a small pp, who goes around town saying it smells like a big one. \nAvoid purchase at all cost. \nBuy D2 and D3 and have fun, bro.",

If you are idle for to long you get kicked, understandably, but I got kicked for simply studying the map to find dungeons I had not completed. You can't just save anywhere you like so if you are in the middle of a dungeon you can leave the game and it will save your progress but you have to start the dungeon from the start again. If you need to take a bathroom break r whatever, you can hit the \"P\" key to cast a portal and that will bring you back to town but you only have so much time to stay idle before the kick you. This is frustrating as all hell. After you reach a certain level everything the enemies drop will be all garbage and nothing worth using for yourself, and that gets very frustrating. Overall the game is pretty cool but I would not, and did not, pay full price. Wait till Steam has it on sale, and don't pay more than $15 for the game because they clearly don't want you to own it when they force you to play online.

There’s Hordes, Lair Bosses, Undercity, Helltides, capstone dungeons, the pit, it just keeps going.\r\n\r\nThe Open World aspect sucks. It’s just a way to get me to waste time sprinting back and forth on my horse. I'm convinced the entire open world-ness is there for padding time. \r\n\r\nThe game desperately needs better itemization. You cannot have legendary items be the base. To the point the game automatically gets rid of white and yellow items (which matter for all of 20 levels?). If nothing else that is a failure of the crafting system. And while there seems to be a decent variety of uniques, later on during the end-game activities the drop rate is absurdly high and begin to see the same ones over and over.\r\n\r\nAnd that brings me to the story. The story is atrocious. Not only are you endlessly sprinting, escorting, and fetch questing, you also get to watch Mephisto walk through portals for 20 hours. A few fantastic cutscenes though.",

This Diablo I don't care for because charectors don't matter they get deleted after a period of time or reset. So there is no RPG aspect in this game for me, it's just an action game without those elements for me. The lack of offline content and forcing players online is another aspect of this version of the game I just don't like one bit. Half the time when you are in areas people come from out of no where to get the loot while you deal with the hordes.
