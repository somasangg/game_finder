It removes the fun/incentive to gearing out multiple characters because of the time it takes for people like me who don't have a lot of time to play\n2.  If people try to join mid-to-late season, (just like once human) you don't get a lot of time to gear your character\n3.  I was hoping this game would be more progressional, like WoW; where content gets added (like expansions) where your gear can be delvl'd or something but you don't get gimped and start from nothing.  Also, to keep the left side of the talent tree; because why start from nothing when you've already earned and learned your character?  \n\nJust my opinion.  But I feel like a lot of people, including myself, would not feel good coming back to this game in-between other games if our characters have been wiped.  I would look forward to continuing my character even if the gear was delvl'd, because I still have my left talent tree earned and filled out, and aren't starting from nothing because I earned it.\n\nMy 2 cents.  Otherwise I'd personally lose motivation to keep starting over.",

      "review": "If your favourite part of MMOs is doing dungeons with a party of 4, but you're disappointed by how simple and easy the dungeons are in FFXIV, or don't want to keep up with the baggage of playing retail WOW, then Fellowship is exactly what you're looking for.\n\nFellowship is a nearly 1:1 recreation of the \"Mythic Plus\" Dungeon system from World of Warcraft; with none of the massive open world or long levelling requirements. Controls, movement, class mechanics, and even aesthetics will be instantly recognisable to any veteran of WOW from the past 10 years, but there's no long levelling process to get into the good part; you can jump straight into a dungeon with well-scaled difficulty, diverse monster types, and engaging bosses alongside 3 of your friends only minutes after installing the game.\n\nThe downsides; Dungeons are the focus of the game, and it doesn't have room for much else. There's no open world here, no deep character customization or personalization, and not much room for roleplay. You play a stock Hero setup; a personality, visual, and set of abilities in the same vein as a character from Overwatch or DOTA, only that you're picking between WOW style MMO holy trinity classes.\n\nSecond; the solo queue is... hit or miss. Make no mistake; this game is best played with friends. Even duo queues aren't so bad, but if you plan to go at this alone, you'll be subject to both the best and worst that party finder has to offer- and usually the worst. It's not totally intolerable, but it's not great, and as of Early Access in October 2025, the game is missing some important social tools to assist with this.\n\nStill, I think what's on offer is well worth the asking; the second my group got into the flow of clearing dungeons together like the glory days of WOW, we felt right at home, and you might too.

Here's how Fellowship does it better.\r\n\r\n[h3]There is no raiding[/h3]\r\nYou are not at a disadvantage in dungeons for not committing to play with a structured raiding guild. There might be raids coming, but as I understand the devs are actively opposed to this problem (that Blizzard perpetuates with every WoW season), so I expect these raids to not be mandatory for your dungeon success.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is no questing or leveling or even an open world. Just dungeons and a hub of services.\r\n\r\n[h3]There is no trading[/h3]\r\nYou're not paying your local goblins on a regular basis for crafts or consumables. You're not enduring shady loot sales. Players can't trade each other anything or even pass on loot for each other.\r\n\r\n[h3]Goons return to our dungeons[/h3]\r\nThere are monsters that do nothing but slap the tank. This means you can have fun, large pulls without worrying about how you're going to deal with every monster having three different abilities that you need to account for. Some mobs do things, but some are really just lovely AoE fodder.\r\n\r\n[h3]Other delights:[/h3]\r\n* Fear my wrath: When you use a defensive or your ultimate ability, there is a voice line everyone in your party hears. I always feel sorry for the boss when I hear Rime use Wrath of Winter.\r\n* The right amount of lore: The game doesn't really have a coherent story; it leaves a lot to the player's imagination. But the dungeons and flavor texts certainly fill in a lot of blanks without being overbearing. They give you enough to build your own idea, without trying to overcompensate based on being your only sources of lore.\r\n* Trinket design: Every trinket has some stats and a utility usage (resurrection, dispel, move speed, etc). You choose based on the tricks you need for the dungeon, not what you simmed to be the best.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, someone (or multiple someones) deserves praise for the fact that despite Fellowship early access being a huge success, it's not tainted by overloaded servers. There was foresight here.",

It effectively distills the best part of dungeon crawlers into a jump-in, jump-out experience that respects your time.\n\nWhy It Works for Busy Gamers\n\nFor someone like me who doesn't have endless hours to sink into dailies and raids, this game is a breath of fresh air. You get that high-level dungeon crawling \"fix\" without the massive time investment.\n\nThe developers are clearly listening to the community and putting in the work:\n\nClass Balancing: The constant tweaks show they care about keeping the meta healthy.\n\nNew Heroes: The roster is expanding nicely, giving us fresh ways to play.\n\nEvents: The Haunting of Stronghold Halloween event cool enough for some new skins and mounts.\nThe One Downside: The Timer\n\nHowever, there is one mechanic that holds the game back from perfection: The Dungeon Timer.\n\nJust like in WoW Mythic+, the timer forces a \"rush culture.\" Instead of enjoying the dungeon and playing strategically, people just sprint through packs.\n\nIt encourages skipping content rather than fighting it.\n\nOne small mistake can ruin the timer, making the whole run feel wasted.\n\nIt creates unnecessary stress in what should be a fun challenge.\n\nFeedback: Difficulty > Speed\n\nI would much rather see the difficulty come from complex boss mechanics and harder trash mobs than an arbitrary clock.\n\nLet us wipe 100 times on a boss while we learn the strategy.\n\nLet us figure out a puzzle or a tough phase.\n\nThat feels rewarding.\n\nBeating a timer just feels like we ran fast enough. Beating a boss that crushed us 10 times feels like a victory.\n\nVerdict\n\nFellowship is doing amazing work. If the devs can offer a mode that focuses on difficulty over speed, this would easily be the best dungeon crawler on the market.\n\nCurrent Score: 8/10 (Would be a 10/10 without the timer!)",

The talent tree system with abilities and even some of the weapons' own talent trees offer unique play styles that are fun to try out. Almost everything for every type of gamer.

      "review": "Let me start with saying \"This game is great and highly addictive.\"\n\nAs a long time veteran wow player i can say this game is great. If you like M+ then this will be your jam. While easy to pick up, pushing io (its called like dungon rating or something but we all know what it is) becomes harder and its challanges start to show. \n\nBosses gain new mechanics as you push difficultly tiers and kicks and pathing start to matter more and more in order to time. Which is nice with keeping it fresh and fun. \n\nThe instances are different enough to make them not overly stale, though can become so when playing multiplue characters. \n\nTiming only helps push io, so getting loot for completion feels good even if we didnt time. The loot down grades 1-2 levels from what the timed version would be. You can still upgrade them with gold so nothing really lost other than io and time. \n\nToons feel good to play, different and simple enough to pick up for a quick change of pace. Swapping toons is simple, mats are shared on an account level so if you farm on one you can upgrade quickly on another. It leaves a lot of room for more heroes in the future. \n\nSome people have an issue with gender locked heroes. I dont really care about it and for all of us who forget this is how it was in D2 back in the day sooo we have delt with it before and were fine. \n\nWhat i hope they will impliment in the future that im sure they have on the radar is:\n1. Specific dungy queuing. Hard to push io for a specific dungy when there are 3 to choose one and typically everyone wants to do the highest level one available.\n2. No deserter penalty. While this is nice, this door swings both ways. Bad group? Be that guy and leave who cares! At the boss and dude doesnt want to finish if we dont time? Rough. While i see both sides, it is annoying to not finish. I would think a happy comprimise is that after 10+ mins? 8 mins? over time you can leave w/o a penatly. This gives a few attempts at a boss over time to still get loot, but if its not happening then its ok to leave. \n3. Ability to change gear at start of dungy. I think talents should stay locked. But if we are about to start and want to run chicken trinkets or invis, rez, or w/e and we are not premade then i think there should be an ability to corridinate. \n\nEither way, if you stayed this long i appresh. Hopefully this helps inform of what to expect. I hope for lots to come b/c this game is exactly what people want without the full WOW experiance.",

I've been a Mythic+ enjoyer in WoW since Legion and to have a game where it's only that is of course right up my alley. I've only played the tanks and healers but all these patches that come out buff them in different ways to make them more appealing and I love that direction. This is how an EA game should be handled before it hits 1.0.\n\nThe interrupt system is next level when used correctly in a group. What we can edit in the UI is enough and they are adding more things to it every patch. The power gains as you advance are really fun. You go from basic stats to using relics and weapon abilities and then the weapons have skill trees too and getting gems to get more passive fun. The dungeons themselves are very straight forward routing wise. The smaller dungeons all have one boss at the end with capstone dungeons doing a 3 boss dungeon. Tanking in WoW can be a bit stressful because you also have to plan your route and there are a bit too many optimizations there. Here, it's more or less go left or right until you get to the boss. That may sound boring but the fights along the way make up for that. A lot of pulls feel like a dance where you have an answer if you manage your cooldowns correctly.\n\nI'm really looking forward to this game's future, it seems bright and so far, they are going in the right direction with patches and buffs.",

I personally can't stop playing it!\n\nCurrently the game is early access and quite frankly the negative reviews on this game just reflect people who expect a perfectly polished game upon release. The developers are continuously working round the clock to meet the feedback of the player base to ensure that problems are fixed. (This includes Class tuning, Bugs, UI update requests and Item fixes and Tuning). This process is expected to take time but the dev team are trying their best.\n\nHonest points of feedback:\nThe game uses a match making system to assign random players to groups. As people are aware that gamers who are not casual players have a tendency to be toxic in regards to knowing what your doing dps & boss tactics wise. I would advise personally just to spend a quick few mins to look up the class your going to play rotation and dungeon guides. There really isn't anything too complex. Not like wow class guides :P \n(This isn't a problem with the game just a human population problem that has conditioned its self to not just enjoy games but to play everything to a meta standard).\n\nCurrently There is no end game match making system in place for the eternal difficulty which means using Discord to find yourself team members. However this hasn't been an issue and is beneficial if you want voice coms for the higher end content. I believe at the minute your expected to find people who are good along the way to eternal rank. Adding them as friends and continuing your journey upwards with those you found on your way. (Hence the Fellowship :P) \n\nOverall I really can't knock it the game has HUUUUGE potential. Especially when they implement more classes or different game modes in the future potentially.

The game automatically selects dungeon difficulties for you based on your gear and experience, and then gives you four dungeons to choose from. However, it happens very often that someone leaves the queue immediately if the other players pick a dungeon they don’t want to run.\r\n\r\nAs a DPS player, this means you often have to try several times to get a group, and you end up waiting a lot. I would prefer a queue system that allows players to freely choose a range of difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe developers are doing a great job, adding new content every week and improving many aspects of the game based on player feedback.

      "review": "As pretty much every MMORPG player has already said, Fellowship is basically \"Mythic+: The Game.\" However, if you haven't played World of Warcraft (WoW) before then this won't mean much, so let me try to summarise what Fellowship is.\n\n[h3] Core Gameplay [/h3]\n\nYou choose a hero that performs one of three roles: Tank, Damage Dealer, or Healer. Heroes are tied to a particular role. For example, you can't play Sylvie as a Damage Dealer. This is very different to WoW, where you would choose a class rather than a hero, and a class could be built to perform any role. Currently, there are only two Tanks, two Healers, and about half a dozen Damage Dealers. Each hero has their own playstyle and set of abilities, and different heros within the same role can be quite different to play (at least in my experience mostly playing the two Healer heroes). I think the heroes are done well, and I think it is even a strength that heroes are tied to specific roles since it makes for much more streamlined \"skill trees.\"\n\n[h3] [strike] Skill [/strike] Talent Trees [/h3]\n\nHeroes don't have traditional skill trees in which you can unlock abilities. Instead, heroes have a set number of skills that you unlock by completing a certain number of dungeons. To add build diversity, heroes instead a \"Talent\" tree. Talent Points are unlocked by completing dungeones and beating increasingly difficult dungeons. Talent Points can be spent to buy passive buffs (such as increased Block Chance) or add special effects to your skills (e.g., casting Skill X has a chance to buff your next cast of Skill Y in some way).\n\n[h3] What Do You Do? [/h3]\n\nUnlike WoW, Fellowship does not have an open world. Instead, you spawn in a central hub. In this hub there are a number of vendors you can speak to to buy and modify equipment, and you queue for dungeons by interacting with the War Table. I won't go into the equipment since it's pretty much what you'd expect from a game like this, and I'll only briefly discuss dungeons. Dungeons require a four-player group: one Tank, two Damage Dealers, and one Healer. While it's possible to beat a dungeon with only a single Damage Dealer, as far as I know there is no way to enter a dungeon without being in a four-player group. Dungeons reward you with gear, currency, and a \"Dungeon Score.\" To get the highest Dungeon Score, you have to beat the dungeon as quickly as possible. However, you cannot rush to the final boss since dungeons require killing a certain number of enemies to be completed. Thankfully, you won't fail a dungeon if you don't beat it in the alloted time so you never have to worry about wasting your time. I think the dungeons are done very well.\n\n[h3] The Usual Problems [/h3]\n\nUnfortunately, queueing for dungeons has all the problems you'd expect. If you're playing solo as one of the Damage Dealer heroes, you might be waiting a while. If you're a Tank or Healer, you'll probably find groups quite quickly. If you're unlucky enough to get put into a group with a toxic Tank or Healer, they might ragequit and render the dungeon impossible to beat. While I don't blame the game itself for these problems, I would like to see penalties for quitting dungeons early to deter this kind of behaviour (excluding quickplay, obviously). It's such a frustrating waste of time to queue for a dungeon only to have the Tank or Healer leave you up $h!t's creek without a paddle.\n\n[h3] Combat [/h3]\n\nOnce you're in a dungeon, combat is very similar to WoW. This can be a bit of a learning curve for players that never played WoW, especially those playing ranged heroes. \"Tab Targeting\" is your friend. If you're a healer, you can cast heals on an ally by hovering your mouse of the player's name in the group menu just above your ability bars. By doing this, you can keep targeting enemies while healing your allies instead of constantly changing targets. Tanks and Damage Dealers also have \"Interrupt\" abilities that can cancel enemy spell casting. This requires a bit of coordination within your group since interrupts have a moderate cooldown. Other than that, combat can be boiled down to: Tank distracts and soaks up damage, Damage Dealers deal damage, and Healers, well, heal. Again, nothing revolutionary, but a tried and tested system that will be familiar to WoW players.\n\n[h3] Another Unreal Engine 5 Game [/h3]\n\nFinally, one last thing I'd like to touch on is Fellowship's choice of engine: Unreal Engine 5 (UE5). I hate UE5. Upon loading the game, you'll see high CPU utilisation during the hero selection screen as shaders are compiled in the background. Trying to choose a hero while this is happening results in a timeout, so you effectively can't play the game until this has happened, but you have no idea how close it is to finishing or roughly how long it will take. Mercifully, the game doesn't run like garbage once the shaders have compiled, though performance is certainly below what I'd expect given how limited the game's scope is. Fellowship is very GPU hungry but I'm not too sure why. Sure, the game looks pretty good, but I don't think the visuals justify the performance. That said, I'm more forgiving of smaller studios using proprietary engines, so I won't complain too much. It's perfectly playable.\n\n[h3] TL;DR/Summary [/h3]\n\nFellowship is a game about beating progressively difficult dungeons. That's it. It respects your time, and if you have a group to play with the experience can be fantastic. There isn't much \"new\" here, but it does what it does well. Really well. I expect this game will only get better with time, and right now I'd say it's worth it's asking price. Give it a go. You'll know whether or not it's something you want to play within the first two hours, so you can always refund it if it's not your cup of tea.",

      "review": "First off, I want to say that I REALLY like this game, and I absolutely want to give it a positive review. I think it has a few issues that I hope the devs buff out, and I think that they will! But in my opinion none of them detract from my enjoyment too much to say \"you shouldn't play this game\" besides possibly one. If you have experience in this genre and know how to be patient, are interested in learning mechanics and characters, and have the mentality to not let bad groups bother you, then there is ALOT to enjoy about this game. That being said there is one issue with the game has that has absolutely killed it for me and after encountering it I have not touched the game since; and if remedied I will happily roll my review to a recommend.\n\nFellowship as I saw it before release, and through the beta tests I participated in seemed to be marketed as a more solo player friendly, time respecting, and more focused alternative to the m+ system in WoW. Easy to pick up and play with or without your friends for just about as long or short as you wanted. The characters weren't bloated by dozens of spells and talents intended to fulfil purposes across several different styles of play, there wasn't 20 years of systems to familiarize yourself with, but still with enough depth to make learning and optimization fulfilling. And there is a lot of optimization in the end game! There are empowered sockets, legendaries, gem bonuses, set bonuses, weapon talent trees, all kinds of stuff. As someone who worked their way through paragon and into the final tier of gear I was looking forward to interacting with all of these systems and make my push towards the cool cosmetic rewards tied to the newly unlocked Eternal queue.\n\nBut there is a problem with that. In fact it's such a large problem that it caused me to write this review. Fellowship, the solo friendly, time respecting alternative to m+ in WoW, aided by it's \"click a button and you're in a group playing no questions asked\", for reasons inexplicable to me, decided to ditch this model in their infinitely scaling endgame mode.\n\nSo what is the alternative? It's fine, I've played WoW, I've spent plenty of time in LFG before, and besides, I main a healer, so I should get groups fine? I mean sure, it sucks for DPS players playing non-meta characters since they're just going to be denied from every group, but whatever I guess. Oh wait, whats that? There is no LFG system in the game? Okay well maybe I join a guild then and find people to play with, a Fellowship. Oh, there Isnt one of those either? Okay will this guy in my lobby has some eternal gear, maybe he'll be interested in playing with me? Ah, I can't whisper him, that Isnt in the game either...\n\nSo what is my option? Of course it's a clusterfuck discord server moving a hundred miles a minute. God what a fucking mess. You have to just sit in game for 30+ minutes either hoping you can snatch a tank up or hoping you get invited to do one run and disband. Essentially the same fucking experience of adept through paragon but with a extra steps. Baffling decision to me for what I could only imagine is to protect the egos of people coming into the game with their competitive m+ statics.\n\nI've waxxed poetic here but my main point is that I am done with Fellowship because I assumed I was 2/3rds of the way through progression but if I have to piss around in a discord server to do the same shit I was already doing with the click of a button I'm honestly just not going to bother. I'm sure some of the people reading this will find that a petty reason for this rant, or tell me to \"just make friends\" in the game with no tools to do so, and a game premise that suggested it was unnecessary; And it is fine if you do, but this is where I've decided I'm drawing the line. Ironically it drove me back to just doing m+ in wow because they have a better system for playing the game. Which is a hilarious prospect to me all things considered.\n\nAnyways, if you are experienced in the genre there is a lot to like here for about 60-100 hours, which is really not bad for the entry price. And if you're new to the genre I think it's a lot better entry point than WoW. I think the game is good, I think the devs care about it being good (mostly, unfortunately they seem to also care too much about what Twitch streamers think makes a game like this good), and I've supported it for a while, and I want to leave a good review, but it seems like eternal queue is not a priority for the devs at the moment for some reason, as I have seen no concrete confirmation to a timeframe for its release, and I feel this is the only way I have to make my voice heard. Once it is added I will gladly delete this review.\n\nEDIT: I have been informed that there is in-fact a \"confirmed\" date for eternal queue, which is great news. But until it is absolutely out and not covered in stupid stipulations I'm going to keep this review up.",

My team pushed to Eternal 30, earned the 0.1% platinum trims, collected all the Halloween skins, and geared multiple alts just below our mains.\n\nBut I can’t recommend this game for high-end M+ players in its current state.\n\nLack of Long-Term Goals\n\nThere’s only a single 10k achievement for a mount, and an 8.5k cap for alts. To put that in perspective: it’s easier than hitting ~3k in WoW M+. A premade group could reach that in roughly two weeks — yet seasons are clearly intended to last far longer. There’s no real “carrot” for the top 5% of players. Once you finish the initial push, the game becomes pure grind with no meaningful progression goal beyond repetition.\n\nTime-Respect Claims Don’t Match Reality\n\nThe developers marketed Fellowship as a game that respects your time. Outside of skipping traditional leveling, this simply isn’t true.\n\nQueue Times:\nBecause difficulty brackets aren’t condensed and the playerbase is small, many queues are dead — especially for DPS. I’ve personally seen queue times stretch beyond an hour.\n\nEternal Grind:\nOnce you enter Eternal, the time-respect goes out the window:\n\nYou must farm the correct weapon type.\nThen you must farm or reroll traits to get the right capstone ability.\nThen you sacrifice sets to chase random gem slots and 92 total gems that drop extremely slowly.\nThen you need those gem slots with specific stats and empowered gem slots (+35% power).\n\nMeanwhile you’re told the game is “about pushing and beating dungeons,” yet you spend 50–60 hours in Heart of Tuzari alone.\n\nAfter that, more time in Sailor’s Abyss 10 or 20.\nThen you slog through specific cursed dungeons hoping for a BiS drop with empowered stats.\n\nIt’s a massive treadmill disguised as endgame progression.\n\nProgression Loops Are Just Leveling With Extra Steps\n\nThe game tries to frame Contender → Adept → Challenger → Paragon as something different from leveling, but functionally it’s the same:\n\n7 dungeon levels with ilvl requirement. Clear a capstone  → earn skill points\n7 dungeon levels with ilvl requirement. Clear a capstone → earn skill points\n7 dungeon levels with ilvl requirement. Clear a capstone → earn skill points\nReach Eternal → earn skill points and a random legendary (No legendary bad luck protection) that may or may not be your BiS\n\nThis is leveling — just spread across differently named brackets.\n\nEternal Mode Is Oddly Structured\n\nEternal is basically a hunt for the easiest curse combinations so you can skip bad affixes and bad dungeons entirely. Before Eternal even starts to feel good, you’re stuck farming either:\n\nThe Paragon capstone dungeon, or Heart of Tuzari Eternal 2\n…over and over. My group has probably run that specific dungeon close to 300 times by now.\n\nOverall\n\nI’m disappointed with where the game currently stands. Not everyone needs a carrot to keep pushing endless dungeons, but many of us do — especially players coming from high-end M+. The game was marketed as respecting your time more than “that other game” (WoW), yet it ended up building the same systems with different names and even heavier RNG-based grind.\n\nThere’s a solid foundation here, and the dungeon gameplay itself is fun. But unless Fellowship adds meaningful long-term rewards or progression for top-tier players, it risks losing exactly the audience it was designed to attract.",

The quickplay is absolutely a grind and its EXTREMELY boring but its the only way to get fellowship marks, which lets you purchase material that's required later on. The drop rate in actual dungeons for these items is very very low and not worth doing it. The dungeons are really fun at first but then they get tedious. There aren't many and you quickly run out of things to do.\n\nThe game is actually extremely grindy, but its also fun if you wanna just waste a few hours. I quit at eternal 16 because there was nothing left for me to farm.\n\nThe community is both awesome and toxic and if you take a look at their general fellowship discussion channel you'll see that. If you always want to see a fight, start there. The class channels are better. The suggestion channels are the most toxic.\n\nYou'll receive in-game mutes for various things including saying things like \"This boss is aids\" and during these times, you will not be able to communicate anything, including pinging ability cooldown.\n\nOverall, the game is a 6.5 out of 10.\n\nThere are better games out there at a similar price point but this one has potential. \n\nFull disclosure, I was banned from their discord for being an asshole and I deserved it, but the guy I was fighting with was also being an asshole AND a bigot and wasn't banned.",

From the first dungeon you run with other people... It is mandatory for tanks to do massive mob-pulls, healers have to be ON-point with healing, and DPS has to deal enough damage before the tank is overwhelmed. For newbies, this is a harrowing experience.\n\nThe harder dungeons that give rating, just requires you to do all this speed-running with just a narrower margin for doing mistakes. \n\n...and if you don't measure up? everyone leaves the run, period.\nOh, and the (not so) brilliant idea of not having any penalty for abandoning a dungeon is a interesting choice.\n\nThis accumulates with the community becoming very toxic.\n\nAnother thing... is that the gear you \"wear\" doesn't change the way your character looks. Equipment are just numbers that give you an item level, any cosmetics are locked behind grinding and in-game stores, which nulls any feeling of visual progression, especially since you play fixed character, having everyone look the same in the hub.\n\n\nFellowship has to change... alot, for it to purify it's toxicity.",

This game's new player gameplay is atrocious, and is almost certainly the reason why the hub is filled with only experienced players. This game demands an extremely specific desire and playstyle. If you meet those, great! By all means, continue playing, but it's very clear, given the clown reacts on other negative reviews for this game, that these same people take any negative critique as a direct insult to them.\n\nI wanna make this as clear as possible: If you like this game, that's great, more power to you. I, however, absolutely do not.\n\nThe introduction is absolutely overwhelming, and honestly, rather dull. An interesting opening cutscene is followed by near complete silence for 15 minutes as you go through the tutorial, followed by near complete silence in the hub. I tried loading up a quickplay, and got dumped in a team of high level players blasting through the content, as the team's only healer, getting left behind because, for some reason, you're not granted a mount until you complete your first dungeon.\n\nSkill based matchmaking has its flaws, but the bare minimum it provides is a space for new players to learn the ropes, without absolutely shitting themselves about being kicked from the squad (especially given the rep healers get in these kinds of games). Opening your game without any form of squad finder or skill based matchmaking is a recipe for a game that stagnates, as you'll only attract a limited trickle of players.\n\nLooking at the player counts, the numbers don't lie. This game has an utterly awful new player experience, and very likely, a poor mid to end game loop, given there's only 3700 peak players at the time of writing this.

No forgiveness for new players.

V-sync seemed to help but there was noticeable tearing and stuttering as well no matter what settings were used (2080 super). As far as the gameplay goes it fails at the one thing it sets out to do: be a fun and engaging Mythic+ simulator. The dungeons are boring. The classes/characters are boring. The gameplay feels watered down and abilities lack impact and flow (something that WoW does extremely well for most classes and specs). I tried three different characters during my 9 hour stint in the game and none of them felt well executed nor fun. My advice would be to save yourself the money on this and just play retail WoW. It's not hard at all to get into and get geared nowadays and it's a 1000 times better game experience with infinitely more to do besides M+ dungeons if you should so choose to. Instead of being a legit threat to WoW's M+ this is more like Temu M+ that fails miserably at everything that makes M+ fun and rewarding.",

Then what happens? Someone joins, someone leaves, and the queue resets. Another 10–15 minutes. We finally start a match, the tank pulls three packs, dies, leaves instantly. Restart. Next run, we get a DPS who does less damage than the tank. Impossible to kill the boss → someone leaves → back to queue.\n\nThis loop repeats endlessly. For three days straight I literally could not finish one match.\n\nI paid for this game, but right now I spend 50%+ of my time sitting in queues. And unlike other games (WoW, Dota, etc.), there’s nothing to do while waiting — no fishing, no farming, no side activities. In WoW, if queues are long, at least your time doesn’t feel wasted. Here it feels like pure dead time.\n\nTo compare:\n\nIn Dota you wait 3–5 minutes and play a 40-minute match.\n\nHere you wait 15 minutes to play a 5-minute run… or worse, 15 minutes → play 5 seconds → someone leaves → 15 minutes again.\n\nIt’s honestly torture. I love the game and want to keep playing, but if matchmaking stays like this, I’m seriously considering refunding. Please fix this.

But I don't have a mount. I have to walk to catch up, as the healer mind you. Party wipes, because I am literally not there. (Still walking). Because the party died, the mobs now return to their starting places where I am unfortunately located. I die.\n\nI type in the chat \"guys this is literally my first dungeon can we take it slow.\" Literally no one responds. They rush in at Mach 5 again, and die once again. The ENTIRE party leaves without a word. \n\nI join the Fellowship discord trying to get some answers as to what the heck just happened. I'm told not to play quickplay, as end game players spam it to get resources and it's no longer new player friendly whatsoever. They admit it's a huge problem that the game pushes new players to quickplay still. They tell me to queue for contender, which is the separate progression based gamemode.\n\nSo I queue up for the 'Contender' league. I literally sit in queue for 12 minutes before giving up. \n\nI tell the discord people that I'm probably going to refund. Mind you, people in discord servers of games are usually the biggest fans of the game. And even they tell me the game is undercooked right now and not ready yet. \n\nI get this is early access but this is seriously the worst first impression of a game I've ever had. \n\nBut yeah, definitely going to refund. Maybe this will get better someday I dunno.",

      "review": "Let it be known, I love this game. Truly. And despite the review, I’ll still play it, as it’s a great relief of stress for me.\n\nI love games where I can relax, turn my brain off after a long day of work, and just unwind. That’s usually what I’d do as a tank, either Helena or Meiko. That was my fun. It’s why I enjoy games like Guild Wars 2, I don’t have to regrind everything just to stay relevant.\n\nIt’s the perfect “WoW dungeons only” experience. It brings that mythic atmosphere into it, while also being a charming, amazing, and well-optimized game in my opinion. However, I have to mention the one thing that really holds it back, full seasonal resets.\n\nMy biggest gripe is the fact that its Seasonal Progression isn’t just a small wipe, it’s a full wipe. Instead of your old gear being downscaled for a new season, you start completely from level 1 again. Many people compare it to PoE, but it’s better to reference WoW’s Mythic+ seasons, since that’s what this game is really trying to emulate, a dungeon grinder / Time-trial.\n\nYou’ll have to relearn all your skills, even ones that felt like baseline for your character. Hopefully the skills stay on the hotbar, having to rebind everything each season would get frustrating fast. But honestly, knowing there’s a full reset coming kills my motivation to grind if everything’s just going to be deleted.\n\nFor example, I was working on my “cool, chill tank girl” Helena build. She’s the mitigation tank, and I wanted two specific items: the Saltwash Elixir, a trinket that gives you a fair heal on a cooldown, and the Grimoire, which lets you bring back a player from the dead, basically letting me play a more relaxed, paladin-like style. But with a reset every season, it’s hard to justify putting in that time. What’s the point in chasing gear if it’s all going to be trashed and reset next season?\n\n“Ooh, there’s going to be new modifiers for the dungeons!” — sure, but that usually just means shifting a few around and adding a couple of new ones.\n“Ooh, there’s going to be two new characters!” — it’s a tank and a healer. (People were even upset both tanks were female, so maybe this next one’s a guy?)\n“You should strive to be better and no-life the game!” — some of us literally have jobs and just want to relax, run a few dungeons with friends, and have a ‘fellowship.’\n\nI work for my money like anyone else. The difference is, I want to keep what I earn, or at least have the option to opt out. Maybe opting in to seasonal resets could reward cosmetics or mounts. That way, both sides would be happy: let the competitive players race the new ladders, while the rest of us relax and enjoy the game the devs built up.\n\nI want to gear everyone, explore fun little non-meta builds, and just have fun. But it seems like the devs have the full reset idea set in stone. I’ll keep playing because I love what’s here, but I truly hope the devs reconsider. Fellowship could be something special for both competitive and casual players alike. Should the devs ever change their minds about it, I’ll gladly change this review to positive.",

This game about getting gear paired with seasonal resets can only work in a path of exile style where you can blast to end game within 5 to 10 hours if you want. Path of exile also has the ability to craft item upgrades that you need/want. this game has none of this and is purely RNG drop based. Losing all of your gear if a slap in the face to your time as there are no mechanics to use to get back gear faster. Even if more crafting systems were added it would take years to feel good enough to justify playing each league. With so much inspiration taken from WOW style MMO dungeons why not just instead focus on either more vertical progression or even horizontal. The game was already starting to feel stale after getting to the adept league just being the same dungeons with new enemy abilities. To me this just seems like a game being designed to be the only game you play however the amount of grind and content are just not there. I seriously doubt I will show up for any new leagues in this game but can see myself coming back when progression is saved to try new dungeons or even raids.\nFor a game that claims to be like the endgame of your faviorite games why reset back to the part of the game that people pay to skip in those games?",
