      "review": "Sincere props to everybody involved with producing this incredible strategy game. There's so many things Old World does right that sets it apart from the competition.\n\n[list]\n    [*]The #1 thing I want to highlight is the fantastic UI/UX. Strategy games can hide a lot of complexity only emphasizing the need for clear and obvious information. It's here where the game really shines. UI panels are intuitive to read and stuffed with helpful details. Game concepts are written as hyperlinks you can repeatedly SHIFT-CLICK to expose stacking detail panels. The encyclopedia is well written. Boundary lines are clear, unit move distance is apparent, everything just comes together nicely to make the learning experience smooth and engaging.\n    [*]This is the first strategy game I've played offering an undo button. Did you accidentally click the wrong hex when scouting or make a tactical blunder in combat? CTRL-Z to undo. Want to experiment with a few moves and see their impact? Feel free because you can undo an entire turn if things don't work out. I never realized how much I needed this.\n    [*]Old World introduced an orders system that governs how many moves you can execute per turn. This was the thing I was most excited to try out and I'm happy to say it leads to an intriguing puzzle to solve. You have 27 orders this turn...do you want to spend that scouting, engaging in warfare, building up your nation, dealing in politics, or do you instead bank them for extra gold? Some turns you won't have enough orders to do everything you want, others you struggle to even spend them all. Combine that with the undo action and it makes each turn feel truly dynamic.\n    [*]The leaders and politics are fascinating. You're constantly managing reputation and finding ways to effectively utilize these powerful figures from ancient history. Lines of succession get redrawn amidst death, marriage, and children getting born into the family. All your characters visually age over time making you feel connected to them, and some of the choices personal.\n    [*]Throughout the game you're presented with so many rich and satisfying decisions. There's numerous resources to juggle. Technology is randomized each game. Events frequently present themselves with a cause and effect scenario. Leaders level up giving you choices about how to shape your nation. Workers have an abundance of rural and urban improvements to build. Combine all of that with the orders system and it's just endless fun to tickle your brain. I end each round with anticipation, begin new ones with enthusiasm, and find it difficult to deny just one more turn.\n    [*]Combat is actually tactical beyond your standard rock-paper-scissor unit composition. Spearman target enemies in a line, axemen attack multiple units in an arc, cavalry can route (attack again after defeating an enemy), some units benefit from adjacency. Generals can be assigned to units to further enhance their capability while also leveling up.\n    [*]And the music...OMG they chose some real beauties here. You can't go wrong enlisting Christopher Tin. Songs you dislike you can disable from rotation. And in a clever touch the music doesn't actually kick in until you've researched drama, at which point this game soars above the clouds.\n[/list]",

Civ is the natural comparison and OW improves on it in virtually every way. Bought it on that other store at launch and then bought it again on Steam to support the devs.\n\nIt is *hard* - wildly complex, and the court and events system makes games deeply unpredictable.

      "review": "As a long time Civilization fanatic who mourns the downfall of my favorite franchise (starting at civ 6), I hereby unofficially nominate Old World as the official standard bearer of the civ like 4X genre. I also officially nominated them for the \"Labor of Love\" steam awards.\n\nPros: \n-Hands down the most well thought out gameplay mechanics of any recent 4X \n-Excellent storytelling ability via its situationally proccing events\n-Meaningful diplomacy that integrates into the event system\n-Strategic combat with good utilization of terrain \n-Outcomes in combat that have overlap with the events system\n-Surprisingly clever AI opponents\n\nCons:\n\n-A half hearted implementation of a CK3 style family tree minigame. It has good bones, but seems to never have really been fleshed out in a way that has a meaningful impact on your gameplay. I want to care about my family members more, but sometimes all the characters just blur together.\n\n-While Old World has many similarities to the Civilization franchise, it lacks a certain kind of charm that Civ has. I think its likely due to the narrow time period in which the game covers. While a game in civ can span from the ancient to the modern, OW really only covers a narrow slice of a specific historical time period. While in theory this focus has some upsides, it kind of translates into bland progression of the technology tree. Most new units are just slightly more powerful versions of their earlier counterparts, but otherwise thematically identical.\n\n-Poor end game experience despite good intentions. In an attempt to remedy the end game grind that other 4X games are plagued by, the OW implemented an \"ambitions\" mechanic which essentially finishes the game after meeting a set number of smaller incremental goals (similar to a light version of victory conditions in Civ). While I enjoy this mechanic throughout the game as a fun incentive for accomplishing specific actions, I find it to be both an unsatisfying and anticlimactic way to finish a game. Instead of rethinking the end-game grind, OW devs seemed to have tried to sidestep the end-game all together. But if you're like me in that you enjoy long drawn out domination victories, OW suffers from the usual late-game fatigue involving tedious levels of micromanagement. Do you enjoy dragging 50 units across a large map one-by-one? Me neither. And while technically you can automate workers and cities, the bad AI for this renders it practically un-useable (in stark contrast to the excellent combat and diplomacy AI). Conversely, I feel like there could be some innovative event based solutions to these issues, but surfacing them would require a handful of outside-of-the-box brainstorming sessions (with possible chemical enhancement required for increased lateral thinking).\n\nOverall:\n\nDespite some glaring flaws, Old World does so much right that others in the 4X genre could really learn from. As evidenced by my playtime, it is objectively one of my favorite games. If you enjoy the 4X genre, it might just become one of your favorites too.",

The developers of this game are so far and hopefully for the future the most caring team for a game iv played yet, they roll out updates, fixes and feed back like no one else in the industry. Im positively floored all the time when i open steam, always something in my news feed for this game, iv come to expect nothing less of Mohwak games. As of this review i am nominating Old world for the labor of love award because of much care they still put into this game after 3 and half year. \n\nim not the best at describing games but for me, old world is a mix of games, its like if civ 6 and total war rome 2 had direct control of its people in power, shaping its inner dynesties and  ruler's  with random events and encounters to shape those people, more in depth diplomacy with nations and other characters of intrigue.\none day i hope to see more games use this style of 4x and story building.",

It has events involving your player character and their court/family, with light role play elements. Pacing is good and more realistic than Civ where training a scout may take 1000 in-game years (one turn = one year in Old World). The graphics are good, nothing to get too excited about but good enough that I don't mind looking at the map and features are discernible and distinct. The interface is decent but a little crowded, it's helpful to play the tutorial just to know where things are located.

This game is more fun than Civ to me nowadays, because the random events (based on actual historical events) and the character system create much more variety from game to game. They also create frustration^^, because there are negative events, characters can be insubordinate, etc. but on the other hand that's funny (mind the mischievous pet monkey!) and makes the game more challenging 'cause it doesn't always go to plan (like in Civ, where it's the same all over again every game after some time).\n\nThe order system needs getting used to at first (but you can revert your actions when playing single player, which is quite cool), but I find it prevents you from snowballing too hard (like in Civ), where the game is just over in mid-game and I never finish my games 'cause it gets boring. Also cool in Old World is the setting that makes the AI hate you more and more the closer you get to winning, which simulates a multiplayer FFA lobby quite well imho and keeps the game interesting until the end, when the AI will mass war you to stop you from winning (because of course eventually you would snowball here, too).\n\nDisclaimer: I only play random maps either against the AI or with friends, but there are also scenarios (which are supposed to be quite good). The vanilla multiplayer balancing is very good (actually A LOT better than Civ) and the devs are really giving a lot of attention to the multiplayer mode.

There are family members and heirs to worry about and important figures of authority to please. On the strategy and management side, you can research technologies only from a drawn lot and build settlements only on a limited number of random locations, so the gameplay is less predictable and more challenging. Almost everything you do uses up orders or command points, which comes with a cap depending on how well your game is progressing. This adds some realism to the game as if you were actually a ruler in charge of a complex nation, not just an abstract administrative entity.\n\nI think these are good features to add to the more typical Civ experience, even if they are not radically new.",

I frequently find myself making nuanced high impact decisions each turn due to the orders system. Max difficulty is a genuine challenge. Unlike Civ, archers aren't the ultimate unit because they do lower damage per order spent than melee units, which encourages using a diversified army composition.\n\nSome things I think can be done better (around 1 year old advice, so it may have already been fixed):\n1. Buying unit upgrades with money is abuse-able since it is far cheaper overall to build the cheaper unit and upgrade it rather than building the upgraded unit directly. For example, building 10-20 of the cheapest horse units, getting the tech for their upgrade, and upgrading all of them at once and storming the enemy is extremely powerful and may want to be nerfed.",

I decided to try Old World as an alternative and have been absolutely thrilled at the experience. Civ tends to play through in a very similar fashion every game, with a lot of repetitive actions. Old World has a lot of these same actions, but it offers something much more. Every turn is deeply engrossed in story driven decisions that change with every playthrough. You are not just some King/Queen, you have heirs, ambassadors, ruling class families, advisors, generals, and many others. They are not just there in name, but you take part in their development and decision making. This makes every character in the game feel much more alive. Maybe you marry off your son to another empires daughter in order to broker peace. You can abdicate the throne or chose to be a general in one of your armies. All of this makes each play through a completely new experience, and this is something Civ has never been able to do. If you like Civ or have friends that do and you are looking for a better alternative to the new expensive and problem ridden Civ 7, then tell them this game is worth every dollar. I got it while it was 75% off but would have happily paid full price. You can rename most names in the game and even be the first to explore and name landmarks. The game can be funny or dark or serious depending on how you make decisions.

      "review": "TLDR: I became aware of the game some months ago and it soon developed into one of my favourite games. Thus, I can really recommend it. The complexity, level of strategy depth and historical flavour of this strategy game are really outstanding.\n\nThe Good:\n\n- The game has a level of complexity and interconnectedness of game mechanics that are rarely found in gaming. This is one of the few examples of games that still try to simulate a world instead of streamlining the mechanics to the point that it could also be a board game. (Don't get me wrong: I really like board games. But if you can use the processing power of a computer to simulate a world, you should do that.)\n\n- The AI in this game is really good, one of the best I have ever played against. (I do not consider myself a hardcore gamer and winning an epic victory in scenario 3 of the Carthage Campaign really makes me proud.)\n\n- This game ouzes historical flavour. This already shows in normal games, but the campaigns are really great! Not only have I had lots of fun, I also learned a lot.\n\n- The soundtrack is great. (You have to research \"Drama\" ingame for the music to start, which is a nice detail)\n\n- The long term support for the game is great. Many larger companies should take note how regularly and transparently this small indie company supports their game.\n\n- The base game is really good as a standalone and the DLCs really are optional. I own each DLC and I love all of them, but I cannot stress this enough: This game is not the typical jigsaw puzzle which is unplayable without buying each DLC, but a really good game all on its own. You can have lots of fun just with the base game and later add in all the DLC you like to get more content (like new campaigns) or deepen certain game mechanics.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- The good AI comes with a price and the price is payed in computational ressources. Even on newer computers turns in the late game can take some time due to all the background computations that need to be made in order to get such a competent AI.\n\nThe Up to Taste:\n\n- Due to the complexity of the game, it comes with a considerable learning curve. You should consider the first 50 to 100 hours of play as your tutorial and should not get discouraged if you get your behind handed to you by the AI, especially in warfare. After this learning phase, the fun really starts. It is worth it.\n\n- The game is made by a very small studio and they achieved this great game by really focussing on a specific timeframe (classical antiquity) and geographic region (middle east and mediterranean sea). I for mine love it.\n\nAll in all, a solid 9.5 out of 10 and one of my favourite games.",

      "review": "If only all 4X games were designed as well as this one. I strongly recommend it if you enjoy this genre of game. \r\n\r\nOld World takes the familiar 4X formula and tweaks it in all the best ways. The game looks beautiful, the music and sound effects are great, the UI is extremely user friendly, the game ran flawlessly for me, and it quite possibly has the most clever AI I have seen in any 4X game. After playing civ games all these years, I was shocked to see AI using actual tactics to counter strikes into its territory. \r\n\r\nI originally gave Old World a hard pass when it was released for three reasons. Firstly, I was waiting for Civ 7 but, like many others, I decided not to support their new business model of fleecing their fans which got me taking another look at Old World. Secondly, I read reviews indicating that Old World had a 200 turn-limit which was a deal breaker for me. However, I have since learned that you can set your own victory conditions with or without turn limits. And thirdly, I enjoy playing 4X games that span the breath of human history so I was unsure whether I would enjoy being restrained to the Classical era. However, Old World is a good example of how compromising breath for depth can allow for greater immersion which I enjoyed more than I thought I would. \r\n\r\nKeep in mind however that Old World is coming from a relatively small development team which is reflected in a game that does not quite match the grandeur of some of the big players like Amplitude, Firaxis, or Paradox. Nonetheless, what Old World might lack in quantity, it more than makes up for in quality with some of the best UI, AI, and game mechanics I have seen for 4X games. \r\n\r\nI am so glad I gave this game a chance and I dont think you will regret it either.",

First problem right off the bad is information overload. There is too much going on and no helpful help system to explain anything. At least with CIV, everything made sense. If you want to produce something, you know what affected producing things. With this game, it's more of magic behind the scenes affects producing.\nThen I tried out battling. I found out really quick that this game's biggest weakness was battling. First, AI units are inherently stronger even if you have more advanced units. They will send in 3 units and make mince meat of anything you have. If you try to attack them, expect to waste actions cause it will take 5-7 of of your units to hopefully kill one of their units. On top of that, the AI produces units faster than roaches multiply. With the AI set up to be somewhat weaker than you are, you will find that by the time you can produce enough settlers to create 3 cites, they will be on their 4th with an army of units already. \nThen there is the annoyance that you can't really do anything cause of orders. You set workers and your one scout to automate and find they just sit there doing nothing all game. Meanwhile the AI system is chugging away and somehow has double your order count. Seems the can reproduce orders as fast as they can units. \nJust this minute, I had an enemy archer completely surrounded by 6 units. It took all 6 to defeat a single archer. Something is messed up when it takes that much work for a single weak unit when they could have easily taken out my strongest unit with just 3 units. I ended up keeping that from happening by opening the editor and blocking their territory with mountains so I didn't have the AI swarming me with super humans anymore.\n\nOverall, it was a good concept of a game but falls way short of being good. Unless you open up the game editor and periodically erase AI units to even the playing field. \n\nI see other people mention things that are a problem and the common reply is that you can just turn off this or that feature.

      "review": "[h1]Multiplayer Wargame With 4X Foundation[/h1]\n\n[h2]Fatigue, Information Overload and Ugliness Earn Old World A 2 Out of 5[/h2]\n\n[b]THE GOOD: Cities and specialists; Pings; Undo; Orders; Vassal Families[/b]\n\n[b]THE BAD: Diplomacy; Religion; Espionage; Influence Actions[/b]\n\n[b]THE UGLY: Neverending text; Everything looks the same; Data displays are crude and ugly; A very rough UI[/b]\n\nOld World is for lawyers and gamblers, not for engineers or accountants. It has some interesting concepts which enhance gameplay by exploiting the natural tension between freedom and constraints. I hope others duplicate the conceptual innovations in Old World and improve upon them in other 4X titles.\n\nOld World's user interface is text- and number-dense. Playing beyond about four hours leads to a sense of fatigue and information overload. Things one might like to plan ahead of time, e.g. technological research or military unit promotions, are wrapped in random processes that appeal to devil-may-care gamblers but drive deliberate strategists mad. Frustration sets in when one tries to learn one's lessons from previous losses, only to be stymied because one can't make long-term plans for structural reasons intrinsic to the game. These structural aspects aggravate the information overload precisely because they make long-term strategic planning so exasperating.\n\nOld World's intended audience is players seeking a Multiplayer Wargaming experience with a 4X foundation. Many (most?) experienced Old World players value the developers' attention to aspects of Multiplayer gameplay that were absent from or very poorly implemented in other 4X titles. I exclusively play Single Player, and though I enjoy stomping my annoying neighbors' guts out as much as anyone, that's not the only way I play 4X games. The victory conditions are boring, especially the Ambitions Victory, which, for structural reasons described previously, is challenging for all the wrong reasons.\n\nMany positive reviewers on Steam reveal themselves to be unserious, as they are enthusiasts, fanbois and gatekeepers who abandon their critical faculties in defense of a game they believe is under-appreciated and not well publicized. Both of these things may be true of Old World but reviews don't settle scores. \"Historical\" justifications of Old World come either from fools or charlatans. The game's many grossly ahistorical elements are documented and criticized in detail elsewhere. Old World is \"history based,\" at best. It is [i]not[/i] \"historical.\" There's nothing wrong with that! But don't try to church up Old World with assertions of historicity.\n\n[b]THE GOOD:[/b]\n[b]1. City limits, workable tiles and specialists.[/b] There's usually a way to get what you want where you want it, though not necessarily when you need it. Borders can grow stupidly, which should be fixed, e.g., don't give that unincorporated wheat to my Champions city when my Landowners city is within equal range.\n\n[b]2. The Ping system[/b] is great for planning improvements. Reminder pings need improvement. Setting a reminder ping to, say, promote a military unit on turn X will cause the ping message to post in the long list of messages delivered at the start of turn X, but the map pin is immediately removed! Leave time-sensitive pings on the map until they're acknowledged or removed manually.\n\n[b]3. Undo is wonderful![/b] Make the Actions Stack viewable so that the player can easily select the last event they want to \"keep\" when they undo Actions.\n\n[b]4. The Orders concept[/b] is an interesting constraint on player actions. Are the computer players also so constrained? The need for the player to decide which actions to take this turn (vs. later or maybe never) limits one's horizons, but it presents a challenge that's interesting to deal with.\n\n[b]5. The Vassal Families system[/b] presents interesting challenges. Why aren't all 10 vassal families available to every civilization? Keep the limit of only three Families per empire. There's no good reason to arbitrarily make it impossible for a particular civilization to incorporate any of the different Vassal Families, so long as there are never more than three Families present in the empire.\n\n[b]THE BAD:[/b]\n[b]1. The Diplomacy system stinks.[/b] It's too limited and it's lame that an Ambassador is required in order to take any diplomatic action. It's reasonable to require an Ambassador to conduct diplomacy with other Civilizations. It's unreasonable to require an Ambassador to conduct diplomacy with Tribes. The few Ambassador Actions available suggest that the Diplomacy system was just bolted onto the game rather than developed right from the beginning. My Orders are better spent elsewhere.\n\n[b]2. The Religion system stinks.[/b] Like Diplomacy, Religion seems like an afterthought. Civilizations without Clerics Families or that don't start the game with the Divination technology or with the Husbandry technology will almost never found a World Religion except by sheer accident due to a random Event. Pagan Religions are second-class to World Religions, making them a short-term sink of one's precious Orders, so why bother?\n\n[b]3. The Espionage system is weak.[/b] It's reasonable to require a Spymaster to conduct Espionage Missions against other Civilizations. It's unreasonable to require a Spymaster to, e.g., \"deal with\" my rotten jealous scheming twin brother who lives forever and is an irredeemable nuisance and DEFCON 1 threat to my Rule and my household. It's completely arbitrary that all the nasty things one might need to do without being noticed within one's own civilization are off limits until one reaches the developmental stage at which it is also possible to foment unrest in foreign lands or steal technologies from adversaries. And Spymasters can't stir up the Tribes.\n\n[b]4. Influence Actions are too limited.[/b] One Character can only attempt to Influence (\"A chats up B\") another Character exactly one time, ever, throughout the entire lives of both Characters (A and B). One Character can only be Interceded For (\"C chats up B on A's behalf\") one time, ever, throughout the entire lives of both principal Characters (A and B). And during Leadership transitions, womp womp Legitimacy tanks! Good luck getting all your VIPs happily in line. You get one shot and one shot only per Influence target. What am I, made of Orders? Better to spend them on sure things.\n\n[b]THE UGLY:[/b]\n[b]1. \"Yo I heard you like reading.\"[/b] Everything that's not the map terrain itself is text. Tiny icons and tiny text litter the map, every notification is text... you'll do so much reading and clicking through menus in Old World that you'll suffer eye strain. Tooltips and text labels need different typefaces to separate and highlight different bits of information. The net effect is information overload. Animations and voice acting for Events would do wonders to liven things up.\n\n[b]2. All the improvements look the same.[/b] Each improvement type looks identical across all Civilizations, lacking any national or regional character. Is it all made out of ticky-tacky?\n\n[b]3. Tables, charts and graphs are more crude and ugly than useful.[/b] For example, the Family Opinion chart. One sees three traces plotted vs. time. Three numbers, that's it! Information, especially numerical data, is presented in a very limited and visually unappealing way that screams \"SuSE Linux, circa 2003.\"\n\n[b]4. The UI is fiddly and sticky.[/b] Tooltips with tooltips on their tooltips make for a very fiddly experience. There's a lot of clicking this and clicking that and having to drag the map this way and that, which worsens player fatigue caused by turn after turn of textalanche. Units cycle in a fixed order, bouncing from one end of the map to the other. One can automate Scouts and Workers, but military units need their hands held every step they take.",

      "review": "[h1]A Beautiful Disappointment: Ambition Without Execution[/h1]\r\nI'm a history buff and a fan of 4X games, so Old World should have been perfect for me. The concept is compelling - a 4X game set in antiquity with dynastic mechanics and character-driven narratives. The art direction is beautiful, and I think the developers had good intentions. Unfortunately, that doesn't make up for the game's problems.\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[b]The Identity Crisis[/b]\r\nOld World feels like it's trying to be three different games at once: Civilization's empire-building, Europa Universalis' depth, and Hearts of Iron's strategic complexity. It doesn't succeed at being any of them. It's stuck in an awkward middle ground where it's too shallow for grand strategy enthusiasts but too convoluted for casual 4X players.\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[b]Forced Ideology and Limited Agency[/b]\r\nOne of my biggest frustrations is how the game pushes contemporary cultural expectations and ideals into your face during gameplay. Mods can fix this (thankfully), but it shouldn't require community intervention to make a historical game feel less like social commentary. I play these games to engage with history on its own terms, not to have modern sensibilities imposed on ancient civilizations.\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[b]Shallow Systems[/b]\r\nThe problem-solving paths are severely gated and limited compared to what Europa Universalis offers. When challenges arise, you're forced down narrow story-driven solutions rather than having real strategic options. The economics feel underbaked, and production times are painfully long without the depth to justify it. Everything takes forever, but nothing feels particularly rewarding when completed.\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[b]Better Options Exist[/b]\r\nI wanted this to work, but there are simply better games out there. If you want accessible 4X gameplay, Civilization V (or earlier) does it better. For grand strategy depth, Europa Universalis IV is superior. For character-driven narratives, Crusader Kings III excels. Even older games like Endless Legend or Endless Space offer more satisfying experiences.\r\nOld World falls short in nearly every category it attempts. I can't recommend it when superior alternatives exist at similar or lower price points.\r\n[b]Not Recommended[/b] ❌",

      "review": "First impression was very positive.  The core mechanics are familiar, with some things more fleshed out compared to Civ and other things simplified.  Within a few hours the cracks were showing though.  \n\nOne of the areas the game focuses on is characters - individual people who get older with each turn and have roles in your court or line of succession and so on.  IMO this aspect is far too fiddly for very little benefit.  They broke it into a bunch of little pieces that are not fun to micromanage.  You get spammed constantly with notifications that certain people are getting ill, enough that it started to feel comical, which contributed to the feeling of the whole people aspect quickly turning into a list of random names that mean nothing.  There's a bunch of them there on the right side of the screen, and they all have opinions and those opinions are influenced by a lot of things and their opinions in turn influence a lot of other things.  I don't know who they are or why but they sure do get sick and die a lot and randomly acquire traits that do something to their stats.  I think they got a little carried away with developing the people part of the game but tbf I'm more of a Civ person than a Crusader Kings person so maybe you like that stuff.  It just felt to me like I'm trying to put some Legos together and when I pick up a Lego it turns out to be a pile of ants instead of a Lego piece - too much granularity with too much randomness and chaos, and it just didn't need to be that way because the work to benefit ratio of staying on top of these people seems poor.  Just seems very fiddly and random for no good reason.\n\nAlso a religion formed spontaneously in one of my cities, I don't know where it came from or how to deal with it but it made a bunch of people unhappy with me for not being that new thing.  The music is great but the vocals are a bit much, I wish I could get an instrumental track because the singers, while talented, need to chill for being a background soundtrack for a game.

In almost every. single. way.\r\nThe family dynamics twist seemed kind of intriguing to me, though. \r\nIt was something new, and I was liking what I was seeing.\r\nThe interface was good, the mechanics all seemed to be there.\r\nThe different families for each nation, and the members of each family and their feelings about each other and their traits and how that all affects the nation was new to me and right up my alley.\r\nI was making choices and doing researches and building tile improvements and really getting a feel for the game.\r\nI had met another nation and some city states and was making peace and diplomacy.\r\nMy step-son was mad initially he wasn't the heir, but I gave him a job and made him an advisor and felt we were getting along and I even forgave him when he go caught being a traitor.\r\nMy heir, my daughter married a prince from a City-state and I had a granddaughter and I was like, this is awesome. I am totally digging this family dynamic mixed into the good old Civ gameplay.\r\nSuddenly, in under 30 total turns, I became ill, then gravely ill, then doomed, and then died within 4 turns.\r\nAll my plans, diplomacy, relations went to hell, but I'm like, ok it's cool people get old and die, that's this game's mechanic to keep you challenged. My daughter will step in and take over control of the empire and I'll hopefully have another 30 turns or longer trying to make some progress before she dies too.\r\nWithin 4 turns, I'm not even kidding, ill, gravely ill, doomed.\r\nI rage quit right there, and it will likely be a long time, if ever, I come back to this game.\r\nWhy did they get sick? NO REASON GIVEN. I had so many farms and so much food, I was killing it.\r\nI would understand if there was like a famine or some game mechanic that would have instigated the illness.\r\nWhy couldn't I do anything to try and improve their health to keep them alive? BECAUSE.\r\nNo medicine, no obligatory rest, no options at all to try and rectify the illness. Just dead.\r\nMy mom died of cancer pretty suddenly a few years back, I don't need my games to mimic that trauma and make me feel helpless and powerless, life does that well enough, thank you.\r\nGames are supposed to be an escape from reality. An opportunity to use your intellect and your choice to affect a favorable outcome in a controlled environment. Hell, I even played Darkest Dungeon and enjoyed it.\r\nI gotta leave a negative review, and I hate to do that, but I play a lot of different games and it's rare that I get as frustrated as that. Maybe this is not normal for this game and I just had a really bad RNG luck, but it was my very first play-through, so go figure how that's even likely. Maybe you can load it and the RNG won't hit again and you won't get sick, but I'm not loading and saving and going through all that wasted time just to get around this game wrecking mechanic.\r\nI'm not down for uncontrolled, unexplained, run ruining chaos in my 4x game. Sorry, not sorry.\r\nGlad I got the game on sale, I'd be pissed if I payed full price for this carbon copy.\r\nAlright, well cool, there are plenty of other awesome games to play.

      "review": "I love CIV pre CIV 5 (CIV 5 was bad and CIV 6 was junk). I hated Crusader Kings. So coming in I looked at the game as a mixed bag. \nThen I started playing it. First problem right off the bad is information overload. There is too much going on and no helpful help system to explain anything. At least with CIV, everything made sense. If you want to produce something, you know what affected producing things. With this game, it's more of magic behind the scenes affects producing.\nThen I tried out battling. I found out really quick that this game's biggest weakness was battling. First, AI units are inherently stronger even if you have more advanced units. They will send in 3 units and make mince meat of anything you have. If you try to attack them, expect to waste actions cause it will take 5-7 of of your units to hopefully kill one of their units. On top of that, the AI produces units faster than roaches multiply. With the AI set up to be somewhat weaker than you are, you will find that by the time you can produce enough settlers to create 3 cites, they will be on their 4th with an army of units already. \nThen there is the annoyance that you can't really do anything cause of orders. You set workers and your one scout to automate and find they just sit there doing nothing all game. Meanwhile the AI system is chugging away and somehow has double your order count. Seems the can reproduce orders as fast as they can units. \nJust this minute, I had an enemy archer completely surrounded by 6 units. It took all 6 to defeat a single archer. Something is messed up when it takes that much work for a single weak unit when they could have easily taken out my strongest unit with just 3 units. I ended up keeping that from happening by opening the editor and blocking their territory with mountains so I didn't have the AI swarming me with super humans anymore.\n\nOverall, it was a good concept of a game but falls way short of being good. Unless you open up the game editor and periodically erase AI units to even the playing field. \n\nI see other people mention things that are a problem and the common reply is that you can just turn off this or that feature.

There is nothing to fight against in this game other than the event system, and this becomes both extremely irritating and extremely boring at the same time. Many of the event systems in this game have choice structures that go like this: Choice 1) Do this quest, build these ten farms, whatever (this is irritating) OR Choice 2: Lots of enemy raiders spawn in your terrority (this is extremely irriitation). \r\n\r\nIf you enjoy games where you get to choose between one thing that is irritating and another thing that is also irritating, this is exactly the game for you. If your idea of a good time on a Friday night is to be asked the question \"would you like 50 gold, 100 lumber, or 200 civics?\" this is exactly the game for you.",

      "review": "[h1]Multiplayer Wargame With 4X Foundation[/h1]\n\n[h2]Fatigue, Information Overload and Ugliness Earn Old World A 2 Out of 5[/h2]\n\n[b]THE GOOD: Cities and specialists; Pings; Undo; Orders; Vassal Families[/b]\n\n[b]THE BAD: Diplomacy; Religion; Espionage; Influence Actions[/b]\n\n[b]THE UGLY: Neverending text; Everything looks the same; Data displays are crude and ugly; A very rough UI[/b]\n\nOld World is for lawyers and gamblers, not for engineers or accountants. It has some interesting concepts which enhance gameplay by exploiting the natural tension between freedom and constraints. I hope others duplicate the conceptual innovations in Old World and improve upon them in other 4X titles.\n\nOld World's user interface is text- and number-dense. Playing beyond about four hours leads to a sense of fatigue and information overload. Things one might like to plan ahead of time, e.g. technological research or military unit promotions, are wrapped in random processes that appeal to devil-may-care gamblers but drive deliberate strategists mad. Frustration sets in when one tries to learn one's lessons from previous losses, only to be stymied because one can't make long-term plans for structural reasons intrinsic to the game. These structural aspects aggravate the information overload precisely because they make long-term strategic planning so exasperating.\n\nOld World's intended audience is players seeking a Multiplayer Wargaming experience with a 4X foundation. Many (most?) experienced Old World players value the developers' attention to aspects of Multiplayer gameplay that were absent from or very poorly implemented in other 4X titles. I exclusively play Single Player, and though I enjoy stomping my annoying neighbors' guts out as much as anyone, that's not the only way I play 4X games. The victory conditions are boring, especially the Ambitions Victory, which, for structural reasons described previously, is challenging for all the wrong reasons.\n\nMany positive reviewers on Steam reveal themselves to be unserious, as they are enthusiasts, fanbois and gatekeepers who abandon their critical faculties in defense of a game they believe is under-appreciated and not well publicized. Both of these things may be true of Old World but reviews don't settle scores. \"Historical\" justifications of Old World come either from fools or charlatans. The game's many grossly ahistorical elements are documented and criticized in detail elsewhere. Old World is \"history based,\" at best. It is [i]not[/i] \"historical.\" There's nothing wrong with that! But don't try to church up Old World with assertions of historicity.\n\n[b]THE GOOD:[/b]\n[b]1. City limits, workable tiles and specialists.[/b] There's usually a way to get what you want where you want it, though not necessarily when you need it. Borders can grow stupidly, which should be fixed, e.g., don't give that unincorporated wheat to my Champions city when my Landowners city is within equal range.\n\n[b]2. The Ping system[/b] is great for planning improvements. Reminder pings need improvement. Setting a reminder ping to, say, promote a military unit on turn X will cause the ping message to post in the long list of messages delivered at the start of turn X, but the map pin is immediately removed! Leave time-sensitive pings on the map until they're acknowledged or removed manually.\n\n[b]3. Undo is wonderful![/b] Make the Actions Stack viewable so that the player can easily select the last event they want to \"keep\" when they undo Actions.\n\n[b]4. The Orders concept[/b] is an interesting constraint on player actions. Are the computer players also so constrained? The need for the player to decide which actions to take this turn (vs. later or maybe never) limits one's horizons, but it presents a challenge that's interesting to deal with.\n\n[b]5. The Vassal Families system[/b] presents interesting challenges. Why aren't all 10 vassal families available to every civilization? Keep the limit of only three Families per empire. There's no good reason to arbitrarily make it impossible for a particular civilization to incorporate any of the different Vassal Families, so long as there are never more than three Families present in the empire.\n\n[b]THE BAD:[/b]\n[b]1. The Diplomacy system stinks.[/b] It's too limited and it's lame that an Ambassador is required in order to take any diplomatic action. It's reasonable to require an Ambassador to conduct diplomacy with other Civilizations. It's unreasonable to require an Ambassador to conduct diplomacy with Tribes. The few Ambassador Actions available suggest that the Diplomacy system was just bolted onto the game rather than developed right from the beginning. My Orders are better spent elsewhere.\n\n[b]2. The Religion system stinks.[/b] Like Diplomacy, Religion seems like an afterthought. Civilizations without Clerics Families or that don't start the game with the Divination technology or with the Husbandry technology will almost never found a World Religion except by sheer accident due to a random Event. Pagan Religions are second-class to World Religions, making them a short-term sink of one's precious Orders, so why bother?\n\n[b]3. The Espionage system is weak.[/b] It's reasonable to require a Spymaster to conduct Espionage Missions against other Civilizations. It's unreasonable to require a Spymaster to, e.g., \"deal with\" my rotten jealous scheming twin brother who lives forever and is an irredeemable nuisance and DEFCON 1 threat to my Rule and my household. It's completely arbitrary that all the nasty things one might need to do without being noticed within one's own civilization are off limits until one reaches the developmental stage at which it is also possible to foment unrest in foreign lands or steal technologies from adversaries. And Spymasters can't stir up the Tribes.\n\n[b]4. Influence Actions are too limited.[/b] One Character can only attempt to Influence (\"A chats up B\") another Character exactly one time, ever, throughout the entire lives of both Characters (A and B). One Character can only be Interceded For (\"C chats up B on A's behalf\") one time, ever, throughout the entire lives of both principal Characters (A and B). And during Leadership transitions, womp womp Legitimacy tanks! Good luck getting all your VIPs happily in line. You get one shot and one shot only per Influence target. What am I, made of Orders? Better to spend them on sure things.\n\n[b]THE UGLY:[/b]\n[b]1. \"Yo I heard you like reading.\"[/b] Everything that's not the map terrain itself is text. Tiny icons and tiny text litter the map, every notification is text... you'll do so much reading and clicking through menus in Old World that you'll suffer eye strain. Tooltips and text labels need different typefaces to separate and highlight different bits of information. The net effect is information overload. Animations and voice acting for Events would do wonders to liven things up.\n\n[b]2. All the improvements look the same.[/b] Each improvement type looks identical across all Civilizations, lacking any national or regional character. Is it all made out of ticky-tacky?\n\n[b]3. Tables, charts and graphs are more crude and ugly than useful.[/b] For example, the Family Opinion chart. One sees three traces plotted vs. time. Three numbers, that's it! Information, especially numerical data, is presented in a very limited and visually unappealing way that screams \"SuSE Linux, circa 2003.\"\n\n[b]4. The UI is fiddly and sticky.[/b] Tooltips with tooltips on their tooltips make for a very fiddly experience. There's a lot of clicking this and clicking that and having to drag the map this way and that, which worsens player fatigue caused by turn after turn of textalanche. Units cycle in a fixed order, bouncing from one end of the map to the other. One can automate Scouts and Workers, but military units need their hands held every step they take.",

      "review": "[h1]A Beautiful Disappointment: Ambition Without Execution[/h1]\r\nI'm a history buff and a fan of 4X games, so Old World should have been perfect for me. The concept is compelling - a 4X game set in antiquity with dynastic mechanics and character-driven narratives. The art direction is beautiful, and I think the developers had good intentions. Unfortunately, that doesn't make up for the game's problems.\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[b]The Identity Crisis[/b]\r\nOld World feels like it's trying to be three different games at once: Civilization's empire-building, Europa Universalis' depth, and Hearts of Iron's strategic complexity. It doesn't succeed at being any of them. It's stuck in an awkward middle ground where it's too shallow for grand strategy enthusiasts but too convoluted for casual 4X players.\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[b]Forced Ideology and Limited Agency[/b]\r\nOne of my biggest frustrations is how the game pushes contemporary cultural expectations and ideals into your face during gameplay. Mods can fix this (thankfully), but it shouldn't require community intervention to make a historical game feel less like social commentary. I play these games to engage with history on its own terms, not to have modern sensibilities imposed on ancient civilizations.\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[b]Shallow Systems[/b]\r\nThe problem-solving paths are severely gated and limited compared to what Europa Universalis offers. When challenges arise, you're forced down narrow story-driven solutions rather than having real strategic options. The economics feel underbaked, and production times are painfully long without the depth to justify it. Everything takes forever, but nothing feels particularly rewarding when completed.\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[b]Better Options Exist[/b]\r\nI wanted this to work, but there are simply better games out there. If you want accessible 4X gameplay, Civilization V (or earlier) does it better. For grand strategy depth, Europa Universalis IV is superior. For character-driven narratives, Crusader Kings III excels. Even older games like Endless Legend or Endless Space offer more satisfying experiences.\r\nOld World falls short in nearly every category it attempts. I can't recommend it when superior alternatives exist at similar or lower price points.\r\n[b]Not Recommended[/b] ❌",

Within a few hours the cracks were showing though.  \n\nOne of the areas the game focuses on is characters - individual people who get older with each turn and have roles in your court or line of succession and so on.  IMO this aspect is far too fiddly for very little benefit.  They broke it into a bunch of little pieces that are not fun to micromanage.  You get spammed constantly with notifications that certain people are getting ill, enough that it started to feel comical, which contributed to the feeling of the whole people aspect quickly turning into a list of random names that mean nothing.  There's a bunch of them there on the right side of the screen, and they all have opinions and those opinions are influenced by a lot of things and their opinions in turn influence a lot of other things.  I don't know who they are or why but they sure do get sick and die a lot and randomly acquire traits that do something to their stats.  I think they got a little carried away with developing the people part of the game but tbf I'm more of a Civ person than a Crusader Kings person so maybe you like that stuff.  It just felt to me like I'm trying to put some Legos together and when I pick up a Lego it turns out to be a pile of ants instead of a Lego piece - too much granularity with too much randomness and chaos, and it just didn't need to be that way because the work to benefit ratio of staying on top of these people seems poor.  Just seems very fiddly and random for no good reason.\n\nAlso a religion formed spontaneously in one of my cities, I don't know where it came from or how to deal with it but it made a bunch of people unhappy with me for not being that new thing.  The music is great but the vocals are a bit much, I wish I could get an instrumental track because the singers, while talented, need to chill for being a background soundtrack for a game.

In almost every. single. way.\r\nThe family dynamics twist seemed kind of intriguing to me, though. \r\nIt was something new, and I was liking what I was seeing.\r\nThe interface was good, the mechanics all seemed to be there.\r\nThe different families for each nation, and the members of each family and their feelings about each other and their traits and how that all affects the nation was new to me and right up my alley.\r\nI was making choices and doing researches and building tile improvements and really getting a feel for the game.\r\nI had met another nation and some city states and was making peace and diplomacy.\r\nMy step-son was mad initially he wasn't the heir, but I gave him a job and made him an advisor and felt we were getting along and I even forgave him when he go caught being a traitor.\r\nMy heir, my daughter married a prince from a City-state and I had a granddaughter and I was like, this is awesome. I am totally digging this family dynamic mixed into the good old Civ gameplay.\r\nSuddenly, in under 30 total turns, I became ill, then gravely ill, then doomed, and then died within 4 turns.\r\nAll my plans, diplomacy, relations went to hell, but I'm like, ok it's cool people get old and die, that's this game's mechanic to keep you challenged. My daughter will step in and take over control of the empire and I'll hopefully have another 30 turns or longer trying to make some progress before she dies too.\r\nWithin 4 turns, I'm not even kidding, ill, gravely ill, doomed.\r\nI rage quit right there, and it will likely be a long time, if ever, I come back to this game.\r\nWhy did they get sick? NO REASON GIVEN. I had so many farms and so much food, I was killing it.\r\nI would understand if there was like a famine or some game mechanic that would have instigated the illness.\r\nWhy couldn't I do anything to try and improve their health to keep them alive? BECAUSE.\r\nNo medicine, no obligatory rest, no options at all to try and rectify the illness. Just dead.\r\nMy mom died of cancer pretty suddenly a few years back, I don't need my games to mimic that trauma and make me feel helpless and powerless, life does that well enough, thank you.\r\nGames are supposed to be an escape from reality. An opportunity to use your intellect and your choice to affect a favorable outcome in a controlled environment. Hell, I even played Darkest Dungeon and enjoyed it.\r\nI gotta leave a negative review, and I hate to do that, but I play a lot of different games and it's rare that I get as frustrated as that. Maybe this is not normal for this game and I just had a really bad RNG luck, but it was my very first play-through, so go figure how that's even likely. Maybe you can load it and the RNG won't hit again and you won't get sick, but I'm not loading and saving and going through all that wasted time just to get around this game wrecking mechanic.\r\nI'm not down for uncontrolled, unexplained, run ruining chaos in my 4x game. Sorry, not sorry.\r\nGlad I got the game on sale, I'd be pissed if I payed full price for this carbon copy.\r\nAlright, well cool, there are plenty of other awesome games to play.

      "review": "I love CIV pre CIV 5 (CIV 5 was bad and CIV 6 was junk). I hated Crusader Kings. So coming in I looked at the game as a mixed bag. \nThen I started playing it. First problem right off the bad is information overload. There is too much going on and no helpful help system to explain anything. At least with CIV, everything made sense. If you want to produce something, you know what affected producing things. With this game, it's more of magic behind the scenes affects producing.\nThen I tried out battling. I found out really quick that this game's biggest weakness was battling. First, AI units are inherently stronger even if you have more advanced units. They will send in 3 units and make mince meat of anything you have. If you try to attack them, expect to waste actions cause it will take 5-7 of of your units to hopefully kill one of their units. On top of that, the AI produces units faster than roaches multiply. With the AI set up to be somewhat weaker than you are, you will find that by the time you can produce enough settlers to create 3 cites, they will be on their 4th with an army of units already. \nThen there is the annoyance that you can't really do anything cause of orders. You set workers and your one scout to automate and find they just sit there doing nothing all game. Meanwhile the AI system is chugging away and somehow has double your order count. Seems the can reproduce orders as fast as they can units. \nJust this minute, I had an enemy archer completely surrounded by 6 units. It took all 6 to defeat a single archer. Something is messed up when it takes that much work for a single weak unit when they could have easily taken out my strongest unit with just 3 units. I ended up keeping that from happening by opening the editor and blocking their territory with mountains so I didn't have the AI swarming me with super humans anymore.\n\nOverall, it was a good concept of a game but falls way short of being good. Unless you open up the game editor and periodically erase AI units to even the playing field. \n\nI see other people mention things that are a problem and the common reply is that you can just turn off this or that feature.

      "review": "[h1]Multiplayer Wargame With 4X Foundation[/h1]\n\n[h2]Fatigue, Information Overload and Ugliness Earn Old World A 2 Out of 5[/h2]\n\n[b]THE GOOD: Cities and specialists; Pings; Undo; Orders; Vassal Families[/b]\n\n[b]THE BAD: Diplomacy; Religion; Espionage; Influence Actions[/b]\n\n[b]THE UGLY: Neverending text; Everything looks the same; Data displays are crude and ugly; A very rough UI[/b]\n\nOld World is for lawyers and gamblers, not for engineers or accountants. It has some interesting concepts which enhance gameplay by exploiting the natural tension between freedom and constraints. I hope others duplicate the conceptual innovations in Old World and improve upon them in other 4X titles.\n\nOld World's user interface is text- and number-dense. Playing beyond about four hours leads to a sense of fatigue and information overload. Things one might like to plan ahead of time, e.g. technological research or military unit promotions, are wrapped in random processes that appeal to devil-may-care gamblers but drive deliberate strategists mad. Frustration sets in when one tries to learn one's lessons from previous losses, only to be stymied because one can't make long-term plans for structural reasons intrinsic to the game. These structural aspects aggravate the information overload precisely because they make long-term strategic planning so exasperating.\n\nOld World's intended audience is players seeking a Multiplayer Wargaming experience with a 4X foundation. Many (most?) experienced Old World players value the developers' attention to aspects of Multiplayer gameplay that were absent from or very poorly implemented in other 4X titles. I exclusively play Single Player, and though I enjoy stomping my annoying neighbors' guts out as much as anyone, that's not the only way I play 4X games. The victory conditions are boring, especially the Ambitions Victory, which, for structural reasons described previously, is challenging for all the wrong reasons.\n\nMany positive reviewers on Steam reveal themselves to be unserious, as they are enthusiasts, fanbois and gatekeepers who abandon their critical faculties in defense of a game they believe is under-appreciated and not well publicized. Both of these things may be true of Old World but reviews don't settle scores. \"Historical\" justifications of Old World come either from fools or charlatans. The game's many grossly ahistorical elements are documented and criticized in detail elsewhere. Old World is \"history based,\" at best. It is [i]not[/i] \"historical.\" There's nothing wrong with that! But don't try to church up Old World with assertions of historicity.\n\n[b]THE GOOD:[/b]\n[b]1. City limits, workable tiles and specialists.[/b] There's usually a way to get what you want where you want it, though not necessarily when you need it. Borders can grow stupidly, which should be fixed, e.g., don't give that unincorporated wheat to my Champions city when my Landowners city is within equal range.\n\n[b]2. The Ping system[/b] is great for planning improvements. Reminder pings need improvement. Setting a reminder ping to, say, promote a military unit on turn X will cause the ping message to post in the long list of messages delivered at the start of turn X, but the map pin is immediately removed! Leave time-sensitive pings on the map until they're acknowledged or removed manually.\n\n[b]3. Undo is wonderful![/b] Make the Actions Stack viewable so that the player can easily select the last event they want to \"keep\" when they undo Actions.\n\n[b]4. The Orders concept[/b] is an interesting constraint on player actions. Are the computer players also so constrained? The need for the player to decide which actions to take this turn (vs. later or maybe never) limits one's horizons, but it presents a challenge that's interesting to deal with.\n\n[b]5. The Vassal Families system[/b] presents interesting challenges. Why aren't all 10 vassal families available to every civilization? Keep the limit of only three Families per empire. There's no good reason to arbitrarily make it impossible for a particular civilization to incorporate any of the different Vassal Families, so long as there are never more than three Families present in the empire.\n\n[b]THE BAD:[/b]\n[b]1. The Diplomacy system stinks.[/b] It's too limited and it's lame that an Ambassador is required in order to take any diplomatic action. It's reasonable to require an Ambassador to conduct diplomacy with other Civilizations. It's unreasonable to require an Ambassador to conduct diplomacy with Tribes. The few Ambassador Actions available suggest that the Diplomacy system was just bolted onto the game rather than developed right from the beginning. My Orders are better spent elsewhere.\n\n[b]2. The Religion system stinks.[/b] Like Diplomacy, Religion seems like an afterthought. Civilizations without Clerics Families or that don't start the game with the Divination technology or with the Husbandry technology will almost never found a World Religion except by sheer accident due to a random Event. Pagan Religions are second-class to World Religions, making them a short-term sink of one's precious Orders, so why bother?\n\n[b]3. The Espionage system is weak.[/b] It's reasonable to require a Spymaster to conduct Espionage Missions against other Civilizations. It's unreasonable to require a Spymaster to, e.g., \"deal with\" my rotten jealous scheming twin brother who lives forever and is an irredeemable nuisance and DEFCON 1 threat to my Rule and my household. It's completely arbitrary that all the nasty things one might need to do without being noticed within one's own civilization are off limits until one reaches the developmental stage at which it is also possible to foment unrest in foreign lands or steal technologies from adversaries. And Spymasters can't stir up the Tribes.\n\n[b]4. Influence Actions are too limited.[/b] One Character can only attempt to Influence (\"A chats up B\") another Character exactly one time, ever, throughout the entire lives of both Characters (A and B). One Character can only be Interceded For (\"C chats up B on A's behalf\") one time, ever, throughout the entire lives of both principal Characters (A and B). And during Leadership transitions, womp womp Legitimacy tanks! Good luck getting all your VIPs happily in line. You get one shot and one shot only per Influence target. What am I, made of Orders? Better to spend them on sure things.\n\n[b]THE UGLY:[/b]\n[b]1. \"Yo I heard you like reading.\"[/b] Everything that's not the map terrain itself is text. Tiny icons and tiny text litter the map, every notification is text... you'll do so much reading and clicking through menus in Old World that you'll suffer eye strain. Tooltips and text labels need different typefaces to separate and highlight different bits of information. The net effect is information overload. Animations and voice acting for Events would do wonders to liven things up.\n\n[b]2. All the improvements look the same.[/b] Each improvement type looks identical across all Civilizations, lacking any national or regional character. Is it all made out of ticky-tacky?\n\n[b]3. Tables, charts and graphs are more crude and ugly than useful.[/b] For example, the Family Opinion chart. One sees three traces plotted vs. time. Three numbers, that's it! Information, especially numerical data, is presented in a very limited and visually unappealing way that screams \"SuSE Linux, circa 2003.\"\n\n[b]4. The UI is fiddly and sticky.[/b] Tooltips with tooltips on their tooltips make for a very fiddly experience. There's a lot of clicking this and clicking that and having to drag the map this way and that, which worsens player fatigue caused by turn after turn of textalanche. Units cycle in a fixed order, bouncing from one end of the map to the other. One can automate Scouts and Workers, but military units need their hands held every step they take.",

      "review": "[h1]A Beautiful Disappointment: Ambition Without Execution[/h1]\r\nI'm a history buff and a fan of 4X games, so Old World should have been perfect for me. The concept is compelling - a 4X game set in antiquity with dynastic mechanics and character-driven narratives. The art direction is beautiful, and I think the developers had good intentions. Unfortunately, that doesn't make up for the game's problems.\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[b]The Identity Crisis[/b]\r\nOld World feels like it's trying to be three different games at once: Civilization's empire-building, Europa Universalis' depth, and Hearts of Iron's strategic complexity. It doesn't succeed at being any of them. It's stuck in an awkward middle ground where it's too shallow for grand strategy enthusiasts but too convoluted for casual 4X players.\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[b]Forced Ideology and Limited Agency[/b]\r\nOne of my biggest frustrations is how the game pushes contemporary cultural expectations and ideals into your face during gameplay. Mods can fix this (thankfully), but it shouldn't require community intervention to make a historical game feel less like social commentary. I play these games to engage with history on its own terms, not to have modern sensibilities imposed on ancient civilizations.\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[b]Shallow Systems[/b]\r\nThe problem-solving paths are severely gated and limited compared to what Europa Universalis offers. When challenges arise, you're forced down narrow story-driven solutions rather than having real strategic options. The economics feel underbaked, and production times are painfully long without the depth to justify it. Everything takes forever, but nothing feels particularly rewarding when completed.\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[b]Better Options Exist[/b]\r\nI wanted this to work, but there are simply better games out there. If you want accessible 4X gameplay, Civilization V (or earlier) does it better. For grand strategy depth, Europa Universalis IV is superior. For character-driven narratives, Crusader Kings III excels. Even older games like Endless Legend or Endless Space offer more satisfying experiences.\r\nOld World falls short in nearly every category it attempts. I can't recommend it when superior alternatives exist at similar or lower price points.\r\n[b]Not Recommended[/b] ❌",

Within a few hours the cracks were showing though.  \n\nOne of the areas the game focuses on is characters - individual people who get older with each turn and have roles in your court or line of succession and so on.  IMO this aspect is far too fiddly for very little benefit.  They broke it into a bunch of little pieces that are not fun to micromanage.  You get spammed constantly with notifications that certain people are getting ill, enough that it started to feel comical, which contributed to the feeling of the whole people aspect quickly turning into a list of random names that mean nothing.  There's a bunch of them there on the right side of the screen, and they all have opinions and those opinions are influenced by a lot of things and their opinions in turn influence a lot of other things.  I don't know who they are or why but they sure do get sick and die a lot and randomly acquire traits that do something to their stats.  I think they got a little carried away with developing the people part of the game but tbf I'm more of a Civ person than a Crusader Kings person so maybe you like that stuff.  It just felt to me like I'm trying to put some Legos together and when I pick up a Lego it turns out to be a pile of ants instead of a Lego piece - too much granularity with too much randomness and chaos, and it just didn't need to be that way because the work to benefit ratio of staying on top of these people seems poor.  Just seems very fiddly and random for no good reason.\n\nAlso a religion formed spontaneously in one of my cities, I don't know where it came from or how to deal with it but it made a bunch of people unhappy with me for not being that new thing.  The music is great but the vocals are a bit much, I wish I could get an instrumental track because the singers, while talented, need to chill for being a background soundtrack for a game.

In almost every. single. way.\r\nThe family dynamics twist seemed kind of intriguing to me, though. \r\nIt was something new, and I was liking what I was seeing.\r\nThe interface was good, the mechanics all seemed to be there.\r\nThe different families for each nation, and the members of each family and their feelings about each other and their traits and how that all affects the nation was new to me and right up my alley.\r\nI was making choices and doing researches and building tile improvements and really getting a feel for the game.\r\nI had met another nation and some city states and was making peace and diplomacy.\r\nMy step-son was mad initially he wasn't the heir, but I gave him a job and made him an advisor and felt we were getting along and I even forgave him when he go caught being a traitor.\r\nMy heir, my daughter married a prince from a City-state and I had a granddaughter and I was like, this is awesome. I am totally digging this family dynamic mixed into the good old Civ gameplay.\r\nSuddenly, in under 30 total turns, I became ill, then gravely ill, then doomed, and then died within 4 turns.\r\nAll my plans, diplomacy, relations went to hell, but I'm like, ok it's cool people get old and die, that's this game's mechanic to keep you challenged. My daughter will step in and take over control of the empire and I'll hopefully have another 30 turns or longer trying to make some progress before she dies too.\r\nWithin 4 turns, I'm not even kidding, ill, gravely ill, doomed.\r\nI rage quit right there, and it will likely be a long time, if ever, I come back to this game.\r\nWhy did they get sick? NO REASON GIVEN. I had so many farms and so much food, I was killing it.\r\nI would understand if there was like a famine or some game mechanic that would have instigated the illness.\r\nWhy couldn't I do anything to try and improve their health to keep them alive? BECAUSE.\r\nNo medicine, no obligatory rest, no options at all to try and rectify the illness.

Maybe this is not normal for this game and I just had a really bad RNG luck, but it was my very first play-through, so go figure how that's even likely. Maybe you can load it and the RNG won't hit again and you won't get sick, but I'm not loading and saving and going through all that wasted time just to get around this game wrecking mechanic.\r\nI'm not down for uncontrolled, unexplained, run ruining chaos in my 4x game. Sorry, not sorry.\r\nGlad I got the game on sale, I'd be pissed if I payed full price for this carbon copy.\r\nAlright, well cool, there are plenty of other awesome games to play.

      "review": "I love CIV pre CIV 5 (CIV 5 was bad and CIV 6 was junk). I hated Crusader Kings. So coming in I looked at the game as a mixed bag. \nThen I started playing it. First problem right off the bad is information overload. There is too much going on and no helpful help system to explain anything. At least with CIV, everything made sense. If you want to produce something, you know what affected producing things. With this game, it's more of magic behind the scenes affects producing.\nThen I tried out battling. I found out really quick that this game's biggest weakness was battling. First, AI units are inherently stronger even if you have more advanced units. They will send in 3 units and make mince meat of anything you have. If you try to attack them, expect to waste actions cause it will take 5-7 of of your units to hopefully kill one of their units. On top of that, the AI produces units faster than roaches multiply. With the AI set up to be somewhat weaker than you are, you will find that by the time you can produce enough settlers to create 3 cites, they will be on their 4th with an army of units already. \nThen there is the annoyance that you can't really do anything cause of orders. You set workers and your one scout to automate and find they just sit there doing nothing all game. Meanwhile the AI system is chugging away and somehow has double your order count. Seems the can reproduce orders as fast as they can units. \nJust this minute, I had an enemy archer completely surrounded by 6 units. It took all 6 to defeat a single archer. Something is messed up when it takes that much work for a single weak unit when they could have easily taken out my strongest unit with just 3 units. I ended up keeping that from happening by opening the editor and blocking their territory with mountains so I didn't have the AI swarming me with super humans anymore.\n\nOverall, it was a good concept of a game but falls way short of being good. Unless you open up the game editor and periodically erase AI units to even the playing field. \n\nI see other people mention things that are a problem and the common reply is that you can just turn off this or that feature.

It makes the world feel inorganic, which in this style of game, I think just ruins the experience. \n\nSome day, one developer will figure out that most people hate this, and they will add a slider, so people who do want to be swarmed can crank it up, and people who want a more organic world growth can turn it down or off. Until then, I think this will be my last 'civilization style' game for awhile.\n\nP.S. butthurt fanboys throwing me points isn't going to change the review lol",

      "review": "[h1]Multiplayer Wargame With 4X Foundation[/h1]\n\n[h2]Fatigue, Information Overload and Ugliness Earn Old World A 2 Out of 5[/h2]\n\n[b]THE GOOD: Cities and specialists; Pings; Undo; Orders; Vassal Families[/b]\n\n[b]THE BAD: Diplomacy; Religion; Espionage; Influence Actions[/b]\n\n[b]THE UGLY: Neverending text; Everything looks the same; Data displays are crude and ugly; A very rough UI[/b]\n\nOld World is for lawyers and gamblers, not for engineers or accountants. It has some interesting concepts which enhance gameplay by exploiting the natural tension between freedom and constraints. I hope others duplicate the conceptual innovations in Old World and improve upon them in other 4X titles.\n\nOld World's user interface is text- and number-dense. Playing beyond about four hours leads to a sense of fatigue and information overload. Things one might like to plan ahead of time, e.g. technological research or military unit promotions, are wrapped in random processes that appeal to devil-may-care gamblers but drive deliberate strategists mad. Frustration sets in when one tries to learn one's lessons from previous losses, only to be stymied because one can't make long-term plans for structural reasons intrinsic to the game. These structural aspects aggravate the information overload precisely because they make long-term strategic planning so exasperating.\n\nOld World's intended audience is players seeking a Multiplayer Wargaming experience with a 4X foundation. Many (most?) experienced Old World players value the developers' attention to aspects of Multiplayer gameplay that were absent from or very poorly implemented in other 4X titles. I exclusively play Single Player, and though I enjoy stomping my annoying neighbors' guts out as much as anyone, that's not the only way I play 4X games. The victory conditions are boring, especially the Ambitions Victory, which, for structural reasons described previously, is challenging for all the wrong reasons.\n\nMany positive reviewers on Steam reveal themselves to be unserious, as they are enthusiasts, fanbois and gatekeepers who abandon their critical faculties in defense of a game they believe is under-appreciated and not well publicized. Both of these things may be true of Old World but reviews don't settle scores. \"Historical\" justifications of Old World come either from fools or charlatans. The game's many grossly ahistorical elements are documented and criticized in detail elsewhere. Old World is \"history based,\" at best. It is [i]not[/i] \"historical.\" There's nothing wrong with that! But don't try to church up Old World with assertions of historicity.\n\n[b]THE GOOD:[/b]\n[b]1. City limits, workable tiles and specialists.[/b] There's usually a way to get what you want where you want it, though not necessarily when you need it. Borders can grow stupidly, which should be fixed, e.g., don't give that unincorporated wheat to my Champions city when my Landowners city is within equal range.\n\n[b]2. The Ping system[/b] is great for planning improvements. Reminder pings need improvement. Setting a reminder ping to, say, promote a military unit on turn X will cause the ping message to post in the long list of messages delivered at the start of turn X, but the map pin is immediately removed! Leave time-sensitive pings on the map until they're acknowledged or removed manually.\n\n[b]3. Undo is wonderful![/b] Make the Actions Stack viewable so that the player can easily select the last event they want to \"keep\" when they undo Actions.\n\n[b]4. The Orders concept[/b] is an interesting constraint on player actions. Are the computer players also so constrained? The need for the player to decide which actions to take this turn (vs. later or maybe never) limits one's horizons, but it presents a challenge that's interesting to deal with.\n\n[b]5. The Vassal Families system[/b] presents interesting challenges. Why aren't all 10 vassal families available to every civilization? Keep the limit of only three Families per empire. There's no good reason to arbitrarily make it impossible for a particular civilization to incorporate any of the different Vassal Families, so long as there are never more than three Families present in the empire.\n\n[b]THE BAD:[/b]\n[b]1. The Diplomacy system stinks.[/b] It's too limited and it's lame that an Ambassador is required in order to take any diplomatic action. It's reasonable to require an Ambassador to conduct diplomacy with other Civilizations. It's unreasonable to require an Ambassador to conduct diplomacy with Tribes. The few Ambassador Actions available suggest that the Diplomacy system was just bolted onto the game rather than developed right from the beginning. My Orders are better spent elsewhere.\n\n[b]2. The Religion system stinks.[/b] Like Diplomacy, Religion seems like an afterthought. Civilizations without Clerics Families or that don't start the game with the Divination technology or with the Husbandry technology will almost never found a World Religion except by sheer accident due to a random Event. Pagan Religions are second-class to World Religions, making them a short-term sink of one's precious Orders, so why bother?\n\n[b]3. The Espionage system is weak.[/b] It's reasonable to require a Spymaster to conduct Espionage Missions against other Civilizations. It's unreasonable to require a Spymaster to, e.g., \"deal with\" my rotten jealous scheming twin brother who lives forever and is an irredeemable nuisance and DEFCON 1 threat to my Rule and my household. It's completely arbitrary that all the nasty things one might need to do without being noticed within one's own civilization are off limits until one reaches the developmental stage at which it is also possible to foment unrest in foreign lands or steal technologies from adversaries. And Spymasters can't stir up the Tribes.\n\n[b]4. Influence Actions are too limited.[/b] One Character can only attempt to Influence (\"A chats up B\") another Character exactly one time, ever, throughout the entire lives of both Characters (A and B). One Character can only be Interceded For (\"C chats up B on A's behalf\") one time, ever, throughout the entire lives of both principal Characters (A and B). And during Leadership transitions, womp womp Legitimacy tanks! Good luck getting all your VIPs happily in line. You get one shot and one shot only per Influence target. What am I, made of Orders? Better to spend them on sure things.\n\n[b]THE UGLY:[/b]\n[b]1. \"Yo I heard you like reading.\"[/b] Everything that's not the map terrain itself is text. Tiny icons and tiny text litter the map, every notification is text... you'll do so much reading and clicking through menus in Old World that you'll suffer eye strain. Tooltips and text labels need different typefaces to separate and highlight different bits of information. The net effect is information overload. Animations and voice acting for Events would do wonders to liven things up.\n\n[b]2. All the improvements look the same.[/b] Each improvement type looks identical across all Civilizations, lacking any national or regional character. Is it all made out of ticky-tacky?\n\n[b]3. Tables, charts and graphs are more crude and ugly than useful.[/b] For example, the Family Opinion chart. One sees three traces plotted vs. time. Three numbers, that's it! Information, especially numerical data, is presented in a very limited and visually unappealing way that screams \"SuSE Linux, circa 2003.\"\n\n[b]4. The UI is fiddly and sticky.[/b] Tooltips with tooltips on their tooltips make for a very fiddly experience. There's a lot of clicking this and clicking that and having to drag the map this way and that, which worsens player fatigue caused by turn after turn of textalanche. Units cycle in a fixed order, bouncing from one end of the map to the other. One can automate Scouts and Workers, but military units need their hands held every step they take.",

      "review": "[h1]A Beautiful Disappointment: Ambition Without Execution[/h1]\r\nI'm a history buff and a fan of 4X games, so Old World should have been perfect for me. The concept is compelling - a 4X game set in antiquity with dynastic mechanics and character-driven narratives. The art direction is beautiful, and I think the developers had good intentions. Unfortunately, that doesn't make up for the game's problems.\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[b]The Identity Crisis[/b]\r\nOld World feels like it's trying to be three different games at once: Civilization's empire-building, Europa Universalis' depth, and Hearts of Iron's strategic complexity. It doesn't succeed at being any of them. It's stuck in an awkward middle ground where it's too shallow for grand strategy enthusiasts but too convoluted for casual 4X players.\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[b]Forced Ideology and Limited Agency[/b]\r\nOne of my biggest frustrations is how the game pushes contemporary cultural expectations and ideals into your face during gameplay. Mods can fix this (thankfully), but it shouldn't require community intervention to make a historical game feel less like social commentary. I play these games to engage with history on its own terms, not to have modern sensibilities imposed on ancient civilizations.\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[b]Shallow Systems[/b]\r\nThe problem-solving paths are severely gated and limited compared to what Europa Universalis offers. When challenges arise, you're forced down narrow story-driven solutions rather than having real strategic options. The economics feel underbaked, and production times are painfully long without the depth to justify it. Everything takes forever, but nothing feels particularly rewarding when completed.\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[b]Better Options Exist[/b]\r\nI wanted this to work, but there are simply better games out there. If you want accessible 4X gameplay, Civilization V (or earlier) does it better. For grand strategy depth, Europa Universalis IV is superior. For character-driven narratives, Crusader Kings III excels. Even older games like Endless Legend or Endless Space offer more satisfying experiences.\r\nOld World falls short in nearly every category it attempts. I can't recommend it when superior alternatives exist at similar or lower price points.\r\n[b]Not Recommended[/b] ❌",

Within a few hours the cracks were showing though.  \n\nOne of the areas the game focuses on is characters - individual people who get older with each turn and have roles in your court or line of succession and so on.  IMO this aspect is far too fiddly for very little benefit.  They broke it into a bunch of little pieces that are not fun to micromanage.  You get spammed constantly with notifications that certain people are getting ill, enough that it started to feel comical, which contributed to the feeling of the whole people aspect quickly turning into a list of random names that mean nothing.  There's a bunch of them there on the right side of the screen, and they all have opinions and those opinions are influenced by a lot of things and their opinions in turn influence a lot of other things.  I don't know who they are or why but they sure do get sick and die a lot and randomly acquire traits that do something to their stats.  I think they got a little carried away with developing the people part of the game but tbf I'm more of a Civ person than a Crusader Kings person so maybe you like that stuff.  It just felt to me like I'm trying to put some Legos together and when I pick up a Lego it turns out to be a pile of ants instead of a Lego piece - too much granularity with too much randomness and chaos, and it just didn't need to be that way because the work to benefit ratio of staying on top of these people seems poor.  Just seems very fiddly and random for no good reason.\n\nAlso a religion formed spontaneously in one of my cities, I don't know where it came from or how to deal with it but it made a bunch of people unhappy with me for not being that new thing.  The music is great but the vocals are a bit much, I wish I could get an instrumental track because the singers, while talented, need to chill for being a background soundtrack for a game.

In almost every. single. way.\r\nThe family dynamics twist seemed kind of intriguing to me, though. \r\nIt was something new, and I was liking what I was seeing.\r\nThe interface was good, the mechanics all seemed to be there.\r\nThe different families for each nation, and the members of each family and their feelings about each other and their traits and how that all affects the nation was new to me and right up my alley.\r\nI was making choices and doing researches and building tile improvements and really getting a feel for the game.\r\nI had met another nation and some city states and was making peace and diplomacy.\r\nMy step-son was mad initially he wasn't the heir, but I gave him a job and made him an advisor and felt we were getting along and I even forgave him when he go caught being a traitor.\r\nMy heir, my daughter married a prince from a City-state and I had a granddaughter and I was like, this is awesome.

NO REASON GIVEN. I had so many farms and so much food, I was killing it.\r\nI would understand if there was like a famine or some game mechanic that would have instigated the illness.\r\nWhy couldn't I do anything to try and improve their health to keep them alive?

Maybe you can load it and the RNG won't hit again and you won't get sick, but I'm not loading and saving and going through all that wasted time just to get around this game wrecking mechanic.\r\nI'm not down for uncontrolled, unexplained, run ruining chaos in my 4x game.

      "review": "I love CIV pre CIV 5 (CIV 5 was bad and CIV 6 was junk). I hated Crusader Kings. So coming in I looked at the game as a mixed bag. \nThen I started playing it. First problem right off the bad is information overload. There is too much going on and no helpful help system to explain anything. At least with CIV, everything made sense. If you want to produce something, you know what affected producing things. With this game, it's more of magic behind the scenes affects producing.\nThen I tried out battling. I found out really quick that this game's biggest weakness was battling. First, AI units are inherently stronger even if you have more advanced units. They will send in 3 units and make mince meat of anything you have. If you try to attack them, expect to waste actions cause it will take 5-7 of of your units to hopefully kill one of their units. On top of that, the AI produces units faster than roaches multiply. With the AI set up to be somewhat weaker than you are, you will find that by the time you can produce enough settlers to create 3 cites, they will be on their 4th with an army of units already. \nThen there is the annoyance that you can't really do anything cause of orders. You set workers and your one scout to automate and find they just sit there doing nothing all game. Meanwhile the AI system is chugging away and somehow has double your order count. Seems the can reproduce orders as fast as they can units. \nJust this minute, I had an enemy archer completely surrounded by 6 units. It took all 6 to defeat a single archer. Something is messed up when it takes that much work for a single weak unit when they could have easily taken out my strongest unit with just 3 units. I ended up keeping that from happening by opening the editor and blocking their territory with mountains so I didn't have the AI swarming me with super humans anymore.\n\nOverall, it was a good concept of a game but falls way short of being good. Unless you open up the game editor and periodically erase AI units to even the playing field. \n\nI see other people mention things that are a problem and the common reply is that you can just turn off this or that feature.

I needed that on turn 1!).\n\nBought it on sale for <CA$6, and still applied for a refund.",

      "review": "Has the same problem all of these games have, AI cheats, can build insane amounts of military units early on making early game frustrating. I already know how this plays out, if I survive the early game I eventually become unstoppable, Its an old and tired game style of these types of games, and one day I hope to find one that is balanced throughout instead of insanely front loaded when it comes to difficulty.\n\nI'm not even going to bother pushing onwards, because if it doesn't work like that, then the entire game will be fighting against overwhelming odds and that I don't find fun either.\n\nHonestly, the anti player bias in these style of games (and total war, one of my favorite series suffers this too) is about half the problem. Bandit/barbarian whatever else will walk past the AI to attack the player.\n\nIf this hadn't been the case, I wouldn't be slogged down in a 2 front war which would have made fighting the enemies I had on my eastern front a lot more fun, even though they were annoyingly over stacked. Instead I had to split my already undersized compared to my enemies forces in half because of a never ending onslaught of random spawn bandit enemies on me western flank, which was otherwise secure with only friendly AI (that they of course ignored and walked past to attack me) in that direction.\n\nI finally alt F4'd and uninstalled when a 3rd front opened by even more random spawn enemies to my south, making the situation completely untenable. \n\nI have no interest in restarting over and over trying to get the right circumstances and force counts to 'win' the early game, Because like civ before it, I already know how this plays out. Same old tired trope of annoying start and way too easy late game.\n\nI don't know why devs think anti player bias is fun, but I wish they would get it through their thick skulls it just isn't. It makes the world feel inorganic, which in this style of game, I think just ruins the experience. \n\nSome day, one developer will figure out that most people hate this, and they will add a slider, so people who do want to be swarmed can crank it up, and people who want a more organic world growth can turn it down or off. Until then, I think this will be my last 'civilization style' game for awhile.\n\nP.S. butthurt fanboys throwing me points isn't going to change the review lol",

If you're of the opinion \"less is more\", DON'T BUY THIS GAME. It's trying too hard to be a grand strategy game in a 4X setting and the blend leaves it with an identity crisis.",
