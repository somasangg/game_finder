      "review": "This is intended to be a neutral review. \nAfter my third or fourth restart I have finally played a campaign all the way to the end!\n\nTo start with, this game tries to be a lot of different things, in a way that is very unique. It's a geopolitical sim, two different map painting games in one, space combat sim, logistics game, among others. While this is great, I feel that certain aspects of the game need a LOT of work. \n\nThe good:\n- Strangely addicting even in aspects that feel repetitive, like the early-mid earth management.\n- You feel a real sense of accomplishment as you progress.\n- The early and mid game are both fantastic and feel completely different to each other.\n- The simulation of earth alone is ridiculously complex in a fun way, it doesn't get boring. Even after finishing the game I wanted to reload just to fiddle with it more.\n- Absurd level of detail in the solar system, virtually every object in the solar system is available.\n- The alien hate/retaliation system is actually very well thought out, though it could be better explained through hints in game (Since it's metagame info). I think the devs did a good job of making it relatively hard to lock yourself out from progress due to aggression.\n- Despite the tech tree flaws, it creates a sense that there is a massive alien tech difference at the start by by the end you are out-competing them.\n\nThe neutral:\n- Climate change exists, it is more of a debuff than a problem. You can effectively slow it down but not feasibly reverse it for most playthroughs.\n\nThe bad:\n- Virtually zero automation, beyond just councillors. At the very least I think there needs to be a way to set up automated fleets that rally at a given point, merge, refuel etc. The tasks themselves do not need automating IMO as 90% of the clicking was just telling new ships to merge at their location individually, without merging to say \"the defence fleet\". Having templates for fleet names by ship class and grouping these would be great.\n- Very poor UI/UX. You cannot even do things like select multiple armies, which is one of the most annoying things in the entire game. If selecting multiple entities is not possible, simply having a button to move ALL armies of ONE nation to a given point would be great. The only possibility for this currently is moving all from one tile home/somewhere else. You can also right click tabs in the ship designer to see charts of parts that you can sort by attributes, I found this by ACCIDENT.\n- The tech tree is bloated beyond belief and pacing makes for poor gameplay. Unfortunately or more likely by design, most of the early to mid space tech is completely useless. You can make initial suicide vessels easily, then later make a viable defence fleet for the body it's manufactured at (earth, mars). After this point, there is about 10-15 in game years of useless technology before you actually reach drives and weapons that make attack fleets viable.\n- Sieging titan was so difficult that I was almost considering it a bug. 40+ ships with siege coils did nothing while 10 ships with marines destroy the base in 5 days.\n- Enemy councilors continue to be annoying long beyond the point where that faction is irrelevant on the global stage.\n\nSuggestions:\n- Add another game mode or option when starting that compresses the tech tree instead of speed up research. Organise drives into type (i.e. Chemical, Ion + Mass Driver, fission, fusion/hydrogen). Select 4-5 of each type and lock that down. It does not even have to be a strict progression, just having 20 rather than 70+ would help a lot. Throughout my playthrough I think used 5 different drives in total. I personally don't feel like the game needs tooltips with suggestions for drive use-cases, but that could also be nice. \n- Rebalance the end-game drives. The Pion Torch and Protium Converter Torch have similar applications but both take very long to research. The Pion has a ridiculous install cost but low mass (open cycle), while PCT effectively makes refueling free but by that point the Helion drive is good enough for general attack use anyway.\n- Ship templates to show new players example designs would be nice.\n- In terms of tedium, the only part of the game I hated was actually the end game. Once you clear jupiter, the rest of the game feels like a slog as you are mostly just waiting for your ships to move around the outer solar system, or mass producing attack fleets. I think if there was a way to better \"compress\" the experience this would go away. I could have played more aggressively, but it feels like there's just a lot of waiting the closer you get to the end of the game.",

      "review": "Terra Invicta is one of those unique strong games that make you ask, \"Why isn't this idea more common?\" Imagine if a UFO crash landed in an undeniably well documented area of the planet today. How would the world react? What would you do? What kinds of factions, organizations, and treaties would form? There's a lot to the imagination there, but this game does its best to give you an inkling of what that might look like!\nI may not have a lot of hours on it, thats mostly because the game is such a densely packed experience, but I've seen plenty of campaigns by other people going well into the 2100s. Its amazing how the planet changes in just a few years let alone decades. \n\nWhat do I think needs improvement?\n- The international diplomacy mechanics. This game is set up around the capabilities of certain private organizations that push their interests on the world to respond to the alien threat as they see fit. Fine. But I think it would be better if the game acknowledged that some long standing things are not going to just change over a few turns or even (at least) a decade into the game. Take NATO for example. In a hypothetical scenario where the USA somehow adopted an authoritarian government led by the Initiative (an unrealistic scenario I'm sure, but bear with me), it is in the interest of the initiative to break their alliance (IRL that would be NATO) with the rest of their non-initiative controlled allies. So if Canada, France, Spain, and Turkey were randomly controlled by the Resistance in this hypothetical scenario? They'd randomly break their alliance with those while keeping the rest of their allied network with the rest of NATO. You see the problem? We've managed to somehow side skirt 70+ years of diplomacy and hegemonic millitary alliance because a game mechanic encourages you with little to no modifiers that discourage that act. This game doesn't need to be HOI4 or some other paradox game, it does a great job of forging its own identity, but this is one glaring issue I would call to improve on in the future. \n\nWhat do I love about Terra Invicta?\n- Without posting the copy pasta that got me into this game, I would invite you to think about the year 2100. In one game, that might be one where the world is dominated by three major great nations, who have become entrenched in a long war against the aliens. Climate change has wreaked havoc, Florida has sunken (the game has beautiful graphics that change as climate change inevitably swallows the Earth. A coalition of Academy led nations have set out to improve the quality of life in regions that were 'left behind' on Earth, using their political leverage to slowly fold those impoverished lands into their hold. South America, long ago unified by Colonel Hanse Castillo has gone on an ecological crusade to burn the surrounding regions of the Amazon to prevent the Alien flora from choking out the last native stronghold of terrestrial plantlife. In this world, humanity is winning, but it will never be the same again. \nIn another game, the year 2100 is a dark age where light of humanity has been quenched by nuclear fire. The literacy rate has plummeted because no nation thought it useful to put stock into welfare and education. What little polities remain that hasn't been gobbled up by an alien directorate are a few space stations floating around Mars and one interestingly bright star flying away from the solar system. In this world, humanity is losing, and it will never be the same again.\nThere is so much variety to this game, such a simple question it asks: \"What if aliens landed tomorrow?\" and what complex answers it offers. I can't recommend it enough, its my favorite game to think about and I only wish I had more time to play all the beautiful stories it offers.",

      "review": "Terra Invicta is a hard sci-fi, grand strategy game set in an alien invasion of modern day Earth.  At a high level, the game is split between a map of the solar system where you build and direct space stations, mines, and fleets of of ships and a geoscape where you gain control of and direct the resources of nations on Earth.  \n\nThis game is hard.  There is no learning curve but several learning cliffs that you smash into and climb over as you hit walls with the different mechanics.  It throws you into the deep end and you stay there.  The aliens will throw you curve balls as they escalate their invasion that initially you won't have any idea how to deal with and be left scrambling.  You will be punished for mistakes that you made in game years and real life hours ago and your best laid plans will turn to ash in front of you in an instant.  But little by little you figure it out until your wins start to out number your losses and you reach the victory screen. If that sounds like your brain damage then I highly recommend this game.\n\nTerra Invicta is a niche game for a niche audience and it does it very well.  You'll either love it or hate it and props to the publisher Hooded Horse for letting the developers cook without dialing it back, watering it down, or chopping the game up into dozens of packs of DLC.",

How cool is that ?! \n\nI have played a lot of strategy games, city/colony builders, 4X, space games (EVE etc)\nSo I enjoy depth in games with mechanics that you want to explore and you need to make perfect. \nIf you like researching on guides after guide on optimal ways of doing things and builds, setups ,ship and navy compositions then this is a playground for you! \n\nIt is not for everybody. But for the ones it is , it is the best expirience there. \nIf the dev teams spend some (more) time on making tutorials , update theis guides and making QOL imporvements then the barrier that keeps a lot of players away will be lifted. \n\nOne Requests that I have is to add a ship designer that can visualise ( with X-Y axis) how a ship behaves/move. How fast can accelerate and how far it can move. Then add in the same graph an allien fleet so I can know at the time of design if I can intercept it or not! \nIt is heart breaking on spending 3 afternoons gathering resources, technology and then wait for the fleet to be build just to learn that my ship is good for nothing! \n\nI can feel that the team is a passionate engineers that love what they are doing ( and I am envy on that ) but I can also feel that as most engineers they add a lot of depth and mechanisms and do not like to document them :-) \n\nThank you and keep up the good job.",

I will admit that the early game can seem kind of tedious until you start to unlock space colonization and you struggle to know what is in store for you, but this game has incredible depth. \n\nEach turn I'm simultaneously managing my efforts on Earth to unify Africa and maintain my political and military foothold on other parts of the world as the Aliens slowly start to take over entire countries, while also managing a wide colony of habs and space fleets to defend my important points. \n\nThere are a lot of fair criticisms though, such as convoluted UI that doesn't seem to have been put together with a lot of thought or cohesiveness, while also not giving as much information about certain mechanics as I would have wished. Along the same lines, the tech tree and the whole tech tab is just wildly unintuitive. For some reason I can't choose to research items from the tree itself which is super annoying. Maybe I'm just missing something there. \n\nThat all being said, I was able to play and learn this game with no youtube tutorials, which is kind of unheard of for me cause I'm kind of an idiot, because the tutorial does a really good job of guiding you through what your next goals should be. \n\nAll in all this game isn't really for someone who doesn't have a lot of time. I found it while looking for wargames that specifically require a lot of time and dedication, with campaigns that I could play over the span of months, and this game delivers. Also there really isn't anything like this game at all, it really is the only one of it's kind so it's hard to compare to other games, so if you are looking for a game that is like that one game you really love, this isn't really that but I'm willing to bet that if you gave this game enough commitment, that it'll reward you back.",

I didn't notice a single bug! The interface felt awkward at times, but I that may just come down to a learning curve. Although some things like nation management can come down to nothing more than doing a bit of math and making adjustments as I go, there's always a trade-off, for instance between choosing whether and how to keep control of the world-wide research to guide it down favored avenues, as opposed to just sticking to myself and researching whatever specific, ground-level techs the larger research give me access to. The AI seems to do well enough with the present systems to pounce if I leave something neglected or unattended. After 51 hours I still haven't really left the Earth-Luna system yet, and the only competition so far has been the other six unruly factions, so there's another huge part of the game waiting once I head off into deep space.

The atmosphere alone had me hooked-- aliens are coming, we don't know why, all we know is that they don't wish us well. Pitting you against the aliens like David vs a cyborg Goliath on steroids. That game made you use every little scrap of cunning, knowledge and a healthy heap of determination to win. It felt like a legitimate achievement to score a win against the aliens.\n\nSo, when it came out that the people behind XCOM long war- one of the most challenging mods for the XCOM remake-- were making a game of their own, and a hard sci-fi (I adore hard SF) one at that, I was over the moon and probably all the way out past the orbit of Pluto! I do think they delivered here, but not without some caveats that I will get into.\n\nLets start with the good:\n- The atmosphere is immaculate, and exactly what I'd expect from a 7 flavors of illuminati vs Aliens-- backstabbing, betrayal, engineered wars, it's great! How it all plays out in game though, is another matter that we'll get to.\n- The science makes my inner nerd jump for joy, It's one thing to stomp an incoming alien raid, it's quite another to know exactly what tools you're doing it with. Also, the pencil of death space ship design is just fantastic.\n- Quite a bit of difficulty to be found here, it's not an easy game, which is great! The reward wouldn't taste as sweet otherwise.\n- Complexity to lose yourself in for hours on end, an excellent time killer. There's so many systems here to mess around with, each rewarding in some way\n\nMoving on to the bad:\n-Unintuitive UI, and not enough management help tools. Turns could take as much as an hour depending on how much stuff you're managing. It got to the point where I kept a journal on my desk for noting down all the alien fleets I had to intercept alone, and another sheet just for my territorial management/agent action plan\n\n-Split between ground game and space game, it really does feel like you're playing 2 different games once you get to space. Bar stuff like money and research, Earth has very little impact on things in space\n\n- Could use a bit more teaching resources for newer players to consult. This game's learning curve feels less like a curve and more like a mountain.\n\nAll these things can definitely be fixed though. Even as it stands, it's a great game that challenges you to learn and adapt. I highly recommend it for anyone who loves Sci-Fi and has the patience for it!",

There are times you will be frustrated and occasionally blindsided by what's happening and sometimes the external guides are also super confusing so you just have to take a guess and see what happens. It's particularly bad for shipbuilding and drive technology and if you happen to pick shit research paths you'll get kicked in the dick come the mid-late game.\r\n\r\nWith all that said though this game is grand unlike anything I've played.

      "review": "Instead of describing the game I'm going to try and summarize my learning curve since this game has a reputation for being difficult. Now I'm not an experienced 4x or RTS player at all but I think that reputation is overblown. In my current save I made at least 2 big mistakes that cost me a few years in-game but it turns out...that doesn't matter much. Aliens don't start treating you like a threat until you are one so if your research is lower than it should be or it took you an extra year to get control of the country you want (USA/China/EU in most cases) that's alright. In my case I completely forgot that taking control of a country is easier when you first control their smaller neighbors so I needed to get Canada and Mexico before the US.  That cost me at least a year.\r\n\r\nBeing late meant there I couldn't colonize the moon or Mars at the same time as the other factions, I ended up with a couple measly bases on Mars and that was it for awhile. I was looking at the intel screen which shows resource income for all the various factions and most of them were light years ahead of me. Quitting seemed like the logical thing to do.\r\n\r\nBut I wanted to keep learning the game before I reset so I continued. A couple years go by and I notice I've ended up with a lot of tech for these interesting fellows called \"space marines\" and just enough engine tech to manufacture a spaceship in orbit and then send down to planets...where all those juicy Mars bases are.\r\n\r\nOne space dock and a couple marine transport ships later and what do you know. I own Mars!\r\n\r\nSome time has gone by since then and the aliens are more active now. I still can barely scratch them so I'm accepting my losses and trying to seed more bases where I can. It's starting to feel like I might lose again. But I'll keep going. I learned my lesson the first time, if the ayys want my planet they better eradicate every last one of my assets or I'll find a way back. \r\n\r\nSo if the difficulty is the only thing holding you back then I recommend diving in. The systems are fairly complicated but the game itself is very forgiving. Keep that wiki open and be prepared for some reading and you'll be building a palace on Mars in no time.",

      "review": "This is a long review! I really enjoyed the one game I played (~125 of the 133 hours on record after ending a short campaign after I got the hand of things). This game is gonna be a powerhouse at launch.\n\nThe bad: Honestly the 'worst' part of it was lategame, which I found very tedious - the aliens had a bunch of <100 value fleets that would constantly donk any station I tried to build unless I had a fleet babysitting it for its entire construction, and it was just a lot of tedium to clean everything up after I had already functionally won. I had some frustration with alien admin and nukes, but I've heard that's fixed on experimental. There's also a lot of UI work to be done (again I've heard experimental is working on this), but controlling armies and fleets was a chore lategame. There's work to be done as well on clarifying how some of the mechanics work in game, from how farms actually work, to the fact that spoils income isn't shown in your income estimate. Also, and I don't know a good fix to this - the priority system needs work.  When the 'correct' way to play (25% min investment to make an impact) is wildly different from what you expect/what the AI does (many categories with 6-20% investment), it indicates an issue. Part of it is UI, because \"0.0000793\" is not a value that should be used to tell a player anything ever, but part of it is just that the magnitudes aren't intuitive. Also, magnitude wise, don't even get me started on antimatter. Oh, worth mentioning performance degrades lategame.\n\nThe fine, could be improved: Space resources were very disconnected from earth, and while it was interesting that different resources 'peak' at different points in the game, it was weird to have boost be nearly useless at some point. Depending on your system roll you might not notice some resources existed. It would be cool to be able to sell resources to pay for events as they were happening, for example, or to let you substitute resources for direct investments. \nI also got the feeling like some factions cared more about some resources than others, if that's actually the case I'd love to be able to see those differences. Diplomacy between human factions was OK, but I'd love more depth there - the ability to make alliances, or make peace with a faction (where lore relevant).\n\nThe particularly good: I really enjoyed how every strategic layer had an entire game's worth of depth involved. Every time some new section of the game opened I was very impressed that it wasn't just a shallow addition, but an entire new Thing to Do. I loved seeing Jupiter and sending probes but discovering how the aliens reacted to settlement. I think the timescales in the game (even if they're silly for IRL development) felt very impactful - the changing council cycle, or the pace of events in general. The international diplomacy was good and interesting. I also liked the idea of the priority system, even with the issues listed above. Ship design was fun, and the autodesigner was good enough to start from. The entire early-midgame alien investigation portion was a highlight, I wish it didn't disappear at a certain point (when it became pointless to interact with them at all). I also liked the flow of human factions starting as major opponents before the danger of the aliens increases. The game also did a great job of allowing player comebacks from dramatic losses if played smartly.\n\nOverall a game I'm going to happily play again in the future after some more time in the oven. It feels like an Aurora4x made by people who actually wanted to make a game that was fun!",

      "review": "A fun and unique game, but it has its issues. The system for designing ships is by far the game's best feature. \r\nNow on to specific issues:\r\n1- Balancing. The Aliens are simply too strong, on Earth but especially in space. Playing as the servants, the only real challenge was abandoning nations fast enough to not completely overload control point capacity! In order to build up a fleet that can stand against the Aliens, you really need several sites on the Jovian and Saturnian moons. But the aliens absolutely refuse to let this happen, even when avoiding direct conflict with them, having a small space presence, and researching all the misdirection techs. You kinda just gotta keep throwing colony/assault ships at the wall until you get lucky and one gets through. Until the very late game, you're also pretty much entirely at the alien's mercy in space. Their ships are far more powerful, and also far more mobile so hit and run tactics are a no-go.\r\n2- Space combat. It's pretty hard to control the ships in 3d during combat. Essentially the only options are to hold position or let AI control (and the AI can be pretty dumb)\r\n3- AI factions don't seem to do much. They'll have enourmous resource stockpiles, but engage minimally in building fleets and fighting other factions (which can be particularly annoying when the Servants are rapidly closing on victory and no AI seems to be doing anything about it). And they'll have like 50k of a resource and maybe be willing to trade you a few hundred if you're lucky. \r\n4- The research tree is massive, and it's not very intuitive what to research next. I like the amount of research available but until several playthroughs it's almost impossible to know how to get to cruical tech (such as point-defense arrays). \r\n5- Lack of scenarios. Hopefully the 2070 mode will be a great improvement but I want to be able to start with some technological parity with the aliens and fight them off rather than spending 50 hours wrangling control of the Earth first. \r\n6- If you crackdown on a point you should be given priority to taking it back. It's extremely annoying to have a point lost, and you immediately react to take it back, only for a faction that you're at peace with to take it first (in the same mission phase) and now you can't take back your country without breaking that truce.\r\nNow that seems like a lot but I will still say overall a good game and I look forward to how it will continue to improve.",

If you are interested in 4X games, and have an inkling of interest in astronomy -- I recommend this game wholeheartedly! \r\n\r\nA great game as is, with updates to come. The game is mechanically rich. Many different ways to play in terms of strategies in the micro and macro venues (e.g., taking over the world via espionage or warfare, choice of fleet loadout). I can easily see the game being adapted with total conversions (e.g., Halo) that use these great mechanics. \r\n\r\nInteresting story with some twists along the way. Some creative factions in there such as Initiative, Academy and Protectorate along with the more conventional factions. Though, the Protectorate's goal is not especially compelling and so I cannot see myself connecting with them.\r\n\r\nBuilding up your fiefdom on Earth and in space is good fun. Combat is interesting and offers many options. Allowing the AI to control your ships is also welcome for those of us that are not great at micro or are playing on slow hardware.\r\n\r\nThe modelling of the solar system is also fantastic -- if you are interested in astronomy you will dig it, and, it is an impressive mechanic for gameplay that further serves to offer you choice on how you build your solar empire. There are many different stellar bodies with modelling based on reality. Kuiper Belt objects are also modelled with some creative liberty -- because in the real world we don't know what their surface looks like -- but the devs have created a diverse set of appearances for them regardless!\r\n\r\nThe inclusion of lesser-known political ideas such as the United Arab League, East Africa Federation and Westralia also are engaging as speculative fiction that is tied to our real world.\r\n\r\nImprovements to be made in a few area. UI/UX needs work. It is often a bit clunky in key elements (e.g., cannot auto-organise Habs/Army/Fleet list nor can you organise it by dragging, menus such as the Habs/Intel don't remember where you were if you close them). Story voice acting and events also seem to die off once you unlock your victory condition, those were a fun part of the early game so it is a shame they vanish in the latter stretch. Enemy overworld AI can be funky in that they engage in endless pointless wars, and Humanity First especially really seems to struggle at establishing any firm foundation on Earth and instead end up limited to poor peripheral countries. Also, being able to change over an outpost from manned to automated would be a convenient addition, instead of having to dismantle it and then find the relevant asteroid, then resettling it. More explanation in-game of certain mechanics would be useful as well (e.g., the speed of a councillor mission being related to success chance, thrust vs delta, how control points are allocated after a coup).\r\n\r\nOverall, a great game that kicked off Hooded Horse!

      "review": "The best I will say about this game is 'It's fine', and that is in the absolute kindest, most charitable context I can give it. It looks really cool and has great theming, but in some ways it doesn't match up well against idle games. I tried really hard to be interested and excited by the game but it never actually did any work to meet me there, so after I gave it 35 hours I turned it off and didn't feel *anything* but relief. Games should be fun. This is not, this is work that tells you its fun, but is actually just work. The graphics are functional and serve the purpose they need to. The interface is mostly numbers that does a terrible job why any of them might matter, how any could be helpful, etc.\n\nIf you want an extremely (and I cannot emphasize this enough) slow game, this is one for you. The closest comparison I have in my entire gaming experience would be like, an idle game like cookie clicker, or one of those Starcraft custom maps where you don't move or explore, but you just stand in a single spot and watch a number change while zerglings run single file at a marine who kills them faster than they spawn, with the idea being \"Hey look you're making progress because number go up, ignore that you haven't actually done anything\". There is not a word in English that does a good job communicating exactly how plodding, meandering, and without passion this game feels, and how boring it is for it. I honestly don't know if I've made any real progress in my game. I don't know if I've made good decisions, l have *no feedback* whatsoever and I have played for a decent amount of time. I have no idea if the choices I've made are good or bad, I have no idea if I should be doing other things, and I played the game for nearly THREE DOZEN HOURS. I have restarted twice in that time, the first after about two hours, the second after maybe ten? That is not a plot that moves at 'a measured pace' or 'a slow burn' that is \"A plot that does not respect your time\". \n\nThe game does an awful, awful, awful job providing any feedback to the player beyond telling you your faction goal right away, with some sort of assumption that that's all people need? I get it, some people are going to love the idea of an incredibly slow game with zero help, zero feedback, and a goal you will never see any actual progress towards until you've already spent two to three dozen hours in the game doing 'stuff'. I am not that person, and I was recommended this game because I like strategy games. This is not a strategy game like Europa universalis. In EU if you make a decision, you can make major, immediate changes to your game state in seconds, and you will know if you fucked up or succeeded within minutes. In this game, you will not find out if those decisions mattered *maybe ever*.\n\nI have no emotional attachment to any of the decisions I've made in the game, and I think the only reason I would is because the game takes so long that its trying to force you to by exposure instead of any of the other reasons you might like a game. \n\nDon't buy this. Or at least, only buy it on sale. It's just not fun to play. It might be fun to win, but if I can't even see a flicker of that light after 35 hours why would I stick around to find out?",

      "review": "I really, really wanted to like this game. But it's just fundamentally not good. I almost feel bad for not liking it, because it's sort of a monkey's paw for me. It has all the influences I want and almost all of the design goals I would find very intriguing, and caused me to buy it in the first place. But it has other design goals too, and those goals simply lead to bad places. I do not believe the game can be made better through updates or that it even had a chance to be good in the first place, because if you perfectly executed the core design philosophy of this game, it would still be unfun on a mechanical level. But we're not even there, because they didn't execute the rest of it particularly well either.\r\n\r\nIt's primarily a waiting simulator where you roll dice and get shit results constantly while watching the AI theoretically do the same thing, but actually it's quite apparent that it's both cheating and handicapped in order to respond to how well or poorly you're rolling. It is very obvious that XCOM modders worked on this game and it does not reflect well on it. There is very little in the way of strategy and very much in the way of performing the same, incredibly basic, obviously optimized tasks repeatedly for hours and seeing if the gambling machine allows them to work or not. You are not rewarded for clever thinking, you are simply existing and seeing what happens.\r\n\r\nThe writing is just not up to par. I appreciate the influences it takes and the ambition it had, and there are interesting ideas, but the characters are not interesting, and it does not really delve deeply into the concepts it brings up. The aliens are uninteresting and there is not a hint of intriguing mystery to be found. If there is some sort of twist that I've thusfar missed, I do not really care, because I've gotten no reason to be that invested in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe aesthetics are honestly poor. The music is forgettable, the 3D models are laughable, the voice acting ranges from endearingly amateur to gratingly bad. The globes are not fun to look at, and the mapmodes are downright terrible. This is a game you would want to play on your second monitor, not just because of the repetitive and disengaging gameplay, but because it physically hurts to look at.\r\n\r\nAgain, I almost feel bad for being so harsh on the game. I appreciate that it was made by a small, passionate, and talented team. But really I don't feel the need to pull any punches, because I don't feel like any of this is the result of a botched execution. I think this game IS, more or less, what they wanted it to be. Obviously they would've paid for better art if they could, but I think the art DIRECTION is poor, and I think they wanted the direction that way. I think the writing is poor, and I think they like it that way. I think the gameplay is abysmal, and I think that it's exactly what they wanted. I think this is a rare case of an early access game ready to go 1.0 as a complete product. But its complete form does not impress.",

The RTS phases are bad, the controls are wonky, slow, and I'd rather just auto-resolve every combat encounter in the game. Many others must feel the same, as the Steam achievement stats show that barely anyone has finished a single playthrough, or even gotten very far into the space stage.\n\nUntil that gap between the grand strategy and tactical sections of the game are smoothed out, I don't think this game is worth picking up.",

It looks really cool and has great theming, but in some ways it doesn't match up well against idle games. I tried really hard to be interested and excited by the game but it never actually did any work to meet me there, so after I gave it 35 hours I turned it off and didn't feel *anything* but relief. Games should be fun. This is not, this is work that tells you its fun, but is actually just work. The graphics are functional and serve the purpose they need to. The interface is mostly numbers that does a terrible job why any of them might matter, how any could be helpful, etc.\n\nIf you want an extremely (and I cannot emphasize this enough) slow game, this is one for you. The closest comparison I have in my entire gaming experience would be like, an idle game like cookie clicker, or one of those Starcraft custom maps where you don't move or explore, but you just stand in a single spot and watch a number change while zerglings run single file at a marine who kills them faster than they spawn, with the idea being \"Hey look you're making progress because number go up, ignore that you haven't actually done anything\". There is not a word in English that does a good job communicating exactly how plodding, meandering, and without passion this game feels, and how boring it is for it. I honestly don't know if I've made any real progress in my game. I don't know if I've made good decisions, l have *no feedback* whatsoever and I have played for a decent amount of time. I have no idea if the choices I've made are good or bad, I have no idea if I should be doing other things, and I played the game for nearly THREE DOZEN HOURS. I have restarted twice in that time, the first after about two hours, the second after maybe ten? That is not a plot that moves at 'a measured pace' or 'a slow burn' that is \"A plot that does not respect your time\". \n\nThe game does an awful, awful, awful job providing any feedback to the player beyond telling you your faction goal right away, with some sort of assumption that that's all people need? I get it, some people are going to love the idea of an incredibly slow game with zero help, zero feedback, and a goal you will never see any actual progress towards until you've already spent two to three dozen hours in the game doing 'stuff'. I am not that person, and I was recommended this game because I like strategy games. This is not a strategy game like Europa universalis. In EU if you make a decision, you can make major, immediate changes to your game state in seconds, and you will know if you fucked up or succeeded within minutes. In this game, you will not find out if those decisions mattered *maybe ever*.\n\nI have no emotional attachment to any of the decisions I've made in the game, and I think the only reason I would is because the game takes so long that its trying to force you to by exposure instead of any of the other reasons you might like a game. \n\nDon't buy this. Or at least, only buy it on sale. It's just not fun to play. It might be fun to win, but if I can't even see a flicker of that light after 35 hours why would I stick around to find out?",

There are mechanics that just seem to be pushing the player in two directions at once and that's before talking about the issues with clarity in equipment descriptions. The sheer number of engines, generators, weapons etc to try and research is gargantuan and the design decision to have 80% be flat useless unless they're a pre-requisite to something else is... a choice. \n\nBeyond the balance problems, are issues just with the way the game is designed as turn based but not turn based. Time pauses when you are planning your councilors next move, or when you get a notification like one of your stations being destroyed, and then it resumes and you can move armies and ships around which have travel time etc. There have been QOL improvements I can see from old builds to be sure, but why you can't cancel a fleet  transfer order even just in orbit around earth is wild, and the fact there isn't a \"rebuild hab\" option when one of your stations inevitably gets blown up is *baffling*. Clicking through remaking stations or having a thousand templates to search through is not my idea of fun. As the game progresses it starts feeling like I'm just left clicking continue on notifications over and over until something meaningful happens.\n\nIt feels like you have to read the latest forums or watch youtube to get a feel for how the current branch of the game plays before you even start a save, and the advise those forums give you will be outdated with the next update. I hope it improves by \"1.0\", I really want to love this game, and will probably keep trying to figure it out for a while longer, but to everyone else, unless you enjoy pain and frustration, maybe look elsewhere. - edit, did try for probably too much longer, and there is no shot I could come close to finishing the game in another 30-40 hours most likely.

It has all the influences I want and almost all of the design goals I would find very intriguing, and caused me to buy it in the first place. But it has other design goals too, and those goals simply lead to bad places. I do not believe the game can be made better through updates or that it even had a chance to be good in the first place, because if you perfectly executed the core design philosophy of this game, it would still be unfun on a mechanical level. But we're not even there, because they didn't execute the rest of it particularly well either.\r\n\r\nIt's primarily a waiting simulator where you roll dice and get shit results constantly while watching the AI theoretically do the same thing, but actually it's quite apparent that it's both cheating and handicapped in order to respond to how well or poorly you're rolling. It is very obvious that XCOM modders worked on this game and it does not reflect well on it. There is very little in the way of strategy and very much in the way of performing the same, incredibly basic, obviously optimized tasks repeatedly for hours and seeing if the gambling machine allows them to work or not. You are not rewarded for clever thinking, you are simply existing and seeing what happens.\r\n\r\nThe writing is just not up to par. I appreciate the influences it takes and the ambition it had, and there are interesting ideas, but the characters are not interesting, and it does not really delve deeply into the concepts it brings up. The aliens are uninteresting and there is not a hint of intriguing mystery to be found. If there is some sort of twist that I've thusfar missed, I do not really care, because I've gotten no reason to be that invested in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe aesthetics are honestly poor. The music is forgettable, the 3D models are laughable, the voice acting ranges from endearingly amateur to gratingly bad. The globes are not fun to look at, and the mapmodes are downright terrible. This is a game you would want to play on your second monitor, not just because of the repetitive and disengaging gameplay, but because it physically hurts to look at.\r\n\r\nAgain, I almost feel bad for being so harsh on the game. I appreciate that it was made by a small, passionate, and talented team. But really I don't feel the need to pull any punches, because I don't feel like any of this is the result of a botched execution. I think this game IS, more or less, what they wanted it to be. Obviously they would've paid for better art if they could, but I think the art DIRECTION is poor, and I think they wanted the direction that way. I think the writing is poor, and I think they like it that way. I think the gameplay is abysmal, and I think that it's exactly what they wanted. I think this is a rare case of an early access game ready to go 1.0 as a complete product. But its complete form does not impress.",

Over successive rebalances, patches, and new versions as they work towards release (now at Release Candidate 1 at the time of writing), it honestly feels like the Developers are playing [b]against[/b] the players more than anything.\n\nThis is supposed to be hard. That makes sense. A technologically superior enemy of this kind should absolutely wipe the floor with you for a long time, and you should need to be very smart in order to survive to the point you can start to contend even your own orbits... but the constant frustration I have is that [b]nothing works anymore[/b] and if it does, it will get patched out soon. \n\nAny time the players find a decent strategy (not too overpowered, not too gamey), it gets nerfed. This is due to the back and forth between a diehard minority of experienced gamers with thousands of hours in TI trying to find \"the way\" to win, which the developers then nerf and patch out... again and again. That is [b]not the spirit of the game[/b] - if after 1000 hours, you find a way to min max and win, congrats! You get a medal. \n\nPavonis, you need to remember you're making a game for the wider \"hardcore strategy\" audience who don't have 1000 hours - the approach to this game should not be so narrow and continuously narrower because a tiny minority have found that next new min/max approach to win. I come back periodically and every time the player base finds an approach that may work, the developers nerf it and buff the aliens. [b]Are you making a game for your players, or making a game against your players[/b]? It feels like the latter.\n\nAs an example, even with the max in Targeting Computers, the Alien ECM has become so strong that your ships will just float there useless and get blown up, even when you're floating by each other, as your missiles [b]and shipboard weapons[/b] will be disabled. Additionally, it used to be that with the right tech level, well armoured defense arrays with mid-tier weapons tech (green arc laser and coilgun) could at least contend against a small handful of alien ships, but it's like they're only for show with no actual power. You might as well not build them, were it not for the harassing human AI factions.\n\nThe UI is clunky sometimes, but that can be overlooked, because honestly this is a very unique concept for a game... but the \"no fun allowed, suffer instead\" again and again with the rebalances and the nerfs is maddening. You have to relearn the game every time you come back because if something works, the devs will get rid of it.\n\nSave the hundreds of hours you'd need to try and find the [b]only acceptable[/b] 0.1% min max approach to \"win\" and go play something else that gives you fun instead of frustration.",

If not, you will struggle, lose, and rage quit.\nThe worst part is that your mistake was a few hours ago, so you basically have to play the last 4-6 hours again. \n\nNot to mention the other factions feel like helpless idiots, so you spend the game 1v2 with the servants and aliens (as any faction basically), and the others are there as filler, or to troll you on a purge. \n\nCredit where credit is due, the two tier research system is interesting, the ship design properly follows hard sci-fi.

However they are completely useless in actually fighting the aliens and act more against the player than anything, EXCEPT if you are playing the Servants in which case the other factions are completely irrelevant and an easy win for the aliens is guaranteed.  Even by RC 1 they still don't build any decent stations or colonies, still don't prioritize mining and space resources and in previous versions would eventually just stop building anything in space even with 60K (600 kilotons) of each resource in storage.  In RC 1 they do build ships but I've seen autoresolves on fleets of 20 ships from corvettes up to destropyers with artemis torpedos, UV arc lasers, MK 3 railguns lose to a single alien destroyer and two gunships.  I have never seen any computer-controlled human faction win any fights vs aliens.  Also, computer-controlled human factions still have far too low research value to do much of anything past 2030.  \n\nAlien surveillance/abductions were always a threat, but now they are so accelerated even on normal campaign difficulty that no amount of defenses against alien influence research can protect your nations from simply being stolen with no effort by the aliens in 2033.  Oh, and they no longer use destroyers, but cruisers for surveillance missions, with multiple laser/PD escorts making the suicide torpedo ship runs unusable.  Also, aliens in the RC1 version on normal build far more ships, far more quickly than they did in my previous brutal campaigns, while space mining sites AND space mining orgs have been HEAVILY nerfed to where you're barely able to do anything in space at all.  This is total bs.  \n\nThe devs are only listening to the few elite players who keep screaming about how so many things are too good for the player and should be nerfed.  Oh, and they are using the Helldivers dev playbook of using \"realism\" against the player in game balance, but somehow never allowing \"realism\" in favor of the player, as a cheap excuse for artificial difficulty.\n\nAlso, in the research tree you'll find research for all sorts of ship parts, weapons, reactor cores and drives.  Nearly all of these are noob traps to \"gotcha\" new players.  Sure the tungsten resistojet is cheap, but on the lightest ship it is still completely useless - you won't be able to go anywhere or even move with any sort of speed if somehow you could.  And the dusty plasma drive is a complete joke - a drive that only uses fissiles as fuel, with an acceleration so low it would take months to get a stipped down gunship out of Earth orbit, never mind getting to anywhere else.  The fissiles nerf is such a huge hit that I have a hard time justifying drives which use fissiles even as 1% of their fuel now.  This hits hard with fusion drives in particular, where for some inexplicable reason, human FUSION drives were nerfed to require up to 10% of the fuel load to be FISSIONABLE material.  Oh, but of course the alien fusion drives magically only need water still.\n\nA lot of the early non-fission drives are just there to waste your research points.  Missiles are only there to waste your research points.  Hypergolic torpedoes are only there to waste your research points.  First-generation lasers are only there to waste your research points.  Oh, and in late-game, the plasma weapons are only there to waste your research points.  You think that you're getting an advanced end-game weapon?  Think again!  It got nerfed into being so completely useless, even MK 1 railguns are better - they'll at least be absorbed by a laser instead of your ship taking that laser hit.  Supposedly they stip armor off alien hulls but I never saw that actually happen - you're better off overwhelming them with kinetics or your own lasers instead.  As part of the so-called armor sttripping that doesn't actually work, they only deal 20% of the listedbase damage as actual damage... which is absorbed by the armor that isn't actually being stripped by the other 80%.  But of course the alien plasma never got nerfed.\n\nI can keep going on but why bother.  If somehow you find something that works, DO NOT tell the devs, they will patch it out or nerf it so hard you can't use it anymore.",

It looks really cool and has great theming, but in some ways it doesn't match up well against idle games. I tried really hard to be interested and excited by the game but it never actually did any work to meet me there, so after I gave it 35 hours I turned it off and didn't feel *anything* but relief. Games should be fun. This is not, this is work that tells you its fun, but is actually just work. The graphics are functional and serve the purpose they need to. The interface is mostly numbers that does a terrible job why any of them might matter, how any could be helpful, etc.\n\nIf you want an extremely (and I cannot emphasize this enough) slow game, this is one for you. The closest comparison I have in my entire gaming experience would be like, an idle game like cookie clicker, or one of those Starcraft custom maps where you don't move or explore, but you just stand in a single spot and watch a number change while zerglings run single file at a marine who kills them faster than they spawn, with the idea being \"Hey look you're making progress because number go up, ignore that you haven't actually done anything\". There is not a word in English that does a good job communicating exactly how plodding, meandering, and without passion this game feels, and how boring it is for it. I honestly don't know if I've made any real progress in my game. I don't know if I've made good decisions, l have *no feedback* whatsoever and I have played for a decent amount of time. I have no idea if the choices I've made are good or bad, I have no idea if I should be doing other things, and I played the game for nearly THREE DOZEN HOURS. I have restarted twice in that time, the first after about two hours, the second after maybe ten? That is not a plot that moves at 'a measured pace' or 'a slow burn' that is \"A plot that does not respect your time\". \n\nThe game does an awful, awful, awful job providing any feedback to the player beyond telling you your faction goal right away, with some sort of assumption that that's all people need? I get it, some people are going to love the idea of an incredibly slow game with zero help, zero feedback, and a goal you will never see any actual progress towards until you've already spent two to three dozen hours in the game doing 'stuff'. I am not that person, and I was recommended this game because I like strategy games. This is not a strategy game like Europa universalis. In EU if you make a decision, you can make major, immediate changes to your game state in seconds, and you will know if you fucked up or succeeded within minutes. In this game, you will not find out if those decisions mattered *maybe ever*.\n\nI have no emotional attachment to any of the decisions I've made in the game, and I think the only reason I would is because the game takes so long that its trying to force you to by exposure instead of any of the other reasons you might like a game. \n\nDon't buy this. Or at least, only buy it on sale. It's just not fun to play. It might be fun to win, but if I can't even see a flicker of that light after 35 hours why would I stick around to find out?",

There are mechanics that just seem to be pushing the player in two directions at once and that's before talking about the issues with clarity in equipment descriptions. The sheer number of engines, generators, weapons etc to try and research is gargantuan and the design decision to have 80% be flat useless unless they're a pre-requisite to something else is... a choice. \n\nBeyond the balance problems, are issues just with the way the game is designed as turn based but not turn based. Time pauses when you are planning your councilors next move, or when you get a notification like one of your stations being destroyed, and then it resumes and you can move armies and ships around which have travel time etc. There have been QOL improvements I can see from old builds to be sure, but why you can't cancel a fleet  transfer order even just in orbit around earth is wild, and the fact there isn't a \"rebuild hab\" option when one of your stations inevitably gets blown up is *baffling*. Clicking through remaking stations or having a thousand templates to search through is not my idea of fun. As the game progresses it starts feeling like I'm just left clicking continue on notifications over and over until something meaningful happens.\n\nIt feels like you have to read the latest forums or watch youtube to get a feel for how the current branch of the game plays before you even start a save, and the advise those forums give you will be outdated with the next update. I hope it improves by \"1.0\", I really want to love this game, and will probably keep trying to figure it out for a while longer, but to everyone else, unless you enjoy pain and frustration, maybe look elsewhere. - edit, did try for probably too much longer, and there is no shot I could come close to finishing the game in another 30-40 hours most likely.

It has all the influences I want and almost all of the design goals I would find very intriguing, and caused me to buy it in the first place. But it has other design goals too, and those goals simply lead to bad places. I do not believe the game can be made better through updates or that it even had a chance to be good in the first place, because if you perfectly executed the core design philosophy of this game, it would still be unfun on a mechanical level. But we're not even there, because they didn't execute the rest of it particularly well either.\r\n\r\nIt's primarily a waiting simulator where you roll dice and get shit results constantly while watching the AI theoretically do the same thing, but actually it's quite apparent that it's both cheating and handicapped in order to respond to how well or poorly you're rolling. It is very obvious that XCOM modders worked on this game and it does not reflect well on it. There is very little in the way of strategy and very much in the way of performing the same, incredibly basic, obviously optimized tasks repeatedly for hours and seeing if the gambling machine allows them to work or not. You are not rewarded for clever thinking, you are simply existing and seeing what happens.\r\n\r\nThe writing is just not up to par. I appreciate the influences it takes and the ambition it had, and there are interesting ideas, but the characters are not interesting, and it does not really delve deeply into the concepts it brings up. The aliens are uninteresting and there is not a hint of intriguing mystery to be found. If there is some sort of twist that I've thusfar missed, I do not really care, because I've gotten no reason to be that invested in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe aesthetics are honestly poor. The music is forgettable, the 3D models are laughable, the voice acting ranges from endearingly amateur to gratingly bad. The globes are not fun to look at, and the mapmodes are downright terrible. This is a game you would want to play on your second monitor, not just because of the repetitive and disengaging gameplay, but because it physically hurts to look at.\r\n\r\nAgain, I almost feel bad for being so harsh on the game. I appreciate that it was made by a small, passionate, and talented team. But really I don't feel the need to pull any punches, because I don't feel like any of this is the result of a botched execution. I think this game IS, more or less, what they wanted it to be. Obviously they would've paid for better art if they could, but I think the art DIRECTION is poor, and I think they wanted the direction that way. I think the writing is poor, and I think they like it that way. I think the gameplay is abysmal, and I think that it's exactly what they wanted. I think this is a rare case of an early access game ready to go 1.0 as a complete product. But its complete form does not impress.",

Over successive rebalances, patches, and new versions as they work towards release (now at Release Candidate 1 at the time of writing), it honestly feels like the Developers are playing [b]against[/b] the players more than anything.\n\nThis is supposed to be hard. That makes sense. A technologically superior enemy of this kind should absolutely wipe the floor with you for a long time, and you should need to be very smart in order to survive to the point you can start to contend even your own orbits... but the constant frustration I have is that [b]nothing works anymore[/b] and if it does, it will get patched out soon. \n\nAny time the players find a decent strategy (not too overpowered, not too gamey), it gets nerfed. This is due to the back and forth between a diehard minority of experienced gamers with thousands of hours in TI trying to find \"the way\" to win, which the developers then nerf and patch out... again and again. That is [b]not the spirit of the game[/b] - if after 1000 hours, you find a way to min max and win, congrats! You get a medal. \n\nPavonis, you need to remember you're making a game for the wider \"hardcore strategy\" audience who don't have 1000 hours - the approach to this game should not be so narrow and continuously narrower because a tiny minority have found that next new min/max approach to win. I come back periodically and every time the player base finds an approach that may work, the developers nerf it and buff the aliens. [b]Are you making a game for your players, or making a game against your players[/b]? It feels like the latter.\n\nAs an example, even with the max in Targeting Computers, the Alien ECM has become so strong that your ships will just float there useless and get blown up, even when you're floating by each other, as your missiles [b]and shipboard weapons[/b] will be disabled. Additionally, it used to be that with the right tech level, well armoured defense arrays with mid-tier weapons tech (green arc laser and coilgun) could at least contend against a small handful of alien ships, but it's like they're only for show with no actual power. You might as well not build them, were it not for the harassing human AI factions.\n\nThe UI is clunky sometimes, but that can be overlooked, because honestly this is a very unique concept for a game... but the \"no fun allowed, suffer instead\" again and again with the rebalances and the nerfs is maddening. You have to relearn the game every time you come back because if something works, the devs will get rid of it.\n\nSave the hundreds of hours you'd need to try and find the [b]only acceptable[/b] 0.1% min max approach to \"win\" and go play something else that gives you fun instead of frustration.",

If not, you will struggle, lose, and rage quit.\nThe worst part is that your mistake was a few hours ago, so you basically have to play the last 4-6 hours again. \n\nNot to mention the other factions feel like helpless idiots, so you spend the game 1v2 with the servants and aliens (as any faction basically), and the others are there as filler, or to troll you on a purge. \n\nCredit where credit is due, the two tier research system is interesting, the ship design properly follows hard sci-fi.

However they are completely useless in actually fighting the aliens and act more against the player than anything, EXCEPT if you are playing the Servants in which case the other factions are completely irrelevant and an easy win for the aliens is guaranteed.  Even by RC 1 they still don't build any decent stations or colonies, still don't prioritize mining and space resources and in previous versions would eventually just stop building anything in space even with 60K (600 kilotons) of each resource in storage.  In RC 1 they do build ships but I've seen autoresolves on fleets of 20 ships from corvettes up to destropyers with artemis torpedos, UV arc lasers, MK 3 railguns lose to a single alien destroyer and two gunships.  I have never seen any computer-controlled human faction win any fights vs aliens.  Also, computer-controlled human factions still have far too low research value to do much of anything past 2030.  \n\nAlien surveillance/abductions were always a threat, but now they are so accelerated even on normal campaign difficulty that no amount of defenses against alien influence research can protect your nations from simply being stolen with no effort by the aliens in 2033.  Oh, and they no longer use destroyers, but cruisers for surveillance missions, with multiple laser/PD escorts making the suicide torpedo ship runs unusable.  Also, aliens in the RC1 version on normal build far more ships, far more quickly than they did in my previous brutal campaigns, while space mining sites AND space mining orgs have been HEAVILY nerfed to where you're barely able to do anything in space at all.  This is total bs.  \n\nThe devs are only listening to the few elite players who keep screaming about how so many things are too good for the player and should be nerfed.  Oh, and they are using the Helldivers dev playbook of using \"realism\" against the player in game balance, but somehow never allowing \"realism\" in favor of the player, as a cheap excuse for artificial difficulty.\n\nAlso, in the research tree you'll find research for all sorts of ship parts, weapons, reactor cores and drives.  Nearly all of these are noob traps to \"gotcha\" new players.  Sure the tungsten resistojet is cheap, but on the lightest ship it is still completely useless - you won't be able to go anywhere or even move with any sort of speed if somehow you could.  And the dusty plasma drive is a complete joke - a drive that only uses fissiles as fuel, with an acceleration so low it would take months to get a stipped down gunship out of Earth orbit, never mind getting to anywhere else.  The fissiles nerf is such a huge hit that I have a hard time justifying drives which use fissiles even as 1% of their fuel now.  This hits hard with fusion drives in particular, where for some inexplicable reason, human FUSION drives were nerfed to require up to 10% of the fuel load to be FISSIONABLE material.  Oh, but of course the alien fusion drives magically only need water still.\n\nA lot of the early non-fission drives are just there to waste your research points.  Missiles are only there to waste your research points.  Hypergolic torpedoes are only there to waste your research points.  First-generation lasers are only there to waste your research points.  Oh, and in late-game, the plasma weapons are only there to waste your research points.  You think that you're getting an advanced end-game weapon?  Think again!  It got nerfed into being so completely useless, even MK 1 railguns are better - they'll at least be absorbed by a laser instead of your ship taking that laser hit.  Supposedly they stip armor off alien hulls but I never saw that actually happen - you're better off overwhelming them with kinetics or your own lasers instead.  As part of the so-called armor sttripping that doesn't actually work, they only deal 20% of the listedbase damage as actual damage... which is absorbed by the armor that isn't actually being stripped by the other 80%.  But of course the alien plasma never got nerfed.\n\nI can keep going on but why bother.  If somehow you find something that works, DO NOT tell the devs, they will patch it out or nerf it so hard you can't use it anymore.",

Many others must feel the same, as the Steam achievement stats show that barely anyone has finished a single playthrough, or even gotten very far into the space stage.\n\nUntil that gap between the grand strategy and tactical sections of the game are smoothed out, I don't think this game is worth picking up.",

      "review": "The best I will say about this game is 'It's fine', and that is in the absolute kindest, most charitable context I can give it. It looks really cool and has great theming, but in some ways it doesn't match up well against idle games. I tried really hard to be interested and excited by the game but it never actually did any work to meet me there, so after I gave it 35 hours I turned it off and didn't feel *anything* but relief. Games should be fun. This is not, this is work that tells you its fun, but is actually just work. The graphics are functional and serve the purpose they need to. The interface is mostly numbers that does a terrible job why any of them might matter, how any could be helpful, etc.\n\nIf you want an extremely (and I cannot emphasize this enough) slow game, this is one for you. The closest comparison I have in my entire gaming experience would be like, an idle game like cookie clicker, or one of those Starcraft custom maps where you don't move or explore, but you just stand in a single spot and watch a number change while zerglings run single file at a marine who kills them faster than they spawn, with the idea being \"Hey look you're making progress because number go up, ignore that you haven't actually done anything\". There is not a word in English that does a good job communicating exactly how plodding, meandering, and without passion this game feels, and how boring it is for it. I honestly don't know if I've made any real progress in my game. I don't know if I've made good decisions, l have *no feedback* whatsoever and I have played for a decent amount of time. I have no idea if the choices I've made are good or bad, I have no idea if I should be doing other things, and I played the game for nearly THREE DOZEN HOURS. I have restarted twice in that time, the first after about two hours, the second after maybe ten? That is not a plot that moves at 'a measured pace' or 'a slow burn' that is \"A plot that does not respect your time\". \n\nThe game does an awful, awful, awful job providing any feedback to the player beyond telling you your faction goal right away, with some sort of assumption that that's all people need? I get it, some people are going to love the idea of an incredibly slow game with zero help, zero feedback, and a goal you will never see any actual progress towards until you've already spent two to three dozen hours in the game doing 'stuff'. I am not that person, and I was recommended this game because I like strategy games. This is not a strategy game like Europa universalis. In EU if you make a decision, you can make major, immediate changes to your game state in seconds, and you will know if you fucked up or succeeded within minutes. In this game, you will not find out if those decisions mattered *maybe ever*.\n\nI have no emotional attachment to any of the decisions I've made in the game, and I think the only reason I would is because the game takes so long that its trying to force you to by exposure instead of any of the other reasons you might like a game. \n\nDon't buy this. Or at least, only buy it on sale. It's just not fun to play. It might be fun to win, but if I can't even see a flicker of that light after 35 hours why would I stick around to find out?",

      "review": "This is simultaneously the coolest and most frustrating game I think I have ever played, and couldn't recommend it in it's current state. \n\nThere are a lot of \"player traps\" that you have no real way of knowing about or even figuring out (if you do figure out what you did) your mistake for hours and hours after you've done it. There are mechanics that just seem to be pushing the player in two directions at once and that's before talking about the issues with clarity in equipment descriptions. The sheer number of engines, generators, weapons etc to try and research is gargantuan and the design decision to have 80% be flat useless unless they're a pre-requisite to something else is... a choice. \n\nBeyond the balance problems, are issues just with the way the game is designed as turn based but not turn based. Time pauses when you are planning your councilors next move, or when you get a notification like one of your stations being destroyed, and then it resumes and you can move armies and ships around which have travel time etc. There have been QOL improvements I can see from old builds to be sure, but why you can't cancel a fleet  transfer order even just in orbit around earth is wild, and the fact there isn't a \"rebuild hab\" option when one of your stations inevitably gets blown up is *baffling*. Clicking through remaking stations or having a thousand templates to search through is not my idea of fun. As the game progresses it starts feeling like I'm just left clicking continue on notifications over and over until something meaningful happens.\n\nIt feels like you have to read the latest forums or watch youtube to get a feel for how the current branch of the game plays before you even start a save, and the advise those forums give you will be outdated with the next update. I hope it improves by \"1.0\", I really want to love this game, and will probably keep trying to figure it out for a while longer, but to everyone else, unless you enjoy pain and frustration, maybe look elsewhere. - edit, did try for probably too much longer, and there is no shot I could come close to finishing the game in another 30-40 hours most likely. Putting this down, maybe permanently until there are some big changes.",

      "review": "I really, really wanted to like this game. But it's just fundamentally not good. I almost feel bad for not liking it, because it's sort of a monkey's paw for me. It has all the influences I want and almost all of the design goals I would find very intriguing, and caused me to buy it in the first place. But it has other design goals too, and those goals simply lead to bad places. I do not believe the game can be made better through updates or that it even had a chance to be good in the first place, because if you perfectly executed the core design philosophy of this game, it would still be unfun on a mechanical level. But we're not even there, because they didn't execute the rest of it particularly well either.\r\n\r\nIt's primarily a waiting simulator where you roll dice and get shit results constantly while watching the AI theoretically do the same thing, but actually it's quite apparent that it's both cheating and handicapped in order to respond to how well or poorly you're rolling. It is very obvious that XCOM modders worked on this game and it does not reflect well on it. There is very little in the way of strategy and very much in the way of performing the same, incredibly basic, obviously optimized tasks repeatedly for hours and seeing if the gambling machine allows them to work or not. You are not rewarded for clever thinking, you are simply existing and seeing what happens.\r\n\r\nThe writing is just not up to par. I appreciate the influences it takes and the ambition it had, and there are interesting ideas, but the characters are not interesting, and it does not really delve deeply into the concepts it brings up. The aliens are uninteresting and there is not a hint of intriguing mystery to be found. If there is some sort of twist that I've thusfar missed, I do not really care, because I've gotten no reason to be that invested in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe aesthetics are honestly poor. The music is forgettable, the 3D models are laughable, the voice acting ranges from endearingly amateur to gratingly bad. The globes are not fun to look at, and the mapmodes are downright terrible. This is a game you would want to play on your second monitor, not just because of the repetitive and disengaging gameplay, but because it physically hurts to look at.\r\n\r\nAgain, I almost feel bad for being so harsh on the game. I appreciate that it was made by a small, passionate, and talented team. But really I don't feel the need to pull any punches, because I don't feel like any of this is the result of a botched execution. I think this game IS, more or less, what they wanted it to be. Obviously they would've paid for better art if they could, but I think the art DIRECTION is poor, and I think they wanted the direction that way. I think the writing is poor, and I think they like it that way. I think the gameplay is abysmal, and I think that it's exactly what they wanted. I think this is a rare case of an early access game ready to go 1.0 as a complete product. But its complete form does not impress.",
