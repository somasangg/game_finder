You clean it, you dry it, you sort it, you strap it in bundles. Then you ship back a nicely sorted pack. They always send you a bit extra so you keep that for yourself and hoard it.\n\nYou buy better equipment to partially automate the mundane steps. You come up with and design a layout to clean and sort cash efficiently. You get more niche tools - some jobs ask to sort out marked bills, some need advanced cleaning with chemicals. You may occasionally find coins, statues, necklaces, or even gold bars, too.\n\nThe devs do listen to feedback and while some minor inconveniences persist for longer than I'd hope for, they really do a good job of adding more features and fixes over time. There's still more new stuff to come and their positive track record makes it exciting. You can definitely buy the game as is - the story mode is there and a lot of the rest is optional or post-campaign freeplay content.",

      "review": "RU Версия\r\nОх, как же я устал сортировать эти 2,5 млн долларов для квеста!\r\nЗагрузил пачки в стиралку, отмыл от слизи, и — поскольку после стирки пачки разваливаются на отдельные купюры — открывая машинку, на меня просто вываливалась гора денег. (Кстати, стирка ТАКОГО объёма уверенно делит FPS на три 😅).\r\n\r\nДальше — сушка, сортировка и обратная упаковка. В итоге эти ~3,5 млн долларов (клиент прислал с запасом) заняли [b]12 (!!)[/b] полных паллет. Начал упаковывать на счетной машинке: ждёшь 5 секунд, пока отсчитаются 100 купюр, связываешь, достаёшь, перекладываешь на другую паллету. И так [b]350 раз[/b]! Параллельно нужно подкидывать деньги в машинку, следить за лентой, сушить партии, потому что на паллетах они не высыхают.\r\n\r\nИ вот, когда почти всё готово, я замечаю, что [b]на купюрах есть метки[/b], которых быть не должно! Осознаю, что обратно рассыпанные деньги в стиралку не поместятся, значит — нужно закончить упаковку, а потом заново стирать уже от меток.\r\nИ да… всё сначала. Сушка, упаковка. Снова 350 раз. 😭\r\nНо зато по завершении квеста — приятный бонус: лишний миллион от заказчика и огромное моральное удовлетворение.\r\n\r\nА потом открываешь телефон и видишь ещё три задания: на 20 млн юаней, 1,5 млн долларов и 3 млн евро… Благо, что это уже побочные, а не сюжетные квесты. Но честно говоря, несмотря на их огромный объём, работать с такими заданиями куда интереснее, чем возиться с жалкими тремя пачками по 20 долларов, которые зачем-то нужно класть в огромную коробку.\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n\r\n[h2]Теперь серьёзно[/h2]\r\n\r\nМне очень понравились визуал, атмосфера и общий стиль игры. Крутая идея, интересный сюжет, возможность выбора, забавные и приятные достижения (я выбил 100%). И да — сама физика денег просто великолепна ✨\r\n\r\nВ игре огромный потенциал. И даже на текущем этапе она отлично затягивает на несколько вечеров. Если вам хочется чего-то медитативного, немного скрупулёзного, но не занудного — смело берите, зайдёт.\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n\r\n[h2]О потенциале[/h2]\r\n\r\nНе знаю, какие планы у разработчиков, но лично я хотел бы увидеть больше автоматизации. Пусть дорого, пусть в поздней игре — но было бы круто строить конвейерные линии:\r\n— для сортировки денег,\r\n— отделения разных типов меток,\r\n— автоматической упаковки.\r\n\r\nЧтобы ты просто загружал мешок налички, а на выходе получал аккуратно отсортированные: полицейские метки, бандитские, мафиозные и прочие.\r\n\r\nПока же приходится вручную перекладывать деньги из аппарата в аппарат.\r\nА упаковка — это вообще испытание. С тем же квестом на 2,5 млн ты тратишь час+ чистого времени только на связывание пачек. Если бы существовала машинка с фиксированной валютой/номиналом, но с автоупаковкой — это было бы шикарно.\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n\r\n[h2]О багах и мелочах[/h2]\r\n\r\nПродвинутую стиральную машину можно достать, не покупая ни её, ни комнату. Просто ставите лестницу к стене, забираетесь с другой в руках, прыгаете внутрь, ставите её там и вытаскиваете стиралку. Разработчики… думаю, стоит пофиксить 😅\r\n\r\nЕщё момент: таймеры ведут себя странно. Минуты на чёрном рынке и секунды на стиральной машине живут в разных вселенных. Было бы логично либо показывать реальные минуты доставки, либо синхронизировать стиралку и сушилку с внутриигровым временем.\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n\r\n[h2]Куда девать деньги после выплаты долга?[/h2]\r\n\r\nПосле погашения 1 млн долларов остаётся куча налички, которую никак не использовать. Было бы круто добавить \"диллера\", которому можно отправлять, например, по миллиону долларов и получать крипту по скромному курсу (скажем, 1 крипта = 10к долларов).\r\nМожно усложнить ожиданием транзакции.\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n\r\n[h2]Итог[/h2]\r\n\r\nИгра стоит каждого потраченного рубля.\r\nЯ провёл в ней несколько дней, и она ни разу не наскучила. У игры отличный фундамент и огромный потенциал для развития. Очень надеюсь, что разработчики продолжат её улучшать.\r\n\r\nС удовольствием буду возвращаться!\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\nEN Version\r\nOh man, I got so tired sorting those $2.5 million for that quest.\r\nLoaded the bundles into the washing machine, cleaned off the slime, and — since the bundles fall apart into individual bills after washing — when I opened the machine, a literal avalanche of cash just poured out onto me. (By the way, washing THAT amount of money easily cuts your FPS by three 😅).\r\n\r\nThen comes the drying, sorting, and packing everything back into bundles. In the end, those ~$3.5 million (the client sent extra) took up [b]12 (!!)[/b] full pallets. I started packing them with the counting machine: wait 5 seconds while it counts 100 bills, tie the bundle, pull it out, place it on another pallet. And repeat that [b]350 times[/b].\r\nMeanwhile you have to feed money into the machine, monitor the tape so it doesn’t run out, and rotate batches because the bills won’t dry on pallets by themselves.\r\n\r\nAnd just when I’m almost done, I notice that [b]the bills have markings[/b] they absolutely shouldn’t have. Realizing the loose money won’t fit back into the washer all at once, I have to finish packing everything… and then wash it all again to remove the markings.\r\nSo yeah — dry, pack, repeat. Another 350 times. 😭\r\nBut at least you get an extra million from the client and that sweet relief that it’s finally over.\r\n\r\nAnd then you open your in-game phone and see three more tasks: 20 million yuan, 1.5 million dollars, and 3 million euros… Luckily those are side quests now, not main story ones. But honestly, despite their massive scale, they’re way more fun to work with than those pathetic three $20 bundles you sometimes need to shove into a huge box for no reason.\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n\r\n[h2]Now seriously[/h2]\r\n\r\nI really liked the visuals, the vibe, and the whole style of the game. Cool idea, fun story, choices that actually matter, and a bunch of enjoyable achievements (I got 100%). And yeah — the physics of the money is insanely good ✨\r\n\r\nThe game has tons of potential. And even in its current state, it’s super easy to sink into for several evenings. If you're looking for something meditative, a bit meticulous but not boring — this is absolutely it.\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n\r\n[h2]About the potential[/h2]\r\n\r\nI have no idea what the devs are planning, but personally I’d love more automation. Expensive, late-game — whatever, just give us something.\r\nConveyor lines, for example:\r\n— for sorting the money,\r\n— separating different types of markings,\r\n— auto-packing.\r\n\r\nImagine throwing a bag of cash onto the line and getting neat piles sorted by police marks, gang marks, mafia marks, etc.\r\n\r\nRight now everything has to be moved from one machine to another manually.\r\nAnd packing… oh boy. With that 2.5M quest you literally spend an hour+ just tying bundles. If there were a counting machine with a fixed denomination but automatic packing? That’d be amazing.\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n\r\n[h2]Bugs and small quirks[/h2]\r\n\r\nYou can actually get the advanced washing machine without buying it or the room it’s in. Just place a ladder near the wall, climb with another ladder in your hands, jump inside, place the second ladder, and steal the machine. Devs… yeah, you might wanna fix that 😅\r\n\r\nAlso, the timers are weird. The washing machine uses real seconds, while the black market uses some kind of… made-up minutes? They don’t match real time or in-game time. It would make more sense to either show real delivery time or sync the washer/dryer timers with in-game time.\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n\r\n[h2]What to do with the money after paying off the debt?[/h2]\r\n\r\nAfter you pay the $1M debt, you end up with tons of cash that has nowhere to go. It’d be great to have some kind of “dealer” you can send, say, a million dollars to and get cryptocurrency at a low rate (like 1 crypto = 10k dollars).\r\nWaiting time before receiving crypto would also make it more interesting.\r\n\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n\r\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\r\n\r\nThe game is worth every dollar.\r\nI spent a few days in it and didn’t get bored for a second. It has a great foundation and huge potential for updates. I really hope the devs keep expanding it.\r\n\r\nI’ll definitely be coming back!",

It desperately needs an additional difficulty mode, where you either can't submit a job until the cash is 100% sorted, or you're severely punished for any counterfeit/marked bills.\nThat didn't stop me from playing through a couple of times, each time making my setup slightly more efficient.",

      "review": "The game is fun overall, but tops out very quickly. Needs more updates to allow more automation. \nThere is a main storyline that you can finish in less than 10 hours, and it feels pretty hollow. Wish games like these just did away with trying to have a coherent story - we're all here just to try to optimize some menial task. \nGame does a good job of making the volume of the money feel large and unmanageable before you sort it, and tasks feel very satisfying. \nHowever, you will quickly find yourself asking \"How do I do this faster\" and the answer will be \"you can't\". \n\nFor example, the more expensive money sorters should be packing and shooting out the bundles of cash faster and without user input. There should be more advanced machines that sort out the marked/unclean bills more optimally and faster, and even reload their required resources (like wrapping tape for example) automatically. They should also be able to sort them by all currencies and denominations, as right now the best sorting machine tops out at 3. Up a level, they should be able to wrap the bundles of cash in cling-wrap and put them on pallets automatically, maybe in a conveyer fashion. Top level sorter should be able to sort each currency, then by denomination, then by cleanliness type (clean, goo, ink, dirty, etc.) then by marking type (police, gang, fdi, etc.). Then those monies could be moved and packed where they need to go very quickly. Ungodly amounts of mixed cash could then be made manageable. \n\nThere are aspects of verticality in the game that are pretty unusable beyond just throwing money down into a big pile, but they have a lot of potential (thinking of the raising platforms in the vault). Down the line these could be useful in making funnel and chute style systems that feed sorters and other machines from above.\n\nAll machines should be automated to start once a certain amount of currency is placed in them, and there should be more ways to move money around without much supervision, like other games where optimization is emphasized. \n\nThere's a large ceiling to where this game could go with the right updates. It has really good bones.",

It’s basically therapy, but cheaper and with more trash bags.\n\nThe gameplay loop is simple but dangerously addictive: clean, sort, bundle, and send it off in a box, bag or mattress... Performance-wise, the game runs smoother than a freshly waxed supermarket aisle. I haven’t hit any serious bugs just the occasional moment where I question my life choices after realizing I’ve spent 2 hours removing digital stains.\n\nBesides that, it’s genuinely well-made. The visuals are clean, the controls feel good, and the whole experience is oddly calming. Perfect “chill after work” energy.\n\nIf you enjoy cozy simulators, satisfying cleanup games, or the feeling of fixing things without actually fixing your real problems, this one’s absolutely worth grabbing.\n \n9/10",

The vibe just gave me a lot of stress. I'm not really sure who this is aimed at, since most of the cozy-cleany types will probably not enjoy how hard it is to organize things, with stuff constantly falling on your head and the tasks designed to make you stressed out. I followed the tutorial but still felt like I was doing everything wrong. The help documents are in-game which is nice, but it didn't make me feel much more confident I was doing what the game expected. If I was doing as intended, it's tedious and not rewarding.\n\nDoes one bill in a pile make the whole pile inky? I suddenly felt like all my money was tainted and I have no idea when it happened. It's possible some mission just threw nothing but ink covered bills at me, but my current job was specific about not using inked up currency.\n\nManually cleaning ink off bills was tedious, and the ability to do it with detergent was level locked way into the future. I had someone requesting only clean bills at level 7, and the detergent was at 15. I am not hand washing thousands of dollars to grind for the detergent.\n\nChecked a bunch of bills with the UV trying to find legit ones but didn't know how punishing the game was going to be about checking individual bills there, so I cut open all the packs it gave me. Video online I watched after the fact said the packs are all one or the other, but I have no reason to trust that in-game. The people on the phone want me dead, they have no reason to make my life easy like that. Not sure how I was supposed to figure that out in-game.\n\nDo bills dry off over time? The wetness system seemed weird. I threw all my wet cash into a pile off to the side before I unlocked the dryer, and when I went to pick it up everything after the first handful was dry.\n\nIn general when you're dealing with loose cash, it's hard to get the details of what is what at a glance. I usually didn't notice ink bills until I was loading them into the money counter, which I then had to unload carefully instead of counting it. This sometimes left after-images of the cash in the money counter, which was not the kind of bug I want to see when I'm expected to be precise.\n\nMight get fun later. I don't want to yuck anyone's yum. Some of the later game stuff where you can batch process looks nice but I couldn't see myself grinding up to it at the current early game. Other reviews also said automation is not a thing in this game, which is a shame. Like I said, intentionally messy feeling. The fact you're messing around with piles of money is novel for all of 30 seconds, but when you get into what the game actually wants it gets frustrating fast.",

The game just isn't optimized for large amounts of cash, which is a shame since that's the gimmick. The game can be very chill and zen-like, which is why I have so many hours in it, but so can stacking rocks.

      "review": "An interesting concept let down by uneven progression, a lack of variety, and a cartoonish story that doesn't even take itself seriously.\n\nBefore I launch into my criticisms, I would say that I was impressed by the game's technical handling of large sums of money - a lot of games struggle when dealing with lots of objects but you can be throwing around thousands of bills and not have any problems. I do think that there's some potential to the concept of sorting and examining money as a game but Cash Cleaner Simulator is just missing the mark.\n\n---\n\nWhen it comes to progression, these kind of games typically give you tools that make tasks easier and perhaps by endgame you're working on an entirely different scale, but in Cash Cleaner the tools basically trivialise a previous problem only for it to be replaced by another, functionality identical, problem:\n- At first you're sorting bills by hand, but then you get an automatic sorter that does it for you.\n- Next you're checking for counterfeit bills by hand, but then you get an upgraded sorter that detects them for you.\n- Later you're separating out multiple currencies by hand, but then you get an upgraded sorter that does it for you.\n\nThere aren't really any intermediate steps and some basic options are so tedious (e.g. cleaning ink off individual bills with a sponge) that they might as well not exist. This wouldn't be so much of an issue if each new complication wasn't essentially solved the same way - by sorting bills into piles.\n\nUnfortunately one other aspect of the progression which feels off is the cost of tools - you unlock tools for purchase much faster than you earn the money needed to actually buy them, so in the few cases where there is an intermediate option (e.g. getting individual sorters for Euros or Yen), you may as well just save up to get the top option (the multi-currency sorter) because you'll have unlocked both before you can afford either of them.\n\nThis all-or-nothing progression and lack of real difference for how you deal with problems means most missions in the mid-to-late game (~10 hours in, for me) can't really escalate the challenge - you either have the tools that make them really easy or you don't and it's a tedious manual task. Despite the name of the game, cleaning missions seem quite rare and even then you're still sorting and counting the money after it's cleaned.\n\n---\n\nMercifully, perhaps, the story seems set to wrap up around the 15 hour mark (I've not quite got there at time of writing, but I have the final mission available) so you could feasibly complete it without the novelty wearing too thin, but the story itself doesn't really do much to motivate me to finish it.\n\nThe tone they're going for seems to be somewhere between Watchdogs 2 and Austin Powers - a very unserious crime syndicate with \"wacky\" characters and some conspiratorial nonsense which treads a bit too close to genuine conspiracy theories to sit right with the slapstick tone.\n\nThere are multiple endings but it seems to essentially just be a case of picking side A or side B at the end and I don't really feel any motivation to choose either of them.\n\n---\n\nOverall I would say that Cash Cleaner Simulator is entertaining for a few hours but just doesn't have enough to carry it once the novelty of the mechanics wears off. There's no interesting evolution of the challenges you're dealing with or the tools you have to deal with them, and the story did nothing for me. The fact that the roadmap promises \"Additional Currencies\" in future updates suggests that the devs don't really know how to expand the gameplay either.",

Reasonable CPU usage is the domain of distant and uncaring gods, whose light will never shine on your face again.\n\nSuch a thing as peace or a normal idle temperature does not exist here, where you will endlessly clean and arrange cash for no real purpose, as it doesn't feel like there's any real growth or endgame other than to repeat the same missions over and over again until you uninstall the game or have your motherboard melt to slag inside your PC case.\n\nPerhaps, like me, you enjoy the organizational toil of neatly stacking money in preparation of the next assignment, already ready to load boxes or suitcases and ship them off as soon as you receive word of your task. Well, they'll make sure you don't by making neatly stacked money transform into giant, unorganized piles of cash the moment any of the stacks are placed anywhere near each other.

      "review": "TL:DR This is a very barebones game with almost no synergies between equipment / machines, a real lot of useless or pointless items / mechanics, and without any long term goals. Which practically makes it a sandbox, but somewhat a crude one. If processing (cleaning, drying, sorting) money just for the sake of processing and stacking it in the corner is your thing, then you will probably make the most out of the offered experience. I was looking for some meaning and goals behind the processing as well as a way to optimize the process itself, make it efficient and flawless. Unfortunately, there is nothing of this sort available, at least at the time being.\n \nNow, for the detailed part.\n \nAs always, I'm very skeptical about the games with the word \"Simulator\" in their names. So I tried a YARRR version first, and boy I got so much hooked by the process and aesthetics, that I purchased it straight away. And this is probably the strongest quality of the game - the beginning is extremely addicting. All these random packages dropping from the tube in the ceiling, opening them to see what’s inside, unpacking and arranging bills, using simple counting machines, making stacks of money - it really is a somewhat unique and enjoyable experience.\n \nBut processing alone (as in doing the same thing over and over and over again) can only last for so long. And things started to fall short lightning fast.\n \nThe majority of the side quests do not care about the state of bills. You can send marked, counterfeit and even inked notes with the only downside of not receiving a modest crypto bonus for the delivery. So there is no incentive to bother with all these washing machines, UV lights and other equipment, unless it's just for the sake of your perfectionism. I am a perfectionist, so I was diligently washing, removing marked bills, sorting everything in stacks and even wrapping it in plastic no matter the size before making a delivery, even if nothing of this was requested. This got quite boring faster than I anticipated, though.\n \nI also levelled up really fast, got access to the Piggy Bank and to the end tier machines. Here it is - a long term goal to follow (collect 1.000.000$ in the Piggy) and ways to potentially automate, optimize and make the process of sorting as efficient and pleasant as possible. Nice!\n \nWell, not really. My biggest disappointment was that the Piggy gladly accepts all kinds of bills, no matter how shitty they are: counterfeit, inked, dirty, marked,  ̶s̶l̶i̶c̶e̶d̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶t̶w̶o̶, you name it. Hence collecting 1.000.000$ turned out to be absolutely trivial. Such a perfect opportunity for a nice meaningful and really long term goal just thrown away... Imagine if the Piggy accepted ONLY clean bills and only in perfect wrapped stacks of 100. Or even better - had a requirement of all three currencies: 1.000.000$ + 1.000.000€ + 10.000.000¥, all in clean only state and perfect wrapped stacks of 100. You can go further and add value requirements, for example, 10.000.000¥ is 62 stacks of ¥10,000 + 63 stacks of ¥5,000 + 65 stacks of ¥1,000. This would at least make all these machines really worth purchasing and organizing in an efficient manner. And doing all these side missions would have a goal of slowly filling the Piggy with the leftovers (even though you can just still receive the money and forfeit the mission to keep it, yes).\n \nThe machines. Again, leveling up is so fast, that I've only used 1 Dollar L counter in combination with 2 simple low level counters before I unlocked the end-game XXL counter. I also purchased 1 Euro L counter, as I thought that it will be a part of natural progression, but I ended up using it just a couple of times. Yen L counter was skipped entirely.\n \nIn addition, all machines seem to require a manual input of money and manual button clicks which becomes rather tedious. Partial automation is possible, but it's very clunky and often leaves some lonely bills either flying past the target machine. On a side note, sometimes I also noticed that counters spit out the bills as \"wrong\" for no reason; I manually grabbed these, put them back into the counter and they were sorted correctly on a second attempt. But back to automation - there is not a full one available at the moment. The best thing you can possibly do is to XXL sort by currency, manually taking a stack of 100 out of it every time (if you have a box of mixed ones in the first place) and put it into another XXL that will sort one type of currency into 4 ($) or 3 (€, ¥) bill types. I also created 2 x 4 marked machine sorting chains that were sorting FDI, Police, Gangs and Unknown bills, respectively.\n\nAgain, on a side note, I was really surprised to discover that the marked bills sorter was introduced only recently, while previously the only way to tell if the bills were marked was to spread them out 1 by 1 and manually sort using UV light, Jesus...\n\nAnother example of a weird mechanic: sorting machines have a button to select the size of a stack to create. However, a “nothing” option which I thought would spit everything above 100 out or ideally spit everything that matches the bill nominal right away is simply creating a stack of 100 instead and stops, effectively duplicating the “100” sorting option that's already there. If the “nothing” option worked like it presumably should, it would really help minimize the tedium of manual clicks as currently there is no way to make the machine work non-stop; the moment the stack size reaches designated number, the counting process immediately stops and requires your undivided manual attention.\n\nTo make things even weirder, most of the machines allow you to install a wrapping tape directly into them. Sounds mighty useful, right? I think even the machine description said something about automatic wrapping. But in reality this is a huge and clunky waste of time, as it goes like this: the machine counted a designated number of bills. First, you need to manually press a Wrap button on the machine, then you need to manually take the wrapped stack out, otherwise the machine will not get back to work. And then, you need to manually get rid of the stack in your hands (drop it, place it on a table, etc). However, what you should be really doing instead, is to take the wrapping tape in your hand, wait for the machine to stop after counting the bills, make just a SINGLE click to wrap the stack, which then automatically drops out of the machine and automatically lets the machine continue counting. Just, why? Why not make the machine, in which you install a huge tape, automatically wrap the stack and automatically spit it? It’s already happening on manual approach; a really strange decision.\n\nThe second most disappointing moment for me was inability to effectively arrange the equipment. Tables, racks, machines, pallets - everything exists solely on its own without a notion for a synergy. Different heights, different shapes, some machines throw bills in an arc, some – in a straight line. Yes, you can be totally creative and place a table on two racks, a machine on a pallet, then use a different sorter that spits money in a trajectory you want, then place the machine in all sorts of awkward positions and angles. But first, it might take anything from 10 to 30 minutes per section, because the current placement mechanic is very unfriendly, especially for the bigger size equipment – these need to be aligned absolutely perfectly in order to avoid bills flying past the machine, but you really can’t see shit while positioning the items. And even then, the 30 minutes of arranging can be wasted in a split second, either by you slightly touching one of the objects on accident, or another equipment completely and fully turning around everything after a gentle bump.\n\nSo all in all, after 100% the game I felt rather disappointed with how awesome the game started and how shallow it turned out to be past the first couple of hours.",

The vibe just gave me a lot of stress. I'm not really sure who this is aimed at, since most of the cozy-cleany types will probably not enjoy how hard it is to organize things, with stuff constantly falling on your head and the tasks designed to make you stressed out. I followed the tutorial but still felt like I was doing everything wrong. The help documents are in-game which is nice, but it didn't make me feel much more confident I was doing what the game expected. If I was doing as intended, it's tedious and not rewarding.\n\nDoes one bill in a pile make the whole pile inky? I suddenly felt like all my money was tainted and I have no idea when it happened. It's possible some mission just threw nothing but ink covered bills at me, but my current job was specific about not using inked up currency.\n\nManually cleaning ink off bills was tedious, and the ability to do it with detergent was level locked way into the future. I had someone requesting only clean bills at level 7, and the detergent was at 15. I am not hand washing thousands of dollars to grind for the detergent.\n\nChecked a bunch of bills with the UV trying to find legit ones but didn't know how punishing the game was going to be about checking individual bills there, so I cut open all the packs it gave me. Video online I watched after the fact said the packs are all one or the other, but I have no reason to trust that in-game. The people on the phone want me dead, they have no reason to make my life easy like that. Not sure how I was supposed to figure that out in-game.\n\nDo bills dry off over time? The wetness system seemed weird. I threw all my wet cash into a pile off to the side before I unlocked the dryer, and when I went to pick it up everything after the first handful was dry.\n\nIn general when you're dealing with loose cash, it's hard to get the details of what is what at a glance. I usually didn't notice ink bills until I was loading them into the money counter, which I then had to unload carefully instead of counting it. This sometimes left after-images of the cash in the money counter, which was not the kind of bug I want to see when I'm expected to be precise.\n\nMight get fun later. I don't want to yuck anyone's yum. Some of the later game stuff where you can batch process looks nice but I couldn't see myself grinding up to it at the current early game. Other reviews also said automation is not a thing in this game, which is a shame. Like I said, intentionally messy feeling. The fact you're messing around with piles of money is novel for all of 30 seconds, but when you get into what the game actually wants it gets frustrating fast.",

      "review": "An interesting concept let down by uneven progression, a lack of variety, and a cartoonish story that doesn't even take itself seriously.\n\nBefore I launch into my criticisms, I would say that I was impressed by the game's technical handling of large sums of money - a lot of games struggle when dealing with lots of objects but you can be throwing around thousands of bills and not have any problems. I do think that there's some potential to the concept of sorting and examining money as a game but Cash Cleaner Simulator is just missing the mark.\n\n---\n\nWhen it comes to progression, these kind of games typically give you tools that make tasks easier and perhaps by endgame you're working on an entirely different scale, but in Cash Cleaner the tools basically trivialise a previous problem only for it to be replaced by another, functionality identical, problem:\n- At first you're sorting bills by hand, but then you get an automatic sorter that does it for you.\n- Next you're checking for counterfeit bills by hand, but then you get an upgraded sorter that detects them for you.\n- Later you're separating out multiple currencies by hand, but then you get an upgraded sorter that does it for you.\n\nThere aren't really any intermediate steps and some basic options are so tedious (e.g. cleaning ink off individual bills with a sponge) that they might as well not exist. This wouldn't be so much of an issue if each new complication wasn't essentially solved the same way - by sorting bills into piles.\n\nUnfortunately one other aspect of the progression which feels off is the cost of tools - you unlock tools for purchase much faster than you earn the money needed to actually buy them, so in the few cases where there is an intermediate option (e.g. getting individual sorters for Euros or Yen), you may as well just save up to get the top option (the multi-currency sorter) because you'll have unlocked both before you can afford either of them.\n\nThis all-or-nothing progression and lack of real difference for how you deal with problems means most missions in the mid-to-late game (~10 hours in, for me) can't really escalate the challenge - you either have the tools that make them really easy or you don't and it's a tedious manual task. Despite the name of the game, cleaning missions seem quite rare and even then you're still sorting and counting the money after it's cleaned.\n\n---\n\nMercifully, perhaps, the story seems set to wrap up around the 15 hour mark (I've not quite got there at time of writing, but I have the final mission available) so you could feasibly complete it without the novelty wearing too thin, but the story itself doesn't really do much to motivate me to finish it.\n\nThe tone they're going for seems to be somewhere between Watchdogs 2 and Austin Powers - a very unserious crime syndicate with \"wacky\" characters and some conspiratorial nonsense which treads a bit too close to genuine conspiracy theories to sit right with the slapstick tone.\n\nThere are multiple endings but it seems to essentially just be a case of picking side A or side B at the end and I don't really feel any motivation to choose either of them.\n\n---\n\nOverall I would say that Cash Cleaner Simulator is entertaining for a few hours but just doesn't have enough to carry it once the novelty of the mechanics wears off. There's no interesting evolution of the challenges you're dealing with or the tools you have to deal with them, and the story did nothing for me. The fact that the roadmap promises \"Additional Currencies\" in future updates suggests that the devs don't really know how to expand the gameplay either.",

      "review": "TL:DR This is a very barebones game with almost no synergies between equipment / machines, a real lot of useless or pointless items / mechanics, and without any long term goals. Which practically makes it a sandbox, but somewhat a crude one. If processing (cleaning, drying, sorting) money just for the sake of processing and stacking it in the corner is your thing, then you will probably make the most out of the offered experience. I was looking for some meaning and goals behind the processing as well as a way to optimize the process itself, make it efficient and flawless. Unfortunately, there is nothing of this sort available, at least at the time being.\n \nNow, for the detailed part.\n \nAs always, I'm very skeptical about the games with the word \"Simulator\" in their names. So I tried a YARRR version first, and boy I got so much hooked by the process and aesthetics, that I purchased it straight away. And this is probably the strongest quality of the game - the beginning is extremely addicting. All these random packages dropping from the tube in the ceiling, opening them to see what’s inside, unpacking and arranging bills, using simple counting machines, making stacks of money - it really is a somewhat unique and enjoyable experience.\n \nBut processing alone (as in doing the same thing over and over and over again) can only last for so long. And things started to fall short lightning fast.\n \nThe majority of the side quests do not care about the state of bills. You can send marked, counterfeit and even inked notes with the only downside of not receiving a modest crypto bonus for the delivery. So there is no incentive to bother with all these washing machines, UV lights and other equipment, unless it's just for the sake of your perfectionism. I am a perfectionist, so I was diligently washing, removing marked bills, sorting everything in stacks and even wrapping it in plastic no matter the size before making a delivery, even if nothing of this was requested. This got quite boring faster than I anticipated, though.\n \nI also levelled up really fast, got access to the Piggy Bank and to the end tier machines. Here it is - a long term goal to follow (collect 1.000.000$ in the Piggy) and ways to potentially automate, optimize and make the process of sorting as efficient and pleasant as possible. Nice!\n \nWell, not really. My biggest disappointment was that the Piggy gladly accepts all kinds of bills, no matter how shitty they are: counterfeit, inked, dirty, marked,  ̶s̶l̶i̶c̶e̶d̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶t̶w̶o̶, you name it. Hence collecting 1.000.000$ turned out to be absolutely trivial. Such a perfect opportunity for a nice meaningful and really long term goal just thrown away... Imagine if the Piggy accepted ONLY clean bills and only in perfect wrapped stacks of 100. Or even better - had a requirement of all three currencies: 1.000.000$ + 1.000.000€ + 10.000.000¥, all in clean only state and perfect wrapped stacks of 100. You can go further and add value requirements, for example, 10.000.000¥ is 62 stacks of ¥10,000 + 63 stacks of ¥5,000 + 65 stacks of ¥1,000. This would at least make all these machines really worth purchasing and organizing in an efficient manner. And doing all these side missions would have a goal of slowly filling the Piggy with the leftovers (even though you can just still receive the money and forfeit the mission to keep it, yes).\n \nThe machines. Again, leveling up is so fast, that I've only used 1 Dollar L counter in combination with 2 simple low level counters before I unlocked the end-game XXL counter. I also purchased 1 Euro L counter, as I thought that it will be a part of natural progression, but I ended up using it just a couple of times. Yen L counter was skipped entirely.\n \nIn addition, all machines seem to require a manual input of money and manual button clicks which becomes rather tedious. Partial automation is possible, but it's very clunky and often leaves some lonely bills either flying past the target machine. On a side note, sometimes I also noticed that counters spit out the bills as \"wrong\" for no reason; I manually grabbed these, put them back into the counter and they were sorted correctly on a second attempt. But back to automation - there is not a full one available at the moment. The best thing you can possibly do is to XXL sort by currency, manually taking a stack of 100 out of it every time (if you have a box of mixed ones in the first place) and put it into another XXL that will sort one type of currency into 4 ($) or 3 (€, ¥) bill types. I also created 2 x 4 marked machine sorting chains that were sorting FDI, Police, Gangs and Unknown bills, respectively.\n\nAgain, on a side note, I was really surprised to discover that the marked bills sorter was introduced only recently, while previously the only way to tell if the bills were marked was to spread them out 1 by 1 and manually sort using UV light, Jesus...\n\nAnother example of a weird mechanic: sorting machines have a button to select the size of a stack to create. However, a “nothing” option which I thought would spit everything above 100 out or ideally spit everything that matches the bill nominal right away is simply creating a stack of 100 instead and stops, effectively duplicating the “100” sorting option that's already there. If the “nothing” option worked like it presumably should, it would really help minimize the tedium of manual clicks as currently there is no way to make the machine work non-stop; the moment the stack size reaches designated number, the counting process immediately stops and requires your undivided manual attention.\n\nTo make things even weirder, most of the machines allow you to install a wrapping tape directly into them. Sounds mighty useful, right? I think even the machine description said something about automatic wrapping. But in reality this is a huge and clunky waste of time, as it goes like this: the machine counted a designated number of bills. First, you need to manually press a Wrap button on the machine, then you need to manually take the wrapped stack out, otherwise the machine will not get back to work. And then, you need to manually get rid of the stack in your hands (drop it, place it on a table, etc). However, what you should be really doing instead, is to take the wrapping tape in your hand, wait for the machine to stop after counting the bills, make just a SINGLE click to wrap the stack, which then automatically drops out of the machine and automatically lets the machine continue counting. Just, why? Why not make the machine, in which you install a huge tape, automatically wrap the stack and automatically spit it? It’s already happening on manual approach; a really strange decision.\n\nThe second most disappointing moment for me was inability to effectively arrange the equipment. Tables, racks, machines, pallets - everything exists solely on its own without a notion for a synergy. Different heights, different shapes, some machines throw bills in an arc, some – in a straight line. Yes, you can be totally creative and place a table on two racks, a machine on a pallet, then use a different sorter that spits money in a trajectory you want, then place the machine in all sorts of awkward positions and angles. But first, it might take anything from 10 to 30 minutes per section, because the current placement mechanic is very unfriendly, especially for the bigger size equipment – these need to be aligned absolutely perfectly in order to avoid bills flying past the machine, but you really can’t see shit while positioning the items. And even then, the 30 minutes of arranging can be wasted in a split second, either by you slightly touching one of the objects on accident, or another equipment completely and fully turning around everything after a gentle bump.\n\nSo all in all, after 100% the game I felt rather disappointed with how awesome the game started and how shallow it turned out to be past the first couple of hours.",

The vibe just gave me a lot of stress. I'm not really sure who this is aimed at, since most of the cozy-cleany types will probably not enjoy how hard it is to organize things, with stuff constantly falling on your head and the tasks designed to make you stressed out. I followed the tutorial but still felt like I was doing everything wrong. The help documents are in-game which is nice, but it didn't make me feel much more confident I was doing what the game expected. If I was doing as intended, it's tedious and not rewarding.\n\nDoes one bill in a pile make the whole pile inky? I suddenly felt like all my money was tainted and I have no idea when it happened. It's possible some mission just threw nothing but ink covered bills at me, but my current job was specific about not using inked up currency.\n\nManually cleaning ink off bills was tedious, and the ability to do it with detergent was level locked way into the future. I had someone requesting only clean bills at level 7, and the detergent was at 15. I am not hand washing thousands of dollars to grind for the detergent.\n\nChecked a bunch of bills with the UV trying to find legit ones but didn't know how punishing the game was going to be about checking individual bills there, so I cut open all the packs it gave me. Video online I watched after the fact said the packs are all one or the other, but I have no reason to trust that in-game. The people on the phone want me dead, they have no reason to make my life easy like that. Not sure how I was supposed to figure that out in-game.\n\nDo bills dry off over time? The wetness system seemed weird. I threw all my wet cash into a pile off to the side before I unlocked the dryer, and when I went to pick it up everything after the first handful was dry.\n\nIn general when you're dealing with loose cash, it's hard to get the details of what is what at a glance. I usually didn't notice ink bills until I was loading them into the money counter, which I then had to unload carefully instead of counting it. This sometimes left after-images of the cash in the money counter, which was not the kind of bug I want to see when I'm expected to be precise.\n\nMight get fun later. I don't want to yuck anyone's yum. Some of the later game stuff where you can batch process looks nice but I couldn't see myself grinding up to it at the current early game. Other reviews also said automation is not a thing in this game, which is a shame. Like I said, intentionally messy feeling. The fact you're messing around with piles of money is novel for all of 30 seconds, but when you get into what the game actually wants it gets frustrating fast.",

      "review": "An interesting concept let down by uneven progression, a lack of variety, and a cartoonish story that doesn't even take itself seriously.\n\nBefore I launch into my criticisms, I would say that I was impressed by the game's technical handling of large sums of money - a lot of games struggle when dealing with lots of objects but you can be throwing around thousands of bills and not have any problems. I do think that there's some potential to the concept of sorting and examining money as a game but Cash Cleaner Simulator is just missing the mark.\n\n---\n\nWhen it comes to progression, these kind of games typically give you tools that make tasks easier and perhaps by endgame you're working on an entirely different scale, but in Cash Cleaner the tools basically trivialise a previous problem only for it to be replaced by another, functionality identical, problem:\n- At first you're sorting bills by hand, but then you get an automatic sorter that does it for you.\n- Next you're checking for counterfeit bills by hand, but then you get an upgraded sorter that detects them for you.\n- Later you're separating out multiple currencies by hand, but then you get an upgraded sorter that does it for you.\n\nThere aren't really any intermediate steps and some basic options are so tedious (e.g. cleaning ink off individual bills with a sponge) that they might as well not exist. This wouldn't be so much of an issue if each new complication wasn't essentially solved the same way - by sorting bills into piles.\n\nUnfortunately one other aspect of the progression which feels off is the cost of tools - you unlock tools for purchase much faster than you earn the money needed to actually buy them, so in the few cases where there is an intermediate option (e.g. getting individual sorters for Euros or Yen), you may as well just save up to get the top option (the multi-currency sorter) because you'll have unlocked both before you can afford either of them.\n\nThis all-or-nothing progression and lack of real difference for how you deal with problems means most missions in the mid-to-late game (~10 hours in, for me) can't really escalate the challenge - you either have the tools that make them really easy or you don't and it's a tedious manual task. Despite the name of the game, cleaning missions seem quite rare and even then you're still sorting and counting the money after it's cleaned.\n\n---\n\nMercifully, perhaps, the story seems set to wrap up around the 15 hour mark (I've not quite got there at time of writing, but I have the final mission available) so you could feasibly complete it without the novelty wearing too thin, but the story itself doesn't really do much to motivate me to finish it.\n\nThe tone they're going for seems to be somewhere between Watchdogs 2 and Austin Powers - a very unserious crime syndicate with \"wacky\" characters and some conspiratorial nonsense which treads a bit too close to genuine conspiracy theories to sit right with the slapstick tone.\n\nThere are multiple endings but it seems to essentially just be a case of picking side A or side B at the end and I don't really feel any motivation to choose either of them.\n\n---\n\nOverall I would say that Cash Cleaner Simulator is entertaining for a few hours but just doesn't have enough to carry it once the novelty of the mechanics wears off. There's no interesting evolution of the challenges you're dealing with or the tools you have to deal with them, and the story did nothing for me. The fact that the roadmap promises \"Additional Currencies\" in future updates suggests that the devs don't really know how to expand the gameplay either.",

Reasonable CPU usage is the domain of distant and uncaring gods, whose light will never shine on your face again.\n\nSuch a thing as peace or a normal idle temperature does not exist here, where you will endlessly clean and arrange cash for no real purpose, as it doesn't feel like there's any real growth or endgame other than to repeat the same missions over and over again until you uninstall the game or have your motherboard melt to slag inside your PC case.\n\nPerhaps, like me, you enjoy the organizational toil of neatly stacking money in preparation of the next assignment, already ready to load boxes or suitcases and ship them off as soon as you receive word of your task.

      "review": "TL:DR This is a very barebones game with almost no synergies between equipment / machines, a real lot of useless or pointless items / mechanics, and without any long term goals. Which practically makes it a sandbox, but somewhat a crude one. If processing (cleaning, drying, sorting) money just for the sake of processing and stacking it in the corner is your thing, then you will probably make the most out of the offered experience. I was looking for some meaning and goals behind the processing as well as a way to optimize the process itself, make it efficient and flawless. Unfortunately, there is nothing of this sort available, at least at the time being.\n \nNow, for the detailed part.\n \nAs always, I'm very skeptical about the games with the word \"Simulator\" in their names. So I tried a YARRR version first, and boy I got so much hooked by the process and aesthetics, that I purchased it straight away. And this is probably the strongest quality of the game - the beginning is extremely addicting. All these random packages dropping from the tube in the ceiling, opening them to see what’s inside, unpacking and arranging bills, using simple counting machines, making stacks of money - it really is a somewhat unique and enjoyable experience.\n \nBut processing alone (as in doing the same thing over and over and over again) can only last for so long. And things started to fall short lightning fast.\n \nThe majority of the side quests do not care about the state of bills. You can send marked, counterfeit and even inked notes with the only downside of not receiving a modest crypto bonus for the delivery. So there is no incentive to bother with all these washing machines, UV lights and other equipment, unless it's just for the sake of your perfectionism. I am a perfectionist, so I was diligently washing, removing marked bills, sorting everything in stacks and even wrapping it in plastic no matter the size before making a delivery, even if nothing of this was requested. This got quite boring faster than I anticipated, though.\n \nI also levelled up really fast, got access to the Piggy Bank and to the end tier machines. Here it is - a long term goal to follow (collect 1.000.000$ in the Piggy) and ways to potentially automate, optimize and make the process of sorting as efficient and pleasant as possible. Nice!\n \nWell, not really. My biggest disappointment was that the Piggy gladly accepts all kinds of bills, no matter how shitty they are: counterfeit, inked, dirty, marked,  ̶s̶l̶i̶c̶e̶d̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶t̶w̶o̶, you name it. Hence collecting 1.000.000$ turned out to be absolutely trivial. Such a perfect opportunity for a nice meaningful and really long term goal just thrown away... Imagine if the Piggy accepted ONLY clean bills and only in perfect wrapped stacks of 100. Or even better - had a requirement of all three currencies: 1.000.000$ + 1.000.000€ + 10.000.000¥, all in clean only state and perfect wrapped stacks of 100. You can go further and add value requirements, for example, 10.000.000¥ is 62 stacks of ¥10,000 + 63 stacks of ¥5,000 + 65 stacks of ¥1,000. This would at least make all these machines really worth purchasing and organizing in an efficient manner. And doing all these side missions would have a goal of slowly filling the Piggy with the leftovers (even though you can just still receive the money and forfeit the mission to keep it, yes).\n \nThe machines. Again, leveling up is so fast, that I've only used 1 Dollar L counter in combination with 2 simple low level counters before I unlocked the end-game XXL counter. I also purchased 1 Euro L counter, as I thought that it will be a part of natural progression, but I ended up using it just a couple of times. Yen L counter was skipped entirely.\n \nIn addition, all machines seem to require a manual input of money and manual button clicks which becomes rather tedious. Partial automation is possible, but it's very clunky and often leaves some lonely bills either flying past the target machine. On a side note, sometimes I also noticed that counters spit out the bills as \"wrong\" for no reason; I manually grabbed these, put them back into the counter and they were sorted correctly on a second attempt. But back to automation - there is not a full one available at the moment. The best thing you can possibly do is to XXL sort by currency, manually taking a stack of 100 out of it every time (if you have a box of mixed ones in the first place) and put it into another XXL that will sort one type of currency into 4 ($) or 3 (€, ¥) bill types. I also created 2 x 4 marked machine sorting chains that were sorting FDI, Police, Gangs and Unknown bills, respectively.\n\nAgain, on a side note, I was really surprised to discover that the marked bills sorter was introduced only recently, while previously the only way to tell if the bills were marked was to spread them out 1 by 1 and manually sort using UV light, Jesus...\n\nAnother example of a weird mechanic: sorting machines have a button to select the size of a stack to create. However, a “nothing” option which I thought would spit everything above 100 out or ideally spit everything that matches the bill nominal right away is simply creating a stack of 100 instead and stops, effectively duplicating the “100” sorting option that's already there. If the “nothing” option worked like it presumably should, it would really help minimize the tedium of manual clicks as currently there is no way to make the machine work non-stop; the moment the stack size reaches designated number, the counting process immediately stops and requires your undivided manual attention.\n\nTo make things even weirder, most of the machines allow you to install a wrapping tape directly into them. Sounds mighty useful, right? I think even the machine description said something about automatic wrapping. But in reality this is a huge and clunky waste of time, as it goes like this: the machine counted a designated number of bills. First, you need to manually press a Wrap button on the machine, then you need to manually take the wrapped stack out, otherwise the machine will not get back to work. And then, you need to manually get rid of the stack in your hands (drop it, place it on a table, etc). However, what you should be really doing instead, is to take the wrapping tape in your hand, wait for the machine to stop after counting the bills, make just a SINGLE click to wrap the stack, which then automatically drops out of the machine and automatically lets the machine continue counting. Just, why? Why not make the machine, in which you install a huge tape, automatically wrap the stack and automatically spit it? It’s already happening on manual approach; a really strange decision.\n\nThe second most disappointing moment for me was inability to effectively arrange the equipment. Tables, racks, machines, pallets - everything exists solely on its own without a notion for a synergy. Different heights, different shapes, some machines throw bills in an arc, some – in a straight line. Yes, you can be totally creative and place a table on two racks, a machine on a pallet, then use a different sorter that spits money in a trajectory you want, then place the machine in all sorts of awkward positions and angles. But first, it might take anything from 10 to 30 minutes per section, because the current placement mechanic is very unfriendly, especially for the bigger size equipment – these need to be aligned absolutely perfectly in order to avoid bills flying past the machine, but you really can’t see shit while positioning the items. And even then, the 30 minutes of arranging can be wasted in a split second, either by you slightly touching one of the objects on accident, or another equipment completely and fully turning around everything after a gentle bump.\n\nSo all in all, after 100% the game I felt rather disappointed with how awesome the game started and how shallow it turned out to be past the first couple of hours.",

Empty game after.\r\n\r\n1) No endgame after piggy bank, no unlocks or new things, just 'okay it's done. Go back to the small jobs'. Game feels empty with nowhere to showoff your money, anywhere to make it easier to stockpile, and just an empty warehouse that is badly lit. Definitely requires you make your own aftergame/endgame.\r\n2) There is clearly a right and wrong choice for the piggy bank (look it up on Youtube if you want spoilers) definitely feels biased and hackjob-ed after all the lore you get while playing and then 50% of it turns out to be a lie (oops!) that doesn't even make any sense!\r\n\r\nGonna go look on Nexus for some mods, see if I can salvage some long term playability from this and get some more hours out of it but definitely don't recommend because of the rug pull and empty void after the main quest.\r\n\r\nMy playtime is from being OCD with my money - YMMV.\r\n\r\n(Some post review commentary, just so I'm not complaining without critique: If we had a well lit area or somewhere to actually build up a mountain of money pallets with some purpose or aesthetic, I'd probably recommend despite the garbo polarized main quest rugpull. Maybe the dev adds some content in the future and I can come back and edit this but as of right now it's a cliff drop after the piggy bank and I hate that I can't recommend it because of that)",

In my personal experience, there was just a lot of money piles and not enough ways to organize efficiently between all the bill amounts, traits, and currencies.

Otherwise, it's a pretty fun game with a cool concept, but I just couldn't with all the disorganization.

      "review": "Fun game, but the devs misunderstood their own feature request.\nCash Cleaner is a solid and enjoyable game, but I’m really disappointed with how the developers handled the community feedback.\n\nPlayers asked for a simple thing — the ability to take single items from pallets or boxes, like one stack of bills or a single coin instead of a full hand.\nThat could easily use the existing pickup system, just giving fewer items per grab. It wouldn’t affect performance at all.\n\nHowever, the devs changed the meaning of the request to something completely different — “picking specific items from containers” — and then said they scrapped it because “it had too much impact on game performance.”\nThat’s just not the same feature people asked for. The original idea was simple, realistic, and totally doable without hurting performance.\n\nIt’s a great game overall, but moments like this make it feel like the devs don’t really listen or try to understand what the community actually means.",

      "review": "Didn't find it very satisfying over the first hour. Refunded.\n\nIt looked super fun watching others play, but it really is a (very intentionally) messy game. The vibe just gave me a lot of stress. I'm not really sure who this is aimed at, since most of the cozy-cleany types will probably not enjoy how hard it is to organize things, with stuff constantly falling on your head and the tasks designed to make you stressed out. I followed the tutorial but still felt like I was doing everything wrong. The help documents are in-game which is nice, but it didn't make me feel much more confident I was doing what the game expected. If I was doing as intended, it's tedious and not rewarding.\n\nDoes one bill in a pile make the whole pile inky? I suddenly felt like all my money was tainted and I have no idea when it happened. It's possible some mission just threw nothing but ink covered bills at me, but my current job was specific about not using inked up currency.\n\nManually cleaning ink off bills was tedious, and the ability to do it with detergent was level locked way into the future. I had someone requesting only clean bills at level 7, and the detergent was at 15. I am not hand washing thousands of dollars to grind for the detergent.\n\nChecked a bunch of bills with the UV trying to find legit ones but didn't know how punishing the game was going to be about checking individual bills there, so I cut open all the packs it gave me. Video online I watched after the fact said the packs are all one or the other, but I have no reason to trust that in-game. The people on the phone want me dead, they have no reason to make my life easy like that. Not sure how I was supposed to figure that out in-game.\n\nDo bills dry off over time? The wetness system seemed weird. I threw all my wet cash into a pile off to the side before I unlocked the dryer, and when I went to pick it up everything after the first handful was dry.\n\nIn general when you're dealing with loose cash, it's hard to get the details of what is what at a glance. I usually didn't notice ink bills until I was loading them into the money counter, which I then had to unload carefully instead of counting it. This sometimes left after-images of the cash in the money counter, which was not the kind of bug I want to see when I'm expected to be precise.\n\nMight get fun later. I don't want to yuck anyone's yum. Some of the later game stuff where you can batch process looks nice but I couldn't see myself grinding up to it at the current early game. Other reviews also said automation is not a thing in this game, which is a shame. Like I said, intentionally messy feeling. The fact you're messing around with piles of money is novel for all of 30 seconds, but when you get into what the game actually wants it gets frustrating fast.",

The game just isn't optimized for large amounts of cash, which is a shame since that's the gimmick. The game can be very chill and zen-like, which is why I have so many hours in it, but so can stacking rocks. The storyline is a disjointed mess, the early versions show the developers don't respect players' time (largely fixed), and you can pretty much do everything there is to do in 10-15 hours. If you're looking for a palate cleanser type game and can get it for under $10, go for it. Just set your expectations accordingly.",
