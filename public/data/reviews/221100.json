      "review": "DayZ 3,000 Hours Later\r\n\r\nThis game just keeps on giving.\r\n\r\nAt first it’s brutal. There’s no tutorial or hand-holding. You learn by dying again and again, but that’s part of what makes it so good. The learning curve is steep, but once you start figuring things out it becomes incredibly rewarding. There’s always something new to learn like sickness, hypothermia, fractures, finding food, clean water and of course surviving other players.\r\n\r\nYou can’t trust anyone in DayZ, but sometimes giving a little trust can lead to some of the best and most memorable moments you’ll ever have in a game.\r\n\r\nEvery time you log in it feels like a new story. No two sessions are ever the same and that’s what keeps it fresh even after all these years.\r\n\r\nThe game is around 13 years old now and still has a huge player base which says a lot. I recommend joining a community server with active admins as it makes a big difference. Most have Discords where you can meet people and group up. Personally I play on The Better Vanilla and it has everything I need.\r\n\r\nAfter 3,000 hours I still haven’t gotten bored. It’s one of those games where you never really know what’s going to happen next.\r\n\r\nThink about it. You can spend the same amount of money on a cinema ticket, drink and popcorn for two hours of fun. DayZ gives you thousands of hours of chaos, stories and pure survival. Totally worth it.",

      "review": "The Agonizing, Unforgiving, Brilliant 7/10 Masterpiece\r\n\r\nReview:\r\n\r\nTo review DayZ is, in itself, an act of survival. You must endure hours of hardship, frustration, and existential dread, only to emerge on the other side, blinking into the sun, unsure if you’ve just had a profound experience or wasted 500 hours of your life. The answer, as it turns out, is \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nThis is not a \"game\" in the traditional sense. This is a sociological experiment with a terrible frame rate. It’s a high-stakes, player-driven drama where the zombies are merely the set dressing for the real horror: other people.\r\n\r\nThe 10/10 High: The Unscripted Masterpiece\r\nThere is, quite simply, nothing on the market that generates stories like DayZ. The highs are so astronomically high that they justify all the suffering.\r\n\r\nYou will remember, for years, the time you and a stranger, both armed only with flashlights, wordlessly teamed up to fight off a horde. You will never forget the 10-minute, high-stakes negotiation with a fully-geared squad that ended in a peaceful trade of beans for ammo. And you will definitely never forget the adrenaline of a 45-minute-long sniper duel in the hills of Chernarus.\r\n\r\nThese aren't quests. They aren't scripted. They are raw, emergent, human narratives. When DayZ works, it is the most sublime, heart-pounding experience in all of gaming.\r\n\r\nThe 4/10 Low: The \"Jank\" Engine\r\n...And then there's the rest of it.\r\n\r\nDayZ is a magnificent, beautiful, brilliant idea, held together with duct tape, stubbornness, and code that feels, at times, haunted. For every sublime moment of human drama, there are three moments where you die because your character decided to get stuck in a door-opening animation.\r\n\r\nThis is a game where your greatest enemies are, in order:\r\n\r\nOther players.\r\n\r\nStarvation/Dehydration.\r\n\r\nA simple ladder.\r\n\r\nThe inventory system.\r\n\r\nA single, very determined zombie who can somehow punch you through a solid brick wall.\r\n\r\nYou will spend 40 minutes playing \"Running Simulator\" across a gorgeous, empty landscape, only to find that the can of food you’ve finally located requires a can opener you don’t have. You will engage in melee combat that feels less like a desperate fight for survival and more like two drunkards trying to swat a fly with wet noodles.\r\n\r\nThe Verdict: A Flawed Classic (7/10)\r\nThis is the central paradox of DayZ. It's a game I both love and loathe. It is deeply, fundamentally, and perhaps purposefully, flawed.\r\n\r\nA 7/10 is the only honest score. It is not a \"perfect\" 10, nor is it a \"broken\" 4. It's a 7, which in school-grading terms, is a \"C+\" — average, but passing. And that's DayZ: it passes the test of \"Is this a unique experience?\" with flying colors, but it barely scrapes by on \"Is this a functional piece of software?\"\r\n\r\nIt doesn't respect your time. It is obtuse. It is clunky.\r\n\r\nAnd yet... I'm logging in again tonight. I need to get that car battery back to my base.\r\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10 — A beautiful, broken, unforgettable disaster.",

I am situated in Asia, I get above 150ms ping in asia servers, where there is mostly 3/100 players one of which is on chance a hacker, all other servers give ping too high to play, now even on DZSA launcher's custom servers there is a provider issue. The map chernarus is already too big for average player like me, we will not be interested in giving more money than the game cost us in sale to buy a DLC for a game in which anyways servers are broken with either lag issue or hackers. I have been following DayZ since the beginning in ARMA days, finally have a PC which can run it, please it is my humble request it is a great game and i would love to play it the way it was meant to be. Please fix servers and I will for sure buy DLC ^.^",

      "review": "I Sold My Soul for a Can of Beans: A DayZ Review (And Why My Wife Almost Left Me)\n\nIt was 3:00 AM on a Tuesday. The rain was hammering against the window, but in Chernarus, the sun was shining.\n\nI had finally done it. After four hours of crawling through bushes like a terrified hedgehog, I had the loot. I had a pristine M4 assault rifle. I had a tactical vest. I even had—and I cannot stress the luxury of this enough—a can of Tactical Bacon.\n\nI was the king of the server. I was a survivor. I was a man of many talents.\n\nThen, I met \"Steve.\"\n\nSteve was a fresh spawn. No shoes, no pants, just a glow stick and a dream. He waved at me. I waved back. \"Friendly?\" he asked over voice chat. \"Friendly,\" I lied. (Okay, I intended to be friendly, but my finger was trembling on the trigger).\n\nWe bonded. We walked together for 20 minutes. I fed him half my bacon. I felt like a benevolent god. I told him about my real life—about the neighbors, about the lady losing the plot on the left. Steve listened. Steve cared.\n\nThen, I stopped to check inventory.\n\nCRACK.\n\nMy screen went black. \"You are dead.\"\n\nSteve didn’t shoot me. No, that would be too dignified. Steve hit me in the back of the head with a can of Heinz Baked Beans. My own beans. The betrayal wasn't just physical; it was spiritual.\n\nThe IRL Drama:\nI didn’t just sigh. I didn’t just rage-quit. I stood up and screamed, \"STEVE, YOU TRAITOROUS PIG!\" at the top of my lungs.\n\nThe bedroom door flew open.\n\nEnter my wife. She looked at me. She looked at the \"You are dead\" screen. She looked at the clock.\n\n\"Did you just wake up the entire neighborhood because you died in your little walking simulator?\" she whispered. Her voice was scary calm.\n\n\"He... he hit me with beans, honey. After I gave him bacon,\" I stammered, realizing how insane I sounded. \"I lost everything. My M4. My dignity.\"\n\nShe stared at me for a long, cold minute. \"If you wake up the baby,\" she said, pointing a finger sharper than any DayZ bayonet, \"I will make you eat cold beans for a week. Real ones. Go to sleep.\"\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nDayZ is not a game. It is a psychological experiment designed to test how quickly you can develop trust issues. It is a walking simulator where the destination is always disappointment. It looks like 2013, runs like a potato, and the cars fly better than the planes.\n\nPros:\nBeautiful scenery (while you starve to death).\nTeaches you valuable life skills, like never trusting a man named Steve who isn't wearing pants.\nAdrenaline rushes that are definitely bad for your heart.\n\nCons:\nHigh risk of divorce.\nI spent 6 hours looting to die in 3 seconds.\nI am now emotionally damaged by canned food.\n\nFinal Score: Trash game. Broken mechanics. Toxic players. I’m logging back in tonight.",

You'll die from starvation, disease, other players, and countless mistakes you didn't even know you could make. But that's exactly what makes it special. Every encounter matters. Every decision has weight. The tension of hearing footsteps in a building you thought was empty, or successfully making it through a firefight alive; these moments stick with you.\r\nDayZ was the game that made me personally make the switch from years of console gaming to PC, and I haven't looked back since. If you're willing to embrace the very steep learning curve and accept that failure is part of the experience, DayZ offers an unmatched survival game that no other title has quite managed to replicate yet.",

The world is harsh, unpredictable, and incredibly immersive. You’re not just fighting zombies; you’re fighting hunger, weather, and sometimes your own bad choices.\n\nWhat makes DayZ special is the stories you create. One day you’re scavenging alone in the woods, the next you’re teaming up with strangers who might save you… or betray you. No two encounters feel the same, and that tension is what keeps me coming back.\n\nThe atmosphere is unmatched: the sound design is eerie, the map is huge and full of hidden details, and the survival mechanics feel rewarding once you learn them. The game has come a long way over the years, and the updates have made it smoother, more stable, and much more fun to play.\n\nIf you enjoy genuine survival, player-driven stories, and high-stakes moments where your heart is pounding out of your chest, DayZ is absolutely worth it. It’s tough, unforgiving, and sometimes frustrating—but that’s exactly why it’s so memorable.\n\nOne of the best survival games out there. Bring patience, bring courage, and bring a can opener.

A lot of bugs still, and when I say that I mean potentially game-breaking ones. \n\n97%+ of servers are part of a botnet that tries to install malicious Steam Workshop repacks and probably cryto-mine on your rig. The servers you do find are likely shit. Being a decade and a half old, people know all the best ways to raid your crap already, the best base spots are known, and any populated server you join I hope you have no attachment to any of your items or any real hope of.. \"progressing\" unless you've got 100+ hours and know your way around already. \n\nOn that topic.. This game has no progression, and it masks it with the \"hardcore survival\" BS. It wants you to keep restarting to hide the fact that there is no real endgame. \"Veterans\" are just geared up with ghillie suits and SVDs with 40 buried and underwater stashes around the map sniping freshies who just spawned. There is really nothing to do once you master the mediocre survival aspects and aren't in a group messing around 24/7. Oh, I know! Let's loot another military base (maybe get sniped by a no life doing so). Or get an empty farmhouse with a damaged sweater and ballcap in it. I've not enjoyed the gunplay either. Despite once being an Arma-engine based game, the shooting feels clunky and requires adjusting to. The bullet velocity and drop isn't all that, either, and it moreso is to just add another layer of tedium. \n\nThat's all this game is. Tedium tedium tedium. You spawn half starved and dehydrated so you spend 7-10 minutes filling those up every life. It adds up. Enjoy the iZurvive map because you're going to be looking at it an ungodly amount of time. No in-game map function and when you do eventually find one it's useless because it's essentially a piece of paper in game, doesn't track your location or make it worth using at all. There are MANY useless items they add pretending players will use them when really top players all just want a DMR and plate carrier. And yet, they refuse to fix any bugs. I've followed development all the years I didn't own this pile of trash - I waited this long for a reason. I finally gave in, and admittedly had some fun, but I can't recommend it in it's current state, or ever really. If they can't get it right after almost two decades it's pretty obvious this is a long-con cash cow a la Fortnite.\n\nHave I mentioned the building oversights? Or lack of tutorials on building, or that you can lock yourself into your base with no warning? Or that a sharpened stick can break your metal wall if it pokes it for ~30mins while you're offline and some noob can just take (or drop to despawn) everything you own while you aren't playing? Even better, if you manage to avoid getting raided your base items only last ~45 days if you don't interact with them (yes I know flags exist but that's just more BS to add on) and server wipes completely remove your hard work every few months. I could go on.\n\n It's fun for a bit, especially with friends,  just kinda lame after a while. Bohemia.. How the f*ck did you guys only manage this much in 15 years? No story (not required but would've been nice to have by now), no finality, no progression of any sort. Even friggin' TARKOV- the most hardcore of masochistic shooters out there lets you keep the stuff you extract with. Virtual object attachment aside, it just isn't worth 25$ on sale (because they refuse to put it lower than that, cheap, greedy, prideful nitwits) and CERTAINLY not worth 50$ full price. \n\nPlay Zomboid instead lol",

In theory this is fantastic, however all it takes is an admin from one community server to put you on the list for (whatever reason he wishes!). These aren't reviewed, controlled and are at the whims of admins. I ended up contacting CFTools to remove my info because I didn't want my precious account tarnished by a power tripping admin. So now I can either play official or a community server not using CFTools (most use it). Being at the mercy of individuals on a 40-50€ game and the mother company not caring about it's servers (no single player btw, so those servers are the main way to play).\n\nIn the end, I'd stay away unless you have enough friends or a group large enough to pay and play your own server.

Barely afloat, barely enough resources to do anything related to technical debt.\nPoorly implemented Enfusion engine, only halfway there.\nDev team was scaled down soon after full release, seniors usually leave the company, like Eugen Harton and Brian Hicks. Battleye does not work well enough against DMA cheats, server side anticheat is lacking, code changes this far in after all of these years are very resource heavy. The dev team only prioritizes content, security and stability. All devs are for the time being pretty locked to DLC crunch (Badlands)\nThe list goes on and on.\n\nHowever many great moments and overall a good experience for veterans.\n\n\nAll in all very frustrating experience for new players, even after all these years, would not buy unless friends are veterans and are patient.",

The mods did make it better, but it left a bad taste in my mouth that I'll never shake.\n\nQuick Review: \n~ It's a half baked game with little to no content, that's being held together by a modding community.\n~~ Huge props to the modding community, for trying to make the game what it should have been.\n\nReview:\n\n~Concept:\n~~ The game was a fantastic concept, but was poorly executed.\n\n~Technical:\n~~ Game constantly has technical issues which makes it feel more like an Early Access Alpha version (not even beta). If you think Early Access is bad in Steam.... You have no idea.\n\n~ Mechanics:\n~~ The mechanics are pretty trash and haven't shown any signs of improvement. Between a lack of fluidity, low quality animations, and tedious / poorly balanced survival mechanics.\n\n~ Empty Worlds:\n~~ This ties back into technical issues and a major lack of anything really populated. The world seems lifeless and you can go hours without seeing much (Walking Simulator). \n~~~ Thanks to the wonderful modding community, they are the only saving grace. Keep up the great work modders!\n\n~ Community:\n~~ Very toxic and stick to their cliques. \n~~ This is not new person friendly (excluding the PVE mods). The overall design of the game encourages paranoia / hostility / toxicity, which in turn fosters aggressive tendencies and griefing. \n\n~ Bare Bones Sandbox:\n~~ I do enjoy sandboxes, but the game is completely missing depth. There's little to no objectives, a major lack of things to do, player driven drama to make up for the shortcomings of the game (ties back into toxic community).\n\n~ Brief Summary: \n~~ The only thing keeping this game alive is the modding community.",
