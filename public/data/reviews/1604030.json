PvP is ok, just the usually higher level lurkers and cowards waiting for you at ore spots and attacking you while doing bosses, often in 2v1 battles, preventing you from leveling up too much too quick, are a nuisance. Server resets are annoying, having to re-farm everything again is not my kind of play, but you can host your own game thankfully.",

      "review": "Having fully finished V Rising I can confidently say that it is one of the best open world survival craft games. From a nice blend of survival/crafting and ARPG to great atmosphere of being a vampire in a hostile world, prowling for blood (hopefully the good quality) was a blast to play.\r\n\r\nLet's break it down briefly:\r\n\r\nThe game plays and looks amazing, I absolutely adore the art style, animations, and effects. Combine this with the smoothness of the combat, a myriad of spells and weapons to choose from and you receive an experience that can stay fresh for long hours.\r\n\r\nA part that I wasn't so sure about at first were the building mechanics. Some trial and error and getting to know how everything works changed my mind to see it as one of the more enjoyable building systems, albeit quite simple. However, the decorating and furnishing really ties everything together nicely in the end.\r\n\r\nBut what really made me fall deep into this game was the soundtrack. Early game, wandering through the woods at night and listening to the haunting, somber, yet very soothing melodies of Farbane Nights by Migova was truly an ethereal experience. The music fits greatly with the various areas that are present in the game, satisfyingly conveying the atmosphere. Also, the fact that every zone has a day and night soundtrack works perfectly with vampire's night prowling/sun avoiding mechanics. \r\n\r\nOverall, V Rising is one of the best games of its kind that I've played. Having been postponing playing it for a long time I was pleasantly surprised once i finally gave it a try. In fact I was hooked almost immediately and for a quite a long time. If you like open world survival games or ARPG games then I would definitely give it a try as well. If you like both and enjoy some gothic aesthetics, this one might be a jackpot!",

The first quest is basically: wake up from your coffin and return to that land which was… well, at least close to us on older maps.\n\nI learned that reclaiming my old Transylvanian estates doesn’t require diplomacy at all — just a vampire cloak and some basic resources. Castle-building is 10/10, sunlight is 0/10, and the local peasants really don’t appreciate being treated as walking blood bags.\n\n10/10, would play again as soon as the sun goes down. <3",

      "review": "V Rising Game Review\n(Disclaimer - This is just my opinion and may be disliked. Please know I only recommend playing the game once and seeing what it is about as it really isn't the best game out there. Also, I played the game after early access.)\n\n(General)\n1. This game is an action, role-playing, survival game. \n2. You play as a vampire trying to reign over a kingdom again.\n3. You can play with up to 4 players including ourself and it is also not necessary to buy a server to host a game (you can just host from the game servers itself, etc).\n\n(Positive)\n1. The character customization has a decent amount of options and can be altered in game.\n2. The armor made in game and the cosmetics unlocked in game also adds to having a decent character appearance. \n3. The vampires in game are very Bram Stoker vampires in that they have animal forms, sunlight hurts them, garlic repels them, etc.\n4. The bosses you fight to complete the story have diversity, some are funny, some are cool, etc.\n5. The building mechanic for the game is really good and easy so that adds to making base building fun.\n6. The game has survival elememts like needing to keep your blood reserves full, base building and resource collection to further weapon, armor, etc building.\n7. The graphics is well done and the game is pretty. (Big plus is that they didn't use Unreal Engine)\n8. There is a lot of armor, weapon and skill (spell power) diversity making your characters versitile and unique.\n9. It is worth noting that with some armor or coemstics you can semi change the colors making it feel even more unique.\n10. You can make servants in the game helping with the resource collection.\n11. You can get prisoners to help you not run out of blood sources, or go look for it the whole time.\n\n(Negative)\n1. It is hard to sometimes properly see the designs of bosses as they move a lot during boss fights and don't look exactly like their codex photos.\n2. The farming of resources to fight bosses, etc starts to feel excessive, repitive and annoying close to the end when it starts to feel like it isn't really making too much of a difference anymore.\n3. The bosses don't have distinct patterns and sometimes beating the boss is just pure luck. (Dark Souls, for example, the bosses are difficult, but the patterns are learnable and can be overcome just by how fast you grasp their concepts.)\n4. Not all the weapons, armor, pendants, rings, and skills (spell power) are as great, or useful as others. (This takes away from it meaning any build can work to fight bosses and starts to put players all in the same category making it kinda useless to have other options.)\n5. It feels like some aspects of the game have a lot of attention and others not so much making stuff slip by that can really add to the game. (Some examples of this: The bosses sometimes lack in concept or abilities, the armor, etc that feels like it makes little difference later on, the skills (spell power) that has some that are evidently better than others, the blood quality that also doesn't make too much of an evident difference and something as simple as words in blocks over lapping the block and looks unneat.) (For the game not being in early access especially the last example shouldn't be a thing, but is left as the devs priorities seem to be elsewhere and not for the better.)\n6. DLC's mostly add cosmetics to the game and need to be bought being as-good-as a micro-transactions.\n7. Armor, weapons, etc specs percentages for certain buffs don't really greatly differ from starter stuff and a lot of the time are so low that it barely feels that you have a buff.\n8. Even though you have multiple forms that you can change to there is really little use for the majority of them.\n9. Also, they don't really explain bosses in the codex when you track them and you can fight a boss with the same spell-power meaining they don't cancel each other out. I just find this odd.\n10. Servants take quite long to return from resource hunts, and it feels like the timer only decreases when you are in game. (I haven't experienced that in game things don't continue when you are logged out for online games often, so just noting it.)\n11. The Stygian Circle, Eye of Mortium and Tombs are not really useful. The map shows basically what the Eye of Mortuim shows and you can farm more stuff in the field than the Stygian Circle or Tomb offers plus it takes too long.\n12. You can only have 1 coating, resistance and buff available at a time. \n13. The game doesn't show you any sign as to weather your buffs are being stacked, multiplied, decreased, etc.\n14. The golden quality pendants collected from bosses close to the end of the game and head gear in the game moves to your bag and becomes unequip when you get dropped and come back. This makes it annoying to keep having to re-equip, especially the pendants while you are in combat and need it.\n\n(I don't hate the game, but it does need work. It is, however, really not bad if you came accross it and played it once.)\n\nTips (This might only make sense when you play):\n1. Collect a lot of all resources from early game even if it is something like plant fiber.\n2. Make use of servants and prisoners. (Just make sure to keep prisoner misery levels managed and don't send servants to hunt areas higher than their capacity.)\n3. Take your time with boss fights.\n4. Stick to what you are comfortable.\n5. Make use of Vermin nests, 1st and 2nd Tier Stygian farms (on both levels even if you are high enough to do 2nd Tier still do a bit of both), and gardening as it really does help with late game resource farming.\n6. Spend the coins you get at the market places and invest in seeds especially.\n7. Take the time and build at least 4 bases (the max capacity of bases buildable) well placed accross you map to make the flow of things easier as you progress as the game is rather linear.\n8. Fight corrupt bosses, especially Megara, while having corrupt blood consumed as it does help to take less damage from her and people like that, but makes you take more damage against other bosses and adds.\n9. Make use of holy resistance potions. (It does help.)\n10. Late game, try to only use the 2nd Tier Stygian unlocked Passive Abilities.\n11. Prioritize a weapon that is close and long range. (Axe, spear, scythe, etc for example.)\n12. Chaos Magic and Phantom Aegis Shield in Illusion is something I would recommend.\n13. Constantly make sure things are in production to assist with late game so things are always prepared.\n14. Make use of fire resistance brews as I've found this element does the most damage quickly.",

      "review": "(Single player review)\r\n\r\nVery fun and polished game with a good UI and decent controller support, in the survival/crafting genre that is not always a given. There is a blend of typical mechanics (crafting stations, gathering materials and climbing tiers) but also a fair share of mechanics from the vampire theme and some of them integrate very well with the rest, creating a familiar yet original experience. \r\n\r\nCombat starts off pretty simple but becomes increasingly more varied. You don't end up with tons of skills or abilities but rather are able to switch freely through different spell schools and weapon types that all bring something different, so there's a lot of options to choose from which is great, although once I found a comfortable set of weapons and spells I found it hard to switch to anything else.\r\n\r\nThe grid-based base building was very satisfying and with the way inventory management is done, way less of a hassle than some other games I've played. Building adequate rooms in your base will provide you with some bonuses which makes spending some time building a cozy place really rewarding, and provides another reason to decorate it as you'll be traversing and using those rooms regularly.\r\n\r\nI found the game very well balanced when it came to how much resource I was able to hoard vs what I was required to spend to keep progressing and it created a very satisfying loop of going out to gather stuff or beat bosses and coming back to upgrade my base and process my loot. After a while, you're able to automate getting some resources through sending followers on missions. I didn't love this mechanic being based on real time (e.g. you send them on a 16-hour mission which means you're penalized for long playing sessions and overly rewarded for playing a little bit every day). In general I don't like games dictating how often and how long I should play them. Still this was only a minor part of the game, and I was able to gather myself any material I needed anyway.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty felt right throughout the game, with some challenges here and there, though I kind of hit a wall with the very final bosses and didn't feel like it was worth it for me to really try hard (as I was already maxed out on upgrades, consumables, and minor power boosts). A bit sad to not close the playthrough with a satisfying finale, but I'm okay with the idea of a tough final challenge, I'm just not up to it. Looking up strategies online, it seems multiplayer is much less of a struggle since you're able to revive each other.\r\n\r\nAll in all a very enjoyable game, the kind that makes you forget real time passing and really immerses you in the whole gothic vampire fantasy. I didn't get to experience the coop aspect of it but it seems like that would be a fun time too! (although PvP features seemed pretty intense and a big turnoff for me, but I'm sure it's configurable)",

I just did one play through but I tried to be as completionist as possible and fully built 3 level 5 castles, crafted max level jewels with max stats for every spell, and collected every legendary weapon.  \r\n\r\nThe DLC are a little expensive, but also not required.  If you're 100% into just making the coolest looking castle, then they sorta are required.  You can actually build things for clan members, so if you have a friend with DLC you can have them make most DLC content items for you in your house, then you rearrange to your liking.  \r\n\r\nSame was for most cosmetic outfits.  Wish there were more of these too.  Another gripe I have about the game is the inability to choose your armor colors.  They sometimes have a color palette you can choose from that has 4 colors pre-determined, but the 4 colors are mostly not attractive combos.  They have cool hats you can find in the game, but NONE of the colors on the palettes match the hats, so you look like a clown if you try to wear one.\r\n\r\nBiggest downside is there is not more content.  Maybe they'll release more, or a sequel or different themed game.  Crossing my fingers.",

With friends you can alternate between healing and attacking a boss (i.e. V Blood) making it way more forgiving for mistakes.\n2) High skill cap means you might get stuck in progression multiple times until you get better at playing (learning boss attacks and countering with player skills) - gear/spell progression tied to beating bosses so if you get stuck on a boss you can't just skip and come back or grind up level/stats\n3) Certain crafting materials can be quite the grind to acquire (highly recommend increased resource harvesting on private server settings) \n\nNote: I can only speak to private server PvE Solo & Team and have not played PvP or official server PvE.",

A big part of it is the top-down perspective as opposed to being in 1st or 3rd person. Also the devs do a good job of  creating the fantasy of living as a vampire trying to build your power. It's a simple detail, for example, but when you're out in the daytime you've got to dart between the shadows lest you get  your face melted off by the sun.\r\n\r\nThe combat is that classic combo of \"easy to learn, tricky to master,\" but there's a bunch of different weapon types, each with very unique move sets, along with numerous spells and powers giving the player plenty of options to use to build whatever playstyle suits their tastes the best. Some of the bosses can get kinda cheesy, but the player's got more than enough tools to work with in order to cook up some super cheesy builds to fight back.\r\n\r\nOne thing I can say is that it sure as hell is a better vampire game than Bloodlines 2. But honestly I'd recommend anyone that likes survival/base building games to give it a shot.",

I played on a custom server that I hosted myself so I could adjust all of the crap things like degradation and blood loss etc that people said was a negative for the game so it is more skewed towards that especially as I played with friends however the world of v raising is so lived in and contributes so much to the overall aesthetic of the game especially as there are many different segments of the map each offering a different set of objectives, drops, encounters etc. that the user can pick and choose how they progress. The progression really isn’t that bad and the bosses that you fight in order to upgrade your character are honestly so good with them being just the right amount of BS and actual good encounters where it feels like a souls game where if you get good at it and memorise the attack patterns and methods that the bosses use then you can very quickly adapt and kill them. The friend experience is seamless, the game runs fantastic and has a lot of options to adjust your experience especially on a server. The building is great as well with it being quite unique from my point of view however in a good way, the decorations as well just are simply amazing. I hope they keep adding updates to this game and contribute more towards it as I’m excited to see where it goes in the future\n\n7 / 10",

Every new area brings fresh resources, environmental themes, and opportunities to advance your castle or improve your gear.\r\n\r\nOne of the most positive surprises is the progression system: your power depends entirely on your gear, not on traditional RPG experience. This design works extremely well, making progression feel more organic and tied directly to crafting, exploration, and defeating bosses.\r\n\r\nThe bosses are a major highlight. Each one features distinct mechanics, requiring strategy and proper timing to defeat. Beating them rewards you with key items, abilities, recipes, and structures, making every victory feel meaningful.\r\n\r\nThe game also offers three difficulty levels, which you can adjust at any time, allowing players to tailor the challenge to their preferred playstyle. On top of that, there are numerous skills and ultimates that help shape your ideal build.\r\n\r\nAnother fun mechanic is the ability to unlock multiple forms, such as wolf, rat, or bat. Each form has its own purpose, making exploration faster, stealthier, or simply more stylish.\r\n\r\nThe presence of private servers and the option to play entirely in PvE was a huge plus for me. It allowed me to explore the world at my own pace without any external pressure, fully enjoying the dark atmosphere and steady progression.\r\n\r\nFor players who love building and decorating, the castle system is fantastic. Creating, expanding, and customizing your own vampiric fortress is extremely satisfying and adds even more depth to the overall experience.\r\n\r\nEven after defeating the final boss, the game continues: the endgame revolves around grinding for ancestral weapons, upgrading gear, and improving your servants’ equipment, giving you plenty to do if you want to keep going.\r\n\r\nOverall, V Rising delivers a rich, stylish, and immersive adventure perfect for fans of survival games, base building, and action, all wrapped in a captivating gothic vampire world.",

And you move with WASD. This is surprisingly important for my enjoyment. \r\n\r\nServer settings can be tweaked to make the game a lot easier for the resource grinding portion or make the survival by lower day time... or make it a lot harder by multiplying those values. I haven't played in multiplayer yet and I haven't touched any public servers, but I still find this game a lot of fun.\r\n\r\nSome of my issues are the kinda clunky combat which reminds me of Monster Hunter and how you need to plan your attacks and spell casts a little ahead of time. The map is static as far as I know, so once you find a resource spot you know where to find it later. Would be nice to have a way to make a marker on the map for this purpose. Character movement speed is kind of slow, which adds to the survival aspect but makes it very annoying to try to go long distances. You only have 2 skills per weapon and 2 spell slots (as far as I currently know), which can be sad because the game has a great amount of interesting spells. This may be a balancing feature for the multiplayer.",

It's so refreshing to see an Early Access title come to full fruition, and this game does that and so much more. This is a complete gaming experience and encapsulates everything you could ever want or expect being a vampire.\n\nThere is an enormous amount of content and so many playstyles thanks to a very unique and deep weapon/skill system. There is an emphasis on PvP, but you can also host your own server and play entirely PvE by yourself or with friends, with customizable rule settings for difficulty. Too many games don't allow that kind of freedom.\n\n10/10 looking forward to whatever Stunlock puts out in the future.",

      "review": "TLDR - V Rising is a very fun game. Solo or with friends it's a blast!\n\nAt its core, V Rising is a survival–RPG hybrid where you play as a weakened vampire trying to reclaim your powers. Like Valheim, you can create your own world, invite friends or join official servers. \n\nI played on PvE servers (from EA to 1.0 - both solo, in duos and in full 4man clans) because I love the base-building and boss-hunting loop. The story is minimal but effective: consume the blood of foes, regain lost powers and eventually confront Dracula himself. But what elevates the game is how deeply it leans into the vampire fantasy. Blood is your lifeline, used to survive, cast abilities and maintain your castle. Sunlight burns you alive! Garlic weakens you with a stacking debuff. It's awesome!!!\n\nUnlike many survival games, V Rising puts real emphasis on combat and it’s excellent. There are no traditional classes, but various blood types act as pseudo-classes: Scholar for spell damage, Warrior and Brute for melee builds and so on. Add in six magic schools, customizable abilities and weapons with unique skills and you get a level of flexibility that encourages experimentation.\n\nProgression is centered around defeating V Blood bosses (57 in total) - each unlocking new crafting stations, gear tiers, spells and upgrades. The structure is linear but satisfying and late-game boss farming for gems, loot and books keeps the endgame loop somewhat engaging (there is definitely room for improvement).\n\nBuilding your vampire castle might be the most enjoyable base-building experience I’ve had in a survival game. Choosing a good location matters, especially on official servers where prime spots disappear quickly. You’ll probably relocate your castle at least once and the new castle relocation system in 1.0 makes that painless. Instead of shuttling items across the map like in early access, you now build a relocation heart and bring your entire castle with you. It’s a massive QoL upgrade.\n\nThere’s still the expected survival-game resource grind, but the game softens the blow with servants who gather resources for you, shady merchants and plenty of efficient farming routes.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed playing this game and I will come back every time new content is getting added.",

For a game whose entire premise hinges on crafting, the crafting is not really executed in a way that's enjoyable.  While the multiplayer integration is well-handled there are too many issues with the crafting part of the crafting game that is ultimately a turn-off.

It's the small inconveniences and negligible progression that made me give up on the game. Wanted to love it because of the gorgeous art style, but that's probably the best thing about the game. Combat is frustrating with really bad mob tethering that can reset a boss fight randomly. Maintaining blood and grinding for vanity is a chore. There's basically no story. Game had so very much potential, but fell extremely flat.\r\n\r\nBrutal difficulty feels pretty poorly designed. Enemies are hit point sponges and they didn't put a lot of thought into numbers tuning. Moves that are pretty unavoidable do huge chunks of damage, while you are really limited in your options for becoming tankier or healing. Especially during a fight, you have almost no options for useful consumables in the first half of the game. Gear has almost no customization options, you basically just pick a weapon. Your basebuilding and the survival elements really only serve to build armor/weapons/consumables and the materials they require. This makes those parts of the game pretty hollow. Ooh you upgraded from a shitty wooden coffin to a stone one! But... they have the same exact effects. You can decorate your castle pretty cool, but none of it affects gameplay and is all locked behind grinds for resources. Even if you do make the castle feel like home, you don't really have anything to do in there besides RP. A lot of this game feels like a framework, I'm shocked there isn't at least official mod support or something. I guess then it would be harder to sell their myriad of cosmetic DLCs, without which vanity items are pretty limited.",

      "review": "I don't know, maybe this just isn't a game for my play style, but I find V Rising to be immensely frustrating in so many ways.  On the one hand, it looks like a game that would be very fun, and feel rewarding to play throughout the process of gearing up, farming resources, building up the castle, and then killing bosses.  You know, kind of Valheim-esque, but as a top-down ARPG type of game.  Except the game kind of stymies any sense of excitement as you go through.  Granted, I'm only around 40% through the bosses, so maybe some of this changes later.  But it's been 11 hours of playtime and hard to justify trying to devote more.\n\nFirst of all, you run at a snail's pace, and this game requires a lot of running.  Sure, you have the wolf form but that's horribly slow too.  It's agonizing trying to run through the map.  And that's out of combat.  It's equally agonizing to fight bosses at this pace of movement.  I've seen people say the game would be too easy if you could move faster ... but like, plenty of games that allow faster movement and/or sprinting are still difficult?  EVEN IF everything else in the game were perfect, just the amount of time you waste moving around is straight up irritating.\n\nMy second big gripe is that the game simply doesn't feel very rewarding.  Other than the required \"plot\" of killing bosses, the reward for said bosses generally just doesn't alter your gameplay really at all.  You get new skills sure, but every skill I saw more or less feels like the same skill in a different font.  And of course you do get new castle buildings along the way, but these don't really negate your need to still go out and farm materials in a lot of cases.  I found many of the castle buildings to not really be worth using very often.    \n\nBut, you say, at least the boss rushes are fun right?  Well I seem to be in the minority here but I simply don't see how y'all are finding these fights enjoyable.  Because of the length of cooldowns and the nature of the skills you have at any given time, much like the spells, every boss fight feels like the same fight in a different font.  Except some summon larger or smaller numbers of adds (though most summon at least 2 recurring adds throughout).  \n\nAgain, I'm really not sure what I'm missing but I simply do not understand the very positive reviews here.  Everything in the game feels like the same thing, but reskinned.  Weapons all feel the same, skills all feel the same, boss fights all feel the same.  It's kind of frustrating, but most of all boring.",

      "review": "To be fair, this is more of a neutral review, but depending on what you are looking for, it might be negative.\n\nLet's start with the good. The idea, the visual execution of it is fantastic here, building up your castle and decorating it is a bliss, one of a kind and you could be the least creative person on the planet and still make a good looking vampire lair.\n\nThe combat. It's simple, very much in the same vein league of legends is, as far as the ability kit you are provided is. You have a handful of slots you fill with skills of your choice that you can alter and adjust with gems for them to do what you want or what the situation demands. The attack loop for most weapons is nice and chunky and the skills with said weapons are for the most part pretty darn good to use and feel impactful. There are handful of exceptions, which used to be good and then devs nuked it because PvP balance, we'll get to that.\n\nThe grind. As long as you don't mind it and are a fair enjoyer of survival games, the grind for resources here is fairly forgiving, at least as far as the basic resources go and it's kind of the point of the game, to hoard everything you find, the only drawback really is the inventory size that for the amount and variety of stuff you will grow to need feels just too small, even with the largest inventory upgrades.\n\nThe bad and the bizarre.\n\nThere is no true single player, the game forces a server no matter what your preferred play is, and if your connection is spotty, expect disconnects, which is unforgivable, it would take minimal effort to implement an offline save, but that just never happened, because... why?\n\nThe bosses can be hit or miss, which I suppose can be expected, but some of them truly suffer from some Dark Souls hitboxes and combined with this, the mobility in this game isn't really as great as you would expect it to be. And you can get stunlocked or combo'd very easily, especially with rifts, which are basically random boss encounters accompanied by trash mobs and the stuns and charms in this game are really, REALLY long.\n\nThe final rewards for elite boss kills, which will kind of connect to the final point I will make afterwards. They are awful, absolutely f***ing terrible. From the final few bosses you get special shards that are meant to be shards of absolute power. Want to know what massive, MASSIVE powers they give you as rewards for you beating the toughest of the tough bosses? They give you a couple percentage points against other vampires, as in other players and a fairly underwhelming ultimate skill, and chances are your own ultimates will be better than those at that point... Yeah... They are meant to be the reason why people would want to fight and kill each other in this game. They are abysmally bad, for them to be the \"Trophy\" items.\n\nNow the bizarre\n\nThe devs' approach to this game is mindboggling. From removing sandbox options for no reason to intentionally hard steering this game into its PvP component when they can visibly see people come back and play each and every time when they release a PvE update is just... confusing... They are trying so hard to turn this into Tarkov with vampires and that's just not what people clearly come to this game for, but they are dead set in doing so. And as a result they \"balance\" the game for PvP, meaning they intentionally remove or balance a lot of fun components out of the game, such as the trophy items I mentioned above, because they used to be really cool and impactful and now they are just something you throw onto a pillar and leave it there and never think about it again.\n\nSo, if you look to play this game for its PvP, go for it, it's fairly okay, if you are looking for something to grab a handful of friends to for coop, there are better alternatives, maybe not with vampires, but still, there are options that accommodate that better than V Rising. I really want to love this game, I mean you can see the hours. I just... with each update... even if it's decent as a whole, it feels like the devs are losing the plot more and more with those little changes on the sidelines that ultimately strip the game from the fun things for the sake of PvP that absolute minority of people play.",

      "review": "this game started fantastic. got some crafting, got some ARPG, build your vampire castle, resource management, make stronger gear and fight harder enemies. \nSo now... why the \"not recommended\" vote?\nWell, things are fine and peachy until you start getting to later segments of the game where the developers start trying to fuck you in the ass with some enemy \"mechanics\" where they start making things take a LOT of work to even attempt, in what almost feels like a desperate grasp at trying to extend the time it takes you to actually move along with the game. The first thing you'll notice is that bosses start having attacks that predict your movement. What do I mean by this? Well normally an enemy attacks you and it attacks where you are, right now, and usually has a bit of a windup animation that allows you to move and not get hit.....unless you're one of those players that goes full Leeroy Jenkins and tries to brute force it with raw damage. Ok now...what this prediction does is, it measures your movement direction, speed, and distance from  the boss so that it attacks where you are GOING to be once the attack actually launches... so if you're strafing to evade and you just keep strafing, you WILL get hit because it has measured where you ARE going to be. I'm sure a lot of you have seen stuff like this and think \"Oh, I know this trick, just stop moving or move the other way.\" And to that I say \"yeah, kinda\" because it will keep tracking you until the last second, and then some normal/elite enemies will also do this later on... yes, normal enemies.. that you'll be fighting in groups, and also crowd control abilities from other enemies that \"charm\" you. But of course the worst is still the bosses because THEY are the ones that hurt a LOT. Then bosses also start to spam you with abilities and also call in support to help fight and suddenly the game isn't even the same game any more, now you're playing a fucking bullet hell game like touhou, except you have to also deal with abilities that fucking track you and your movement, and trying to not get hit by attacks that chunk 1/4 of your fucking hp each time. This shitty artificial difficulty spike really sucks and is absolutely infuriating because you're now keeping track of so many goddamn things on your screen that using your basic attack is almost suicide because you can't afford to stop to do that low ass damage. the game devolves into running away like a bitch and trying to spam your abilities whenever they come off cooldown and also stalling so your 8 second cooldown \"dodge\" is available to save your ass from an attack that would have otherwise hit you and fucked you.\n\nI would only recommend this game if you'r really hardcore because otherwise you're going to get stupidly frustrated. If you want to get a rough idea, the bosses I thought were the most annoying so far are named Voltatia and General Valencia. There are a few others that were very bothersome but could still be worked out by seeing their pattern and cheesing them with the bow, but these two are especially egregious, one  with a laser attack that is increasingly harder to dodge at a distance and then CLONES herself so it becomes TWO lasers from ever changing angles and distances WITH summoning mobs and also places a barrier to block ranged projectiles/shots. The second one calls an iron maiden in the middle that will constantly try to pull you in with chain shots and the boss will also try to instant-dash behind you to kick you into it and it will not only chunk your life but also your blood (which is a mechanic in the game) and has an attack pattern that tries to fuck you if you are not moving correctly with a wide spear swipe and then a long thrust, and it fucks you because your move speed is NOT the same moving in all directions and she changes positions between the two consecutive attacks so that you don't just get to change your walk direction 90 degrees to dodge the long thrust, oh no no, you have to see where she's dashing to and then adjust your strafe to match where she is NOW. Go ahead, look up videos of what those fights look like. THEN you'll see if this is a game for you or not.",

Thumbs down to yet another game that advertises solo play but in reality it still relies on a multiplayer server for solo play and has penalizes the solo player by harder difficulty and lesser features. Could of been great but falls very short for this reason.",

My inventory clogs up with resources and gemstones and various intermediate products which suggests that I could maybe do something with all this stuff, but then it's just a timegated grind to transform it into stuff that I can use to craft some slightly improved version of an item that I already had so I can increase some stat by 3%. \n\nI guess maybe building the castles could offer some creative outlet once you get far enough, but combat is uninteresting so far and the logistics and crafting elements are equivalently dull. There is no story to speak of, no characters, and an uninteresting setting. The only possible redeeming element I could see here is multiplayer, in particular pvp, but for me that's a negative, not a positive.",

      "review": "TL;DR Foundations of a good game, but frustrating to interact with and bad accessibility wise\n\nPro:\n- Variety of skills and weapons to choose from, including upgrades to said skills. This encourages playing around with builds\n- A lot of content to explore, gradually unlocking more and more as you go. It keeps you engaged for quite a while. Unlocking new skills and improvements to skills also frequently makes you reevaluate and potentially adjust your build which prevents getting bored\n- Fun way to unlock new things through bossfights. I'm usually enjoying pushing hard bosses to try and unlock new goodies. The fights can be reasonably challenging as well. V Rising is no dark souls, but the boss fights can take a few tries, even on normal difficulty. Which makes it all the more satisfying when you manage to kill them, especially if you're punching above your weight class and take on bosses a tier or several higher. Or in one occasion, i fought 2 bosses at the same time (probably because they were randomly in the same area), and it was one of the memorable and satisfying fights i've had because i actually managed to win. A good fight in this game is just incredibly fun!\n- Many options for customizing game rules, to adjust it from PvP to PvE / solo centric, for example if certain items prevent teleporting which would be really annoying when playing solo. Very nice!\n- Some limited mod support. Not great, but better than nothing\n\nCon:\n- Terrible accessibility: If you need to have no flashing lights in a game, don't play V Rising. There's a whole area of the map later with constant lightning happening. It's seriously awful. I contacted the developers about it, and got no signs of intending to add better accessibility options in the response. Come on, this is absolute basic stuff! There are no subtitles either. At least there is a screenshake option, but that's about it\n- Balancing of weapons and skills feels off, some weapons feel terrible to use compared to others. same for skills. It's not much of a choice for me personally and for example i find the bow by far the best ranged weapon (of unlocked ones so far) and generally ranged weapons seem to be the go-to. which is a shame because there are so many melee weapons, and it'd be nice if it felt like a good idea to use them\n- A lot of RNG (randomness) later on. For example: Endgame weapons have different ability modifications that buff a specific ability, and also attribtes which can themselves have 1 of 4 qualities. So you have to gamble to get the combination of ability mod and 2 attributes, AND also good rolls on those 2 attributes. Getting a perfect weapon is very unlikely, which means a lot of grinding. You can also find upgrade gems for skills, but they're also randomized both with their attributes and values so same issue. There are other instances of RNG too, for example unlocking random techs using scrolls, but i don't really have a problem with that specifically.\n- Not enough information. There are a lot of places where the game just hints at something and you're left wondering what it really means. If you look in the tech tree, it doesn't tell you where you make a recipe for example. Or more generally, what some unlock is. I think there are also some passive abilities, but i just don't know because the game doesn't tell you. You also do not get told where to unlock things, you just have to know. There are no search functions for this either. V Rising could really profit from QoL features from the lieks of factorio: Search functions everywhere, a clear tech tree with info on where recipes get made etc etc. You shouldn't need a wiki to look up basic info on how to play the game\n- Lack of options for PvE. While there are a lot of game settings available, there are still some remnants that make playing PvE / solo more annoying than they should be. It's not terrible, but not perfect\n- Controls: By default, pressing the number key for the weapon you have equipped again unequips that weapon which often gets in the way. There is a setting to change it, although why is it enabled by default at all? Took me some time to even find\n- lack of QoL. A lot of manual item shuffling around. You can build buildings from central storage, but you can't make recipes that way and you have to manually get the ingredients from chests and feed them into machines. You can't queue items that depend on each other either, so if you want to make an advanced item of clothing that requires a lower tier, you first have to wait before the lower tier one is finished crafting before you can queue the advanced one. Very annoying and cumbersome\n- Splitting stacks defaults to 1, i think halving as default makes more sense but you can argue about that. What you can't argue about is that it's still annoying to use otherwise too, for example if you target a partial stack that you want to add a few items to, you can't do that. You have to target an empty slot, and then you can manually merge them. There is also no way to write a number, you have to use the slider and arrow keys which is just really cumbersome to use especially with a 1000 stack so the slider is very inaccurate\n\nOverall, it's just not very good. When i started out, i was really enjoying figuring things out and doing challenging fights, but over time the cracks just start to show. Now, every time i think \"Oh it could be fun to play again\" i play for maybe half an hour until i realize why i stopped playing. Interacting with the game is just frustrating in so many ways, and especially after reaching the area with constant lightning (and rain, for even more visual overload) i think i'm just done. It's so close to being a pretty good game, but it would need some more serious work on UI/UX and accessibility",

      "review": "this game was fucking miserable, and i still haven't finished playing it (stuck at fighting Dracula on Relaxed difficulty).\r\n\r\nI love this game, it's a masterpiece, but i can't fucking enjoy it. there's nothing wrong with the enemies, the world design, the mechanics, they're perfect in everything. The boss fights are good and the right amount of challenge. so why don't i reccomend it to anyone? well simply put this game has one giant problem that invalidates all the good aspects of it.\r\n\r\nTHE LAG/RUBBERBANDING IS ATROCIOUS\r\nthis is a problem i've had since the start: at random moments, sometimes while in my castle, while exploring, fighting, looting or even just standing afk waiting for resources to be refined i'd get hit with an insane amount of rubberbanding. I have no clue what the cause is, i've tried everything suggested: lower the quality of certain graphics like cloth or shadows, disable vsync, host a LAN server, i did all of those things combined and more and i still had rubberbanding issues, it got to the point where at the 20 hour or so mark of playing the game i had to lower the difficulty to even give me a chance at fighting the more complex bosses you begin to encounter in Chapter II and forwards (yeah i took it slowly at first to get a grasp so i finished chap. 1 in 20 hours) and i just put up with the insane randomic waves of rubberbanding that would happen without a reason. i'm 1000% sure that my device is not the issue, as the specs i have exceed the required minimum to play the game greatly (allowing me to play with max graphics and all) and that my internet connection isn't the issue either as it's rather good. moreover many people complaining about this same issue had devices with much better specs than mine and still encountered the same exact problem. I decided to just play and ignore the blatant issue up until now that i'm facing Dracula and even on Relaxed difficulty i find it almost impossible to beat him, the rubberbanding is just too much, it's basically once every 10 or so seconds and it caused me to die so many times. i've noticed that this rubberbanding issue has been brought up multiple times since the release, as most of the suggestions i found online were either from last year or even two years ago. I tried really hard to just deal with it and grind through it to at least finish the game, although i'd love to 100% it; I just can't see myself playing it any further after eventually killing Dracula and finishing the story. It doesn't seem there's a definitive fix for the rubberbanding, and i know i'm not the only one dealing with it, also i find it rather sad that in dozens of times i looked for a solution not even once i've stumbled across someone, from the dev team or part of the company, that aknowledged the issue and offered solutions. i don't know what that says about them but i don't honestly care, i just wanted to enjoy this game in it's entirety but this absurd rubberbanding issue is such a huge dealbreaker.\r\n\r\nonce again, I DON'T RECCOMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE, EVEN IF YOUR PC IS GREAT AND CAN HANDLE ANY KIND OF AAA GAME SLOP WITH TERRIBLE OPTIMIZATION, YOU'LL HAVE ISSUES WITH THIS ONE. THE GAME IS AWESOME, THE RUBBERBANDING RUINS IT ALL LIKE A BIRD SHIT LANDING ON YOUR HEAD AS YOU STEP OUT THE  FRONT DOOR.",

      "review": "First things first, this game is NOT a PvE game. Yes there are a lot of PvE things, but it's core design and default setup is PvP. So tweak a LOT of settings if you and a few friends are just playing the game on your own. AND DO NOT START ON BRUTAL. Even playing on easy mode to take on one boss again for reasons that make zero sense to me I still got my ass handed to me a few times.\n\nWhy? Because a lot of bosses (especially early to mid game) are insanely bullshit. They just have massive spam moves that deal 1/4 to 1/3 of your health and you have zero recovery options. No I'm not exaggerating when I say that, I literally mean you have zero recovery options. Your \"max\" health will drop as you take damage and can not be recovered until you are out of combat excluding ONE specific healing system which you can't manually use whenever you feel like it, and half the time it doesn't trigger during bosses. So your health bar will show three \"sections\" as it were. The red (current health), the black (recoverable health), and empty (the rest of your gauge you can't recover until out of combat). So even if you have healing potions, they are only like 25% effective when you're fighting because of this health system. Makes some sense in PvP I guess? I don't think it does (even if I haven't done PvP I see some systems and understand their point for PvP but the health one? not really).\n\nMovement... my god movement is annoying in this game. No running faster than you are without changing forms or using like one buff that you don't get for a long time??? You can get a horse but it can take damage so they're useless until later in the game where their death doesn't matter since you can respawn them at will, but that's in the last 1/3 of the game basically... Which means you'll be running around as a wolf for most of the game when you get it, and it's not much faster than you are normally.\n\nDodging? Fucking terrible. Ah yes waiting 8 seconds to dodge is a great thing in a game where it wants you to dodge every 3 seconds, fantastic design really. You do get some additional ways to avoid damage but half the time you don't get to use those to actually block damage because you don't know what moves are doing what to you and whether they can be blocked. I've blocked a rush move when most other rush moves just break any block/counter you typically have so why would I try at that point when I was taught not to do that? And they have ZERO indication of difference. Like many moves will be grabs but they don't visually look different from normal attack moves, so I don't know when to dodge and when to block/counter because I can't tell what's going to happen.\n\nNow the biggest issue this game has is progression, and it's the easiest way to tell this game was an early access game. Yes I literally thought to myself only about 1/4 of the way into the game \"was this an early access game?\" because progression is so fucking badly designed. I'm almost 100% certain they basically didn't change how the game progressed from it's early stages of development to now, why the fuck am I getting \"tier 1\" spells in the last few bosses of the game???? Why do I suddenly need to make the same piece of equipment 3-4 times and upgrade it multiple times to make my next set of equipment??? Why am I stuck several levels below a specific boss that I need to beat in order to gain more equipment level??? Usually the boss that holds the items you need to make better gear has a lot of bullshit going on, like massive environment damage that you can do nothing about but TRY to dodge and block it (assuming your block even works on it which usually it doesn't). Also ONLY bosses let you progress through the game, nothing else does. You are just getting resources from everything else... not a good way to progress IMO but that's what they did.\n\nBosses are both amazing and fucking terrible. I like a lot of things about this game, but some of the primary things in this game just bog the rest down way too much and make it insufferable. My friend and I have been playing this FOR THE FIRST TIME on BRUTAL difficulty. Which only changes damage taken and health of enemies... Easy mode should make bosses have only one phase with maybe 25% less health, Normal should be them with their default health but now they get a second phase to make normal feel really different from easy and make easy ACTUALLY easy, and hard mode... I guess can stay where it is...? I'm not sure what I'd suggest to change for hard mode... maybe make the bosses not have that much more health? Either way Easy, Normal, and Hard are just bosses and enemies have more or less health and deal more or less damage, the most pathetic way of doing \"difficulty\". At the very least you aren't gonna see repetitive bosses almost at all, some similar yes, but not just copy pasted bosses. That's nice, games struggle to do that these days.\n\nIn the end it feels like the game was going for an MMO kind of feel and started doing MMO like things but ended up just... not doing anything good for the player? There's no real \"builds\" in the game. Yes you can stack up certain \"buffs\" or \"mechanics\" but you can't become STRICTLY spell casing or STRICTLY ranged or STRICTLY melee, the game expects you to balance using all these things in certain ways or forces you to not use certain things because bosses just aren't compatible with playing that way. Most \"buffs\" you get are mostly minor stat changes, nothing actually game changing really. I didn't see anything and go \"HOLY SHIT I'M PLAYING A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GAME NOW!\" it was just \"oh... I get 8% healing from my spell power\" which isn't the damage you do but your raw stat so... in other words fucking nothing because my spell power STILL isn't over 100 yet and my health has reached nearly 900 so I'm healing still less than 10 hp from some of my spells... not that it matters since I can't heal past whatever arbitrary health point the game decides based on damage I've taken.\n\nI do like a lot of other things the game has done but the main points of the game just don't feel like they work well. It feels like the devs made a game in early access, added stuff, but didn't adjust the rest of the game for those things, they didn't streamline anything. For a long time you're going from one resource to the next and then suddenly at the end you need to keep reusing a few end game resources together but no early game resources... So you end up with a lot of useless garbage taking up space that you don't know is gonna be useless because usually these crafting type of games will have you still utilize those resources in some way and the game doesn't tell you what takes what until you learn them, yet has a lot of early game resources sitting in late game areas, I'm still getting paper from most enemies I kill when I no longer need them. Can I change those into more useful things? No not really, sure I can make them into scrolls and then schematics... but why do that when breaking some boxes or opening chests can net me the same amount with less hassle? And even then eventually I won't need schematics because I'll have learned everything and they have no additional uses. Maybe make it so I can change a servant's typing with schematics or something? I don't know.\n\nI just can't recommend you get this game really... if you are into PvP sure go for it... maybe on sale. But otherwise it's not a that fun of a game. The main parts of the game end up becoming the most annoying and irritating parts. Coming from someone who's done Calamity mod for Terraria a few times on the hardest setting, but I feel like I'm progressing and actually doing something. This game just makes me feel like I succeeded or progressed because it told me I could.",

Game tries hard to be Rust and fails miserably; it wants you to feel like you're playing Dark Souls but lacks the depth or mechanics necessary to feel that way. Brutal difficulty is definitely the best experience then cranking the resources up otherwise the grind is terrible.\n\nV Rising is clearly designed with the intent of mimicking Rust's gameplay by encouraging progress in PvP along with contested looting and ending with some people progressing to the end and being able to contest others freely. Then you reset the server and do it all over again. However, the bosses make this much more of a problem and really just don't mesh well with this at all. Honestly if the bosses were removed it might even make this work significantly better but you'd have to find another way for progress to work.\n\nIt definitely tries to make you feel like you're facing a challenging opponent from one of the Dark Souls games with the dash mechanic to avoid stuff and somewhat limited healing but the limited healing is not done well. When you take damage past a certain threshold (around 20% of your health) you start to take permanent health damage. This makes the healing potions close to useless and on top of that they heal over 10 seconds and any time you take damage you stop healing. You can heal permanent health damage out of combat with potions or blood which brings me to the other problem. You rapidly lose blood, buffs, and have to repair armor and weapons over time all of which expends many resources constantly which does not in any way evoke the same kind of challenge that Dark Souls does.\n\nEven the vampire aspect is lacking. Most people who want to play as a vampire like the idea of immortality but when you're so fragile that 90% of the normal humans in the game can one or two shot you at some point in the game.... Well, being more fragile than most humans sure doesn't feel great. There are many spells and other things that seem at least somewhat vampiric but most of them aren't balanced well. Sure, you can pick and choose, swap somewhat easily but later systems make it harder or more expensive. Most bosses have an optimal setup or two to beat them and looking information up after burning through a ridiculous amount of resources over a couple hours then using completely different spells from what you were using to beat the boss... it doesn't feel good, it doesn't feel like you accomplished anything. Even finding a good combination of spells to beat a boss on your own... it feels hollow, empty. That's what this game really feels like. Something hollow and empty, a product that was made to accomplish a task rather than something designed to be enjoyed or to entertain or even to challenge.\n\nI hope this helps someone, have a good day.",

The game, however, progressively got worse as we moved further: repetitive gameplay, unbalanced system. Dowload for incredible experience of standing by the side while your friend murders the boss because it is just EASIER when you do it alone (same thing about farming shards -- you simply get more if you get them by yourself). \n\nDracula was a huge disapointment. As a team of three, we had 42 tries on murdering him, and eventually had to let one of the players pass the first phase by himself (BECAUSE IT IS AGAIN EASIER). We finally managed to murder him, but i accidently revivified myself and didn't get any sort of reward for spending literal 8 hours of my life on this. \n\nOne of my friends also had repetetive connection issues, i experiences bags numerous times. If you are a fun of challenging gameplay which slightly drives you insane -- go to elder rings. This game drives you insane not because it is a fairly challenging warrior combat, but because it tries to be 3 things at once and isn't succesfull with any of them. \n\nHad fun playing around with the castle. Unique system, never seen it before. Recomend for that and than alone.\n\nCould be great if it wasn't for the balancing issue.",

The DEVS constantly go out of their way to make the players play the game in the way the DEV wants them to play. \n\nOn top of that, the code for this game is the highest quality spaghat. Since 1.1 and the massive nerfs to \"balance\" the pvp aspect:\n\n=Player movement nerfed by 50% and all movement enhancements no longer work. These enhancements however are still on all weps/gear with no adjustments. So you have entire gear sets and spells that are completely useless now. This was done to \"balance\" pvp.\n\n=All crafting speeds reduced by as much as 75%. Insanity. What used to take hours now takes DAYS to do.\n\n=The nerfing of all \"Dash\" spells with an 8 seconds CD and the removal of the \"Double Dash\". Bear in mind all aspects of gameplay from combat to boss mechanics were adjusted with \"Double dash\" as a mechanic. Now that \"Double Dash\" is no longer in the game, nothing has been done to tone down the Boss mechanics, meaning most if not all players will quit very early as some bosses will be nearly impossible to engage (Vincent comes to mind). This was done to \"balance\" pvp.\n\n=Nerfing of \"Vampire Shapeshifting\". Some shapeshifting spells would enhance your movements speed. They no longer do so the spell is now useless. Some made it so you could jump to ledges as intended, that was also removed. This was done to \"balance\" pvp.\n\nAll of the above nerfing breaks almost every other aspect of the game because the DEV is unfortunately incompetent when it comes to coding. \n\nI think you see the theme here.\n\nThis could have been an absolute banger of a PvE focused/Pvp lite game. I would have gladly sunk a lot of time and money into it as the premise is there. But the DEV does not want that. They want to shove pvp and skin packs down your throat. \n\nDear DEV: You will never balance pvp. Ever. And all that does is ruin the PvE, which is where 70% of the playerbase is. Why ruin your game for a niche amount of pvp players? Ridiculous. Of the servers still up only a very small percent are PvP and public.

As a player you are one of the slowest character in the game. Dash ability has 8s cooldown while enemies sometimes spam it 3-4 times in 3-4 seconds. (Movement speed should be increased 30-40% and dash should have 20-30% less cooldown time.\n- Why the hell horses feel soo bad to ride??? Wolf form feels far superior and it doesnt require extra work to keep it functional and always available everywhere. Wolf form and horses should be faster too, because i have to spend soo much time carrying resources from farming locations to my base.\n- As a new player i have no idea what to do against fire attacks. I could kill 8 level higher bosses meanwhile i cant deal with a boss that uses fire while it is 4 levels lower than me... Some sort of boss guide would be nice (like a mechanic where you have to discover boss weaknesses)\n- There is overall very little information about things in the game or at least it feels like that which makes me feel like im stuck on progression and having no idea what to do next.\n- It has extremely linear progression (im finished with 25-30% of bosses atm), if the game progression is already extremely linear, than hold my hand to know exactly where to go and what to do.\n- With 18 hours in the game i had very few options to get alternative gear. There is very limited amount of gear you can wear, this means if you feel weak you can't choose alternative progression to get stronger. I got stuck on a boss and i guess i will stay stuck on it... Give more gearing options or some sort of passives to be able to overcome difficulty spikes.\n- Whats up with the crafting times, why are they soo long? Please, do not waste my time with this! At least lower it by 40-50%. Also drop the flooring and roofing requirement to buff crafting speed and resources, it is an unnecessary limitation in building.\n\nOverall: 5/10.

Whatever you are playing cannot outrun a basic human. You are slow as a snail. And if that was not worse enough, there is no sprint option. You are stuck with that option until you unlock the wolf, who is marginally faster. Midgame, you will be fighting an old corpulent women with a walking stick. And she will outrun you. (!!!!)\n2. Teleport: Half of the items, all of which are necessary to progress, restrict you from using teleporters. I have a genuine desire to punch the person who decided that in the face. Really really bad antisynergy with point 1. Yes, you will, very slowly, carry every item you need manually to the base. Without sprint or fast travel.\n3. Spellcasting: Here, have 30 different spells. You are forced to choose between 2 which you are allowed to use in combat, The rest are purely decorative. Swapping spells in your base is easy though.\n4. I am playing singleplayer and my own world with no other players has connection issues. Every friggin minute I am forced to experience a disconnect, missing all skillshots and fully breaking immersion, with the regularity of a clock. Just why?!\n5. Combat feels unelegant. Your \"dash\" has a high cooldown and the counter actionis one of your 2 spellslots and also has high cooldown. So you either dance around the enemy with dash and counter, tickling away at its hp, or you facetank. Neither of that feels like playing a vampire. Dodging or parrying is not an option. See point 1, you are slow as a snail and you will be outrun by a basic human.\nDont think of yourself as a vampire, but as some random dude with a blood kink.\n6. Build Variety: What? Mate, theres a pattern here. There is no such thing as variety here. You will choose your spells and your weapons and thats it. Want to increase spellpower so you can cast more? NO! You will be using the only armor accessible to you and you will eat up the weapon damage increase you wont use!\n7. No modding. So no, that is a lost case.\n8. Castle relocation: Your castle is your base and you can even move it! It allows you to restructure everything for free. Quite elegant, right? Mate, did you forget the pattern already? Relocating takes a long time. You need to drink in between. If you leave the area for 30 seconds (!), which is not enough to drink, your entire relocation is UNDONE. \nNo, you are ofc not allowed to save the game. If you die, the castle relocation stops. \nDevs, please play your own game at least once. This would be immediately noticed and fixed if any of you actually tested your damn game.\n9. Bosses: Themes are interesting, execution is pathetic. Most bosses simply statcheck you. Your gear is either better or you lose. Skill is largely irrelevant. Difficulty does not derive from the AI, but from the tools it is allowed to use. Common spells include \"summon 10 allies in an empty area\", \"make yourself invincible and heal for 50% of your health\" or \"volcanomode\", where literally the entire area is covered by flames and you will continuously take undodgeable and unmitigatable damage. Rematches are irrelevant - as soon as your gear is 5 level above them, their damage approaches 0. To summarize: Piss poor game design, again.\nA game that attempts to walk the line between single and multiplayer and fails miserably at both. What a wasted potential.",

      "review": "On paper and at first, V Rising is a fascinating game that combines hack and slash ARPG gameplay with basebuilding crafting mechanics - but towards the middle of the game and onwards, the shortcomings involved with progression being hard tied to crafting gear and RNG-reliant research trees quickly turns the game into a grindy, frustrating mess.\r\n\r\nThe game's primarily about fast-paced combat with lots of killing enemies and whacking trees and ore nodes for materials to make equipment, and then using that equipment to battle a progressive series of bosses whose deaths reward the player with critical research and spell unlocks to facilitate more equipment, more crafting, and more options to expand one's playstyle.\r\n\r\nTherein lies some of the game's main issues: gear is often tied to killing certain key bosses, so one can only progress up to a certain point before those bosses must be killed in order to progress further.  Have you leveled up all your gear but still can't kill the boss?  Then you'll have to go into server or difficulty settings to accommodate for the inability to get any better equipment to make the fight any easier for yourself.\r\n\r\nThis isn't even in a linear difficulty curve: some bosses will provide a tremendous amount of trouble with homing attacks and hefty hitpoints, but then the higher level bosses after them will confusingly be much simpler fights with significantly lower health meters.  Some bosses will hit like trucks with nearly instant ramming moves with little to no windup animations and others will do easily telegraphed attacks that leave them reeling and vulnerable for the player to attack for a few seconds between patterns.  To say the difficulty curve is 'inconsistent' would be generous.\r\n\r\nMight be fun with friends, but as a solo experience it leaves a lot to be desired.",

      "review": "Overall, I wouldn’t recommend this game. It gives the deepest illusion of choice I’ve ever seen. At first — during Act 1 — it was genuinely interesting, but by the very first boss it became clear that the developers don’t really give you the tools to find creative solutions. They just want you to spend a lot of time grinding, retrying boss fights, running back to bosses, and memorizing their mechanics.\n\nWhat initially drew me in was the RPG aspect. There are some genuinely good ideas — for example, the castle-building system and the ability to relocate your castle which is great. I even managed to find a creative way to beat the Act 1 boss: I went ahead in progression, lured a few bosses to fight each other, and unlocked new abilities. It took me more time than anything else in the entire game, but it was the most fun I had. I even wrote a post about it — but honestly, the community turned out to be pretty toxic. The PvE community basically doesn’t exist, even though most players actually play the game for its PvE side.\n\nBy around the end of Act 3 (mid-game), I completely gave up hope that there would be any room for real build experimentation. It became obvious that all weapons and skills feel more or less the same. There’s just an illusion of variety — tons of mechanics, abilities, spells, and stats — but in reality, everything is tightly balanced according to how the developers see it. There are strict hard caps, bosses that are immune to half of the skill-based mechanics, and as a result, it’s impossible to create a truly interesting build. You just pick whatever deals slightly more damage — that’s it. You’re forced to play as a glass cannon, with no other viable options against bosses — while basic NPCs are just walking resource bags, offering no real challenge or variety unless you’re vastly under-leveled.\n\nBy the end, I simply turned on custom server settings, boosted item stats, reduced crafting costs to minimum, and finished the rest of the game in a couple of evenings. I do regret the hours spent grinding early on. I killed Dracula, uninstalled the game, and I’ll probably never come back.\n\nThere’s no point waiting for updates or sequels — nothing can save it for me. The only thing that really hooked me was the resource drop system and that early-game feeling of adventure ahead. But after Act 2, there’s nothing left — no story, no excitement in progression, no visual appeal (honestly, I got tired of staring at the ground for the entire game!). Nothing.",

      "review": "Although looking promising at first, V Rising quickly turns in a dissapointing game as soon as you delve a bit deeper in the ''story'', with the first cracks showing up at soon as entering the second act.\nTo better discuss the issues I found with V Rising, allow me to analize the three pillars around which its gameplay revolves : Housing, Survival, Combat.\n\nThe Housing aspect of the game is by far the most refined of the three; V Rising provides all the tools to build your own castle, using a simple yet effective modular design. Additionally, the matching room/crafting station mechanic, offers a nice and fresh spin on the traditional approach for base building often seen in other titles. \n\nOn the other hand, the survival aspect of the game is definitely lacking, pulling only the more unintresting mechanics from its genre. Mostly notably: item craft times, item durability and the good old ''hitting a node multiple times to harvest its resources''. The only saving grace in this section would be the blood mechanic; essentially a repurposed hunger meter, not only fitting for a vampire themed game, but which also doubles as an additional layer to build customization.\n\nThis leaves the combat aspect of V Rising... which in short it's a true disappointment. When designing a boss encounter there is a clear line between an honest, challenging opponent and a frustrating mess of a fight. V Rising sistematically crosses said line. \nAdditionally, due to the large cast, many bosses end up feel uninteresting and underwelming, \nrecycling gimmicks and mechanics like aoe spams, minion summons and visiblity reduction effects. By itself this wouldn't be an issue, if not proposed for multiple bosses in a row. \nA final but necessary note on V rising boss design is the lack of strong identity for most members of the roaster. In other words there are too missed opportunity for strong, memorable boss encounters, potentially achievable by adding a special gimmick to the fight.\nA good example would be the boss that summons an iron maiden to trap the player, damaging  and isolating them from the rest of the party. Why not turn it into a double edged sword giving the players the chance to trap the boss instead? Even if it inflicted moderate to low damage, mechanichs like this would increase the engagemaent of the fight offering creative and alternative approaches. Without them, it all boils down to the same battle of attrition, especially with the increased health pools when playing in brutal difficulty.\nTo quickly wrap up the combat section, V rising offers a wide selection of weapons each with its own skills and attack patterns, but in later stages those with a built in dash feel decidedly favorable leaving some options behind. The spells on the other end feel a bit samey, with all magic schools offering a different flavor of the same core abilities. A more pronunced variety in the magic departement would be appreciated.\n\nSome final considerations outside the scope of the three ''pillars'' regard the progression, the Rift Incursion and the ''story''. \nAbout progression, V RIsing constantly offers new tools throught the campaing while leaving some needed quality of life improvements locked behind the later stages of the game. A good example would be the bat form, unlocked only by defeating one of the last bosses. Such an emblematic vampire power would have been useful a bit earlier, especially factoring in its limitation.\n\nRift incursion, while quite important for the game progression, end up being just a repetitive grind. Out of the seven faction featured in the game only one appears in the event, making the grind even more repetitive.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin is the total lack of ''story'' or context outside of some boss voicelines or description, in total FromSoftware fashion. This leads to the game failing to provide a true motivation for the player actions throughout the ''story''. Why are we hunting these bosses, why are we challenging Dracula in the first place? Just for power I guess...\n\nTLDR: cool castles, underwelming and frustrating bosses. Not recommended.",

      "review": "The beginning of this game feels promising and nice. You gradually get introduced to new mechanics in a way that feels exciting. Act 3 feels incomplete, with some . Then shit really hits the fan in act 4 and beyond. There is no consistency to the difficulty curve of bosses; the amount of grinding you need to do to continue to level up and engage with all of the systems & consumables the game gives you skyrockets. The servants are supposed to help you with this, but even investing in them a lot it doesn't feel like enough. It would be one thing if the end game grinds (rifts) were interesting; but they're all the same, and for some reason time gated. This game LOVES to make you wait; the sun mechanic is a cool novelty at first, but once you're a few dozen hours in, it gets really tiring having to just sit around to fight the next boss. Don't bother with this game; all of the things that seem charming and interesting will only end up getting on your nerves the longer you play.",

      "review": "A game that doesn't respect your time whatsoever:\r\n1. Many items you must carry disable waypoints, meaning that you'll be re-trekking the same route across the entire map repeatedly.\r\n2. You assign servants to gather resources for you, which take a dozen hours or more of real-world play time. If you quit the game, time is not incremented. These servants can randomly die on their mission, but there is no indication when that happens except that their casket at the base loses its glow. This will wipe ALL progress on their mission. I uninstalled this game after my servant died 12 hours into a 14 hour mission in an area she was surely over-leveled for. \r\n\r\nThe combat doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. You are given a dodge action, so you're not meant to be hit, but it has an 8 second cooldown. You have both a magic attack and a weapon, but damage dealt is based on your item level, so enemies at your level always feel tanky.\r\n\r\nI didn't get to play the fantasy I was hoping for: a powerful vampire lord collecting legions of servants as my giant castle took shape. I felt like a delivery boy with a warehouse of packages to deliver using only the basket on my bicycle. Underneath the slick vampiric exterior, V Rising really is dead inside.",

      "review": "I picked this up during the 2025 Autumn sale at half price because I had reservations about whether the game would be worth the full price. I've also sunk a considerable amount of time into Valheim so I may be a bit biased as a consequence (or just tired of survival games in general), and I play single player only because in my experience multiplayer with strangers ruins games.\r\n\r\nV Rising not a bad game. I'm mainly disappointed by a number of dev decisions which suck out the fun (pun intended) and turn the game into a slog. V Rising could be so much more fun than it currently is but unfortunately the devs appear to have subscribed to the idea that balance and grinding is more important than fun emergent gameplay. It also looks like the devs are about the release a patch; on casual inspection looks like the patch consists mostly of nerfs to existing abilities so I'm anticipating the game becoming even less enjoyable.\r\n\r\nWhat I was hoping for: A game that I could play either casually to explore environments, create fun experimental builds and extensively customize my character while occasionally engaging in interesting boss fights.\r\n\r\nWhat I got: A game that superficially does these things but doesn't fully deliver on any of them, and feels like a chore to play for more than 30 minutes at a time.\r\n\r\nWhat they did right: The devs nailed the aesthetic. V Rising looks and feels like a game about being a vampire trying to survive in a world filled with humans and the occasional monster. The background music is sufficiently spooky without being annoying or repetitive. The artistic style is solid.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't like:\r\n\r\n1) The day/night cycle is far too short. Typically I've only just begun to explore the environment when I feel forced to rush back to my castle so that I don't accidentally get caught outside by sunlight combined with a large number of enemies and so I can free up inventory space. I feel like this is an artificial way to ensure that players don't consistently enter sections of the map that they are too weak to explore. If so, then that may be a map size issue.\r\n\r\n2) Re-spawn is far too fast. To me it doesn't make sense that an encampment I cleared out the night before is already fully populated the following night. I realize this was done to ensure the players have regular access to necessary materials for building and crafting, but what I have found is that it causes me to repeatedly return to camps I've been to over and over again, in part because of the short day/night cycle. This gets stale fast. Maybe it makes sense to do this with multiplayer, but ... it feels bad.\r\n\r\n3) The camera range is too limited and frequently awkward when fighting enemies who dodge past you, forcing you to rotate the camera mid-fight to continue tracking them. This combined with the rest of movement feels bad. Additionally I'm surprised that there doesn't seem to be an easy way to view the exterior and interior of your castle from the point of view of your character, or at the very least from over their shoulder. If there was more range of camera I feel as though the game would be far more immersive.\r\n\r\n4) Unlocking new abilities or buildables feels as though it takes forever since they are locked behind the boss enemies.\r\n\r\n5) Inventory management is a pain (this is also true in Valheim) and I keep having to add yet more storage containers to keep up. The fact that a Devourer (recycles extra unneeded gear/books into raw materials) has to be unlocked by fighting a boss is counter-intuitive to me.\r\n\r\n6) Additional cosmetics are locked behind pricey DLC: currently the full game plus all DLC is priced at $112.44 with a 10% discount, which is insane to me. A single DLC ranges in price from $9.99 to $29.99 and appear to be nothing more than cosmetic upgrades (even the most expensive DLC is just cosmetics). This feels like the sort of tactics I'd expect from the average greedy triple-A publishing company, not an indie team. I understand that the Castlevania-themed DLC probably necessitated a financial agreement with Konami but it still feels bad and doesn't fully explain the other packages.\r\n\r\nProbably the biggest indicator of how I feel about this game is I find myself shutting it off after a single day-night cycle because I'm not interested in going through another loop of the same grind. I have kept coming back hoping it will get better but so far that doesn't seem to be the case.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in this game I recommend waiting for a sale; it might be better for people who enjoy multiplayer survival games but overall I'm just not impressed. Again, it's not a bad game. It's just not doing much to capture my attention for long.",

The core gameplay is decent but the continued ignoring of QOL things like fixing the stair issue where you have to dismantle your entire castle simply to remove stairs or not being able to toggle either your camera or your building toggles to adjust to floor level versus a second floor level view is enough to disappoint me for investing in the game. For a game whose entire premise hinges on crafting, the crafting is not really executed in a way that's enjoyable.  While the multiplayer integration is well-handled there are too many issues with the crafting part of the crafting game that is ultimately a turn-off. The game seems to struggle a little with identity - unsure if it wants to be combat heavy (which can be a trial unto itself) or a survival/crafter, where it also falls short.

The pace feels perfect - every boss you beat feels like you’re making genuine progress, even if you’re unlocking menial things.\n\nExcept then you leave Farbane woods and enter Act II. Act II feels extraordinarily unpolished, with fucked up hitboxes, missing attack indicators, and very, VERY slow progression. It feels frustrating to play. \n\nFrom Act II onwards, every time you die to a boss, you don’t feel like it was your fault - you feel like something is wrong with the game. The AOE indicator for some attack or another is inaccurate, or literally doesn’t exist. Attack indicators were an established part of the combat in Act I and now they just… vanish? But only for SOME enemies and SOME of their attacks?\n\nAdditionally, the guidance through how to improve your equipment beyond crafting copper gear is entirely absent.
