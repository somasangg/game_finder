      "review": "For those who played the games on home consoles growing up, this is the definitive experience for better or for worse. Thank goodness these games are finally on Steam, because I refused to sign up to a different storefront just to be able to play KH.\r\n\r\nIMO the games rank as follows:\r\n1) Kingdom Hearts 2 (Obviously)\r\n2) Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep\r\n3) Kingdom Hearts\r\n4) Kingdom Hearts: re:Chain of Memories\r\n\r\nI actually really like all four games, even re:COM (I loved the Gameboy Advance game as a child) but as I'm going through the platinum trophy run for each of these games re:COM was definitely one of the worst grinds. The story itself in that game is great, and really important. Personally, I enjoy the card mechanic and think it's a great alternative.\r\n\r\nKH2 is about as polished as it's going to get in a Kingdom Hearts game. It's known as the best of the best for a reason. It's definitely better than Kingdom Hearts 3, and I don't know whether that's down to the fact that KH3's climactic story felt super rushed, or that KH2 had you revisit multiple worlds to get the whole story whereas KH3 was very much 'one and done' a bit like Birth by Sleep (but BBS was a Playstation Portable game from 2010, so you're not expecting mainline game quality for a spin-off).\r\n\r\nOverall, this package is great, and if you can grab it on sale even better. I'm on game 4/4 right now (with 358/2 days and Re:Coded being basically movies, no gameplay) going for the 'perfect game' accolade and I'm 220 hours in. I think I've got another 40 or so hrs in me until I'm finally done. Then I can have peace.",

The feeling of 'I can't remember you but you feel familiar' message that KH puts forward so often tells you your feelings matter, even the ones that don't make sense.\r\n\r\nI felt especially invested in Birth By Sleep and it was preparing you to watch Re:coded and I just felt my heart breathe. The whole series deliberately makes your heart ache and if you stick to the end, it eventually gives you the closure you need.\r\n\r\nIf you are really emotionally sensitive and want some closure for your aching heart and some fun with combat too, it's really good. I would only be careful with Chain of Memories - it's good, but it's a different type of game with the card system. It's jarring at first but you get used to it.\r\n\r\nAlso, 358/2 days and Re:coded are films, not games but really touching ESPECIALLY 358/2 days. It also has KH I which is great and the introduction to the series and KH II - the only annoying aspect of KH II was the constant cutscenes and not enough combat sometimes but an amazing story. I still really like Roxas's section despite it being the start as it really helped me connect with him as a character.\r\n\r\nTo finish this review off, if you like connecting with characters and an engaging story, this is for you so please enjoy it like I did.",

      "review": "Kingdom Hearts has always been a special series for me. I was first introduced to it by my brother when he owned a PS2. At the time, I didn’t really understand what an RPG was, but I was instantly drawn in by the Disney worlds and characters. Kingdom Hearts 2 quickly became my absolute favorite, it was such an ambitious game for its time. When the collection came out on PS4, I decided to replay it, being 17 at the time, I had a much better understanding of video games. I ended up spending the entire summer of 2017 binging these games, often staying up until 8 AM just to keep playing. Experiencing the worlds, the story, and the characters again was incredible. And of course, seeing my favorite Final Fantasy characters made it even better. Facing Sephiroth in both Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 was an unforgettable challenge that took me hours to beat, but was so worth it. Of course, not everything was perfect. Swinging through Tarzan’s world in Kingdom Hearts 1 was pretty frustrating. It was a tricky part that didn’t feel as fun as the rest of the game, but even that didn’t take away from how much I love the series overall. These games will always hold a special place in my heart, and one day, I hope to share them with my own kids. Honestly, Kingdom Hearts 3 didn’t quite hit the same way for me when it first came out, but Kingdom Hearts 2 alone makes this collection worth buying at full price. The music is absolutely unforgettable Roxas’ theme, Sanctuary, and so many others are just iconic.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve never played these games, I highly recommend them. They’re more than just games—they’re experiences that stay with you long after the credits roll.",

One of the benefits you have with this on Steam compared to other platforms is how easy it is to cheat, both for the obvious reasons you'd cheat and for things like enabling challenge runs. For example, if you want to grind but just don't have the time and/or patience for it, you can enable an XP multiplier cheat that makes it go faster. On the other hand, you could use that same XP multiplier cheat, but set the multiplication value to zero and now you gain no XP (which isn't always necessary because in some games there are ways to do the same thing without cheating, but not in all of them). You can also do things like play with the wooden sword for the whole game, or make it so you have no party members for a solo run. Also, you can use mods to return the Final Mix games' enemies' color palettes to their original versions, if you don't like the FM versions.",

Probably still the best 'overall' title for exploration, combat, story, visuals, music, and RPG mechanics as a total package, even though some later entries exceed it in single categories.\r\n\r\n-Re:CoM: There's stuff about the story that's cool but im sorry this battle system doesn't work. Only one I got close to the end but didnt finish. Just too aggravating.\r\n\r\n-365/2 (cutscenes): I get why this is important to the story of the organization but it loses something by skipping over almost half of the time that passes between major events. It's not like the original game was that fun but the cycle of daily missions *did* on some level form part of the story. Still made me feel something.\r\n\r\n-KH2: Absolutely GOATed action game and maybe my personal favorite. The pinnacle of both combat and narrative for the whole series- but I will admit that it's not that 'total package' like 1, it suffers a lot in every category except those two.\r\n\r\n-Recoded (cutscenes) : who cares lol\r\n\r\n-BBS: I used to think this game's move crafting system was the coolest thing ever. After having beaten it I do resent how it replaces the main series' actual action combat with cooldowns and makes normal attacks filler. It's a slog if you play through it back to back, but it was occasionally mindless relaxation and the story was good.\r\n\r\nReview of collection:\r\nI haven't encountered any of the bugs or crashes most people mention, with the exception of the audio cutting out during certain attacks for a second. Overall I find the collection is stable, has a lot of features and good value.",

Bottom line is if you're looking for a new world to sink hundreds of hours in, this is the game for you. With scaling difficulties i.e. the critical mode the games essentially turn into a souls-like experience so there's no worry about difficulty either.
