Overall it is far less challenging, and forgiving but still maintains some element of satisfaction that Snowrunner delivered.  It is a very different game, although having many things in common with its predecessor.\n\nCons\n\n- No fuel\n- No damage\n- No vehicle customisation\n- No trailer selection\n- Cargo does not auto-load, tediously requires a crane to load unless you can luckily get cargos to spawn over the trailer bed\n- Crane controls/vehicle controls are tremendously poorly designed\n- Where the heck is the gear selection! automatic heavy machinery is boring and lacks sophistication\n- Very limited vehicle selection\n- There are straight-up discrepancies in the game everywhere, ie. tooltips stating that tradable loot is green when it is in fact yellow, a location called \"Lorem Ipsum\" in Deluge.\n- Vehicles still woefully underpowered\n- HUD and UI difficult to navigate and poorly explained early game\n\nDespite all this, I find the game overall enjoyable and would recommend it because:\n\nPros\n\n- Better physics\n- Less tipping over\n- Forgiving gameplay; no more snagging on indestructable tree trunks or branches made of the worlds best elastic\n- I like the \"story-ness\" of the game\n- Non-linear problem solving\n- Vehicles automatically available for the next map, ie don't have to collect them all back in to spawn them in the next map.\n- Maps are well thought out, and the biggest pro; can be improved by infrastructure which is often what I wished Snow runner had, particularly for those frequently used main roads.\n\nIts worth getting, just don't expect it to be an updated version of Snowrunner, because its not and requires adjustment in your play style.",

I have already noticed (6 hours of playtime at the time of this review) a few models and assets have missing faces and are invisible from certain angles, not to mention on my RTX 3050, a GPU that came out only 4 years ago and is considered \"mid/entry tier\" barely reaches the minimum requirement, which leaves a lot of other PC players left out due to their limitations, despite that I can run most settings on high with decent FPS, but that doesn't stop the game from having mobile graphics most of the time, I've seen wheels turn into hexagons and lots of pop in, as for the freedom and narrowness of the game, it feels like Construction Simulator and SnowRunner had a child and this was the result, it has the gameplay of Construction Simulator and the looks of SnowRunner, but lacks the freedom and sandbox-y feel that SnowRunner has, SnowRunner after completing a region you're still free to offroad, do contests, as well as you own personal scenarios, for RoadCraft after completing a map there's not much else you can do, there is not many mods either, but I am sure they will come eventually, hopefully, despite all that the game can be fun with friends.",

It would be nice to play my own music in game but oh well that keeps it from being too easy to forget about time. Don't mistake all this positivity the game isn't perfect the maps are specially designed and even the smoothest road has unexpected bumps and the npc vehicle pathing could be better, player controlled vehicles will pass over small bumps with no difficulty but NPC vehicles will get stuck on anything but the flatest smoothest paved road. My other big complaint is the unreality of the scenarios. The level of destruction doesn't necessarily match up with the stated causes.

While Snowrunner's bones are identifiably here, what you get is a dramatically watered down version of SnowRunner's offroading that seems to be intended for players who want a more casual and less involved experience. The customization and upgrade system from the previous games is completely absent from Roadcraft. There is no attachment or sense of progression to the vehicles. \n\nThe virtual joystick controls used for the cranes and heavy equipment when playing with a mouse and keyboard are inexcusably bad. The devs didn't even try, and the game plays likw a poor console port in that regard. This is not a game to play without a controller.\n\nBut what was arguably the most aggravating experience in my two hours of gameplay was the convoy system. Plot a route on the map and AI driven trucks will populate it, giving you idle rewards. It's a cute idea for sure, intended to populate the map and make the game feel alive.\n\nLet me tell you, it doesn't feel alive at all. The AI are incredibly basic and don't respond at all to the player, obstacles, or other vehicles. Spend ten minutes painstakingly loading the back of a truck with the bogus crane controls, and be rewarded when an AI convoy truck not only rams into you, but keeps going without a care in the world and leaves you upturned in a ditch.\n\nClearly the devs are aware that this is a problem, because in the difficulty settings they give you the option to halve the number of convoys sent out per route. Unfortunately, some amount of them is still mandatory and it's simply not fun.",

In Snowrunner I could use my actual pedals and my actual H shifter although not in a way I would realistically expect but at least it somehow worked. Meanwhile here I cannot use my H shifter whatsoever.\n\nThe last drop for me was when I found out that the game cannot decide what inputs to use, keyboard or steering wheel system. For example: Most people use steering wheel system to drive, meanwhile using mouse to pan the camera around. In Snowrunner this is not an issue and you can play like that. Here whenever you touch the mouse to pan the camera while driving using steering wheel setup, the game will get messed up not knowing which inputs to use, your vehicle controls will get stuck in last position, full gas full left lock for example and you cannot do anything. Totally breaks the game for me.\n\nAfter this initial frustration I'm refunding this mess and I'm back to playing Snowrunner.\n\nI hope they will learn someday in the future and finally go back to the roots of original Spintires and bring back the realism, while keeping nice modern graphics and wide variety of vehicles with different uses.",

The vehicle customization has been completely removed. That by itself isn't a big deal, but now every vehicle is a single-purpose vehicle (at least the ones I've unlocked.) The only potentially dual-purpose is the cargo truck with crane. Almost, if not all, vehicles are generic trucks that somewhat resemble real vehicles, but not really. I don't really care all that much about that, it's just yet another area that is a step down from Snowrunner. There's less maps than Snowrunner, and less vehicles. I'm sure I'm overlooking a lot. \n\nSo what's good? Some of the new mechanics. Being able to interact with the environment more is a nice addition, as well as missions that are more than just hauling cargo. In that aspect, it's a nice change from Snowrunner. Being able to build roads and bridges is fantastic. \n\nOverall, it's just meh. It's not \"bad\" but it's a little dull. Because of the simplified vehicle handling, there's not really any issues with getting stuck, even with the recently added difficulty settings. It really feels like it was made by a completely different company as a knock-off to Snowrunner. The overall feel is just one of lesser quality. I really wish I hadn't purchased it. I've got around five hours in, and I just don't have much desire to play it any further when there's already a superior product out there.",

The \"manual\" gearbox isn't even manual, it still has the same terrible (automatic) shifting patterns and the only thing it does do is give you a high gear. The dedicated reverse is weird, all it does is prevent you from going forward. Right trigger is the gas and left trigger should act as a brake, but it doesn't and will rev up the engine for some reason. Logging is very hit or miss, half the time selecting a tree doesn't work and when it does, every five or so trees are made out of lead and topple the tree harvester.  Multiplayer is broken. The guests suffer from awful performance, network bugs, and camera glitches. Desync is common.\n\nThe best way to describe this game in one word is \"almost\". It almost works. The mechanics are right there, my fingertips are just barely brushing them, but alas, I can only almost reach them. You can drive the same route nine times and the tenth time results in your truck bouncing off a rock into the stratosphere.\n\nReally the only good things are the terrain deformation and how that gives the player the opportunity to create things to do. In Snowrunner, you get the tasks and that's it. In this, you could fill in a pond or build a highway. If you are able to work around the weirdness and can make tasks for yourself, it might be worth $30, so only at a discounted price.\n\nBottom line is I feel like this should be listed as Early Access.

In SC, I'd get stuck, look at the terrain, and go \"yeah, that makes sense\". Here, it's almost random at times. This is not helped by the stubborn delivery caravan AI, which seems to delight in finding the one rock left on the path and fully shoving their tires into it.\n\nBizarre control schemes for cranes and other tools have returned, and it is still a nuisance to do anything other than the most basic of tasks. It is not fun having to switch between 3 different specialized vehicles, all with slightly different control schemes. I tried both keyboard and controller - neither felt quite right.\n\nThere are a whole slew of inconsistent and/or poorly thought out design decisions here, too (why are roads so narrow by default? why does the dump truck handle like [i]that[/i]? why is there no damage model for the vehicles? why do certain maps refuse to give you sand?). With all of these issues piled together, you get a game that seems to resist being played at every turn, while also being caught in the middle of an identity crisis - not quite a sim, but not a pick-up-and-play casual title, either. \n\nTo stay within the series' theming, what should be a sandbox has turned into a tar pit, and I'm getting stuck on every single pebble on the way in. I can't say I didn't enjoy this game at all, though - there are some interesting ideas here, and it is ultimately satisfying to turn a muddy dirt path into a fully paved road, but there are so many little nitpicks along the way that really suck the joy out of the experience.

The graphics are excellent, the gameplay is interesting but it the game has a massive issue interfacing with steering wheels. It seems to lose connection with the wheel at random and the vehicle continues on with whatever steering and pedal input you had when the error occurred. Since this is a game has the single theme of technical driving through unforgiving terrain, the complete loss of ability to control the vehicle results in some form of accident and makes the game absolutely unplayable.\r\n\r\nConsidering that I have a Logitech G923, one of the most common steering wheels on the market, the length of time that others have been reporting this problem with no resolution or fix has taken me straight back to the Oovee days when there was zero interest in fixing the bugs and the onus was placed on the gamers to diagnose faults even though the consumer had bought the product in good faith that the product was in complete and working order.

The graphics are solid, the physics feel slightly improved, and the maps and environments are well-designed.\n\nI know this isn’t SnowRunner, MudRunner, or Expedition, so before anyone tells me to go play those, I get it. But one of the biggest reasons I loved those games was the strong modding community behind them. Mods made up at least half the fun for me. So when I saw mod support in this game’s menu, I was genuinely excited to see what the community would come up with, especially since the game already had the groundwork for road-building and environmental changes.\n\nUnfortunately, about a week in, it became clear that the developers made it unnecessarily difficult to mod vehicles. Instead, they seem to only support map mods. That was disappointing. After the first three maps, everything starts to feel the same. It’s hard to get vehicles stuck, leveling roads properly is nearly impossible, and the largest dump truck in the game just scatters sand randomly on your level roads. There’s also very limited vehicle customization, just changing a color that applies to all vehicles.\n\nSaber’s response to modding limitations has basically been, “Go play SnowRunner.”\n\nit feels like they’ve intentionally restricted vehicle modding to push people toward buying DLC for new vehicles. Their first DLC included four vehicles and two map, one of which is just a base jeep with gear strapped on for hard mode, one is a long-bed truck that looks like a vehicle the ai already had, and two are bridge layers. Not worth $15 in my opinion.\n\nHard mode was added in a later update, but if you want to change any settings, you have to start a new company meaning you lose all progress. I had to use a save editor just to re-enable manual gear shifting.\n\nYou can check out other comments or Google RoadCraft mods, but I’d say if you liked SnowRunner or MudRunner, and also enjoy building and shaping your environment, you’ll probably have a good 40–60 hours of fun here, especially with friends.\n\nOverall, it’s a decent sandbox to mess around in for a while.

Coming from a gal who loves to go muddin in real life, It's really disapointing. \n\nThe missions are all the same with a very uncomfortable amount of moving things with wonky crane controls on each map.  You cant go to other maps unless you spend hours of your life just using a crane.  You'll actually be having a little fun and them you get hit with a \"move 15 concrete slabs across the map\"  and it'll take you 30 minutes just to load them up on your truck because there's no way to automatically do it, but first you have to load up scrap concrete with a crane before you even get the slabs so another 30 minutes of crane if your lucky and that's just one of many unskippable crane missions.

After about five minutes, the performance stabilized and the game began to run smoothly. I was able to play for a short while before joining a friend’s multiplayer session, where the same issue occurred: a major frame rate drop that eventually resolved itself.\n\nUnfortunately, after a few hours of gameplay, the performance degraded again, becoming completely unplayable. Despite extensive troubleshooting—including reinstalling the game—I continued to experience frame drops to 1 FPS. Nothing I tried resolved the issue.\n\nMy system far exceeds the recommended requirements (RTX 4070 Ti Super, AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, 64GB RAM DDS5, wired 1.5 Gbps internet connection), so hardware limitations are not the cause. After reading reviews and Reddit threads, it's clear that I’m not the only one experiencing these performance problems.\n\nWhile Roadcraft is a fun and promising game, the current performance issues make it unplayable for me. I’m disappointed considering the amount I spent, and the entertainment I was having. At this time I cannot recommend this game as the optimisation is so poor.",

Dialogue lacks any kind of emotion and punctuation and ends up just being soul crushingly cringy.\nUI on the map just isn't intuitive and figuring out the mission objectives is unnecessarily hard. To remedy this, the developers chose to bombard the players screen constanly with casino-add-tier pop-up messages with overly explained directions. \nIt's impossible to change the controller scheme freely, instead you're stuck with 4 presets, none of which even remotely reminds of the past mudrunner schemes. \nCamera movement is clonky instead of the smooth free flowing as in the older titles.\n\nOver all, the whole game feels like a complete AI generated slop instead of a passion project like the earlier titles and lacks any kind of feel or atmosphere of the past titles.",

The primary concerns I have are with Kelly and her writing. As someone who has worked in a toxic work environment, what she brings up is a little annoying to hear, and I don't want to listen to it while relaxing.

I was hoping it would be Snowrunner with a new infrastructure building mechanic to help you traverse terrain, but all it does is remove the best parts of Snowrunner and implement a half baked road building system which is clunky and frustrating. The gear box interface from Snowrunner is gone, replaced by an unintuitive button pressing system. Missions are repetitive, and the AI truck pathing leaves much to be desired. The game feels as though it has been designed to be played by ages 10 and below in all aspects. I have gone back to playing Snowrunner, which is the better game and I would refund Roadcraft if I was able.",

For anyone looking for a experience to operate heavy machinery with simulator controls, this is NOT for you. Even the extreme delay switching from keyboard to steering wheel breaks the controls and you can end up down the cliff, as your accelerator gets stuck or steering doesn't kick in. You have to smash buttons to make one or the other work and YES I have JoytoKey and know how to use it and it just does not help in this game, because the hydraulic controls are limited to a inflated control scheme.\nThe fact that we have these games in 2025 is very disappointing and all I can say is, Farming Simulator 19+ is a much better operator friendly experience. \nWhen they drop an update and reviews confirm improved support for multiple controllers, I will definitely purchase the game again.
