(I will play the first one after it, i was just here to try the game with the newer one, didn't know it would hook me this tight) Not much far in to the game but i get it now, already. \r\n\r\nThis game is what defines a 'Game'. \r\n\r\nEvery section of this game feels dynamic, crafted with intricate details and level design. You don't just walk or ride a vehicle/'horse' mindlessly, rather you have to pay attention to every moment and surprises never ends in the pipeline. I have played very few linier games with such tight level designs and this one of the best of that category. \r\n\r\nEvery Puzzle to way forward is so thoughtful and Physics based that they don't feel forced just to be there, rather feels organic to the world and actually fun to figure it out. And don't get me started with Physics of this game; i think this is where its all begun, one of the best game (if not the best) to USE Elements (water, fire etc) to such extent, they are not just there, they fulfills purpose, and for a 2004 game, I am really WOW'ed. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe sound-design of this game doesn't feel like 2004 games, it's one of the best i am experiencing so far. The dripping water sound in the canal truly adds to the feel. The Art direction is so immersive that it actually triggers my water phobia in some places despite being such old graphics. \r\n\r\nWhat can I say; People who have played it knows it all and who haven't probably would never but One thing I can say, If you haven't played HALF-LIFE, you are missing big part of a gaming. \r\n\r\nSource-Engine / Valve is now my top favorite Developers. I am invested in this franchise; HALF-LIFE 3 is day one for me.\r\n\r\nI know this game will keep continue to be like this to the end, i have no doubt, already 10/10 for me and it is getting to my TOP 3; Yes. \r\n\r\n\r\nHALF-LIFE 2 is on one hand Retro and on the other hand an Advance piece of technology.",

      "review": "Half-Life was a groundbreaking game when it first came out, back in 1998. It was the best games to ever come out of Valve's office until 16. november 2004 when the world was blessed with Half-Life 2. It had a new artstyle that lean more into realism, rather than 90's sci-fi charm. While it wasn't the first game to use them source engine (that title goes to \"Counter-Strike: Source\" which came out October that same year) it is regarded as the most groundbreaking game using this engine. You can interact with almost everything. It even made up a new weapond for this new physics engine. The Zero Point Energy Field Manipulator also known as the Gravity Gun. It can shoot lazer bolts, move & throw objects that are to heavy for you to pick up on your own. It also gets a temporary upgrade that lets you pick up & throw around alive enemies which is super fun to use. Another thing I really enjoy about the game is it's amazing soundtrack! It really sells the atmosphere the mage is going for. The story is brilliant but I won't spoil it for you. This is (apart from \"Team Fortress 2\") my new favorite video game. If you haven't played it, you should totally give it a try for yourself. \nI give Half-Life 2 a 9.8/10!\nThe only thing I didn't like was the hunter chopper in Half-Life 2 and the Hunters in Episode 2.",

While I never got around to playing it until this year, 2025, I can understand how incredible the game must have been when it released in 2004, because some of that awe can still be felt when playing it today. The story is incredibly well written and goes so much deeper than what the game shows us. The gameplay is engaging and the Gravity Gun's utility of physics as a weapon is unique and very fun to use. The visuals are still quite decent, considering how much graphics have improved since this game came out. Half-Life 2 is a game that will likely be talked about for many more years to come and you need to play it if you haven't already.",

I'm writing this review of why this game is good without trying to spoil anything.\n\nIt's like Half-life 1 where you have to progress through levels and solve different puzzles the game throw at you like having to hold down certain places with health and armour with ammo you get or pushing through enemy lines. And then there are parts where you have to find a way around problems like real life like having to fix broken things or turning on power to activate powered objects or having to find a way around barricades.\n\nSome of the characters in this game is memorable and everyone in this day and age had at least seen Gordon Freeman not to be mixed with Morgan Freeman. You fight your way through Half-life 2 with another iconic character that you meet at the start of the game. Some of the charcters are Gordon's friends from the Black Mesa which is a place in Half-life 1 which is a nice throwback.\n\nFor €10 this a price you can't refuse which is even not on sale which is like €2 on sale. If you buy Half-life 2 you also get two episodes for free which is a steal at this point.\n\nOverall a 9/10 only thing about this is that its a story game meaning that the replay value is eh but is fun to go back everyonce in a while.",

      "review": "STRIDER MINIGUN DAMAGE - Pull up a chair and I'll tell you a tale. When we shipped Half-Life 2 in 2004, we were unaware of a bug in CAmmoDef::NPCDamage() which was returning the MaxCarry field of an ammotype as the amount of damage that should be done to a NPC by that type of ammo. Thankfully, the bug only affected Ammo Types  that DO NOT use ConVars to specify their parameters. As you can see, all of the important ammotypes use ConVars, so the effect of the bug was limited. The Strider Minigun was affected, though. According to my perforce Archeology, we intended to ship the Strider Minigun ammo type to do 15 points of damage per shot, and we did.  To achieve this we, unaware of the bug, set the Strider Minigun ammo  type to have a maxcarry of 15, since our observation was that the  number that was there before (8) was indeed the amount of damage being done to NPC's at the time. So we changed the field that was incorrectly being used as the NPC Damage field. The bug was fixed during Episode 1's development. The result of the  bug fix was that the Strider was reduced to doing 5 points of damage to NPC's, since 5 is the value that was being assigned as NPC damage even though the code was returning 15 up to that point. Now as we go to ship Orange Box, we discover that the Striders in  Half-Life 2 are hugely ineffective against citizens, causing big problems in maps 12 and 13.  In order to restore balance to HL2 without upsetting the delicate  balance of ep2_outland_12, I have chosen to build Episodic binaries with 5 as the Strider->NPC damage, since that's the value that has been in place for all of Episode 2's development. Half-Life 2 will build with 15 as the Strider->NPC damage, which is how HL2 shipped originally, only this time the 15 is located in the correct field now that the AmmoDef code is behaving correctly.",

      "review": "Yes,\r\n\r\nI have played the famous Half-Life series around 20 years too late. Welp, I was familiar with the story anyway.\r\n\r\nThe game deserves its reputation clearly. Storytelling happens in the background as you play. That is amazing. However, as this game is science fiction, there are lots of things that don’t make sense in my opinion. Xen creatures don’t make sense evolution-wise. A creature cannot get an evolution to wait in places creatures rarely visit and wait for God knows how long. Headcrabs are another weirdness. Alright, taking control of the nervous system of another animal has been seen even on Earth. But there is no system that would force an animal to start having a mouth on their belly. So headcrab infection should have let humans have open mouths, as well as normal hands. Additional to that, headcrabs don’t have a system to feed themselves on their body. They can’t feed on what their victim ate just by biting their skull.\r\n\r\nAdditional to that, Earth has lower oxygen levels that have been stolen by the Combine. So, antlions as large as they are cannot survive in those conditions. And also… isn’t Gordon Freeman a physicist? Why do we act like a soldier all the time? If he is an MIT graduate I would like to see we are acting as a scientist. We only cooled down the dark matter reactor once and that’s the only time I felt Gordon was doing what he was supposed to do.\r\n\r\nHowever, the rest of the story seems greatly written.\r\n\r\nGameplay is another topic. I know this game is two decades old. However, as a non-hardcore gamer with not much game experience I still couldn’t believe this game is that old. It looks great and mechanics are amazing. I enjoyed physics in this game a lot. Like using a saw with the gravity gun and crushing ants with cars. As well as creating platforms with wooden boxes on water.\r\n\r\nWhat I absolutely hated is the vehicle scenes. God, I hated every second of it. That water ride responded to water in a way that fits the laws of physics, that was only good thing I can say on this subject. don’t get me wrong, but at defending the silo scene god damn it I circled and circled until I realized I had to talk to people. If I was walking I would never miss those people but in a car I absolutely did. To be honest, as long as I drove the buggy I never knew where to go. I just went and hoped to be on the correct path.\r\n\r\nMusic of HL has always been on point though. I always liked them and probably always will.\r\n\r\nSuch a shame that I won’t be able to play Alyx and it’s been ages since I lost my hope on HL3.\r\n\r\nSo, this is where I say goodbye to this amazing series.\r\n\r\nPortal has been my favorite Valve series, and HL isn’t able to surpass those still. (Sorry, I just love it so much.)\r\n\r\nBut if you still haven’t, you MUST get this game. To be more precise, get the Orange Box deal.\r\n\r\nValve knows what they do, and keep showing off with everything they do.\r\n\r\n8/10",

      "review": "I can't believe valve gave their best game away for free. To preface this, I really dislike playing old games and stray away from them for multiple reasons. I had downloaded Half-Life 2 for free almost a year ago, and it sat in my library until just a few weeks ago. I had never opened it due to the fact that it was such an old game, despite all the positive reviews. I was burnt out of the current games I was playing, so I decided to boot up Half-life 2. Immediately I was confused as it throws you into the aftermath of Half-Life, but it also immediately immerses you in a first person perspective. Many modern games fail to immerse me as the cutscenes are too lengthy, too movie like, and feel as if they are only there for trailers. You never leave first person in Half-Life 2, and it works perfectly. The game is very immersive, despite the lacking graphics to modern standards; adding to the testament of how this game is still very good. The gameplay scratches an itch in my brain unlike other games. I had always liked the resident evil games for their puzzle solving, and this game is no different. What I find better about this game though, is how well thought out the puzzles are. In other games, it's either overdone where it becomes old quickly, or the puzzle solving is too easy which fails to scratch that itch of feeling rewarded. As I write this, I am downloading Black Mesa to further scratch that itch in my brain that only the Half-Life games can.",

I really enjoyed the gunplay and how ammo was somewhat scarce forcing you to change weapons so you can't just constantly use the AR2. I really appreciate in games when the appearance of enemies change the further into the game and HL2 doesn't disappoint, the different Combine soldier design from Civil Protection all the way to the Combine Elites are so distinct yet similar enough to where you can easily tell them apart but they all fit cohesively into the world. Some of my favourite moments have to be Ravenholm, taking part in the actual uprising of City 17 and the ending of the base game. They all perfectly utilised their specific gameplay mechanics for those sections like the sawblades and shotgun in Ravenholm, the rocket launchers against the Gunships and Striders in the uprising and the Charged Gravity Gun in the ending. The Episodes are also some peak fiction, Episode 1 felt a little short and also felt a bit like filler however it was still really good and Episode 2 was all around amazing I loved how right at the beginning after the first shockwave from the citadel the bridge collapsing still holds up to this day and I have no doubt it would've been mind blowing back in 2007. I also love how VALVe can craft such a great, emotional and encapsulating story that they can still allow the player free control of their character (apart from specific instances) and they'll still stand their and listen/watch what is going on. One minor improvement I wish they would add is a volume slider for just dialogue because every time I would be shooting enemies I could barely make out what the characters were saying. Also Half Life 3 tomorrow and if nothing happens tomorrow just reread the first four words of this sentence.",

      "review": "Just about everything I said in my Half-Life review remains true here. 2004 was a year with some huge shifts for the games industry. Nintendo announces what would become the Wii and releases the DS later in the year, the calm before the storm that would be Nintendo's 06-07 dominance. Rockstar releases GTA San Andreas, wrapping up their trilogy of groundbreaking 3D open-world games with a bang. Daigo Umehara pulls off the greatest moment in all of esports during EVO 2004. But most importantly, Half-Life 2 and Counter Strike Source release on Steam, requiring the brand new service to play.\r\n\r\nThe lasting effect of that moment and what Steam has grown to become is not what this review is about, but it should be evident by the fact I'm writing here that Steam has become incredibly important to shaping the way games are played in the modern age. The same can be said for Half-Life 2.\r\n\r\nHalf-Life 2 takes everything the first game stood for and cranks it up to max. The immersive storytelling, the compelling level design, even more puzzles with far more complex set ups, and that's thanks to the physics introduced in the new Source Engine. The Source Engine would then in it's own right go on to change gaming by way of Garry's Mod, not to mention powering Valve's next decade of masterpiece after masterpiece. Again, I've gone off topic. \r\n\r\nHalf-Life 2 gives you perfect gunplay, perfect modding capabilities, perfect movement (including it's bugs), perfect pacing, I could go on. Absolutely insane jump in fidelity not only for the franchise and company but for the industry as a whole. They wrote the f*cking book here man. In the years after we see games like Bioshock, F.E.A.R., and Dishonored release. The standard was raised yet again. In the same year as HL2 we see the first Far Cry come out, a game influenced by the first Half-Life. It's hard to overstate this, just about anything first-person in the modern era has some Half-Life game to thank at some point in it's history. It's no notes, this is a standard. This is The Beatles coming out with Sgt. Peppers. This is George Lucas making Star Wars. This is Valve releasing Half-Life 2.\r\n\r\n10/10",

I was super exited to try the sequel, but it just didn't land for me. Compared to the first- this one just felt disjointed and kind of gimmick-y. The physics based platforming wore out its welcome very fast, as did the gunship and strider fights. It felt like every time I was starting to have fun I would find myself facing another \"floor is made of lava\" section or find-the-infinite-missile-crate mini-boss. For the most part the weapons felt less creative and punchy than in the first game (with the exception of the gravity gun and crossbow) and although the rag-doll effect is INCREDIBLE, it alone wasn't enough to keep me engaged with the moment-to-moment gun play. Admittedly, I could have been playing wrong but I also spent an enormous amount of time waiting in a corner conserving health and ammo while antlions, turrets, or squad members did the bulk of the work for me. I wanted to play more aggressively, but I was disincentivized from experimenting with most of the weapons due to their low magazine size and the frailty of my HEV suit.

You know, each other own and all that.\n\nJust for me personally, even back in the days when i used to give it a few tries here and there and play it for around 5 hours, i never got to like both the story, the gameplay and the controls.\nTo kinda spoiler it - i feel like it's a bad idea to include a level such as Water Hazard at the very start of the game. The amount of times i got stuck or first had to stop and look around while constantly being shot at as you try to maneuver a really clonky hovercraft was just frustrating to me every single time.\nNothing against a fair bit of challenge but about 90% of the time it's more like you go straight but then drive over the tiniest little thing in the water and already go a bit more left, making you miss that narrow ramp you have to hit to make the jump. At the same time you have rockets being shoved up your ass so either you get lucky and get to try it again or have to reload.\n\nI know this also just a basic thing for Valve games but the fact that you can't aim with your weapon only makes that frustration grow even more because you are aiming perfectly but most of the time it just comes down to hoping that your gun does spread it's fire the right way and actually hit the target.\n\nAgain i get when people like this game, most of my friends really love it and call it one of their OG games from back then\nbut for me, it never managed to catch me. I don't think it's a bad game at all, just not for me.\nIf the controls would be a bit smoother, the shooting a bit more accurate and overall the gameplay a bit more of \"looking forward to what's coming next\" then it would have been my kind of game.",

Not \"bad\", just boring. The graphics are incredibly dull and washed out, and the setting of eastern Europe is unimaginative.\n\nAlmost nothing is done with the main antagonists, the Combine, aside from a few enemy types and the last hour or so being in a huge tower built by the Combine called the \"Citadel\". The Combine, themselves, are just a combination of 1984's  Oceania and a bit of the Aliens from War of The Worlds. They're very uninspired.\n\nThe actual gameplay sucks. I'm fine with no ADS but the gunplay is incredibly unresponsive, it's a downgrade from Half-Life 1. One thing that DEFINITELY should have stayed in the original Half-Life is the terrible vehicle-based level \"On A Rail\", which rears it's ugly head once again, now as the Airboat-based Chapter \"Water Hazard\". Water Hazard is HL2 at it's worst, it's one of the games' ugliest environments, with almost no gameplay and some of the most tedious, pace-destroying puzzles imaginable. Both Half-Life and Half-Life 2 overuse miserable puzzles to pad out the runtime; these puzzles range from easy to terribly designed.\n\nI won't comment much on the story, due to it not being finished yet but it's alright. Half-Life 2 isn't all bad, though. Some of the chapters are admittedly great, like the Ravenholm portion and Highway 17. HL2 Partially makes up for it's boring world in it's atmosphere, which is really well done.\n\nAll in all, people call this one of the best games of all time, but to be honest, it's not even the best game of 2004 (in my opinion)",

I was super exited to try the sequel, but it just didn't land for me. Compared to the first- this one just felt disjointed and kind of gimmick-y. The physics based platforming wore out its welcome very fast, as did the gunship and strider fights. It felt like every time I was starting to have fun I would find myself facing another \"floor is made of lava\" section or find-the-infinite-missile-crate mini-boss. For the most part the weapons felt less creative and punchy than in the first game (with the exception of the gravity gun and crossbow) and although the rag-doll effect is INCREDIBLE, it alone wasn't enough to keep me engaged with the moment-to-moment gun play. Admittedly, I could have been playing wrong but I also spent an enormous amount of time waiting in a corner conserving health and ammo while antlions, turrets, or squad members did the bulk of the work for me. I wanted to play more aggressively, but I was disincentivized from experimenting with most of the weapons due to their low magazine size and the frailty of my HEV suit.
