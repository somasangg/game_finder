      "review": "It's a slow burn, but if you're into MMOs, it's worth it.\n\nThe 100 hours playtime you see is the time it took me to get through the majority of the pre-expansion content. For about half of that, I was largely just riding on nostalgia for older WoW-style MMOs based around getting pointed between quest markers and navigating a swarm of hotkeys.\n\nBut for the second half of that playtime, something clicked in the narrative. Characters that I took for granted developed in personality as their appearances recurred, the high presentation value of the story really stuck, and the game began to really push your knowledge of the relatively simple mechanics in it's solo-only story segments. Going into the post-basegame, pre-expansion content, I especially appreciated how layered and mature the story is, unlike GW2's tendencies to forget the world of past stories once you're finished there, or ESO's embarrassingly children's book approach where characters baby you through their stories.\n\nI went into FFXIV extremely sceptical, being a fan of those two MMOs. And sure, ESO still is the most enticing in it's vast level-scaled world and freedom to explore it at your will. And GW2's MMO combat is still absolutely second to none. But never in an MMO have I been as captivated by it's story as what I've experienced in FFXIV. And I haven't even reached Heavensward yet, where I hear the story only continues to get more and more memorable.\n\nSo yeah, I summarise this review just as I began it - if you're an MMO fan, no matter your background, give this a shot. If you fall off here and there, that's fine - I've been on this trial for at least a year already, maybe even two. But if you have the time to stick with it, it will stick.",

But it feels so incomplete without being able to access at least my retainer or an own home.\n\nI am more of a Gatherer personally and I would've loved to sample a little further, not being able to access the player market was no big ordeal for me because I was completely engrossed with where to get what, what to craft, what to do with it, level up by assisting my grand company, cooking various kinds of foods and discovering new materials as I proceed onwards.\n\nIt's so well made, especially for an MMO, props to the gents whom actually designed all of this and keep extending on it, I absolutely love it. \nThe fact people can recognize stuff is HQ and different dialogue hits you. Capability of finding rare seeds and a whole flipping gardening system.. It's just made with some much passion and exactly that compartment of the game to be honest makes me wanna delve even deeper into it. \nAs usual Square Enix got a W, and if I am not mistaken this team specifically was also tasked with making FF16 and honestly it fucking shows. Peak next to peak.\n Keep up the great work, I'll most likely still grab the sub due to my love to the series. And I saw the Cecil Harvey mention in the Options, my favorite FF of the past is and always will be FF4 x)",

Unfortunately no trading of any sort is allowed and the same goes for free companies.\n\nThe beginning of the game is... rough, but it does get better, like really good. The thing that got me hooked through ARR was the crafting which was refreshing for a MMO (gathering is also nice) and once you get near the end of the first expansion the game pretty much, jump in quality suddenly, no more being a delivery guy or at least not as much!",

For about half of that, I was largely just riding on nostalgia for older WoW-style MMOs based around getting pointed between quest markers and navigating a swarm of hotkeys.\n\nBut for the second half of that playtime, something clicked in the narrative. Characters that I took for granted developed in personality as their appearances recurred, the high presentation value of the story really stuck, and the game began to really push your knowledge of the relatively simple mechanics in it's solo-only story segments. Going into the post-basegame, pre-expansion content, I especially appreciated how layered and mature the story is, unlike GW2's tendencies to forget the world of past stories once you're finished there, or ESO's embarrassingly children's book approach where characters baby you through their stories.\n\nI went into FFXIV extremely sceptical, being a fan of those two MMOs. And sure, ESO still is the most enticing in it's vast level-scaled world and freedom to explore it at your will. And GW2's MMO combat is still absolutely second to none. But never in an MMO have I been as captivated by it's story as what I've experienced in FFXIV. And I haven't even reached Heavensward yet, where I hear the story only continues to get more and more memorable.\n\nSo yeah, I summarise this review just as I began it - if you're an MMO fan, no matter your background, give this a shot. If you fall off here and there, that's fine - I've been on this trial for at least a year already, maybe even two. But if you have the time to stick with it, it will stick.",

The free trial is the base game & first few dlc expansions for free with your character level being paywall subscription blocked at level 70. Whatever you do, don't pay anything until you have fully completed all free content story and mission wise first before subscribing. As once your character is considered a paid one you will be permanently locked out of it once your monthly membership expires!!!!\n[h2]The Good.[/h2]\nOverall the gameplay for the dungeons, raids, class variety, weapon variety, anti-monetization needed for the free trial and the full amount content available for completely free is pretty good. It will take you a ton of time to burn through all that on its own. The visuals are also very good with a pretty art style for being a free game. Apparently the modding community is very great in this game and is more than half the reason people even buy monthly subscriptions just to continue playing this. But where this game truly shines is the social aspect while using said feature. That truly is the peak of what ff14 can be.\n[h2]The Bad... [/h2]\nThe story sucks until you hit the free dlc additions included in the trial. All the missions get extremely repetitive. You will be slapped relentlessly with basic enemy swarm fights missions, nonstop character yapping, an ungodly amount of fetch quests required to do previously said fun group content. The main missions in the base game are just insanely bad and just completely mind numbing. The missions in the dlc expansions that are included are still  mostly the same gameplay wise but at least there is a better variety and the story gets somewhat interesting at that point. You are forced to reunlock the ability to fly on your mount in every single area which gets irritating. Despite having a good amount of different classes the tanks and healers especially need more updates to not need such spammy playstyles in order to be more viable certain classes especially. Honestly the game also could use a system that allows more of a unique build selection rather than the current system. Also it takes way too long in order to rush through the game for a realistic sane person that may just want to catch up or play with their friends. And the good modding systems mentioned previously apparently got shut down which made a lot of people stop playing for awhile. But speaking of the community some people are great and some are complete degenerates in both a good and bad way so be careful or your likely to get harassed and stalked by some creepy lizard men (lizard people are usually the freakiest I don't make the rules.) Also you cannot dm to talk to people unless your a paid temporary membership member which genuinely is both good and bad in itself for preventing bots spamming chat, sadly that harms normal players social experience as this is best played as a social game with great group content late game wise.\n[h2]Final conclusion.[/h2]\nFF14 is a 50/50 on whether it actually is fully good or bad in itself. Very much so in each direction of the spectrum. invest your own time at your own risk and remember two rules. Be careful around the lizard people & don't pay until you have completed everything in the base game assuming your willing to lock your hundreds of hours of played content behind a hostage held monthly paywall.",

You are forced to reunlock the ability to fly on your mount in every single area which gets irritating.

And the good modding systems mentioned previously apparently got shut down which made a lot of people stop playing for awhile.

I am a long time player since Heavensward and have a total of 2940 days subscribed (8 years). I have every job at max level including crafting classes, I have put in an ungodly amount of hours into this game, but I cannot recommend it nowadays.\n\nThe game is slowly becoming worse and worse with every expansion. In particular, job design and balance is atrocious. At first, it was the Summoner class that got reworked, all the complicated parts of the rotation were deleted and replaced with the easiest and most boring rotation in the game big summon -> crystals -> big summon. Then they reworked Black Mage, a class that had a simple standard rotation, but could be made infinitely more complicated using non-standard lines (for a mere 1%-2% dps increase) this was unacceptable for Square Enix who obliterated the class and made only standard rotations possible, they also removed enochian upkeep so you don't even have to think anymore. Of course the newly added classes follow this new job design shift, with Reaper being incredibly easy to play, but unbelievably boring, and Pictomancer being so easy you can play it with your eyes closed.\n\nAdditionally, all jobs are slowly moving towards a 1-2-3 rotation, where you press 3 buttons over and over and over and over. Healers on the other hand have a 1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-2 rotation where they spam 1 button over and over and over because healers are required to damage in FFXIV to clear dps checks and so it's optimal not to heal, but focus on your dps \"rotation\" instead. This makes healing a massive chore as you spend the entire fight pressing 1 button.\n\nOnto job balance, Square Enix failed miserably to balance Pictomancer, the new caster DPS job introduced in Dawntrail. It was so bad that Pictomancer was dealing almost 10% more damage than every other job, whilst also providing massive utility for the party such as damage negation and damage buffs and being safe from damage due to being ranged. How long did it take Square Enix to balance the job? over 4 months. For 4 months it was the dominant caster class, making every other class redundant. It was so overpowered that Pictomancers were capable of taking aggro completely off of a tank despite tanks having a bonus to aggro generation.\n\nThe game has gone so far downhill that my entire clan has left the game, only logging in now and then to prevent automatic house demolition since we can't forget the memories we made on here. I'll never forgive Square Enix for what they've done with FFXIV. I have so many fond memories of playing it and now it's all been ruined.",

I literally just created it and linked it to Steam).\nI went to Reddit for help, but it seems like nobody cares about issues like this and my post asking for help just got downvoted into oblivion. I found a YouTube video with supposed fixes, but none of them worked either. And don’t even get me started on what it's like to submit a support ticket- it feels more like I'm filing a police report than just trying to ask a simple question. The amount of personal information they ask for is honestly ridiculous.\nSo now I'm stuck in this situation where the game is actively pushing me away as a new player and won’t even let me in.

We weren't about to spend 30 days testing out a game to play together.. without being able to play together or even in party with others.\n\nBut the 30min we did play: gameplay seemed smooth.

Find the Steam ( 32-bit ) process in the list under background processes (NOT the client service)\n5. Close Steam 32 bit\n6. Click Play now\n\nAnd it should work, [strike]however Steam won't track your hours anymore[/strike] - but at least you get past the black screen.\n\nEDIT: Doing this method once fixes the issue completely for me, no need to keep doing at every launch like first thought but it seems like this might be different for different people.\n\nSquare Enix fix your shit please.",

      "review": "[h1]FF14 Online is a complicated love hate relationship.[/h1]\nThere are very many things about ff14 that are good and equally as many that are bad. The free trial is the base game & first few dlc expansions for free with your character level being paywall subscription blocked at level 70. Whatever you do, don't pay anything until you have fully completed all free content story and mission wise first before subscribing. As once your character is considered a paid one you will be permanently locked out of it once your monthly membership expires!!!!\n[h2]The Good.[/h2]\nOverall the gameplay for the dungeons, raids, class variety, weapon variety, anti-monetization needed for the free trial and the full amount content available for completely free is pretty good. It will take you a ton of time to burn through all that on its own. The visuals are also very good with a pretty art style for being a free game. Apparently the modding community is very great in this game and is more than half the reason people even buy monthly subscriptions just to continue playing this. But where this game truly shines is the social aspect while using said feature. That truly is the peak of what ff14 can be.\n[h2]The Bad... [/h2]\nThe story sucks until you hit the free dlc additions included in the trial. All the missions get extremely repetitive. You will be slapped relentlessly with basic enemy swarm fights missions, nonstop character yapping, an ungodly amount of fetch quests required to do previously said fun group content. The main missions in the base game are just insanely bad and just completely mind numbing. The missions in the dlc expansions that are included are still  mostly the same gameplay wise but at least there is a better variety and the story gets somewhat interesting at that point. You are forced to reunlock the ability to fly on your mount in every single area which gets irritating. Despite having a good amount of different classes the tanks and healers especially need more updates to not need such spammy playstyles in order to be more viable certain classes especially. Honestly the game also could use a system that allows more of a unique build selection rather than the current system. Also it takes way too long in order to rush through the game for a realistic sane person that may just want to catch up or play with their friends. And the good modding systems mentioned previously apparently got shut down which made a lot of people stop playing for awhile. But speaking of the community some people are great and some are complete degenerates in both a good and bad way so be careful or your likely to get harassed and stalked by some creepy lizard men (lizard people are usually the freakiest I don't make the rules.) Also you cannot dm to talk to people unless your a paid temporary membership member which genuinely is both good and bad in itself for preventing bots spamming chat, sadly that harms normal players social experience as this is best played as a social game with great group content late game wise.\n[h2]Final conclusion.[/h2]\nFF14 is a 50/50 on whether it actually is fully good or bad in itself. Very much so in each direction of the spectrum. invest your own time at your own risk and remember two rules. Be careful around the lizard people & don't pay until you have completed everything in the base game assuming your willing to lock your hundreds of hours of played content behind a hostage held monthly paywall.",
