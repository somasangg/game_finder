Also really simple and easy to understand.\n\nDEV NOTE: One recommendation I would give however is fix the amount of bullets shot at once with the flamethrower after exiting any menu. The game pauses the shots then when you go in a menu, it all shoots at once when you exit them and that made my game freeze a couple of times and I would lose progress. GREAT GAME THOUGH",

I really enjoy it because I can see myself improving in cool and unique ways that I wouldn't have expected at first playthrough. Cant wait for more updates <3",
