This game changed everything 🤩 it’s easier to get into, less farm focusing- zero pressure, more town building, more likeable characters. I love how they all have their own convo with each other. Unlocking magic abilities is also a plus. \n\nMain thing I love is that you can increase your health and energy bar as your town ranks up! Easy mining also! Lot of crafting too. Cute animals also!\n\nAnother thing I love is that you can accept daily quests and finish it at your own time. There is no time limit. :)",

      "review": "After nearly 40 hours of play, I’ve come to feel that [i] Fields of Mistria [/i] has gathered the strengths of many beloved farming sims and quietly refined some of their familiar rough edges. You can recognize influences here and there, yet the spirit of the game remains entirely its own—something truly unique and irreplaceable. It is, unmistakably, Mistria.\n\n[b] Here are the aspects I especially enjoyed: [/b]\n\n[b] 1) The art style is unbelievably charming. [/b]\nFrom the NPC designs and the atmosphere of the town, to furniture, outfits, and accessories, everything carries a soft, delightful aesthetic. With so many clothes, skirts, hairstyles, and hair accessories to choose from, dressing up becomes a simple but irresistible joy.\n[b] 2) The NPC dialogue and story writing are thoughtful and attentive. [/b]\nCharacters feel vivid and well-rounded, each with their own small warmths and temperaments. It’s clear that care was put into crafting every line of dialogue.\n[b] 3) The animal system is colorful, varied, and refreshingly not centered purely on productivity. [/b]\nThere are countless color variations and accessories to unlock (even if I’m personally too lazy to collect them all). Unlike most farming sims where animals mainly serve as resources, here you might find yourself gently trying to complete a living color catalog instead.\n[b] 4) Crafting draws resources directly from storage. [/b]\nThere’s no need to shuffle items in and out of your inventory—an understated quality-of-life detail that makes the entire system feel smooth and considerate.\n[b] 5) Mining and combat feel naturally paced and responsive. [/b]\nControls are satisfying, and the deeper-layer creatures have distinctive designs that make exploring the caverns enjoyable.\n[b] 6) The world feels more free than expected. [/b]\nYou can jump, swim, and even step into rivers to catch fish. While terrain editing isn’t available, the world still feels light, open, and inviting.\n\n[b] There are also a few areas that could be refined in the future (none of which diminish the experience): [/b]\n\n[b] 1) The item pickup radius is a little small. [/b]\nThere are moments when you need to pause and wait for items to be collected.\n[b] 2) Large-scale animal management becomes somewhat busy. [/b]\nThe auto-feeder can’t pull feed directly from the barn’s storage, which makes taking care of many animals a bit tedious.\n[b] 3) Movement speed feels slightly slow. [/b]\nThis becomes more noticeable when traveling across larger parts of the map.\n[b] 4) Farm resources cannot be fully disabled. [/b]\nThere is currently no way to completely prevent weeds, wood, and stones from respawning.\n\n[b] And lastly—something I wish to express gently, yet earnestly: [/b]\nThere are many Chinese players who love this game deeply, and we would be truly grateful if official Simplified Chinese language support could be considered in the future.",

      "review": "This is the first cosy farming game I’ve genuinely enjoyed since Stardew Valley. They’re similar in spirit, but different in some ways, and you can definitely say that Field of Mistria isn’t just a thoughtless clone made to rake in money. It’s a game the devs clearly poured a lot of thought, heart, and soul into. I initially planned to just play for 10–15 hours to briefly check out the mechanics… but then I got sucked in and — whoosh! — suddenly I’m dating a draconic lover, solving all the townsfolk's problems, and breeding a golden cow.\n\nThere are some really good things I loved in particular:\n\n- First of all, the NPCs – their art is lovely, and their narrative is very well written. They always have something to say, with and without direct context, and their lines don’t constantly repeat or bore you. Some of the things they say are genuinely touching. I’m especially in love with Caldarus – I feel a kindred spirit in the writer who worked on him. Thank you very much; you knew exactly what you were doing. I haven’t enjoyed romance this much since Astarion in BG3.\n\n- The main quest in the dungeons and the existence of a big goal  to keep digging deeper — is another strong point. I’m really looking forward to the full release and to seeing how the main quest concludes.\n\n- The game loop is well organised: you always have something to do, whether it’s farming, caring for animals, exploring the mines, gathering resources, cooking, crafting, etc. There are always short- and long-term goals on the horizon that you want to work towards.\n\n- The game has a lot of cosy, beautiful animals and decorations, and the character appearance customisation is extensive.\n\nThere are, however, some minor things that could (and maybe will) be improved:\n\n- The start of the game is really slow and feels tuned for a very casual player. You don’t even have all the tools you need for farming right away. I understand it’s probably meant to avoid overwhelming new players, but in my case it felt more like a test of patience.\n\n- The environmental graphics are veeeery simple. You can’t exactly call them beautiful, but they’re not bad either. I got used to them eventually, and on Steam Deck it looks decent. However, when I tried playing on PC, the visuals felt overly simplistic on a big screen.\n\n- There are very few options for farming automation. Watering crops and feeding animals every day became tiring. You only get watering sprites fairly late in the game for the first time, and you never get any help with feeding animals at all. I had a lot of animals, and every rainy day turned into a boring chore of running from shed to shed with food.\n\n- The potential of the game’s magical setting isn’t fully realised. It’s not a major drawback, but it does make me a bit sad. Aside from the mine monsters and Caldarus, there are no magical creatures, fantasy plants to grow, creatures or pets to care for, NPCs to meet, or other magical elements in the world.\n\n- I would really love to see NPCs — especially the ones you’re dating — say at least something short, generic, and simple when you interact with them for the second (and subsequent) time in a day, instead of not reacting at all. I’d also really love a way to be able to kiss my partner at any moment. It doesn’t seem too hard to implement, honestly.\n\nAll in all, the game is very good and has a lot of potential to become even better. Wishing all the best to the devs — you’re doing great, thank you for your work. I’ll be waiting for future updates to come back to the game! ♥",

      "review": "This will be a detailed review and this game is still in early so everything is still open to change. I’ll add a TLDR here for those who don’t want to read everything.\n\n[b] TLDR; [/b] This game is very cute and holds strong on its own. It runs smoothly, the UI is easy to get around and there’s a lot to do despite the early access. The biggest feature that I’d say would draw a lot of people in is the amount of character dialogue there is for the townsfolk. You can talk to them many times throughout the day, gift them every day and their own lore and families are well written and tight knit.\nI truly can’t wait for more and am excited for the full release. I do hope there’s more your own character can do to set up their own personality and story and I do want the world to open up a bit more.\n\n\n[h3] Positives: [/h3]\n[b] CHARACTERS – [/b] The townsfolk have SO much dialogue. You get new dialogue depending on the season, where you are, time of day, events going on and your relationship levels with them as well as other people. It’s really endearing being able to come across someone in town and talking to them. They also converse with one another even in groups and not just one on one which feels really immersive and real.\nThe eight heart events are very good and open up new dialogue with everyone in town as well. I wish there were more heart events not just with romancables.\n\n[b] PROGRESSION – [/b] The progression that comes with the town rank improving is actually well paced and the difficulty slowly rising is well done as well. I just wish there was more. I also wish that there were more sort of side quests too.\n\n[b] MINES – [/b] The mines are actually challenging. You’re not going to descend many levels in a day, rather more like five. The storyline for the mines is actually also interesting.\n\n\n[h3] Critiques: [/h3]\n[b] ARTSTYLE – [/b] It feels bad to put this here but the art style is somewhat awfully simplistic. The environments are just enough but don’t stand out much in any way. It’s easy to understand how to get around and what’s available to you but there’s nothing that adds to your experience exploring like wind in the trees, dark splatters and puddles when it rains etc. I just need a little more.\nSome character’s mini-portraits look too similar (Elsie and Valen, Landen and Hemlock) and even things like seeds look similar (corn and sugarcane).\nThe character customisation feels extremely limited and simple too. The outfit pieces you unlock are well thought out and designed but can fall flat on such a simple character.\n\n[b] TIME – [/b] The days are very short. The days are about 12.5 minutes and typically I felt as if I was constantly rushing to get things done in a day. I know the this is more of a me problem not being able to adjust to their designed gameplay but I personally put it on the longest day option which is 15 minutes which greatly stopped me from stressing out and slowed me down.\n\n[b] FISHING – [/b] Fishing is kind of boring. It’s similar to Animal Crossing where you have to aim the hook in front of the fish. Sometimes aiming for fish far away takes too long and the fish have moved before it’s charged up. There’s nothing like rippling the water to attract fish which would make it go faster and more fun.\n\n[b] OLRIC – [/b] Like everyone else, I am going to complain about how we cannot romance Olric. Release the himbo this is getting ridiculous. \n\n[b] COOKING – [/b] Cooking is really confusing to get into. It’s hard to even start it because some recipes have these sorts of levels that you cannot access until you get a better cooking station. It’s not very profitable too because they only sell more by a sliver. I’d love to making baking my main source of income and my character’s \"thing\" but it’s not worth it in the current state of the game.\nSome ingredients and recipes are so hard to get. I was stuck on a cooking quest for weeks because I didn’t have the recipe. I also can’t make certain things like rock salt (which you should be able to do at the rock refinery) and coffee. I was waiting for the coffee recipe for the longest time until I found out you can only buy it.\nPlease let me track which recipes I don’t have and where they would potentially be accessed. Having a cookbook on me would also be really nice.\n\n[b] FIGHTING – [/b] I hate fighting in this game. You have to be aiming a certain way and it’s so finicky. Waiting for the animated rocks to spit at you so you can deflect back takes so long and you can't taunt them to go faster. I also didn’t know you could feed mimics and a recipe I needed for a quest dropped only from feeding mimics in a certain part of the mines. I probably spent 20 in game days chasing that recipe.\n\n\n[h3] Comments and Nitpicks: [/h3]\nI really appreciate that finding things like bugs and fish are not restricted to time of day.\n\nI didn’t know you could feed animal beads to the chicken statue, does anyone explain this to you in game?\n\nI wish that the Henrietta and Dozy walked around more, I forget I can befriend them because they rarely leave their homes.\n\nMy character does not get much opportunity to show their personality until new dialogue is given to you after eight heart events.\n\nPlease let me half stack items or let me hold down right click to extract items faster all the time. Having to manually right click to extract items drives me absolutely crazy.\n\nI sometimes get random crashes, mainly when I’m crafting furniture and decorating my farm. I’ve had to replay entire days before because it crashes just as I get into bed.\n\nWhen crafting anything the window resets at the top every time rather than staying where I was in the menu. I also hate “quality” furniture as it takes up an extra inventory slot and I rarely ever sell furniture as a money maker.\n\nI wish you could use the axe to move furniture like the pickaxe and even if not efficient cut down things like fiber.\n\nI think adding giant ore nodes rarely would be a nice addition.\n\nI wish there were more reasons to catch bugs like turning them into bait or dyes.\n\nPlease add an auto-feeder for animals. I'm not a big animal person in these sorts of games and caring for them takes up so much time in a day. I need them for the materials so I feel like I'm reluctantly caring for them (sorry). I also ALWAYS forget to send them back inside at the end of the day. Like brother, just walk back inside the barn or coop.\n\nBalor's cart isn't that useful at the moment and I forget it exists. I also forget the fish shack exists too.\n\nSome artifacts drop so often where new ones rarely drop. Feels exhausting to try get new ones if you make it a goal.\n\n\n[h3] Advice to New Players: [/h3]\nYou can feed animals with things like berries so it's a good idea to check bushes and save the berries. You don't have to feed them only through hay and small feed.\n\nTake things slow, don't expect you can do a lot in one day. It's okay to only accomplish one thing in a day.\n\nDon't feel like you have to talk to the townsfolk whenever you see them. It's okay to run past them.\n\nThere's items you can gather in certain rivers and lakes used for crafting that spawn most seasons except winter.\n\nKnow where the ponds are because pond fish are the hardest to get. You can just leave that zone and run back in for them to respawn. Also fish during the rain as some are limited to that weather as well.\n\nYou don't have to wait till Winter to go to the mines or decorate. You can still farm and nothing is limited in this time.\n\nOrganise your storage ASAP or it will get overwhelming. Make a spot for chests like for seasonal seeds, fish, crops, and bugs as well as a crafting area.\n\nTrees grow back the next day and you will NEVER not need wood or stone so spending a whole day cutting trees down is beneficial.\n\nDon't use the spell to get your energy back. Make food.\n\nThere aren't many spells in this game that I often forget to even use them.\n\n\nExcited for future updates, please let me romance Olric. Thank you.",

I am excited to see how this game will continue to develop but even AS IS... its tighter than some \"completed\" farming games.\r\n\r\nThe main complaint is the game does crash far more than I would expect.

      "review": "FoM is a game I've long anticipated, and come to love very dearly. \n\nI'm someone who often struggles finding a game that (in my opinion) has actual replayability, because to me a lot of gameplay loops feel uninspiring and don't really compel me to give it another go. Meanwhile in this game I legitimately could not stop myself from starting multiple saves to alternate between, making different characters, trying new things and romancing someone new. I genuinely don't mind starting fresh and repeating things I've already done before because it still feels FUN.\n\nAnother thing I really enjoy, specifically about the farming aspect, are the magic spells that help make it efficient and satisfying rather than something tedious. You can use spells to restore your energy (also really neat to help you progress exploring the mines), water your crops or instantly progress their growth. Eventually you can even automate by crafting statues to place around your farm.\n\nMy favorite part above all else, though, is the colorful cast of characters. There isn't a single one I can say I genuinely don't like. To me they all appear very distinct from one another and I think it comes across very clearly that they were created with love and care: both in terms of design, variety and personality. I love chatting with them, even if it's just to learn an extra little tidbit of something they like or a past experience they've had.\n\nEven in Early Access this game already has so much to offer, and it's only going to get better from here on out.

There isnt the same drive to fill the museum or reach the bottom of the mines (stardew valley) I would love to see more progression and things to work towards as currently im just playing to reach max hearts and dating status.\r\nIn combat your character moves forward with each hit of the sword which i personally find annoying as i end up past the enemy and have to readjust.\r\nI also find it a little hard aiming/lining up my watering can when im charging it, might be a me problem but i find it less intuative than other games mechanics.\r\n\r\nOverall I really see potential in the full game release and really love what the game has to offer now.

It does a really great job of scratching that itch, I cannot lie, and has a number of quality of life improvements (swimming! jumping over/off things! universal storage access!) that does help it feel like something new. Familiar enough to give me a little deja vu, but certainly fresh enough to be worth your time if this is your kind of game. \r\n\r\nThe characters are engaging and enjoyable, often going on outings around the town in groups and having weekly dnd nights at the inn. Their outfits change season to season, and just about every one has a unique dynamic with everyone else. The map has a lot to like and explore, and areas open up at a nice pace. I am looking forward to unlocking the entire map and more skills/tools/crafts. \r\n\r\nIt does struggle sometimes to explain what about it *is* different, and how your gameplay should reflect that; tool usage being the one that bugged me the most when I first started.

A sword does? literally had to google it) Just now getting in to the ranching side of the farm, and being able to breed different colors/varieties of animals looks promising.\r\n\r\nSPOILERS + a note directly to the development team: please let me romance the dragon.

Their take on a stardew/harvest moon like game is perfect for me, I feel like it gets rid of the bad/annoying parts of stardew. Its not overwhelming and if it is you can just slow the time in settings. I didn't finish stardew, but I can see myself having multiple saves on fields of mistria for every marriage candidate. The music is awesome and the character customization is so cuteee!! idk how far im in, maybe halfway with 25 hours? There is a lot of content for early access, its definitely worth the $14! I'd say its the best game I bought in 2025.\n\nSuggestion: it would be cool if you could have a good friend help you and follow you around for a day or something!

The graphics style has a little more detail, which renders character customizations better in my opinion. I am loving the storyline so far and the characters! I am looking forward to more content and more characters in the future. The dialogue is entertaining. I haven't fully romanced every character but I feel like there's a nice bit of flirtation, cuteness, and substance.

This game automatically harvest it, leaving them as items on the ground. Cooking is no longer just a fun option, but a key money maker. You can send points on skill trees for EVERYTHING, no longer having to choose one or the other.  The townsfolk actually feel like your neighbours instead of npcs, and you are not locked out of the conversation to once per day. You can also see all townsfolk interacting with each other. Cutscenes no longer feels like you're snooping, you are relevant to the conversation. Everyone is helping the town in their own way, but the game outright shows you why you are helping the development most. SHOPS ARE ALWAYS OPEN. You can give gifts everyday. You can save your game in the diary book at home whenever you want, and access those saves again if the need arises. \n\nI feel like I can make a book out of my love for this game, and it is still in early release.

The farming is simple yet not boring, breeding all the different colors and special colors of animals takes long but not too long. Mining and fighting takes up a good portion of your gameplay without making it too tedious and having a great variation of enemies. The devs take their tine and listen to the Community and have changed things in the game they didn't even Plan. Thats what i call dedication and love for their game. I can't wait for the full Release",

It's a lot like Stardew and other pixel art farming sims, but it's different enough to warrant getting this game. The lack of penalty for passing out or the shops always being open may not be everyone's cup of tea, but there are already mods out for changing preferences like that. The game itself is cute, the characters are dynamic and fun to talk to, and I can confidently say this is my and a lot of other people's new obsession.",

It's cohesive and knows what it wants to look like. The decorating part with the clean pastel art style is incredibly satisfying. For the farming, it is not as fantasy-like with the farming as I expected, like Rune Factory, but it does its farming right. The storage to craft system is a huge QoL that I've yet to see in other farming games (if there are any, I haven't played them yet). The mining and the enemies are the right amount of tough.\n\nYet some really huge pain points for me are:\n1) The music:\nSomewhat grating and harsh notes sometimes. Most of the time I'm pretty neutral about the music, nothing much stands out. But when it does stand out, it's not in a good sense.\n\n2) The map:\nThe map is way too big and spaced out, from the town to the mines and everywhere else. Without putting your time on 'longer' or getting the Mistmare, a lot of minutes are wasted getting to and fro and it feels as if it didn't need to be that far apart since these assets, especially in the town, are just lots of empty space or wide road.\n\n3) The NPCs and the world. I'm not asking for a backwater depressing world like Stardew, but even in comparison to other cozy games like Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons/Animal Crossing/Natsumon, most of them are just almost perfect, saccharine sweet. I'm not asking for toxic and irredeemable characters, but it feels as if conflicts are easily solved or talked about in one or two heart events. It doesn't feel like anyone has a real flaw that makes them feel human. The kids feel like the funnest and most human NPCs in the game.\n\nAdditionally, I feel as if I go through some characters heart events where it is more or less the same thing, Adeline=work, Celine=flower. It suffers from making somebody's profession or hobby their thing and sometimes nothing more happens throughout some events, especially in relation to the three girls, Adeline, Celine, and Reina. \n\nTo compare it to a game like Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar, I can see characters having strained relationships with one another due to somebody being too overbearing, friends mustering up courage to talk about difficult things with someone, helping somebody get out of their shell from being a recluse, etc. \n\nThe world: \nThat there was a huge earthquake that happened doesn't make itself felt in the story and the gameplay. In just one or two seasons, it is very easy to surpass the rank that the town used to be before the earthquake and, progression-wise, makes it feel like I didn't achieve much at all. Nor am I working towards anything higher, since it doesn't seem like the town lost much at all. I also don't feel like anyone was that affected by a huge earthquake and it really feels as if nothing happened, besides making things accessible by clearing debris, upgrading buildings further down the line.\n\nThese may just be personal preferences, but for me the world and NPCs interactions with us and themselves especially big parts of what make Harvest Moon/SoS-style games riveting. I don't feel like I'm in a world with real people, thus it is hard to feel immersed. If anything changes down the line, I would be interested again.",

There are skills to reduce this as you level up, but it doesn't go away entirely.  (In certain places, you can get 1hr craft times down to 30mins.)\n-Despite an update to allow for lengthened days, the \"longer\" days are still barely in line with industry standard, and, unlike other games, it has lengthy animations for most necessary actions that don't pause the day's progression while they're happening.  The \"longer\" day option doesn't adjust crafting times.\n-Because planting seeds costs energy, this results in re-growing seeds being the only viable crops until you get sprinklers.\n-Community upgrades can only be done in a specific, linear order.  There isn't a lore or narrative reason for this, you are just at the mercy of the NPC's whims of which one you can do first.  You cannot just decide you want to upgrade the seed vendor or unlock a new foraging area first, you have to upgrade like 5 other building you don't use before you're allowed to touch the thing you want.\n-Mines progression is heavily locked behind RNG.

So, you need to bring extra tools just because.\n-AoE pickax charge does less damage/hit than hitting one-by-one, costs the same amount of stamina.\n-Ranching is poorly-developed to the point it's little more than a novelty time and money sink.  Buy a chicken because you need eggs for cooking?  Food is 50g/day.  At base friendship, it'll give you 1 egg/day that can sell for 20g. When your hearts are halfway up, it'll give you two whole eggs, with a chance of a third. And, when you max out the chicken's friendship (takes about a year), it'll start *only* giving you 1-2 golden eggs.  Which can't be used in the same recipes as normal eggs.  And only sells for 60g.  There is not a silo, you must manually feed your animals every day, either by hand (+5 friendship points, +token bead items, and a long animation), or added the food to a trough (no friendship points, no tokens), or let them eat your crops (with a sell value of 125+g/each).  Animals won't produce if you leave them outside at night, even if you feed them. Animals won't produce if you didn't pet them the previous day, even if they're inside, fed, and at max friendship level.  Ever met a chicken that stopped laying eggs because their owner didn't pet them?

      "review": "I'm a loot goblin. I hate this game. What's a person to do with only 30 inventory slots?\n\nI want the loot. I want to catch every bug that moves. Open every chest that glitters. Pluck every plant that grows. Haul in every fish. Harvest every material on the screen. I can't do most of this in bulk and I hate it.\n\nThis game isn't a game for loot goblins. God forbid someone tell you to \"leave your tools at home in a chest\" or \"plan ahead what you'll farm today\".\n\nIf you disregard all of that, the game is pretty relaxing in terms of music and atmosphere. However, games like Stardew Valley and Rune Factory 4 have it beat in many departments (like inventory space and time management). The characters are diverse and somewhat unique, but nothing really memorable. However, early on you'll find that gifting them items that normally they should at least prefer such as rare insects for the bug kid and unique rocks and gems for the ex-miner aren't quite all as obvious as it seems. Finding out what they like to begin with is purely random trial and error that doesn't always make sense. Give bug kid a regular beetle, he loves it. Give him a rare beetle that looks like it's been blessed by fire itself, neutral reaction. What.\n\nTime in this game passes by incredibly quickly, leaving you very little planning to do other than to focus on one to two main activities a day such as dungeon diving and archaeology or farming and fishing. Time passes by ridiculously quickly in Mistria. Passing out by staying up late has no demerits other than waking up late the next day with less energy, so if you're trying to head back from the dungeon to go back to sleep it's not a big deal to just pass out to teleport back home. For reference, pathing from your house to the dungeon takes an hour and thirty minutes minimum, even with speed boosts, to two hours. That, combined with whatever activity you've chosen for the day quickly passes time with not much room for anything else unless you try to do a small amount of everything. But just doing anything fills up your inventory quickly, and you can't simply store resources anywhere else but your farm. Going back home to make room for more wastes time, and not doing anything while traveling back and forth already wastes the time that you don't have. It's anxiety inducing.\n\nIf you don't really care about any of that, and are just looking for the game's vibes and character stories... then I can't really say that I had any heart pounding emotional moments with any of them. Maybe a chuckle here and there, but you, as a character, are scripting into being the town goodie-two-shoes doormat whose personality is only a he/she/it yes-man in nearly most scenes and being a sarcastic one in only a small few, such as the blacksmith guy. \n\nMost of the game's economy just feels like a chore. There are things that are blatantly better than doing other stuff, such as blacksmithing. Turn ores into bars, make gear, sell for a ridiculous amount of profit compared to harvesting your crops or cooking. Cooking can make you a load of money, but takes far more time before you begin to even unlock features or specific crops to cook recipes. Selling your crops alone is pitiful, as the returns for time spent growing are awful for the majority of them. Spend $25 on seeds? Here, grow something worth maybe $40 after 4 days. Maybe you can turn it into food. Oh, it needs more ingredients? Spend another $100-200 to meet the recipe requirements so you can almost break even if you aren't able to mill for your own sugar or flour... which the crops haven't grown or are even in season yet.\n\nOne of the game's selling points is the ability to use magic and skill specializations. The magic ranges from \"why do i even want to use this over anything else\" to \"really good, useful no matter what\". For the former category, there's a spell that instantly grows crops in a 3x3 area or speeds up a fruit tree's growth by 1 growth stage. It takes up two mana resources that could've been used to cast something like calling in rain or restoring all your stamina instantly twice. The skill specializations are nice, it gives you a measure of progression and quality of life changes.\n\nAll in all if you take the game slowly and disregard the downsides listed, it can be a nice experience. But it doesn't quite stand out in any major way.",

      "review": "I'm a loot goblin. I hate this game. What's a person to do with only 30 inventory slots?\n\nI want the loot. I want to catch every bug that moves. Open every chest that glitters. Pluck every plant that grows. Haul in every fish. Harvest every material on the screen. I can't do most of this in bulk and I hate it.\n\nThis game isn't a game for loot goblins. God forbid someone tell you to \"leave your tools at home in a chest\" or \"plan ahead what you'll farm today\".\n\nIf you disregard all of that, the game is pretty relaxing in terms of music and atmosphere. However, games like Stardew Valley and Rune Factory 4 have it beat in many departments (like inventory space and time management). The characters are diverse and somewhat unique, but nothing really memorable. However, early on you'll find that gifting them items that normally they should at least prefer such as rare insects for the bug kid and unique rocks and gems for the ex-miner aren't quite all as obvious as it seems. Finding out what they like to begin with is purely random trial and error that doesn't always make sense. Give bug kid a regular beetle, he loves it. Give him a rare beetle that looks like it's been blessed by fire itself, neutral reaction. What.\n\nTime in this game passes by incredibly quickly, leaving you very little planning to do other than to focus on one to two main activities a day such as dungeon diving and archaeology or farming and fishing. Time passes by ridiculously quickly in Mistria. Passing out by staying up late has no demerits other than waking up late the next day with less energy, so if you're trying to head back from the dungeon to go back to sleep it's not a big deal to just pass out to teleport back home. For reference, pathing from your house to the dungeon takes an hour and thirty minutes minimum, even with speed boosts, to two hours. That, combined with whatever activity you've chosen for the day quickly passes time with not much room for anything else unless you try to do a small amount of everything. But just doing anything fills up your inventory quickly, and you can't simply store resources anywhere else but your farm. Going back home to make room for more wastes time, and not doing anything while traveling back and forth already wastes the time that you don't have. It's anxiety inducing.\n\nIf you don't really care about any of that, and are just looking for the game's vibes and character stories... then I can't really say that I had any heart pounding emotional moments with any of them. Maybe a chuckle here and there, but you, as a character, are scripting into being the town goodie-two-shoes doormat whose personality is only a he/she/it yes-man in nearly most scenes and being a sarcastic one in only a small few, such as the blacksmith guy. \n\nMost of the game's economy just feels like a chore. There are things that are blatantly better than doing other stuff, such as blacksmithing. Turn ores into bars, make gear, sell for a ridiculous amount of profit compared to harvesting your crops or cooking. Cooking can make you a load of money, but takes far more time before you begin to even unlock features or specific crops to cook recipes. Selling your crops alone is pitiful, as the returns for time spent growing are awful for the majority of them. Spend $25 on seeds? Here, grow something worth maybe $40 after 4 days. Maybe you can turn it into food. Oh, it needs more ingredients? Spend another $100-200 to meet the recipe requirements so you can almost break even if you aren't able to mill for your own sugar or flour... which the crops haven't grown or are even in season yet.\n\nOne of the game's selling points is the ability to use magic and skill specializations. The magic ranges from \"why do i even want to use this over anything else\" to \"really good, useful no matter what\". For the former category, there's a spell that instantly grows crops in a 3x3 area or speeds up a fruit tree's growth by 1 growth stage. It takes up two mana resources that could've been used to cast something like calling in rain or restoring all your stamina instantly twice. The skill specializations are nice, it gives you a measure of progression and quality of life changes.\n\nAll in all if you take the game slowly and disregard the downsides listed, it can be a nice experience. But it doesn't quite stand out in any major way.",

      "review": "I wish I could give this a Neutral there's a lot to love about this game, and it's as of yet still Early Access.\n\nThe art style and color palette is beautifully realized. It's cohesive and knows what it wants to look like. The decorating part with the clean pastel art style is incredibly satisfying. For the farming, it is not as fantasy-like with the farming as I expected, like Rune Factory, but it does its farming right. The storage to craft system is a huge QoL that I've yet to see in other farming games (if there are any, I haven't played them yet). The mining and the enemies are the right amount of tough.\n\nYet some really huge pain points for me are:\n1) The music:\nSomewhat grating and harsh notes sometimes. Most of the time I'm pretty neutral about the music, nothing much stands out. But when it does stand out, it's not in a good sense.\n\n2) The map:\nThe map is way too big and spaced out, from the town to the mines and everywhere else. Without putting your time on 'longer' or getting the Mistmare, a lot of minutes are wasted getting to and fro and it feels as if it didn't need to be that far apart since these assets, especially in the town, are just lots of empty space or wide road.\n\n3) The NPCs and the world. I'm not asking for a backwater depressing world like Stardew, but even in comparison to other cozy games like Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons/Animal Crossing/Natsumon, most of them are just almost perfect, saccharine sweet. I'm not asking for toxic and irredeemable characters, but it feels as if conflicts are easily solved or talked about in one or two heart events. It doesn't feel like anyone has a real flaw that makes them feel human. The kids feel like the funnest and most human NPCs in the game.\n\nAdditionally, I feel as if I go through some characters heart events where it is more or less the same thing, Adeline=work, Celine=flower. It suffers from making somebody's profession or hobby their thing and sometimes nothing more happens throughout some events, especially in relation to the three girls, Adeline, Celine, and Reina. \n\nTo compare it to a game like Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar, I can see characters having strained relationships with one another due to somebody being too overbearing, friends mustering up courage to talk about difficult things with someone, helping somebody get out of their shell from being a recluse, etc. \n\nThe world: \nThat there was a huge earthquake that happened doesn't make itself felt in the story and the gameplay. In just one or two seasons, it is very easy to surpass the rank that the town used to be before the earthquake and, progression-wise, makes it feel like I didn't achieve much at all. Nor am I working towards anything higher, since it doesn't seem like the town lost much at all. I also don't feel like anyone was that affected by a huge earthquake and it really feels as if nothing happened, besides making things accessible by clearing debris, upgrading buildings further down the line.\n\nThese may just be personal preferences, but for me the world and NPCs interactions with us and themselves especially big parts of what make Harvest Moon/SoS-style games riveting. I don't feel like I'm in a world with real people, thus it is hard to feel immersed. If anything changes down the line, I would be interested again.",

Stardew you sit on the furniture you have and it just makes the game more immersive. Also i find the Developer/Developers never talk or answer any questions. I just can't get into this game sorry it's a really 3rd rate stardew for me which is a shame it looks nice but it's just very lack lustre. Hey just my minority opinion but it's a nah from me!",
