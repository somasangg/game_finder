      "review": "I waited four years before playing this game due to pesky real-life distractions. Remembering, but not experiencing, all of the flak the game got near its release, I think I unwittingly timed it perfectly.\n\nWorld/Immersion:\nI won't be the only one to say it, and won't be the one to say it the best, but when you play this game, you're in another world which is supremely realized and oozes with life. The third or fourth ingame night after the intro I was making my way down the street, rain starting to fall, and the blade runner umbrellas popping out, wet streets shining under various lights, with \"I really want to stay at your house\" catching my ear on a passing radio followed by me quickly swapping to it on mine, just as it hit the ~55sec mark and opens up... the entire experience was pure, unadulterated _Excellence_. While the expansion is not perfect (but it's still pretty good), the part where the performer comes on stage at the party midway through--I was actually _in_ that room, making my way through the crowd to get a better view, just soaking it all in. The game has several chef's kiss moments such as these.\n\nStory:\nRight up there if not leagues ahead of 95%+ of other AAA games around the same time or since, and up there with some of the best indie games I've played the last decade. I was engaged pretty much the entire time. HR was not in the room. The characters have flaws, personalities, and reasonable goals for which they take reasonable actions to pursue, which is as refreshing as it is an unfortunately novel concept for much of western storytelling these days. If you'll forgive what is a severely dated comparison now, Fallout 4's story looks like the low-effort output of a 12 year old C student compared to what Cyberpunk offers. As far as V, your own character, dialog options never irked me; there was rarely a time where the thing I wanted to say wasn't an option for V, and never really a dialog summary that misled me. There's several subtly branching paths that might make a reply worthwhile.\n\nCombat:\nFeels fine enough, and more than a few times a bit of a thrill, especially for the first couple of encounters each time after you unlock (or install) some new ability. I played it on normal mode, and I think I somewhat regret not doing it one notch harder. Despite combat feeling good and not really being a weakness, it would be the weakest point of this masterpiece if I was forced to choose one.\n\nNon-combat Gameplay:\nDriving a car or bike feels fine enough. Movement in general feels just fine. The little hacking game is not as annoying as most other ones in other games. Brain dances are a fantastic thing to play with, even if they are slightly hand-holdy. Entering and leaving conversations with people feels extremely fluid. Ingame money isn't so plentiful that it quickly feels useless, but not so hard to obtain that it feels like you must grind. The crafting system is limited and largely ignorable for those that prefer that, yet still worthwhile enough for those who prefer having one. \n\nBugs:\nI'm only addressing this since the game was notorious at launch. I played this game for the first time in December 2024, right as v2.2 dropped. In my 100+ hours, I noticed three odd NPC clipping incidents, some cars clipping through on cutscenes (seemingly to avoid collisions during dialog, which I am okay as a fudge to preserve immersion (though apparently this was even addressed in a patch later in 2025!)), and one glaring floating object. The most common thing to happen, maybe 12-16 times for me across 100+ hours, was for environmental clutter objects, especially stacked ones like piles of garbage, to jostle or break as you enter a room or get near them. If this hadn't have happened I might have forgotten I was playing video game entirely. For the scope and complexity of this game, that these things are all I noticed is damned impressive.\n\nPerformance:\nThis thing ran silky smooth almost all of the time on medium-high settings on my unimpressive 2023 rig. At times when driving through the city at 180+ MPH there was some 50~100ms load stuttering every 45 seconds or so. Not a single crash to desktop. All in all very pleasing.\n\nAnnoying Monetization:\nNone! No ingame micro DLCs or other signs of the rot affecting most other publishers. Thank you, CDPR.\n\n\nI can't speak about how it was at launch, but as for the game that I just finished in 2025? These guys fucking nailed it. I can't recommend it highly enough. Treat yourself to this experience if you have not yet done so. It's well worth full price, and on a sale you'd be silly not to grab it, even if it takes you a few years to get around to playing it.",

In the nearly 300 hours of play through, I agonise a lot over these decisions. Whether to go full stealth or guns blazing, to throw my lot in with one faction over another, to keep a secret or reveal it for financial reasons, whether to side with Songbird or Reed. All of these things are something I really enjoyed in an RPG: meaningful choices. Choices that defines these characters, and reflects how one views the world and oneself.\n\nOf course, this being a video game, it's a simple enough matter to load a previous save game if one isn't happy with the outcome. But in a world where everything is not black or white and immersion is one of its biggest selling points, I feel save-scumming will defeat the entire philosophy behind the quest designs of this game. Whether these decisions will lead into a satisfying conclusion at the end of the game, that is up to us as the players to define it, on our own terms.",

It marries a gripping story with a huge open world absolutely dripping with atmosphere; one in which, after fifty hours of gameplay, I still feel like I've only scratched its surface. Even now I'm itching to jump back in and complete yet more side jobs, not only because they're enjoyable, but also just in case they offer V more options when it comes to ending their story. I'm even contemplating starting over anew to change the outcome of some events with the benefit of hindsight. If you were expecting a light-hearted affair full of futuristic hijinks then you might not find what you want here – though it does let its hair down every once in a while. Instead, what Cyberpunk 2077 delivers is a surprisingly serious story that's genuinely touching at times, with gameplay that lets you be in charge of your destiny. If you want your experience in Night City to be as polished as possible, perhaps hold back until a patch or two has landed to iron out some kinks, but you'll definitely want to visit soon. Phenomenal, that's what Cyberpunk 2077 is.Cyberpunk 2077 is a celebration of the entire medium, marrying cutting-edge technical innovation, unrestrained user agency in an authentic and immersive experience that transports you to another universe. No game has executed on the promise of gaming like Cyberpunk 2077. CD Projekt RED's artistic achievement cannot be overstated…Despite an impressive array of bugs and glitches, Cyberpunk 2077 remains an experience without peer. No punches pulled, no platitudes are given, and no compromises are made. Cyberpunk 2077 is an industry highpoint that, simply put, may never be bested. Right now, and without hesitation, I am overjoyed to say Cyberpunk 2077 is everything I've ever wanted from a game. It is the best game I have ever played.",

      "review": "[H1]Cyberpunk 2077[/h1][hr][/hr] \n30-200+ hours to complete, Cyberpunk 2077 is a first-person dystopian nightmare where you play as V, a mercenary living in Night City – The City of Dreams. Pick your background, your playstyle, your traits, and upgrade yourself at a Ripper with various Cybernetics as you carve out your legend in an unforgiving, glimmering city that will eat you alive if you don’t fight back. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3615853917 \nTo me, Cyberpunk definitely felt more like an experience than a game. Every quest has two or five ways it can end, the characters feel human and morally complex with how they act, how they react, their backgrounds, and branch into your story that makes them more than a side quest. The voice actors did phenomenal jobs conveying personality and emotion, more so than any other game I can think of that I’ve played in the past three years. You will sympathize with them, empathize, and relate to these npcs who feel like fully realized people, and with Johnny, especially Johnny, how he constantly challenges you and comments on your decisions, and opens up is such a surreal and oddly natural experience, especially with how some of them show their character growth. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3590308079 \nMoving on to Night City itself, I adored it. It’s loud, it’s futuristic, and it’s as beautiful as it is rotten with all its trash spilling out from between buildings and overflowing garbage bins. Also, somehow, it’s completely walkable with a WORKING public transportation system, an honest to god metro transit I spent way too much time in. (I’ve never personally lived in a state where it was possible to Not Own A Car.) and I adored its towering buildings and districted areas. It’s absolutely such a treat, you can find a ton of food stalls, shops, places where npcs linger around, bits of environmental storytelling like homeless camps, crime scenes, crashed cars with data messages, a guy who died via vending machine, religious groups doing public speeches. You never know when you’re gonna get pulled into a side quest or what you find exploring random forgotten corners.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3615855273 \nIt's weird that I’ve gotten this far without talking about how much I hated Cyberpunk the first 50 or so hours I played it. I love RPGs, I love happy endings, but Cyberpunk is genuinely and truly a game about compromises, lose-lose situations, and letting you pick what bittersweet poison you will drink next. NPCs will meet or choose terrible fates without you being able to do a single thing about it, and you have to accept it. Night City is legitimately a terrible place to live and it shows that in every questline. Some quests are timed, and the game doesn’t tell you, and there were a few times I felt like I was actively being punished for exploring the open world instead of following the storyline. NPCs will call you, they will ask for help, and despite best efforts, quest lines pile up and can get seriously complicated if you don’t resolve them and let them linger. How you spend your time in Night City is almost as important as exploring it – this is a warning. It took me a long time to appreciate the value of a story without a happy ending, but in the end, I’m really glad I strayed out of my comfort zone and stuck with it.\n[code]If you liked this review and want to read about similar games or just support me on my journey of playing my entire Steam backlog, you can join my curator group, [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/39675075/] Rune's Reviews![/url] Have a nice day!

      "review": "In October of 2012 a trailer dropped, CD Projekt Red were going to do Cyberpunk 2077. What followed in January 2013 was a video of Mike Pondsmith, the author of the Cyberpunk pen and paper RPG, regaling us with his vision of his setting, thus starting the hype for one of the most anticipated games in the following years. The game released in December of 2020, but 8 years of expectations met a cold harsh reality, not unlike that of Night City.\n\nSo where does the game stand 5 years later post release, after numerous larger updates and a full DLC? Is it worth your time to play through it?\n\nYes, but with several caveats.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is a first person action RPG shooter, featuring a dystopian near future, Night City, where corporations hold the power, and everyone else struggles to get by. Enter V, the titular character, a cyber punk that gets dealt a bad hand during a heist and who then struggles to come out alive on the other side of it.\n\nThe game's story is clearly its high point, even though it threads familiar ground and it’s all something we’ve seen before. In fact I’d go so far as to say it's basically the plot of a Johnny Mnemonic and Strange Days mashup, the main plot features elements of both movies, the only thing missing is the dolphin, and I admit I was fully expecting it at some point. Add a sprinkle of the 13th floor mixed in, and you can basically sum up the entirety of the storyline.\n\nThe game is very narrative heavy, full of very long dialog heavy scenes, which is not necessarily negative, but the gameplay is kinda poor, as the vehicle for this narration.\n\nThe main story clashes against the seemingly open world approach to the rest of the game. The story has a great sense of urgency, but the gameplay doesn’t, as V is slowly dying from the biochip he klepted, which is ridiculous  for a game which also tries to serve up a freeform open world game.\nThis narrative disconnect, or \"Ludonarrative dissonance\" can easily take you out of the overall immersion.\n\nThis isn’t helped by the gameplay outside the main story threads being somewhat on the weaker side.\nYou have this sizable cityscape to explore, but where's the emergent gameplay? Everything in Night City is static scripted placements, just sitting there waiting for you to roll by. The city lacks dynamic gameplay.\n\nThe overall story threads sees you as a mercenary working up through a reputation mechanic called Street Cred, but ultimately this serves little purpose other than to gate a handful of missions, as a pseudo leveling restriction.\nMany of these side quests / tasks barely have any differences between them.\nThey are frequently presented by the in universe quest givers called Fixers, each offering a series of side content that leads nowhere. With no tie in with the Street Cred mechanic or the overall narrative, they exist in a pocket.\n\nThe city police, the NCPD, is the most inept and chaotic, you can walk into a bar and just blast every ganger to bits and they don't respond, but god forbid you run over a pedestrian, because Auto-Drive is designed by a gonk-brain, they’ll be on your case instantly.\nThey also constantly need you to clean up boringly trivial “flash points” throughout the city, which ranges from five different variants of “shoot these NPCs”.\nVariants of “shoot this gonk” should have been a part of the dynamism that's missing. We had a MMORPG some 25 odd years ago that had the right idea, Anarchy Online, and its mission generator. Night City could have used something similar, it would also tie in well with the mercenary approach.\n\nGiven the repetitiveness of the side content, by the time you’re through with them, most of the mechanics and the storytelling have long overstayed their welcome. The side content is reminiscent of Ubisoft design philosophy, repetitive spam.\n\nThen there’s the non-combat aspects, you can rent new apartments, but the story treats your original apartment as the only one. No one rides motorbikes in the city. There aren't even real vendors for vehicle purchases, it’s just a lazy catalogue terminal.\n\nThere’s ripper docs, a big part of the universe, as they are the ones that offer installation of cyberware, but they all offer identical services and availability.\nThe clothing stores offer a random, at the time of visit, assortment, for a first person perspective game. You almost never see your character outside of Photo Mode. On top of that with a random selection you cannot get any specific fits.\nConsumable vendors, if you’re lucky they have what you want, sell in quantities of 2-4 items.\nThe in-universe setting is 2077, everything is online and connected, yet the gameplay design is so dated it’s still using walk-in vendors.\n\nMany of these features feel like half baked after thoughts and an aging design philosophy.\n\nSpeaking of half baked, there’s the progression systems, it’s an RPG after all.\nThe main progression system is incredibly dull, the same old trite banality, on top of weird level-adjacent perks and skills, that are wholly disjointed and create an overall awkward experience. You have an assortment of Attributes, which limits what perks you can choose which affects various weapons, side adjacent you have a progression system that’s influenced by your actions, giving minor stat boosts and more perk points.\n\nThe cyberware has seemingly random stats, you can upgrade iconic weapons, but not regular ones, you can slot in mods in weapons, but not take them out, \n\nAdd to that yet another disjointed system in the expansion.\n\nOverall it’s just a large mess of systems and ideas that don't fit together.\n\nThe combat isn’t worth writing much about, it is really basic and the AI is relatively trivial. The game also strongarms in a not-magic spells system, which is rather silly, because the devs couldn’t design the real netrunner experience or let it be handled by NPCs, so now we have techno-mages hacking people remotely with not-spells.\n\nThe game features a selection of radio stations, many of which are not very classical cyberpunky / techno / punky / dark ambient, they feel too contemporary. There’s also a dire lack of ambient music throughout the game. A game which is ripe for Blade Runner-esque scenes and grand ambient sci-fi themes.\n\nThe expansion is a spy thriller, one we've watched 100s of times in movies and tv series, one cliche after another, it is Escape from New York mixed with Ghost In the Shell story beats. An entirely standalone compartmentalized experience, with very little in common with the core game. It feels like the usual quick buck AAA expansions we used to get for games 15 years ago, it does nothing for the main game experience.\nIt also didn't need yet another high profile actor. Add to that, that Songbirds story is just a carbon copy of V's. You can do without the expansion.\n\nOverall they could have done so much more with the game, this game was ripe with potential, The biggest crime this game does is that it's a solo experience, you never get the team, where are the NPC companions joining you on missions? Where's the crew, so many side quest characters are obvious choices for joining up with V as his merc crew.\n\nYou should treat the game like a tv show, that’s how the game presents itself, as a lengthy tv show, full of filler episodes and a bit of a core story, like the old 23 episodes format.\nThe game oozes atmosphere, but that's really all it has going for it. We're so starved for a good cyberpunk experience that even this middling experience is welcome.\n\nIt’s very telling that only 36% have completed the main storyline, despite the games seemingly popularity. Perhaps further emphasized by how most of the playerbase is playing dress up with mods and treating it like The Sims.",

The atmosphere, the music, the characters, the chaos, the beauty… everything pulls you in and refuses to let go.\n\nWhat I love the most is how alive the game feels. Every street has a story, every gig feels unique, and every interaction made me feel like my choices actually mattered. And the writing? Insane. Characters like V, Johnny, Panam, Judy, Songbird (Phantom Liberty) — they feel like real people you don’t forget.\n\nThe combat is stylish and satisfying, whether you’re going full netrunner, katana-slashing, or blasting with smart weapons. The builds you can create are crazy fun, and the game gives you so much freedom to play your way.\n\nAnd after all the updates and expansions, Cyberpunk 2077 feels like the game it was always meant to be. Smooth, polished, and absolutely stunning. Phantom Liberty especially took the story to another level — emotional, cinematic, and unforgettable.\n\nThis is one of those games where you finish the story… and then you just sit there, thinking.

      "review": "Omg Phantom Liberty DLC is 100 times better than the base game. If I had known earlier, I should have started it from the first. The details and everything are amazing, even though the map is just district-sized, it’s packed with so much detail, like NPC dialogue, lore, etc. I wish the base game started like this. And I don’t want any people to comment and say, “The base game is already good, blah blah blah.” Nope, I won’t agree. The whole thing with Jacky felt rushed, less detailed. The base game map is a good size, good verticality, but just billboards; the NPCs are lifeless. Of course, there are unique NPC dialogues in the base game, but very little—you can notice that only on important streets and areas. Driving feels off (not completed properly, like GTA 4 or 5 physics, weight, tires, etc). Combat is good (not gonna lie here). Infiltrating a building has many options (according to your build), and I like that very much. And the worst part of this game is, it literally forces you into UI/Menus for almost 50 percent of the game, like buying (guns, food, clothes), upgrading, and crafting, all done in UI. Even a lot of development is skipped in the base game. Of course, you can go and physically see fixers, but the gigs are rushed in development. Literally forces you into the UI/Holo menu for half of the game.\r\n\r\nGood Combat\r\n\r\nGood build Design, like cyberware and skills ( but not excellent, I hoped for more animations for each cyberware when you fit it, but huge disappointment, only has 3 or 2 animations only in quests)\r\n\r\nGood Infiltration Design for each build (buildings, gang locations, etc)\r\n\r\nGood combat AI for enemies (not bad)\r\n\r\nAverage Driving Experience (physics, weight, movement, etc) not bad, also not good.\r\n\r\nBad Forced/Skipped Content – Most done in UI/Menus (eating, buying, upgrading, etc. expected more immersiveness, just felt like some basic FPS RPG - Most importantly, Holo calls for Gigs instead of proper direct animations and view.\r\n\r\nBad Optics or Live UI/GFX Design – I don’t like how the basic screen and optical GFX work in this game; they could have gone with a better design, a more immersive approach.\r\n\r\nBad NPC AI Coding/Pathing for the game – the game NPC code is a no-brainer, very simple and basic, i say it cant even be compared to older open world games( i dont want to mention names here).\r\n\r\nBut I never Noticed Bad things in Phantom Liberty NPCs, they all feel Unique and rich in detail.\r\n\r\nCop design is average.\r\n\r\nVery GOOD level of facial expression and detail (almost realistic) in side quests and main quests – I think that might be a reason why the game is not boring, more like interesting, good.\r\n\r\nAverage story - rushed Jackie's plot and so on. not like *Phantom Liberty’s proper narrative.\r\n\r\nAverage graphics (pretty much plasticky, reflecty art style implemented here, which i dont like, examples slimy roads in Night City, plastic wall textures, etc, i wanted it to feel more Rawish, just like textures in Phantom Liberty (detailed).\r\n\r\nNot boring, it felt good to play the game, had fun\r\n\r\nHad too many expectations, they marketed this game as “next-gen adventure open world game,” and I watched all the trailers and news without missing, too much hype. My expectation was huge, but for me it just felt huge disappoinment, but phantom libery dlc cured my heart by a good amount. if you take open world mechanics and backward coding implementation,s it is very bad if you compare it to older open world, or other rpg like games.\r\n\r\nOverall: Solid game 7/10 base game + Phantom Liberty. I mean, Phantom Liberty is literally amazing, I can give it a solid 9/10 separate score!\r\n\r\nThis is my opinion: you might feel entirely different, so pipe the flip down and enjoy my review.",

Madem eklediniz, birkaç tane daha ekleyebilirdiniz; eklemeyecekseniz de hiç koymamanız daha mantıklı olurdu diye düşündüğüm zamanlar oldu.\r\n\r\nYine de tüm bu eksiklerine rağmen, günümüzde oynanabilecek en kaliteli oyunlardan biri.

      "review": "I have been continuously returning to Cyberpunk 2077 since its initial release because of 1 thing, the emotions that it stirs in me every time I think about it. I will never forget my first playthrough, the twists and turns of the Arasaka job, meeting Panam, River, and Judy, doing gigs and stopping crimes, stumbling across my favorite sidequest in video game history \"Sinnerman\", or experiencing the sublime beauty of \"The Star\" ending, which still makes me teary eyed thinking about it now, almost 5 years later. No other game captures the bittersweet angst and beauty of this one. Night City is hands down my favorite setting in any game I have ever played. \n\nSure the combat is not as in depth as other ultra-high budget RPGs, but it has become radically more engaging as the game has been updated, and is much more fun and rewarding now than it was when it launched. Its still buggy in some places, and I've had to reload quicksaves to fix some graphics weirdness a handful of times in my most recent playthrough, but it is a testament to the emotional core of this game that I have stuck with it and returned to it every year since its launch when my first impression of the game was a version that was held together with duct tape and spit. Its a testament to the upstanding people that are CD Projekt Red that they have shifted public perception of this game from \"joke of an entire industry\" to \"critically acclaimed modern classic\". \n\nI urge anyone with an interest in science fiction, video games as art, or engrossing stories in general, to pick this up the first chance you can. I will never forget where I was and how I felt when I first played Cyberpunk 2077, and I want others to experience what has over time, become one of my absolute favorite games of all time. Phantom Liberty making a game I already loved even better is the cherry on top.",

      "review": "I played this game on PC.\r\nI held off so long on playing this game because of it's sloppy launch, I remember it too well, it was so bad that it had to be taken off stores and refunded to customers. Few games, even bad ones, achieve that kind of failure, but Cyberpunk did, one of the most highly anticipated games at the time, but as years passed, I heard updates had been pushed, glitches fixed and even people celebrating the game's newfound success. Especially once the anime released to critical acclaim, I finally caved and purchased it so I could experience it for myself.\r\nOne thing should be clear, Cyberpunk 2077 is still unfortunately quite buggy, animations break, T-Poses randomly occur and NPCs lips arent synced way too often, at least for my playthrough. It took barely 10 minutes to get my first major glitch and it was not reassuring, but from what I can tell, the game has come a long way. Between the occasional glitch is a fine game with an exciting story and equally incredible world. Night City is beautiful and this universe created by Mike Pondsmith is nothing short of impressive. The story is so enticing with the \"ghost\" of Johnny Silverhand corrupting your mind, maybe you'll become enemies, maybe you'll become friends. It's an anti-capitalist epic that I can honestly say deserves it's praise. The RPG elements are expertly implemented and feel very approachable and easy to comprehend. This isn't GTA, but if thats what youre looking for, I dont think youll be disappointed. I cant wait for whats next in this franchise. 8.5/10",

      "review": "It is genuinely hard to believe that five years have passed since the disaster of December 2020, but Cyberpunk 2077 in 2025 stands as a monumental testament to redemption. What started as a crash-prone mess of broken promises has been polished into the undisputed RPG of the decade. CD Projekt Red didn't abandon ship; they dug in, overhauled the core systems, and delivered the masterpiece we were promised. The glitches are gone, the \"police system\" actually works, and the game runs smooth as chrome, leaving only the sheer brilliance of the underlying vision.\r\n\r\nNight City finally feels like the living, breathing, dangerous metropolis it was meant to be. The immersion is unparalleled—from the neon-soaked streets of Kabuki to the corporate sterility of City Center, every corner tells a story. The combat has evolved from clunky to spectacular; whether you're slicing bullets with a katana or hacking brains from the shadows, the power fantasy is perfectly tuned. The crowds are dense, the AI is reactive, and the city no longer feels like a cardboard set, but a vibrant, vertical world that swallows you whole.\r\n\r\nAt its core, however, remains the soul of the machine: the story of V and Johnny Silverhand. Now that the technical distractions have vanished, the narrative hits with the force of a sledgehammer, delivering mature, cynical, and deeply human moments that stick with you long after the credits roll. If you swore off this game back in 2020, it is time to break that vow. This isn't just a fixed game; it is the definitive cyberpunk experience and a modern classic.

      "review": "Cyberpunk 2077 is most certainly a contender for my top five games of all time, easily. Now i wasnt someone who was following the development cycle of this game before it was released. but i did pre order and i was excited to get my hands on it and see what it was all about, as it peaked my interest for sure with its themes alone. now when cyberpunk released i had a really good computer for that time, so i got a near glitchless, bugless first experience. I know this was not the case for many people, and i wont excuse the game being pushed out faster then it shouldve been. I truly think they shouldve held off on releasing the game and i hope they learned their lesson and wont do that again. but now that a lot of time has passed, weve gotten lots of updates and content drops for free, and a great paid dlc with a whole new story basically. This leaves cyberpunk in a great spot and i think anyone who hasnt given this game a shot because of that bad launch, should absolutely play this game now. we know they are going to make a sequel and they are producing another season of the cyberpunk show. theres a lot to look forward to here. Cyberpunk also features insane graphics, they are pushing the industry to its full potential. especially with mods, i have quickly glanced at screenshots from this game sometimes and thought it was real life photos. also the music in this game is so amazing. they have produced so much music that fits the setting of this world its incredible. just driving around with the radio on, passing by crowded parks of people and tall as the eye can see skyscrapers is so immersive. you can really get lost in this game with its visuals and audio . i love how the music in this game supplements the visuals of night city so well. theres songs in all sorts of different genres that help add some real depth into this crazy universe. it really helps with the world building when the music compliments the visuals the way they do in cyberpunk. a cold dark night, police lockdowns, psychos going crazy, gangs in military level wars over turf. super soldier like police forces fighting back. its dark and really embodies that dystopian feeling the game set out to showcase. the environments really help paint the picture of a decaying social norms. it blends these themes of oppression and hopelessness, depression and pervasion.  And with Cyberpunk being an open world, first person shooter RPG, there is so much you can do build wise. so many different ways to play and complete the tasks you set out to achieve. I think this game will easily be one of those games we all back at in ten years and really appreciate what this game is. Games like this are becoming increasingly rare and hard to come by.",

The game had me bawling my eyes out more than I care to admit, and it's easy to understand why when you see and recognize the immense love and care that CDPR has put into making 2077 truly special. Every major character feels like an actual living person with goals, aspirations, and personalities, with their own unique interests and responses to how you choose to talk and act with them. You can try your best to help people but after all is said and done, Cyberpunk leaves you realizing just how bleak and punishing Night City, as well as our seemingly destined future is. Even the \"happy\" endings will leave you with a pit in your stomach, but at least some of them were caused by you choosing your own fate. Though, in the end, you'll wind up affecting others' lives as well as their own fates no matter how hard you try to distance yourself, because you never realize just how many people care for you.

      "review": "Hi came here because of Edgerunners to the surprise of probably no one \n\nUsually these types of games aren’t my thing, but I think it’s saying a lot if a 10 episode show can convince me to not only purchase an $80 game, but make a review that isn’t just a one-off joke sentence like usual. I’m aware that I’m like a drop in the sea of reviews saying the same things here, but yknow\n\nWorth EVERY penny, story is great and I’m not even at the end yet, been doing all the side quests\n\nWorldbuilding is AWESOME, it's so interesting especially with the implants and stuff, like WHY can’t I get chromed up IRL man that shit would be so fire. The whole vibe of Night City as well, it feels so unforgiving and I LOVE that, especially with the context I first got from Edgerunners. \nThe different areas of NC, and the different gangs and groups with their own ideals rules and reasons for doing the things that they do, albeit mostly questionable, is also pretty cool. They all have a different vibe to them. \n\nI haven’t drowned myself completely in all of the lore yet but I’m invested enough that it’s utterly inevitable at this point\n\nGameplay is a lot more fun than I expected, I thought I’d get bored after a while but going buck wild on enemies or doing literally anything in game will never get old to me, even just hopping and dashing around. Gets better the more you play too. \nI don’t think there has been a single time where I’ve gotten bored during anything because there’s so much you can do. Is all of it mandatory? Not at all, but it doesn’t feel pointless after completing it. Doesn’t feel like you just wasted your time \n\nDialogue is amazing, 9 times out of 10 there’s usually an option to skip through the dialogue, but I haven’t pressed it once lmao, all of it feels so natural and it’s immersive as hell ( + I love their little slang terms so much). \nThe dialogue doesn’t have an unbearable amount of exposition, you can just roam around the setting on your own and pick up all the context clues on how horrible the state of the world is yourself. Yes, some things ARE just straight up explained to you, obviously, so you aren’t totally lost, but you aren’t just sitting there listening to paragraphs upon paragraphs of unskippable gobbledygook. Also the VOICE ACTING, IT’S GREAT\n\nUnimportant mention but I like how the characters that speak different languages have their sentences translated automatically with the text at the bottom like it’s being decrypted, in a way \n\nOnly came across like two soft locks and one random bug where I got flung out of the world and teleported miles back during a boss fight, but I just reloaded my last save and everything was fine. I’ve heard a lot of stuff about the launch of this game and how horrible it supposedly was. I obviously wasn’t there to see the whole ordeal myself, but I just know that the game I have right now is certainly much different and vastly more playable. I watched some gameplay of 1.0 a while back and I can absolutely see the improvement\n\nAlso Panam and Judy are really neat :D \n\n9.5/10 \nTotally worth the money",

      "review": "Cyberpunk 2077 joins No Man's Sky and Final Fantasy 14 in a small group of abject failures turned into some of gaming's greats. I bought this game on launch and played through it three times in a row, pulling some of my first all-nighters in years. I was lucky to experience very little of the glitches or game-breaking bugs others would experience at launch. Instead, I was met with something that resonated with me in spite of its issues at the time: a wooden open world, a non-existent penalty system when committing crimes, and the side quests are just unimaginative. When I was younger and time was abundant, this would matter less to me. I am more protective of my time these days.\r\n\r\nThe performances by the actors, the writing, the overall sound design, the aesthetic, and the atmosphere are all through the roof. Night City is truly dystopian. The world is lifeless - it's just there - it doesn't respond to the player in meaningful ways. Yet it is deeply detailed in its environments. I am also of the opinion that its wooden open world adds to the dystopian aesthetic - in an uncanny way, there's an element of listlessness to it all. The AI for the NPCs is not great, the police or rival factions do little to pursue you should you run away, and it is void of the same traits that The Witcher 3 or Bethesda style open worlds have: Something that grabs your attention and yanks you off of your current goal and down a rabbit hole. The kind where you come out of the other side disheveled and confused, wondering what year it is.\r\n\r\nThis is a unique and, potentially, catastrophic failing for an open world game. Ubisoft solves this, for better or worse, by prodding you with UI elements that remind you of your checklist. For me, that introduces stress and distracts me. For others, it keeps them focused. In any case, it succeeds in overwhelming amounts to keep people in their world. This is most successful in Ubisoft style open worlds made by other developers: Shadow of War/Shadow of Mordor, the Horizon series, etc. Cyberpunk's open world does not keep me in it, the major plots do. The characters do. The performances do. I believe this stems from a few overarching factors. The  barebones AI, the uninspiring side content and the fact that Cyberpunk spoils itself by being so cinematic in its main content that when you encounter the less imaginative side-quests it feels off-putting. Finally, Night City is decidedly interesting, but I do not want to be there. It is a horrible place full to the brim of suffering. And the narrative, as beautifully written as it is, also harms the open world.\r\n\r\nThe world of The Witcher, or The Elder Scrolls, or even Ghost of Tsushima are all also terrifying. But they are power fantasies, you are the hero, you are decidedly the most capable entity walking around the open world. The same is true in Cyberpunk, but V is dying the entire story. There is no happy ending. I don't want to occupy that space. Cyberpunk is every bit a Greek tragedy. Experience it, learn from it, critique it, dissect it. Live it, though? No thanks. \r\n\r\nIt is also sobering that, what we see in Cyberpunk, could become reality for us. It is too few degrees removed from reality. The Witcher and The Elder Scrolls can be explained away as pure fantasy, and are still written with the end result of victory. V's victory, if there is one, is pyrrhic at best. \r\n\r\nStill, this game is a work of art. A true triumph. There are few times in my life where a story I have read, played, experienced, has left me feeling a distinct emotion. Cyberpunk's is emptiness, sadness. And I feel it in spades. Edgerunners made me feel it, too. The pacing, the choices, the characters, the aesthetic, the stakes, all of it overshadows the flawed open world and leaves us with one of the greatest games we may ever play. Some might say it is derivative - what isn't? Your favorite fantasy games are almost exclusively derived from Tolkein and Dungeons and Dragons.\r\n\r\nIf you've avoided it due to the launch, and are willing to forgive CDPR, I recommend playing this game.",

It's not DOOM, but it's solid.\n● Quality of the story is average, but it has a few great moments.\n● Today (2025), the game is largely bug-free. In 180 hours of play, I only fell through the world twice, and occasionally a car got stuck in the asphalt.\n\nCONS\n\n- The cyberpunk atmosphere could be more \"noir\" for my taste; personally, I think the sun shines too often in the blue sky (needs more acid rain).\n- In some cases, I found the dialogues and explanations unnecessarily long.\n- The hacking minigame is more exciting in other games (Deus Ex).\n\nNOTES:\n\n● Be sure to play with Phantom Liberty!\n● I also recommend some QOL mods, like detachable weapon mods or custom map markers.",

See below for explanation.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 an absolutely incredible experience in every way, in every perspective, from beginning to end. There are even some rather drastic changes that can occur throughout the story depending on the choices you or don't make and, as fantastic as the main storyline is and how it unfolds, the side quests much of the time shine even more in regards to characters, situations and potential outcomes of each one.\n\nBefore walking away from PC gaming for a time and being so sure I'd not return that I deleted every game account I owned, returning to PC gaming was only inevitable for numerous reasons and, before deleting my account, I had almost 1,000 hours in Cyberpunk, having played through the story four times, and roamed Night City for countless hours.\n\nI also bought 2077 through GOG and, with my temporary move back to consoles (XBOX, specifically) had bought Cyberpunk on that platform, which actually looked and ran excellent. I had the GOG version installed before it went on sale again on Steam and had put another 300 hours into that version. I waited for a sale, and bought 2077 a fourth time on this new Steam account.\n\nWhile all art is indeed subjective, I can not stress enough that there are some things that are simply objectively outstanding, whether you've a personal affinity for that particular work of art or not, and Cyberpunk 2077 is both objectively, and subjectively, an absolute masterpiece of gaming art.\n\nAs for any negative aspects regarding the game, there aren't many, and most are completely subjective. Perhaps the biggest complaint, is not being able to spend time with your love interest and engaging in more activities together.\n\nSome examples: having them in your car when driving, perhaps making small talk, or going out to play pool or even to have a drink at a bar. Perhaps even sitting to actually watch television together. These would have make your already strong connections to your love interest far more immersive.\n\nHowever, none of these things prevent this game being objectively being a masterpiece that has become one of my absolute favorite and personal games of the many decades I've been gaming.",

This means no multiplayer and with that giant influx of income missing, no real additive change from this point on. Yes you can have fun, which I did. You can also get bored, which I did. but that is an issue all open world games share. The story is well crafted but from what I understand this game was base off a book series so that should be the floor when entering this game. Surprisingly little customization for your own character, and whilst there is a good amount of interesting characters you can only romance 2-3 depending on your sexuality. It is moddable, which adds value, and the DLC was pretty substantive. If you get the game on sale then you got it at the price it should be considering everything it lacks. Remember, this was CD's answer to GTA, and it doesn't even have multiplayer. Right now the price is $20.99 and only because of that do I give a positive recommendation.

The graphics are stunning, the combat is incredible, and even the map itself is breathtaking. CD Projekt RED truly outdid themselves with this masterpiece.\n\nEvery detail is overwhelming in the best way possible, and the amount of character development and dialogue will keep you immersed for hours. I spent nearly two hours just customizing my character, V, before even starting the main game! The customization options are massive — from your character’s appearance to your properties, vehicles, cyberware, and weapons.\n\nAnd it doesn’t stop there — mods take the experience even further, adding new life to the game long after you’ve finished the story.\n\nThe story mode starts off breathtakingly — emotional and tragic at the same time. Night City feels like a living, breathing world filled with beauty and despair. It gives you the sense that no matter how hard you try, there are rarely happy endings — just pain and survival. The game can be emotionally heavy, but that’s what makes it so powerful.\n\nIt’s fascinating to see how corporations hold immense power in this dystopian future and how they shape the geopolitical landscape. The city’s gangs are just as compelling — tough, ruthless, and deeply tied to the city’s politics and culture.\n\nI highly recommend simply driving around Night City to soak in the atmosphere and witness all the random events happening around you. They make the world feel truly alive. And don’t even get me started on the side quests — they’re practically endless, packed with content and depth.\n\nThe experience doesn’t end with the main story either — the Phantom Liberty DLC is a 100% must-buy. It’s incredible and adds so much to the world and characters.\n\nIn short: just buy this game. Cyberpunk 2077 is an unforgettable journey that combines breathtaking visuals, deep storytelling, and endless replayability.",

The comeback is insane. The PL DLC shows how far this game has come it’s honestly one of the best redemption arcs in gaming and you can really feel the years of hard work the devs poured into it. \n\nMy favorite ending has to be \"don’t fear the reaper\" just V and Johnny attacking Arasaka like absolute badasses and then choosing the \"sun ending\" where V becomes an afterlife legend.

      "review": "I object to some of the design choices like\n\n-missing out on unique loot because of your story decisions,\n\n-changes CDPR has made with updates (like removing stats from clothes, thus making them purely cosmetic, you won't see ninja-players this colorful in any other game),\n\n-how things like changing your skills in your skill tree on the fly when and where ever as well as effectively rebuilding your entire body at a ripperdoc is allowed but changing your attributes is not (which effectively prevents you from accessing to even try some of the end-game perks, forcing you to play through the game multiple times, including leveling up to level cap of 60 multiple times),\n\n-the way how the small amount of weapon customization works, as in once you add a mod that actually changes how the weapon behaves, you can't remove it anymore,\n\n-spending so much time and effort to making so many dialogue options for so many possible things you might do during your playthroughs and yet no-one thought about adding something like a simple \"thanks\" as a dialogue option (this is not an actual issue but it makes me feel like a douche when people like vendors effectively tell me to... \"go sex my own body\" when I leave without a farewell),\n\n-random nature of your nitty-gritty stat upgrades via the cyberware, making you travel through ripperdocs, buying the part you want, upgrade it, hope you get the stat(s) you want in the first place and then hoping it's better than what you already had, making the search for a upgrade of even 0,1% VERY expensive,\n\nor\n\n-how skillchecks are handled (on hardest difficulty at least), specifically how they ramp up as you level up so you either max out specific attributes ASAP or else you'll be locked out of things like alternative routes during missions, potentially costing you unique loot.\n\nThat said, I get it, Cyberpunk 2077 is an RPG, not a god-simulator like Fallout 4 where you can max out your everything. I can tolerate the things I listed above for the sake of gameplay.\n\nMy single biggest personal issue with Cyberpunk 2077 aren't the bugs, gameplay or game designs though. It's the world itself. Sure, I get it, everything is dystopian sexed-up-cyber-slop where everything is owned by a corpo (including governments) and so on, but the amount of [i]noise[/i] in almost every location you visit is what got to me. I don't know what kind of mental instability every thug in Night City has but why do they insist on turning on just about every single TV blasting advertisement spam channels and every radio to play a random station, all on full volume in almost every single location they recide in, no matter the gang? No I'm serious, you get bored of before getting sick of hearing the some moans in every locations real quick.\n\nReally muddles up the different experiences, doesn't matter if you're fighting\n1) a chrome-covered Tyger Claw with blades for arms and legs,\n2) a bi-pedal roid-raging steroid tanker with enough muscles and cybernetic enhancements to make both you and young Kratos jealous and/or nervous or\n3) a group of angry-forgotten-war-veterans-turned-gang-members.\nAll of them want to reconstruct your face to something else, be it a salad, a bowl or a strainer. But all you can remember is hearing that one ad on an obnoxiously loud TV. For me, it's the MILF moaning. I wish I was joking.\n\nThe second biggest issue is the lack of weapon crafting/customization I mentioned before. To me it's rather inconvenient that your options are to either\nA) wish for the best on finding the weapon you want, hope that it has better or some stats as your old weapon, before you consider sacrificing it as a vessel to the greedy Mod Gods or\nB) Google a list of unique weapons, what they do, how to get 'em and maybe fiddle with their scopes and barrel attachments, IF the weapon allows it.\n\nThat said, if these are my major issues with the game, there's bound to be a bunch of good stuff here.\n\nThe game itself is still solid enough once you get the hang of it. Sure, my talent for triggering bugs is still with me with a total of 185 items in my Cyberpunk replay-folder pointing that out. If you seek to roleplay or doing things like challenges, I recommend leveling up as much as possible and as soon as possible. Specifically, in my opinion, you have to get 16 points on Body, Reflex, and Intelligence -attributes, 20 points on Technical and Gorilla Arms to boost your Body-checks. Being able to clear Body- and Technical-checks help out the most during your gameplay no matter how you play, Intelligence is needed for doing stuff like hacking terminals and Reflex- and Cool-stats are useful mostly just for perks. And even then the Cool -attribute is more of a dump stat out of the two. Namely because once you get used to Air Dashing in the Reflex-skilltree, it's gonna be hard to go back. Dumping Cool was unfortunate for me as it benefits sniping gameplay style the most. But whatever attribute points you have left after that, do as you please. Though take this \"advice\" with a grain of salt, I played on Very Hard on all three of my playthroughs.\n\nGame had a rough start when you think of the launch. But now after a bunch of people on my Discord server convinced/insisted on me trying it, 's aight. Just make sure you grab the Phantom Liberty DLC as well.",

The characters are insufferable and the writing is cliche ridden. The ham fisted attempts at trying to be deep, or topical, or comment on true social issues is mind numbing. The world, the writing, the characters, the philosophy all seem like they were ripped from the pages of a 14 year olds diary.\n\nI played Cyberpunk 2077 on a Legion Go S, and it performed better than I expected. I am not real a fan of cyberpunk as a genre; the aesthetic rarely appeals to me. The fetishization of Japanese culture, the machismo, and the overtly sexualized presentation of the world have always felt odd, and I am not entirely sure who this specific brand of sci-fi is meant to click with.\n\nThat said, the game’s dialogue is often intriguing. The main plot is a fairly straightforward mix of espionage and revenge, but thankfully it avoids drowning itself in unnecessary world-building or heavy-handed exposition. The narrative moves along cleanly, and the writing is stronger than I anticipated.\n\nCharacter progression is varied, and I can see the potential for many interesting builds. But, with only one meaningful respec opportunity, experimenting feels limited. While Incan see some builds that would definitely be worth trying, the overall experience doesn’t really justify a full second playthrough.\n\nThere are plenty of side missions and characters to interact with, but they ultimately feel hollow. This is a broader issue I have with open-world design: the main story is framed as urgent and consequential, yet the world asks you to take detours into activities that feel tonally disconnected like lecturing a police officer about mental health or joining a shooting competition without any narrative weight.\n\nI suppose I would recommend it. It’s a fair game. I don’t regret playing it, but I probably won’t feel compelled to return for another go ‘round.\n\nOverall: 6/10 “It’s Fine”",

It has a lot of side content, and there is definitely fun to be had, but it is more so in the Fallout 3 way of making your own fun. The cyberware feels half-baked, the perk system still feels like a first draft, melee feels basically unusable at higher difficulties, the writing is either pretty decent or just abysmal, a lot of the quest design is pretty boring and underdeveloped, the main quest ends right as it seems like it is about to get really interesting, and the city itself feels flat. It's got a lot of pretty buildings to look up at, but there is basically no meaningful verticality that the game plays with. At full price, I can not in good faith recommend the game. \n\nPhantom Liberty is a little better, I would probably rank it independently at around a 7/10 or maybe an 8/10, but that is mainly just because the writing and quest design is better and a lot tighter than the main game. The fundamental gameplay just does not feel good. Still pretty buggy, still a pretty bad \"roleplaying game\", and still a very superficial exploration of the themes of cyberpunk.",

I had to turn crowd density down because cars randomly crash into each other bottle necking the roads and people just zombie walk into each other for no reason. Then every time i summon my car it just falls out of the sky upside down. The graphics are decent but its undermined by outdated physics with bodies falling to the ground in weird yoga poses. Nothing in the city makes it feel alive. You can hardly interact with anything outside of the normal vendors and enemies standing in the street corners. And it feels even more dead when you see the same character models literally walking side by side. \n\nBut my main turn off was the atrocious melee game play. I made a pure melee build and I was left flabbergasted by the mechanics. Hits and swings seem to be absent of any feedback so its hard to tell when you're actually hitting something versus swinging in the air. But oddly enough, enemies swing their arms from 50 feet away and land every hit, even when they're not facing you.

Many guns are copy pasted, enemy health bars are bloated and the guns simply don't feel fun to shoot. The only class I really enjoyed was netrunner. The cars feel awful to drive despite incredible design, which is strange since as earlier, there are games with far better driving made 20 years ago, even in ones where driving isn't the main piece of the game. The male clothing is mind-bogglingly ugly with tight fitting suits that look like they cling 0.1mm above the skin.\r\n\r\nAll the mini-games are boring (hacking, racing, boxing). Crime isn't really a thing in this game outside of quests, you can't rob stores or do anything in the open world without an active quest, there's no random encounters or NPCs I find offering quests or intriguing moments in open world roaming. No NPC has anything of substance or meaningful to say unless you're in a quest.\r\n\r\nThe entire world feels like a placeholder to move from one quest to another and that's really unfortunate.

You can tell the developers just didn’t have enough time and were forced to ship something by a certain date.  Compared to The Witcher 3, this game feels jagged, unfinished, and buggy as hell.\r\n\r\nYou’ll be pressing F to interact with the world, and that’s about as deep as the “interaction” gets. There’s very little sense of presence or consequence. Characters have almost no depth in my opinion, and the choices you’re given throughout the game hardly matter in any meaningful way. The three paths you can take at the start of the game also change basically nothing... apart from your spawn location at the start of the game.\r\n\r\nThe open world? Huge, neon, and… empty. Looks incredible at a distance but there’s almost nothing going on inside it. Most dialogue branches lead nowhere, side content often ends abruptly, and everything eventually boils down to some kind of heist or infiltration mission anyway. The immersion is constantly broken by bugs — sometimes hilarious, but mostly frustrating. Every single area is separated by an elevator ride. I got so tired of stopping at elevators that I think I now hate elevators in real life.\r\n\r\n[spoiler]The game spends the entire runtime telling you that V is dying. It really tries hard to make you feel for him: coughing blood, collapsing, constant reminders. Instead of making me care, it just made me more ready for him to die already. And when the game ends… he doesn’t even die. The entire narrative theme just kind of collapses on itself. It’s a mess.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nThe Phantom Liberty DLC honestly feels like content that should’ve been part of the main story. It was more interesting than the main story anyway...\r\n\r\nVerdict:\r\nCyberpunk 2077 feels feels empty, the characters feel shallow, and the story promises depth it never delivers and the bugs and lack of polish made it hard to enjoy.\r\n\r\nIf you want to try it, only buy it on sale.\r\n€25-30 for the base game + DLC is fair.

I haven't experienced anything on the level of the T-Posing, game crashing, or random nudity that made headlines in the first months of this game's release but there's still an extreme lack of polish in many areas. The prime example is the driving. AI drivers will randomly stop in the middle of the street. Pedestrians will walk out in front of your car like a new hybrid of oblivious humans and suicidal deer. Any time you come to an intersection is a coin flip on whether you will pass through unharmed or be struck with a wanted level as you T Bone someone whose green light went straight to red as the game detected a player character approaching a stop light. Auto drive only compounds these issues as your car struggles to navigate the incredibly complex problem of a car being next to you when you need to make a left hand turn. I wish I could see my character's wanted level from the NCPD, as the amount of traffic violations and vehicular manslaughter that have been committed on the altar of trying to refill my drink while autopilot takes me on a two minute drive have turned me into the automotive equivalent of the night stalker. Truly this is a world where the forces of Big Sobriety have lost the war on drunk driving, as a DUI is far less dangerous than trusting your life to the hands of Tesla's Thalidomide baby. \n\nThe story is the game's shining achievement. In true Cyberpunk fashion it is a tragedy written on chrome leaf paper. V races against the clock as an experimental new chip is rewiring their brain. And this macguffin comes with a jaded rockstar/terrorist in the skin of Keanu Reaves, who delivers a compelling performance as Johnny Silverhand. As you progress along the path of the world's first voluntary lobotomy, the supporting cast become entangled in your plight and vice versa. Unfortunately, while the side characters can be quite compelling during their missions, everyone you meet that isn't directly related to the main story drop off after finishing their quests. In most games this is expected but in Cyberpunk all of the side characters' lives are dramatically influenced by V (for better and worse) with most of them coming just shy of declaring their love for V as the person who brought them from the edge of their individual despairs to the turning point of getting their lives back on track. But once the last mission of their side plot is complete, you won't hear from the characters organically until the end of the game. I would suggest saving some of these missions for later in the game for a more cohesive story that doesn't abandon the best parts of the story in the second act.\n\nWhile the characters are well written and a highlight of the story, the dialogue system leaves a lot to be desired. Anyone familiar with Bethesda games will recognize the dialogue tree, helpfully separated into blue options that add more detail and yellow options that will affect the conversation, but the style of dialogue system isn't the only genetics that the games share. Characters awkwardly walk to their stage positions before continuing conversations and speak with their hands/bodies in a way that would make disney animatronics embarrassed. Maybe it's a statement on the way cybernetics push humanity into a cold, robotic existence or maybe rigging is more complicated than the developers were given time for after multiple launch delays, who can say? But even if you can overlook the inorganic posing and positioning of characters in scripted dialogue scenes, it is much harder to ignore the game stuttering to load the next string of dialogue options once character's stop talking. You can almost hear the gears grinding like a 16 year old learning to drive stick as the characters sit in awkward silence until the game jolts awake and finally brings the dialogue menu back up so V can respond. The fact that so much of the gaming community were outraged by Fallout 4's dialogue wheel of \"yes, sarcastic yes, more details, and no\" but haven't mentioned Cyberpunk's wheel of \"yes, yes but pay me, yes but in the tone of V's background, and no\" is either the result of CD Projekt's otherwise well written story winning players over or the original release being such an unmitigated disaster that players have succumbed to the same logic as abuse victims rationalizing their partners constant gaslighting and emotional abuse by saying \"well at least they don't hit me anymore.\" On a second play through the mask falls even further as it becomes clear that many of the dialogue options elicit a response that is generated from the following formula: [Player's Chosen Dialogue]=[Brief Acknowledgment of Chosen Dialogue] + [Statement the NPC will say regardless of Choice of Dialogue]. This is especially apparent if you select a different background in a new play through as NPCs pay lip service to the idea of addressing your unique perspective before moving on to what they would have said should you have just selected the \"yes\" option. These issues combine to dialogue that feels as stiff and inhuman as a David Lynch film but without the shield of auteur sensibilities to hide behind.\n\nThe gameplay loop is simple but extremely satisfying. It has the same bones as Far Cry 3/4 and Fallout 3/4. Go to a place, have an unexpected and often slightly absurd new variable added to the problem, kill everyone in sight and loot their corpses. But it's the way the game allows you to end the lives of your fellow man that scratches the homicidal itch in my lizard brain that keeps me coming back. My first V was a quick hacker that only entered rooms after melting someone's cyberware and exploding a nearby radio from the safety of a CCTV feed. And while the game starts you with fairly innocuous quick hacks like \"reboot optics\" or \"overheat,\" eventually you unlock such war crimes as \"Cyberpsychosis\" or \"Suicide.\" My second V is a close range shotgun/katana wielder with a military grade Sandevistan and Optical Camouflage allowing me to shotgun a room full of scavs and reach the other side before their grey matter does without raising an alarm. And each build has enough unique weapons to guarantee a unique overpowered build is always available. In that way it succeeds in the way Far Cry 3/4 did; with the first half of the game being spent leveling up to be an unstoppable killing machine and the second half of the game just being an unstoppable killing machine. It adds an incredible layer of satisfaction in picking a dialogue option that equates to \"I will instantly kill you\" and being able to immediately back that threat up by turning the person V is threatening into a pink mist before they can utter the first syllable of their witty comeback. \n\nOverall, the game is difficult to recommend. There is an amazing game here buried inside a considerably clunkier one. It's death by a thousand cuts, starting out with the naive optimism that the bug or awkward dialogue was a one off issue or just an unlucky glitch most people won't experience. But eventually that gives way to the understanding that these are larger problems stemming from the shaky foundation that game was built on. The knowledge that however you customize your V, there won't be enough character there for NPCs to react to. An understanding that for a game about leaving your mark on Night City and dying a legend, that the legend was rigged from the start; and for as often as the game comments on V's growing notoriety and status as one of Night City's most infamous edgerunners, you will always be overshadowed by the exploits of your drugged out imaginary friend. \n\nMy dissonance is ludonarrative, and my immersion is ruined.",

      "review": "After 4 hours of gameplay I am left with a mostly negative impression. Not because of the atmosphere or writing, the game is fine. The problem is the uncomfortable movement on controller - mostly a personal thing though - and the combat. Maybe I'd still be playing if I could just enjoy the first person experience of the story, but even then I'm not sure. The atmosphere is good and I was impressed by is... sortof, it is also extremely hollow at the same time; you can look at the buildings and sky and think wow, so cool, but there is mostly nothing there apart from the face of it. If you want to enjoy the \"open world\" you'll have to be on a questline.\r\n\r\nNow I have been saving the cherry on top of my bad experience with this game:\r\nI just loaded up after two weeks of not being bothered to play it, walked from the building I just did some story stuff in, called my car, looked around a little but, started driving, litterally, JUST, started driving about 10 meters and then two gang cars or some crap just appear and start shooting me, i get cornered and my car is all busted up, I am playing on easy so I can tank all their stupid shots and take them out, but SO SHIT! like wtf, i just wanted to play the game but I'm getting harassed before I can even do anything. And like i metioned, I don't think the combat is that good, the aiming is janky and... just not fun.\r\n\r\nextremely dissapointed with this crap. hopefully I'll decide to give it another try... (probably not)",

      "review": "You remember the hype for this game, right? They announced it back when dinosaurs were still filling out job applications. By the time it actually came out, my toaster had more processing power than the original consoles it launched on. They promised a revolutionary future, a living breathing world, meaningful choices, next-gen immersion, advanced AI, deep role-playing… and what I got was a radioactive dumpster fire wrapped in LED lights and marketed as art.\n\nThis thing was delayed so many times I thought it needed a therapist, a life coach, and a priest. They built it up like it was gonna cure depression, fix the economy, and make your dad finally come back with the milk. Instead, it showed up stuttering, glitching, naked from the waist down, and asking for 60 dollars plus tax.\n\nYou boot up the game and the first thing it does is look at your console and go, “Good luck.” The frame rate drops so hard it looks like a PowerPoint presentation made by someone having a stroke. Characters are popping in and out of existence like ghosts on a day pass from the afterlife. Half the NPCs don’t have faces. The other half have the same face copy-pasted like some cursed clone army made by a drunk intern.\n\nYou walk down the street and it’s supposed to be this bustling futuristic city, but half the people are walking straight into walls like their brains are powered by expired batteries. Some of them are squatting in mid-air. Some are T-posing like they’re asserting dominance on the laws of physics. I saw a guy having a conversation with a vending machine and honestly, he was the sanest character in the entire game.\n\nThe police system? Oh my god. You steal a candy bar and suddenly a cop teleports right behind you like a perverted guardian angel. No chase, no logic, no warning, they just materialize out of nowhere like you summoned the Wizard of Law Enforcement. You could be on top of a building, floating in space, inside a locked bathroom stall, and the cops will still appear behind you like “Hello there, criminal.” What is this, Cyberpunk or a jumpscare simulator?\n\nDriving is a circus act. The cars handle like you’re trying to steer a drunk cow on an ice rink covered in butter. You tap the wheel and suddenly you’re spinning like a malfunctioning Beyblade straight into a hotdog stand, five pedestrians, and the last bit of hope you had left. The car physics make Mario Kart feel like a military driving simulator. This isn’t driving, it’s a scientific experiment in suffering.\n\nAnd the bugs. Cars falling from the sky. Characters clipping into walls. Guns flying out of your hands like they gained free will. NPCs standing on chairs, in chairs, becoming chairs. I saw a dude T-posing while sitting down, which shouldn’t even be possible unless the universe itself hit Alt+F4.\n\nThe dialogue plays from characters whose mouths aren’t moving. Voices are coming from behind you while the person is in front of you making unblinking eye contact like a cursed department store mannequin. Relationships trigger out of nowhere. Quests break. Missions lock themselves. The game doesn’t just have bugs, it has a thriving ecosystem, complete with a food chain and regional variants.\n\nThe launch was so bad that even Sony said, “No.” That’s like a dumpster telling you that you’re too gross to be thrown in it. This wasn’t a game launch. This was a digital crime scene. This thing should’ve shipped with police tape and a therapist.\n\nIt wasn’t “Press X to start,” it was “Press X to lower expectations.”\n\nAnd the marketing, oh the marketing. They sold it like a futuristic paradise. What we got was a broken funhouse run by malfunctioning robots on their last AAA batteries.\n\nBut then, after years of patches, updates, fixes, and probably some dark ritual performed under a full moon, the game actually became good. Now it runs well. Now the world feels alive. Now the characters hit harder. Now the story is solid. Now it’s actually what was promised.\n\nBut that doesn’t erase the fact that at launch this thing was about as useful as a screen door on a submarine.\n\nYou don’t get a medal for fixing the house after you already burned it down and charged people for the ashes.\n\nAt launch, Cyberpunk 2077 wasn’t an RPG. It wasn’t an action game. It wasn’t even software. It was a glitch museum that you paid to walk through.\n\nNow it’s a great game. Then it was a digital insult, a technological prank, a betrayal compressed into an executable file.\n\nCyberpunk 2077: from absolute disaster to genuine masterpiece, but it took years, and the emotional stability of half the gaming population, to get there.\n\nIt wasn’t just broken. It was bugged to hell, back to hell, then trapped in an infinite loading screen while your console cried for mercy.",
