      "review": "[b]Captain of Industry[/b] is an in-depth industrial, logistics and survival game that balances complex economic management, advanced production chains and demanding resource planning. Where many city-builders focus on stylish urban planning or leisurely economic loops, this game places you in the role of an engineer-captain on a remote island, starting with a handful of survivors and a rusty naval factory. From there, you must build a self-sustaining industrial society from the ground up.\r\n\r\nThe game stand out by being a production and logistics game first , and a construction game second. The game offers one of the most detailed resource cycles in the genre. Earth is moved in huge quantities with trucks and dumpers, mines gradually sink, the terrain deforms dynamically, and you have to plan your excavation areas to avoid triggering disasters. In addition to classic raw materials such as iron, coal and oil, you will later gain access to refined chemicals, electronics, environmental components and even advanced fuels such as hydrogen.\r\n\r\nEverything is integrated into logical, realistic production chains, where errors in one place can destabilize your entire economy. A dry tank of diesel or lack of cooling water can go from a minor problem to a complete production stop in a matter of minutes.\r\n\r\nTransportation is a core component. Trucks move almost everything in the beginning, and their routes, fuel, and numbers are critical factors. Later, you can build huge belt networks , pipelines, and conveyor-based superfactories, but planning requires thought—especially when the terrain changes or you've dug up half the island.\r\n\r\nThe progression is heavily technology-driven. You start with simple mechanics and fuel production and end up, after many hours of play, with full automation, nuclear power, advanced chemical processes and global transport via container ships.\r\n\r\n[b]Captain of Industry[/b] has a steep learning curve. The UI and tutorials help you along the way, but the complexity of production and logistics requires long-term planning, frequent restructuring, patience and desire to optimize. On the other hand, the reward becomes all the greater when you manage to transform a raw, unproductive island into a hyper-optimized industrial complex that feeds thousands of residents.\r\n\r\nThe graphics are functional, clear and uncluttered. It's not a visually flashy game like [i]Cities: Skylines[/i], but everything is easy to read, vehicles have good animations, and industrial complexes look impressive when running at full power. The sound effects support the industrial atmosphere well without becoming noisy.\r\n\r\n[b]Captain of Industry[/b] excels as a deep, complex, and technically demanding industrial simulation that rewards players who love to delve into detail and build gigantic, interconnected production systems. It's one of the most ambitious and satisfying games in its niche - both because it challenges your planning skills and because it offers a rare feeling of building an entire industrialized civilization from scratch. A must for engineering game enthusiasts and logistics geeks.\r\n\r\n[h1]9/10[/h1]\r\nDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | [b][u]AMAZING [/u][/b]| MASTERPIECE\r\n[quote]\r\nReviewed on: Win11 Home 64-bit, Intel i5-11600K, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB PRIME, 32GB DDR4-3600 RAM, 2 x Kingston NV1 1TB M.2 NVMe SSD, Internet Broadband 1000/1000 Mbit[/quote]\r\n[quote]\r\nIf you like this review, then please consider giving it a thumbs up.

      "review": "An automation game that belongs right up there with the genre giants like Factorio and Satisfactory - and in a few ways even rises above them. Don't be fooled by Early Access and version numbers (0.7.X); this already feels like an almost finished game, what comes to amount of content and polish. I haven't yet reached the endgame, but I've yet to experience a single crash, performance issues or a significant bug. \n\nThe terraforming system and mining mechanics create an entire new layer of challenges, as does the addition of citizens/workforce and their numerous needs. The tech tree is absurdly huge; I fell in love with the game the moment I realized its scope. The amount of various resources, goods and byproducts is likewise gargantuan, and many of those come with multiple alternative recipes (6 different ways to produce diesel!). There's a layer of realism in the production chains that feels just right, and makes other similar games look simple in comparison. Farming (crop rotation!), weather, trucks, ships, trains, pollution, health, recycling, trading, unity system... the amount of content and details is astounding. And this is before the whole endgame and its rockets and space stations and asteroid mining, which I haven't even glimpsed yet! \n\nCurrently the most glaring things still missing are tunnels and actual bridges, but the bridges are promised already in the next major update. The world map with its island exploration and very simple naval combat feels to me a bit out of place, but I assume it will be refined in the future. A more advanced logics system probably also is still to come. Also, in an automation game this complex and deep, you'd expect to have to build an actual power grid with transformers, power lines and substations etc. (now all buildings and power generators on the map are always connected) - then again, I'm not sure if I really miss all that, with so much other stuff to think about.",

      "review": "Definitely not a game for everyone.\nCaptain of Industry feels like the best parts of several games rolled into one. It’s got that SimCity-style planning, Factorio-like base building, and the constant juggling act of managing a thousand moving parts — only to realize you missed one belt or didn’t leave enough room for future upgrades, and suddenly you’re redesigning half your island.\n\nLoad up an old save and you’ll probably stare at it wondering, “What the hell was I even doing here?” But for those who enjoy that kind of deep, complex satisfaction — like me — this game delivers hundreds of hours of fun.\n\nWith over 350 hours in the game myself, I can confidently give it a 10/10. It just keeps getting better with every update. I’ll keep coming back for a month or two every year as long as they continue improving and adding new content.\n\nCan’t wait for the eventual Version 1.0!",

      "review": "[b]Captain of Industry[/b] is an in-depth industrial, logistics and survival game that balances complex economic management, advanced production chains and demanding resource planning. Where many city-builders focus on stylish urban planning or leisurely economic loops, this game places you in the role of an engineer-captain on a remote island, starting with a handful of survivors and a rusty naval factory. From there, you must build a self-sustaining industrial society from the ground up.\r\n\r\nThe game stand out by being a production and logistics game first , and a construction game second. The game offers one of the most detailed resource cycles in the genre. Earth is moved in huge quantities with trucks and dumpers, mines gradually sink, the terrain deforms dynamically, and you have to plan your excavation areas to avoid triggering disasters. In addition to classic raw materials such as iron, coal and oil, you will later gain access to refined chemicals, electronics, environmental components and even advanced fuels such as hydrogen.\r\n\r\nEverything is integrated into logical, realistic production chains, where errors in one place can destabilize your entire economy. A dry tank of diesel or lack of cooling water can go from a minor problem to a complete production stop in a matter of minutes.\r\n\r\nTransportation is a core component. Trucks move almost everything in the beginning, and their routes, fuel, and numbers are critical factors. Later, you can build huge belt networks , pipelines, and conveyor-based superfactories, but planning requires thought—especially when the terrain changes or you've dug up half the island.\r\n\r\nThe progression is heavily technology-driven. You start with simple mechanics and fuel production and end up, after many hours of play, with full automation, nuclear power, advanced chemical processes and global transport via container ships.\r\n\r\n[b]Captain of Industry[/b] has a steep learning curve. The UI and tutorials help you along the way, but the complexity of production and logistics requires long-term planning, frequent restructuring, patience and desire to optimize. On the other hand, the reward becomes all the greater when you manage to transform a raw, unproductive island into a hyper-optimized industrial complex that feeds thousands of residents.\r\n\r\nThe graphics are functional, clear and uncluttered. It's not a visually flashy game like [i]Cities: Skylines[/i], but everything is easy to read, vehicles have good animations, and industrial complexes look impressive when running at full power. The sound effects support the industrial atmosphere well without becoming noisy.\r\n\r\n[b]Captain of Industry[/b] excels as a deep, complex, and technically demanding industrial simulation that rewards players who love to delve into detail and build gigantic, interconnected production systems. It's one of the most ambitious and satisfying games in its niche - both because it challenges your planning skills and because it offers a rare feeling of building an entire industrialized civilization from scratch. A must for engineering game enthusiasts and logistics geeks.\r\n\r\n[h1]9/10[/h1]\r\nDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | [b][u]AMAZING [/u][/b]| MASTERPIECE\r\n[quote]\r\nReviewed on: Win11 Home 64-bit, Intel i5-11600K, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16GB PRIME, 32GB DDR4-3600 RAM, 2 x Kingston NV1 1TB M.2 NVMe SSD, Internet Broadband 1000/1000 Mbit[/quote]\r\n[quote]\r\nIf you like this review, then please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Unlike most games where you have to smash things out to advance, that strategy will destroy you here. Having said that you need to constantly think ahead before you run out of something. I put 30 hours in with the rush strategy and kept dying and thought I give up. I couldn't stop thinking about the game and what I was doing wrong (nothing I thought). Then I saw one comment somewhere that said you must adhere to production rates. I know to some that is so obvious, but I had no comprehension of the sophistication of the supply lines and production in this game. Once I got that into my thick head along with the go slow and upgrade before moving on, I have thrived. This is the best game I have ever played.",

This was learning as I went, never starting over, and surviving a few death-spirals... then finally completing everything in the tech-tree.\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't tell you the value of this game I don't know what will... because, though it's still in EA, you get a LOT for your money, especially if you like complicated automation games... and this one gets pretty dang complicated, indeed.  Let me break it down a bit:\r\n\r\n- Top-notch automation - with really fun belting and pipe networking. Sphaghetti happens.\r\n- A world map that you can explore, to uncover new settlements and resources.\r\n- A HUGE tech tree that is a joy to unlock, using research labs.\r\n- Trains - versatile track layout and train-car management.\r\n- Ships - One versatile ship (or more) you use to explore , but can buff up with guns/armor to fight pirates.\r\n- Cargo ships you use to trade with other settlements.\r\n- Base-building and city management (provide power, water, sanitation, food, recycling, etc).\r\n- Population management (people unity, workers health, etc.)\r\n- Farming, with a variety of things to grow for many different purposes, besides just food.\r\n- Forestry - Clearing trees, wood processing and later, creating tree farms.\r\n- Complex production chains of ore refining, oil cracking, wafer and chip manufacturing, the list goes on.\r\n- Space station construction and asteroid wrangling for more resources (towards the end game).\r\n\r\nPerhaps the biggest difference between this and other automation games is the incredible terraforming mechanic... it's a MASSIVE part of the game... you will have to clear land, both for resources, but also for more space to build as your factory grows.  Mining and dumping are essential.\r\n\r\nI found no glitches or errors -- the game is very polished.  I felt that the sound and graphics were great. The music really stands out - its some of my favorite in all the different automation games I've played so far, TBH.  \r\n\r\nMy complaints about the game center around things that will probably be updated, as this is still early access.  The QOL for editing is pretty good... but I wish there was at least one level of UNDO.  I feel that terraforming needs a robust tutorial section, since it's such a core part of the game.  The help section is likewise incomplete... as of this review there's no help for rocketry at all! Luckily, there exists a few online sources, such as the WIKI for Captain of Industry - which are pretty good.  \r\n\r\nFINAL WORD:  I feel that this is an ESSENTIAL game for fans of automation games.  It does, after a while, become very complex... which I love in a game like this, but some might get overwhelmed.  As others have mentioned, if you've enjoyed Factorio, Satisfactory, Dyson Space Program, or any or the other base-builder automation games out there, then you'll almost certainly like this one... maybe even get a bit addicted like I did! :-)",

      "review": "An automation game that belongs right up there with the genre giants like Factorio and Satisfactory - and in a few ways even rises above them. Don't be fooled by Early Access and version numbers (0.7.X); this already feels like an almost finished game, what comes to amount of content and polish. I haven't yet reached the endgame, but I've yet to experience a single crash, performance issues or a significant bug. \n\nThe terraforming system and mining mechanics create an entire new layer of challenges, as does the addition of citizens/workforce and their numerous needs. The tech tree is absurdly huge; I fell in love with the game the moment I realized its scope. The amount of various resources, goods and byproducts is likewise gargantuan, and many of those come with multiple alternative recipes (6 different ways to produce diesel!). There's a layer of realism in the production chains that feels just right, and makes other similar games look simple in comparison. Farming (crop rotation!), weather, trucks, ships, trains, pollution, health, recycling, trading, unity system... the amount of content and details is astounding. And this is before the whole endgame and its rockets and space stations and asteroid mining, which I haven't even glimpsed yet! \n\nCurrently the most glaring things still missing are tunnels and actual bridges, but the bridges are promised already in the next major update. The world map with its island exploration and very simple naval combat feels to me a bit out of place, but I assume it will be refined in the future. A more advanced logics system probably also is still to come. Also, in an automation game this complex and deep, you'd expect to have to build an actual power grid with transformers, power lines and substations etc. (now all buildings and power generators on the map are always connected) - then again, I'm not sure if I really miss all that, with so much other stuff to think about.",
