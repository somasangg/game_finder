Game companies from games like War Thunder, KCD II, Terraria and idfk what else dont put their personal opinions in their games, i cant imagine how much would lgbt community cry if terraria became all \"anti-lgbt\" like game and had load screen tips with texts like \"being trans is just mental illness\". So yeah, I dont like this part of the game. And yeah, you can cry about me not liking it being my problem.\n\nThis being the only popular game on steam (that i am aware of, not counting vr chat) that is overly lgbt+ pro supportive, and at the same time not knowing any game that is anti lgbt+ (popular or not), shows who is the \"special\" one, and who needs \"attention\"... I get that at least part of the team is from lgbt community, but shiiit, did you know that you could keep it to yourself?\n\nI wouldnt have to spend time writing this shit, if you wouldnt have trauma from childhood, bcs i cant imagine family liking a child that is actively wearing furry suit 😭 There goes my personal opinion, u dont like mine? Well deal with it, bcs u put your personal opinions in a open world multiplayer game, nobody can really hate me on this, or u can, but it wont have any value unless u would remove it from the game, which u wont xd",

      "review": "Space Station 14 is... a complicated thing to explain. So was Space Station 13.\n\nBasically, it's a top-down 2d tile-based multiplayer action RP game about spessmen on a station. Numbered above a dozen, evidently.\n\nIt was created by Exadv1 over 20 years ago on the BYOND 2D sandbox engine, which was a real piece of work. He started it as an atmospherics simulator. He stopped updating this gamemode and seemingly disappeared, when some folks from Something Awful decompiled the codebase and forked it. And then it got forked again. And again. And again. New features were added. Some were deprecated. The forks are still around out there somewhere, but BYOND still lurks in the shadows. \n\nSo some folks decided to make this port to a BYOND-free sector. This is one of several remake projects ongoing.\n\nThe game revolves around several subjective definitions of roleplaying in a multiplayer class RP server. One involves bananas. One involves robusting. One involves being a secret agent guy. One may even involve a stamp. You'll figure out the rules as you go.\n\nIf you like a neat game about breaky, flaky systems to tinker with, this is a good one. If you like games with emergent RP gameplay amplified by breaky, flaky systems, you're in for a treat. And if you like to run around as a clown or mime, you are a sick bastard, but would probably find an opportunity. \n\nA great introduction to this game and its community and history would be through the illustrious Quartermaster, Randolph P. Checkers. No further detail shall be given, I've said enough already.\n\nRemember: your ration chits will only last while supplies last, or until Nanotrasen expires them, or until the AI acts up and starts the machines off firing Hershey's bars at customers, whichever comes first.\n\nWelcome aboard the station. Nanotrasen expects great things from you, and you are down on your metrics this quarter, you little jerk.",

It's easy to find your own fun each shift when interacting with the universe and all the characters you'll meet! And the community has been relatively great-- better than most I've seen. :)\r\n\r\nAs for my reservations, there is a very sharp learning curve due to the complexity of this game, which you'll need help from experienced players to surmount. There's also that One really helpful guy on Youtube, Liltenhead. If you need help, make sure to ask your peers or a mentor!\r\n\r\nThe gameplay loop can also be genuinely addicting if you don't have your executive functioning skills on lock. This has been a genuine issue for many players, including myself. Shifts last from ~30 minutes up to [i]several hours[/i]. You are allowed to leave early, though many players don't. Make sure to log off when you need to. The people I've played with have been very considerate about this!\r\n\r\n- A (mostly) STARLIGHT Player",

There's definitely a learning curve, but between picking low stakes roles like janitor, and watching youtube tutorials by liltenhead, it's not so bad. The real appeal of the game is that you're playing with dozens of other people, most of whom you're allied with, so there's a real sense of accomplishment every time you help out another player. Even if it's just picking up a synthesizer and helping the musician play with a more fully formed band, but it can go as far as being a doctor and healing folks after injuries, backing up your salvage teammates while exploring off-station planets for resources and artifacts, or even being a bunch of bad guys working together to take down the command staff.\r\n\r\nIt's also open source, so there are a few different forks that change the gameplay experience. Some add new species, some add new mechanics, some just plain offer much higher player count per server.\r\n\r\nThere's so much more to say about this game, and it's only getting better as development continues on.\r\n\r\nIt's also a delightfully queer friendly game, like there's literally vending machines with a whole bunch of different pride pins to wear if anyone chooses to do so (like me).",

Game companies from games like War Thunder, KCD II, Terraria and idfk what else dont put their personal opinions in their games, i cant imagine how much would lgbt community cry if terraria became all \"anti-lgbt\" like game and had load screen tips with texts like \"being trans is just mental illness\". So yeah, I dont like this part of the game. And yeah, you can cry about me not liking it being my problem.\n\nThis being the only popular game on steam (that i am aware of, not counting vr chat) that is overly lgbt+ pro supportive, and at the same time not knowing any game that is anti lgbt+ (popular or not), shows who is the \"special\" one, and who needs \"attention\"... I get that at least part of the team is from lgbt community, but shiiit, did you know that you could keep it to yourself?\n\nI wouldnt have to spend time writing this shit, if you wouldnt have trauma from childhood, bcs i cant imagine family liking a child that is actively wearing furry suit 😭 There goes my personal opinion, u dont like mine? Well deal with it, bcs u put your personal opinions in a open world multiplayer game, nobody can really hate me on this, or u can, but it wont have any value unless u would remove it from the game, which u wont xd",

      "review": "Space Station 14 is... a complicated thing to explain. So was Space Station 13.\n\nBasically, it's a top-down 2d tile-based multiplayer action RP game about spessmen on a station. Numbered above a dozen, evidently.\n\nIt was created by Exadv1 over 20 years ago on the BYOND 2D sandbox engine, which was a real piece of work. He started it as an atmospherics simulator. He stopped updating this gamemode and seemingly disappeared, when some folks from Something Awful decompiled the codebase and forked it. And then it got forked again. And again. And again. New features were added. Some were deprecated. The forks are still around out there somewhere, but BYOND still lurks in the shadows. \n\nSo some folks decided to make this port to a BYOND-free sector. This is one of several remake projects ongoing.\n\nThe game revolves around several subjective definitions of roleplaying in a multiplayer class RP server. One involves bananas. One involves robusting. One involves being a secret agent guy. One may even involve a stamp. You'll figure out the rules as you go.\n\nIf you like a neat game about breaky, flaky systems to tinker with, this is a good one. If you like games with emergent RP gameplay amplified by breaky, flaky systems, you're in for a treat. And if you like to run around as a clown or mime, you are a sick bastard, but would probably find an opportunity. \n\nA great introduction to this game and its community and history would be through the illustrious Quartermaster, Randolph P. Checkers. No further detail shall be given, I've said enough already.\n\nRemember: your ration chits will only last while supplies last, or until Nanotrasen expires them, or until the AI acts up and starts the machines off firing Hershey's bars at customers, whichever comes first.\n\nWelcome aboard the station. Nanotrasen expects great things from you, and you are down on your metrics this quarter, you little jerk.",
