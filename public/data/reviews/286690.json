      "review": "Metro is a series I first heard about back when Metro Exodus was blowing up. At the time, I didn’t even plan to touch the earlier games — I just wanted to play Exodus and be done with it. But when they gave away the first game for free, I figured, “Alright, why not?” …and then postponed it for ages anyway.\n\nWhen I finally launched it, I had no idea what was going on at first — why we’re in the Metro, how we ended up there, what the hell happened. But as the story goes on, everything gets explained so naturally and so well that it just pulls you in. The atmosphere is amazing: dark, creepy, heavy. You really feel what the main character feels, and it stops being “just another shooter” — it genuinely feels like you are stuck in this world crawling with mutants ready to tear you or your friends apart. And the moments when Artyom is left completely alone, and you have to deal with everything by yourself… those gave me goosebumps.\n\nThe graphics also blew me away — for a game from that year, it looks insanely good. I honestly have nothing to complain about.\n\nAnd the world itself feels alive. Wherever you go, you can tell that people are actually living there. Someone’s doing something, someone’s talking, someone’s sleeping; you can knock on a random door and someone will respond — and if you keep knocking, the responses change. NPCs actually react when you approach them instead of staring blankly like in most games. It’s just… really well done.\n\nThe weapon system is also great: upgrades, swapping gear, selling and buying ammo — everything feels thoughtful. You decide what to keep, what to sell, what to upgrade, and what to spend your hard-earned bullets on.\n\nOverall — I absolutely recommend this game, and honestly the whole Metro series.\nMetro 2033 gets a solid 9/10 from me.",

It was a slow, philosophical, and truly terrifying journey of one young man wrestling with the existential dread and politics of the Moscow Metro.\n\nThe game is about that guy's twin brother, Rambo Artyom, who apparently spends his days fighting an entire communist army with a rusty Kalash and a pocket full of industrial-strength murder-farts.\n\nThe game is a brilliant, tense, and polished action adaptation of a philosophical horror novel. Redux smooths out the jank from the original, making it the definitive way to play. Just remember that every mutant you shoot is a philosophical point you missed in the book.",

My impressions are genuinely positive. I love this series, and it makes me happy that aside from [i]S.T.A.L.K.E.R.[/i], we have another well-known franchise from our region. It’s just a shame that, considering today’s realities in Ukraine, the context of the series no longer feels as relevant. Though to be fair, it still offers a strong and well-built post-apocalyptic universe.\n\nThe game holds up surprisingly well even today. It hasn’t aged much in terms of atmosphere or storytelling - the only things that feel outdated are the facial animations and some of the character and monster models.\n\nWhat disappointed me the most, however, was the honestly careless Ukrainian localization. It’s upsetting that it wasn’t treated as a primary language option - and even worse, that the quality is so poor. [i]I’m still grateful it exists at all[/i], but it’s difficult to listen to, and the translation is full of mistakes. I mostly play games in English, but with the [i]Metro[/i] series, playing in English feels strange, and russian is obviously not an option. It's simply unacceptable.\n\nAlso - and this surprised me - [i]Redux[/i] came out in 2014, so it’s not exactly a new release, but my PC was heating up as if I had launched the latest Battlefield on ultra settings. Very odd.\n\nAnyway, it’s a great game - I absolutely recommend it. I don’t know if 4A still fully owns the rights to the franchise, but if they do, it’s always worth supporting our developers.",

From the very beginning, the game establishes an oppressive, immersive atmosphere that pulls you into its bleak yet captivating world.\n\nThe game delivers tense, story-driven FPS gameplay. Stealth, resource management, and careful exploration are essential, as ammunition and supplies are scarce. Every encounter feels weighty and dangerous, forcing you to think before you act. Whether you’re sneaking past human factions or fighting off mutated horrors, the tension never fades.\n\nNarrative and world-building are standout features. Through atmospheric environments, somber characters, and gripping storytelling, Metro 2033 creates a sense of desperation and hope in equal measure. Audio logs, conversations, and environmental details gradually reveal a world still clinging to life despite overwhelming odds.\n\nRedux enhancements bring improved visuals, smoother performance, and polished mechanics. Lighting and textures are sharper, controls are more responsive, and the overall experience feels more refined while staying true to the original’s tone and emotional impact.\n\n[h3]Final Verdict:[/h3]\nMetro 2033 Redux is a gripping and atmospheric survival shooter that combines intense gameplay with exceptional storytelling. Whether you're revisiting the tunnels or experiencing them for the first time, it remains a must-play for fans of post-apocalyptic adventures.\n\n“A haunting, immersive journey through the shadows of a world struggling to survive.”\n\nOverall Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 10/10",

It blends the bleak reality of a world with no future, and the flickering remnants of human hope, spirituality, and survival instinct in a way few other games in the genre have. Gameplay wise it is showing it’s age; you feel clunky to control, some guns handle awkwardly, and the stealth mechanics are at best serviceable. However as a survival horror style FPS the awkward controls often serve to play into the games intent for disempowerment. If you can lean into its older design ethos, and appreciate the world it is trying to present I deeply recommend trying it at least once.",

      "review": "Metro 2033 Redux is the enhanced and significantly improved version of the original 2010 post-apocalyptic FPS, later rebuilt and released by DeepSilver in 2014. The game is based on Dmitry Glukhovsky’s novel of the same name and is widely considered a faithful adaptation.\n\nRedux features noticeably better graphics, detailed textures, dynamic lighting, and stronger atmospheric effects. The underground tunnels feel more claustrophobic, and the surface areas look even more desolate. Some cutscenes were changed, and while the visuals are praised, many players have criticized the reduced difficulty—especially in Survival mode, where resources are more abundant.\n\nThe story takes place in 2033, after a nuclear war in 2013 forced Moscow’s survivors into the metro tunnels. You play as Artyom, a young man trying to reach the central Polis station to seek help from the Rangers as his home station is threatened by mysterious creatures called the Dark Ones.\n\nThe game blends FPS action with strong survival elements. Military-grade bullets serve as currency, used to buy weapons, gear, filters, and supplies. Resource scarcity depends on the chosen mode: Survival makes scavenging tougher, while Spartan offers a more action-oriented experience.\n\nAcross its 10–13-hour campaign, the game offers a varied arsenal, though aiming can feel slow and many weapons are old-fashioned, with some requiring manual pumping. The atmosphere is exceptional—rain blurs your mask, insects crawl across it, fog thickens the air, and you often have to wipe away blood or grime mid-fight. The soundtrack enhances the cinematic feel with high-quality, immersive audio.\n\nMetro 2033 Redux combines the mood of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and Fallout, offering enclosed yet richly explorable environments, two modes, and two endings. With its detailed world and storytelling, it’s a highly recommended title that deserves a place in any game library.",

      "review": "SO good. I wouldn't say its the best in the trilogy (given exodus exists) but it deserves so much love. the story is linear and straight forward, but thats not necessarily a bad thing, nearing the end you can make a number of choices that impact the ending you get.\n\nThe gunplay feels heavy, responsive and bulky, the guns are very cool and have a surprising amount of mechanics, which I feel was a massive win on the game's part. The game is set on an apocalyptic world, conventional weapons run dry, and people have to get creative to protect themselves and others, but also, people have to create different types of weapons, all for different purposes\n\nFor example, you have pneumatic weapons that operate on a \"pressure\" system that only take a certain type of ammo, assault rifles that take normal ammo and military grade, SO MANY SHOTGUN OPTIONS\n\nBy far my favorite part of the game are the shotguns; revolver shotguns, double barrel shotguns, quad barrel shotguns, pump shotguns, regular shotguns, pressure shotguns, buckshot shotguns, and even more\n\nBut what makes the game so good is not the gunplay or its choice making, but its atmosphere\nGOD this game is beautiful and you definitely wouldnt expect this from a 2013 game, the world building is amazing, the world itself feels hostile and unwelcoming, the monsters appear from seemingly nowhere which builds this tension that makes you feel like you could die at any moment if you're not careful\n\nDespite the context of the game and the setting, the game's atmosphere doesn't feel dead by any means, infact I'd say it feels more \"alive\" than alot of other games you can compare it to.\nBut the reason why it feels \"alive\" isnt because it because it makes you feel safe or at peace, but rather because its actively trying to kill you, adding another layer of depth which revolves around insecurity and the ambient's hostility towards you\n\nTL;DR, this game is GREAT and YOU should PLAY IT but only when its on sale because its pretty expensive (I got it on sale and they go for like 80% off, its a steal)\n\n10/10",

      "review": "I'd like to start this with METRO 2033 HAS A LOT OF PROBLEMS. However, to be frank, it is easily one of the best post apocalyptic games I've ever played. One of the few games I've ever played that is actually worth playing on its hardest difficulty, Ranger Hardcore. Gameplay is floaty and weird, using throwing knives sucks even tho they are good, stealth is medicore at best, story can be awkward sometimes with what I assume is just the english dub being just ok. The reason you play this game though is its NEAR PERFECT world design. Few apocalypse games really make the outside world feel completely hostile. This is a game where you are not \"taking\" anything back, you are not going to fix the world. On the surface, you are swarmed by enemies, ammo management, air management, trying to find MGR (military grade round), etc. Even though it's dangerous the game heavily rewards you for exploring and I really appreciate that. The best way to play this game is gamma bar almost completely to the left and getting the NVG's as soon as possible. The scope of this games story is fantastic, if you did more as the main character it would be too much. The terrible morality system of Metro games does not affect this title as much because the cannon ending is the \"bad\" ending so you don't have to fight with the games horrible \"choice\" system. The gun economy is also near perfect, mostly there is a distinct difference between weapons. Peak loadout (for Ranger Hardcore) is the Shambler (worth buying asap) and keeping bourbons AK but if you want supreme accuracy and a silencer than VSV is best. Stealth (even though its jank) is the best way to experience human encounters. Shambler is peak weapon design and is significantly better than any other shotgun. Its hard to explain but there is a grimy, grounded uhhhh realistic-ness to Metro? It is unapologetic about what it is and you rarely feel like you are \"winning\". The spooky atmosphere with ghosts and other-worldly beings make you feel so small in this dying world. If you even kind of like apocalypse games Metro 2033 is a must play. \n\n8/10\n\nRemember, if it's hostile- you kill it.",

      "review": "Metro 2033 Redux is a remake of the first game in the Metro series, based on the worldwide bestseller novel by Dmitry Glukhovsky. The story of Metro games is set in a post-apocalyptic future in (or rather, beneath) the Russian capitol of Moscow. A once proud city inhabited by 15 million people has been reduced to ash and rubble in a nuclear war, along with the rest of the civilized world. Those lucky few who survived the devastation have been forced to continue their lives underground, since the irradiated surface was no longer inhabitable. In the tunnels of Moscow underground railway network, often called the Metro, stand the last remnants of human civilization, quite possibly in the entire world.\r\nYou are Artyom, a young man who was born in the Metro and has lived his entire life without ever seeing the sky. In fact, you've never ventured much beyond your home station Expedition for the fear of mutants, radiation, unexplained anomalies and million other things that could be fatal in these tunnels. Your life in the Metro is about to change drastically when a certain member of the Spartans, an elite squad of Metro militia, arrives at the Expedition station one day.\r\nWhen you start playing Metro 2033 Redux, you'll be asked to choose between two campaign modes: the Survival mode or the more-action oriented Spartan mode. I've tried both modes and I can say that they are both good in their own way. In general terms, Metro 2033 is a horror-shooter with survival elements and a strong atmosphere. The campaign includes a series of chapters with mostly linear, but well-rounded and enjoyable gameplay. The storyline is solid as well, I'd say well above average for a FPS game. The only thing about gameplay that I dislike is the inability to backtrack within a chapter - once you get past a certain point, you cannot go back. When you take into account that autosave is the only way to save the game, you'll be sure to miss out on some of the content.\r\nIn terms of presentation, this Redux remake looks like a modern game, with advanced physics, better lighting and weather effects and, most importantly, more detailed textures. The only real giveaway that you're playing a 15-year-old game is the NPC facial features design - your comrades' faces look outdated and a bit disfigured. The background music and sound effects fit the game atmosphere really well, strengthening the feeling of isolation in a nuclear wasteland. Though I did run into an annoying audio bug — when you’re in a station surrounded by crowds of people, everyone tends to talk at once, creating a chaotic jumble of sound that’s almost impossible to understand. I've encountered several other bugs as well, even a game-breaking one that has forced me to restart the chapter. Even so, I had a great time playing through the game.\r\n\r\nI was very pleasantly surprised by Metro 2033 Redux. I went in with low expectations, but after finishing it, I can confidently say it’s among the best single-player FPS games I’ve ever played.\r\n\r\nScore (out of 10):\r\n[h1][b]8.5[/b][/h1]",

Я вообще люблю постапокалипсис, но тут всё сделано настолько круто, что просто забываешь, что это всего лишь игра.\r\n\r\nПредставь: ты в московском метро, наверху — радиация и мутанты, а внизу люди пытаются выжить. Темнота, скрипы, какие‑то шорохи — аж мурашки по коже. Постоянно чувствуешь, что за тобой кто‑то следит.\r\n\r\nГеймплей простой, но в этом и фишка. Патроны на вес золота — нельзя просто бежать и палить во всё подряд. Надо думать, прятаться, иногда прокрадываться мимо врагов. А ещё эти фильтры для противогаза… Забыл поменять — и всё, конец.\r\n\r\nСюжет затягивает. Главный герой Артём — обычный парень, который пытается спасти свой дом. По ходу игры встречаешь разных людей, у каждого своя история. Иногда прям жалко их, понимаешь, как тяжело им живётся.\r\n\r\nГрафика, конечно, уже не топ (игра‑то старая), но атмосфера перекрывает все недостатки. Звук — просто огонь: шаги, дыхание в противогазе, далёкие крики — всё это создаёт такое ощущение, будто ты реально там, в метро.\r\n\r\nВ общем, если любишь мрачные истории и напряжение — очень советую.

The earth being a desolate landscape is not a new setting in games, but this one truly sells the sheer cost of existence. Every breath, every bullet, and every clumsy step, even above ground, is weighted with panic.\n\nThe metro is very linear, but the moment you set foot on the surface, all of that just fucks off the second your foot crunches some glass, dragging a pack of hideous Nosalises straight to your location. That panic is intense. Yes, there is a Point A to Point B, but when my heartrate spikes? I will wind up running into a wall, or stopping at a deadend, and I will die.\n\nI grew up playing more arcade-y shooters like Call of Duty, and Battlefield. I constantly had to fight the urge to run in and light a room up, but Metro 2033 Redux quickly taught me that recklessness means you just burned a clip of precious, irreplaceable military-grade ammunition. And that, absolutely fucking sucks.\n\nChoosing Survival Ranger difficulty was absolutely the move, even if it turned my whole trip into an unforgiving lesson in getting my ass beat. I don't play games like these, so it was very new to me. Every encounter feels high-stakes. I try to be stealthy, taking out lights and dropping guys with a throwing knife. The thing is, I'm terrible at stealth, and one tiny screw-up, like sprinting when I'm not supposed to, or a misjudged timing to cross a path, then suddenly I'm in a firefight for my life, burning resources like an idiot. The real tension isn't the monsters; it's the genuine, sickening realization that a single fuck-up just cost me my last magazine for my automatic weapon, or half my medkits. So then I just have to live with the consequences of my now depleted resources.\n\nThe game's central mission to warn Polis about the Dark Ones honestly felt secondary to the sheer immersion of the environment. The main plot is simple, and that’s fine, but the real meat is in the world itself: the sad pig farms, the bustling but desperate markets, the desperate chatter of the survivors. The world-building is so captivating that the Dark One plot winds up on the backburner up until the very end. However, the human drama, and the moment-to-moment scavenging provide a much richer, more complex narrative experience.\n\nEven after achieving the ending where the missile strike goes ahead, the ambiguity and eventual sympathy for the Dark Ones lingered. To me, it speaks to the game's atmosphere that the human struggles provide a much richer, more complex narrative experience than the main threat.\n\nMetro 2033 Redux is dark, and it's challenging. Every mistake makes me feel like shit, and I yelped at far too many jumpscares than I should have. All things considered, it was pretty fun. Now on to Last Light.",

Game originally crashed every time I launched until I downloaded an external file replacer from pcwiki as this is a known issue apparently. Considering I can play other games that are much older near perfectly at 4K, including games that have long since been abandoned by the developer like Dragon Age Origins from 2009, I have a hard time understanding how a 2014 remaster of a 2010 game can be so poorly optimized and have such awful settings. This came out around the time of the PS4 launch and is in fact on console, so how is it this is the end product on PC? It doesn't really make a lot of sense, but that is where I will play it I suppose, because this is pretty awful.",
