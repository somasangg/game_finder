      "review": "Back 8 years ago, I genuinely used to feel crazy for playing Rimworld. \n\nLike who are you gonna talk about to about that one crazy pawn who keeps setting your stockroom on fire over not eating at a table? Or about the first time you ever had to deal with a drop pod raid?\n\nDespite all that though, I find myself looking back on everything. Not just the game itself, but gaming as a whole. And it opened my eyes to see Rimworld as more than just a game I play, but as a massive project countless amounts of people have put their minds and hearts into.\n\nAll because of other companies who:\n- trickle updates out, often leaving core issues for the community to fix/deal with (often coupled with the next bullet point)\n- shovel disgusting amounts DLC add-ons (sometimes numerous and unimpactful, sometimes unreasonably priced, and sometimes but not often, content that should have been in the base game)\n- fail to deliver on promises without compromise, or often any communication at all\n- shut their communities out, choosing stubborn ignorance over listening to the people supporting their project (often choosing a PR stance over a humane one)\n- re-release the same title with little/no change (I'm lookin at you, [i] Bethesda. [/i] )\n\n\nLudeon though? \nThey never abandoned Rimworld. They never pushed out cheap and lazy content. They never stopped listening to their community. They put the work in to shoot for the moon, and in turn, it paid off. The game has evolved so much over time, its nothing I would have expected it to be, even outdoing many of the biggest giants in the gaming industry. This game that has stood the test of time in a world full of cashgrabs and broken messes, and I don't believe its something many people recognize. \n\nFrom the diligent work of the bugfixing devs, to every new DLC pack that each adds new ways to build/play your colony...(especially once you begin to combine them, creating complex communities with unique aspects that grow and change as you play); its hard to name many game titles that are this well and thoroughly taken care of on all fronts. \n\nAnd that's not even to mention to absolutely [b] LEGENDARY [/b] modding community this game has. The amount of community content that is continued to be added/supported in the workshop can be a bit overwhelming at first, but becomes quite the treasure trove once you begin to get more comfortable with the games mechanics. \n\nI'm constantly finding myself adding so many new and amazing mods, just to sit for the next hour trying to sort through and de-conflict mods. (trust me when I say the headache of mod management is WELL worth the catharsis you will experience when you are finally able to play mods without issues)\n\nI should wrap this review up though. I wanna really say thank you to the Ludeon Team, though, even if y'all don't read this. Without y'alls hard work and dedication to this game and its community, we would'nt be here with this absolutely stellar game that has brought so many different communities together in one place. And a HUGE thank you to all of the amazing modders who have or continue to add so many ways to spice up the game, y'all are some real g's. \n\nAnd even though I'm just one person writing a review to a sea of distant strangers, y'all have definitely made a difference not only in my life, but in the gaming world as a whole. \n\nMore than many may initially acknowledge or recognize.",

      "review": "Story time: So I once opted to live entirely under a mountain during a game.\r\n\r\nI was fed up with raids getting through my defences or crashing through my roofs, so the only way in or out of the base was down a long tunnel with a big castle gates at the end that the attackers would need to smash through.\r\nEither side I built bunkers that I could fire out of, but the attackers couldn't get into, with the only access to the bunkers being from within my mountain base itself.\r\n\r\nThis worked really well for a time, the attackers would try to smash down the gates while being withered down by fire from both sides.\r\nThen one day a group of weapon traders who were loitering outside of my gates were attacked by a group of raiders. We managed to kill the raiders, but not before one of their pack animals died, spilling everything it was carrying onto the ground. Plenty of nice stuff that was now \"free\" for me to collect.\r\n\r\nBut the main thing it had dropped was mortar rounds... hundreds of them, of all different types.\r\nSince I didn't use mortars in my underground base, I ignored these while I collected the rest of the loot, and that's when it happened.\r\n\r\nAnother raid. I got everyone to their positions in the bunkers and engaged the enemy, who were currently wading through a sea of mortar rounds. Wouldn't it be funny if I were to hit one of those rounds and have the explosion kill all of the raiders at once? Oh look ones cooking off, this'll be grea-\r\n\r\nThe resulting chain reaction as hundreds of HE, EMP, incendiary, and anti-grain warheads went off, destroyed half of the mountain that I was living under. The raiders, as well as the colonist I had in the bunkers either side were vaporised, they didn't even leave corpses. The only survivor was a single \"non-violent\" colonist, that I had on stand-by in the hospital at the back of the colony.\r\n\r\nI have over 700 hours in this game, yet I enjoy every single playthrough that I do. There's always something new, a different set of challenges to overcome, a whole new story being told.",

      "review": "Why RimWorld rocks — especially for modders and long-time players\r\n\r\n✅ Infinite variety & replayability\r\nOne of the strongest suits of RimWorld is that — thanks to procedurally generated worlds, random events, and a flexible “AI Storyteller” system — no two playthroughs feel the same. \r\n\r\nEven after hundreds or thousands of hours — as you experienced — you can still get fresh stories, new disasters, strange “cults” of colonists, bizarre accidents, or unexpected heroes. \r\n\r\n🎮 Deep simulation + emergent storytelling\r\nRimWorld isn’t just about building a base — it simulates social relations, skills, psychology, injuries, medicine, environment (climate, seasons, biomes), resource management, combat, trade, travel, and more. \r\n\r\nBecause of that, the game often “writes its own stories”: some colonies thrive, some collapse; sometimes a colonist becomes a hero, sometimes they go insane — and that unpredictability is part of what makes every run memorable. \r\n\r\n🔧 Modding + community = near-unlimited potential\r\nThe modding scene in RimWorld is one of its biggest strengths. There are thousands (even tens of thousands, depending on the definition) of mods on Steam Workshop — ranging from small quality-of-life tweaks, UI improvements, to major content overhauls (new races, new game mechanics, weapons, story-mod expansions, even total conversions). \r\n\r\nThat means you can tailor the game exactly to your idea of fun: maybe you want hardcore survival, maybe sci-fi, maybe medieval times, maybe more realism — there’s almost always a mod for it. And that mod ecosystem keeps RimWorld alive and fresh, even many years after release. \r\n\r\n🧑🎨 Sandbox freedom & player-driven goals\r\nThere is no “one true way to win.” RimWorld offers different possible victory conditions (escape by spaceship, planetary conquest, survival “forever”, etc.) or you can just play indefinitely. \r\n\r\nYou choose your style: drama, brutality, peaceful farming, trading, colony-building, maybe even a weird “cannibal + vampire + medieval techno-colony” if you feel like it. Modded or vanilla — it’s on you. \r\n\r\n❤️ Great value for time invested\r\nGiven how much content, randomness, and mod-driven expansion RimWorld offers — many players feel that the time spent (even hundreds of hours) is totally justified. Some say that after 700-800 h they still discover new aspects. \r\n\r\nWhere it’s rough — what might turn some players off\r\n\r\n⚠️ Steep learning curve & initial complexity\r\nBecause the game has so many systems — production chains, weather, moods, colonist traits, AI storyteller difficulty scaling — new players can easily feel overwhelmed. Without mods or guides, the early phase can be confusing. \r\n\r\n⚠️ Vanilla feels limited after a while (unless modded)\r\nOnce you figure out the “core loop” (build, expand, survive, repeat), vanilla RimWorld can get a bit repetitive — especially if you aim to “finish” a colony. Many people continue playing because of mods. \r\n\r\nWithout mods or DLCs, the late-game may feel less dynamic than the early or mid game.\r\n\r\n⚠️ UI, micromanagement & performance bugs (with large colonies or many mods)\r\nWhen your colony grows, or you have tons of mods enabled, the UI/menu clutter or pathing / micromanagement can become annoying. Some people report performance/hit-rate issues once the game becomes very complex. \r\n\r\n⚠️ DLC / mod-dependency for maximum depth\r\nWhile base game is solid, many of the newer features (or those giving big variety) come from mods or DLCs — so for “ultimate” RimWorld experience you often rely on external content. That may feel like dependency rather than pure vanilla design. \r\n\r\nMy take — RimWorld as a “lifestyle sandbox” (especially if you love mods)\r\n\r\nGiven that you played 800+ hours, I think you’re exactly the kind of player that RimWorld was made for. It’s less a “game you beat,” more a playground for creativity, chaos, stories, and personal challenges.\r\nBecause of mod support: you aren’t locked into one experience. You can evolve the game with each run — go from peaceful farmers to brutal mech-hive survivors to mad space-pirate colonies — whichever vibe you pick.\r\n\r\nRimWorld manages to balance structure (resources, survival needs, systems) with freedom (randomness, modding, sandbox goals, multiple win/lose conditions). That mixture creates emergent narratives — stories you never planned, but end up remembering.\r\n\r\nYes, you need patience; yes, vanilla gets stale eventually — but as long as you're open to mods (or just tweaking storyteller/difficulty or restart-scenarios), the game stays alive. In my view — RimWorld isn’t just “a good game,” it’s a tool for storytelling, experimentation, and chaos.",

The intent is that you get more attached to each one, and the game accomplishes this well even now, after years of playing it over and over.\n\nI'm getting a bit worn out on it lately, but it's taken me OVER NINE THOUSAND hours over the course of close to a decade to get to that point, and I still enjoy it, even if not as much as before.\n\nGet this fucking game.",

This game is a perfect balance of complexity and simplicity when it comes to details and gameplay mechanics. Complex enough to where you'll be constantly engaged with the amount of things to do, yet simple enough to where you won't feel overwhelmed and/or confused with the game's mechanics. Often you will be building the perfect base and sometimes hardly start on your technology research. This game has a great way of keeping you constantly active, with you adding more things for your colonists and defenses against the raiders. With every goal you accomplish you'll always find another. \n\nMost Colony Sims I've seen are either not very engaging, too laid back to where you're just waiting for colonists to finish before moving onto something else, having much wait time between events, or not very \"open\" like your colonists can't simply roam everywhere. This game however, does a great way of keeping you engaged. With events, quests, or raids that pops up, adding some action to the slightly laid-back gameplay. With the thanks to a storyteller of your choice responsible for causing these events, the game doesn't take too long at all with the time between raids and events. Even for things happening outside your colony. \nThis game has a lot to it, and is my personal pick for those who never picked up a Colony Sim before, or loves Colony Sims in general.",

And with the Combat Extended mod it made combat so much more fun and tactical with each weapon and bullet type having it's pro and con against different type of enemies/armor. And you designate what each colonist job is depending on their expertise. There is a lot of detailed planning and minmaxing for every aspect of the game.\n\nOn top of all the detailed and fun mechanics game is more so a random story telling experience of establishing a colony, you will encounter random events in random environments where every playthrough will be different.\n\nI played hundreds of hours of Rimworld on a cracked version before I decided to buy Rimworld and all it's DLC on steam.",

In just 40h, I've got 8 wipes already, some of them were quick, while others happened when I thought I had it under control. Inevitably, there's a point when everything collapses in both a tragic and hilarious way. \n\nOne time, it was a sort of main character being bitten to death by two guinea pigs during a solo expedition. Another time, malaria hit two out of three people and I low rolled every single chance for a cure. New game that starts to look promising, and then a domestic panther gets bored and becomes wild again, only to jump into your Handy Manny's bed and kill every pawn, one by one, around the house, only to die to the last one... which happened to be a psycho \"allergic\" to healing others, so everyone else slowly bled to death in their beds while she was having dinner. \n\nThe game is ugly af, but the way it offers emergent stories and gameplay is just peak gaming. It is surprisingly well designed and coded, considering the amount of variables at play. It can be very cruel, yet fair, and you can't really hate the game for whatever happens. As if it were the \"Three-Body\" chinese TV show, each collapse is a teaching of how *not* to run a colony, and I'm really curious as to where my trail of failed colonies goes.",

That still puts the price of the full package at 2 AA studio games. For them to fix this they'd need to lower the prices of all old DLC to managable prices, as a religion mod (as an example) shouldn't go for 2 euros off of Silksong.\n\n32 euros for the game. Seems fair, as it's a great game with modding compatibility built in.\n\nNow here comes the math that makes it impossible for me to recommend the game to a new player.\n\nDo you want detailed factions and events relative? 18 euro\nDo you want religion? 18 euro\nDo you want access to different races? 23,5 euro\nDo you want cosmic horror elements? 23,5 euro\nDo you want spaceships? 23,5 euro\n\nDo you want access to all the mods? 138.5 euro\n\nNoone plays the game without mods, and as such, if you want to play along with your favorite youtuber, you are expected to pay around 140 euros to do so.\n\nDo I believe the game is worth 140 euros to a new player?

This game is super diverse and awesome! It's like Kenshi, but better!\" You may ask. Well here is a concise answer to that:\n\n-Being a successful animal breeder quickly leads to uncontrollable chaos the second you get a sizable herd going (overpopulation, starvation, corpses everywhere, disease, performance loss, point of no correction once performance drops even with auto-slaughter set for all animals) \n-One mad wild animal at the start of a run due to random occurrences can end an entire colony (yeah, three colonists killed by a chinchilla, screw your opinions)\n-lackluster, RNG inherent trait system for initial colonists leaves you wishing for better customization of personalities \n-hearkening to the previous comment, HOW DOES A NON-VIOLENT PERSON EVEN EXIST IN THESE CONDITIONS (I'd understand if you had agoraphobic folks arise from offspring once you have a colony established, but putting the mentally ill in extremely expensive stasis for later use? Nah, give me the option to set inherent traits)\n-Torrential rainfall for three months+ with no option to keep debuffs but remove animations really grinds my gears (combine this with animals breeding out of control while I tend to other chores and I just couldn't keep my run going and had to start in a new region with less rain) \n-Harshly-limited graphics options limit performance even on my 5k series once you start getting a thriving colony going \n-pathing for things like hauling not registering even when I have production buildings in a widely accessible zone is becoming a great hindrance to my enjoyment of the game. If someone has a solution to things like the biofuel processor not being usable despite being readily accessible, please let me know what it is\n-even when my colonists are stacked with weapons, skills, armor, and buffs galore, all tailored to their strengths, they often get shredded by inferior lifeforms with inferior tech \n-mid-late game becomes an unstable mess where indoor environments are being registered as outdoors, and my walk-in coolers become useless as indoor/outdoor textures overlap and decay sets in \n-probably a me-issue, but my caravans often fail to form up and leave. the group just sort of gathers on the edge of my map and consistently bump into the boundary but never leave. If anyone has a solution, please let me know in the comments\n\nI'm not going to say this game is bad, it is actually really dope and I am dying to play it at peak performance and functionality. Alas, it just has too many things acting wonky AF for me to get a solid, continuous run with the same save. As of now, I'm on my third colony and doing my best to remain within the performance capabilities of the game itself while my colonies do their best to break every aspect of the game as I go along. \n\nSo far, animal breeding has been the best money-maker but also the most broken aspect of the game. Very hard on morale to see opportunities for wealth going right down the toilet because the game can't handle its own logic.",

That said if I didn't already love and own this game I would never buy it, the cumulative price for the dlc and game have gotten ridiculous. When I go to buy a game I know I'm going to get the dlc if I like the game. Even if I'm not buying the the dlc right away I still factor it in. I think without some real bundle discounts rimworld is stunting it's ability to get new customers. Soon it'll just be a game played by old people because as the cumulative price increases less and less people will get on board. That's why I don't recommend this game to new people.

Never mind colonists will never breed. Both are answered by either paying more money for dlc or getting a mod.

      "review": "Since Steam hasn't implemented a neutral option for reviews like this game deserves, I'm going to have to lean into not recommending it. \n\n\"Why? This game is super diverse and awesome! It's like Kenshi, but better!\" You may ask. Well here is a concise answer to that:\n\n-Being a successful animal breeder quickly leads to uncontrollable chaos the second you get a sizable herd going (overpopulation, starvation, corpses everywhere, disease, performance loss, point of no correction once performance drops even with auto-slaughter set for all animals) \n-One mad wild animal at the start of a run due to random occurrences can end an entire colony (yeah, three colonists killed by a chinchilla, screw your opinions)\n-lackluster, RNG inherent trait system for initial colonists leaves you wishing for better customization of personalities \n-hearkening to the previous comment, HOW DOES A NON-VIOLENT PERSON EVEN EXIST IN THESE CONDITIONS (I'd understand if you had agoraphobic folks arise from offspring once you have a colony established, but putting the mentally ill in extremely expensive stasis for later use? Nah, give me the option to set inherent traits)\n-Torrential rainfall for three months+ with no option to keep debuffs but remove animations really grinds my gears (combine this with animals breeding out of control while I tend to other chores and I just couldn't keep my run going and had to start in a new region with less rain) \n-Harshly-limited graphics options limit performance even on my 5k series once you start getting a thriving colony going \n-pathing for things like hauling not registering even when I have production buildings in a widely accessible zone is becoming a great hindrance to my enjoyment of the game. If someone has a solution to things like the biofuel processor not being usable despite being readily accessible, please let me know what it is\n-even when my colonists are stacked with weapons, skills, armor, and buffs galore, all tailored to their strengths, they often get shredded by inferior lifeforms with inferior tech \n-mid-late game becomes an unstable mess where indoor environments are being registered as outdoors, and my walk-in coolers become useless as indoor/outdoor textures overlap and decay sets in \n-probably a me-issue, but my caravans often fail to form up and leave. the group just sort of gathers on the edge of my map and consistently bump into the boundary but never leave. If anyone has a solution, please let me know in the comments\n\nI'm not going to say this game is bad, it is actually really dope and I am dying to play it at peak performance and functionality. Alas, it just has too many things acting wonky AF for me to get a solid, continuous run with the same save. As of now, I'm on my third colony and doing my best to remain within the performance capabilities of the game itself while my colonies do their best to break every aspect of the game as I go along. \n\nSo far, animal breeding has been the best money-maker but also the most broken aspect of the game. Very hard on morale to see opportunities for wealth going right down the toilet because the game can't handle its own logic.",

The expansions are pretty expensive for how small they seem, and for the price of a single RimWorld DLC I could buy several really solid indie games. It makes the overall package feel a bit unbalanced, especially for someone just getting into the game.\n\nSo far, RimWorld itself seems good, but the cost and size of the DLCs keep me hesitant about investing further.",
