The game also dives into goods transport, logistics, and company management, letting you build an empire while still getting behind the wheel.\n\nBonus point, It’s multiplayer, so you can run deliveries, compete, or build businesses with friends. If you’ve ever wanted a transport tycoon with real driving and mod-worthy vehicles, this is the goat.",

      "review": "Came here from SnowRunner, stayed for the taxi money.\r\n\r\nThis Game Is My Favorite \"Side Hustle\" Sim\r\n\r\nLook, if you're coming from SnowRunner or expecting another ATS, you gotta reset your expectations. Motor Town doesn't try to be either of those, and that’s why I love it.\r\n\r\nMy favorite thing to do in this game—and the reason I’ve racked up 262 hours—is running a trucking empire. I use the AI company system as my personal \"idle game.\" I've got my AI buses and trucks delivering goods to every supermarket to keep the Town Bonus humming. It's just a fun side gig that lets me run the game’s whole economy without lifting a finger.\r\n\r\nThen, when I want to drive, I just jump into a gig. Sometimes it's the back-and-forth trucking, which is surprisingly chill and addictive. Other times, I’m cruising around in my favorite taxi setups—the reliable Monarch or my pimped-out Cervo sedan. It’s the perfect blend of being the CEO and the best employee.\r\n\r\nThe Good: What Motor Town Gets So Right\r\n\r\nThe Tycoon Layer: This is the heart of the game. Managing the AI routes and watching the cash roll in while I’m out on a personal run makes every delivery feel meaningful. It’s truly a different and solid experience.\r\n\r\nThe Taxi Grind: Once you nail the suspension tuning running taxi routes is incredibly relaxing. It's flow-state driving at its best.\r\n\r\nCharming, But Simple Graphics: The game uses a low-poly aesthetic that is often praised as charming and distinct. However, for sim fans coming from graphically intensive titles like ETS2, the simplified look can be an initial barrier.\r\n\r\nWholesome Multiplayer: The community is generally known for being chill and helpful. Jumping into a populated server often leads to fun social experiences like impromptu convoys or players assisting with tows.\r\n\r\nI've done basically everything the game has to offer right now, and I’ve got a few constructive complaints:\r\n\r\nBrutal Drop-Off Zones: For big truck missions and bulk runs, some of those drop-off spots are straight-up gnarly. I have no problem backing a truck, but some areas are pointlessly punishing. A simple quality-of-life fix would be a \"lazy cube\" option—a green drop zone right in the middle for when you just need a break.\r\n\r\nHyper-Sensitive Taxi Comfort: The comfort point system (the gyroscope/swivel thing) is crazily sensitive. Losing points for a simple, very slow turn or gentle braking is ridiculous. This needs to be looked at, as it penalizes careful driving.\r\n\r\nAI Pathing is... a Mess: My AI drivers (and the NPCs) frequently cause accidents at lights or during turns. The AI pathing needs a serious look.\r\n\r\nHandling & Racing Expectations: While cruising around like an idiot at high speeds is fun, trying to buckle down and race just isn't appealing. When you have games like Gran Turismo 7, Forza Motorsport, and Need for Speed, Motor Town's unique handling just doesn't meet the expectation for a dedicated racing experience for some one who uses controller and steering wheel in my opinion. I know the game is still in early.\r\n\r\nOptimization Issues: This has been a recurring headache. Early on, the game gave my hardware a pointless amount of stress considering the visuals. It's something you have to wrestle with, and it’s definitely not always a smooth experience right out of the box.\r\n\r\nThe Semi-Truck Dilemma: Once you are established, the top-tier semi-trucks often feel underwhelming compared to smaller, highly efficient delivery setups. Without the ability to run multiple trailers (proper road trains), their profitability doesn't always justify the high cost, a point of frequent community discussion.\r\n\r\nThe Off-Road Dilemma: For a game with this much dirt, the lack of capable off-road vehicles is a bummer. What I really need is an AWD swap option for existing cars.\r\n\r\nLack of Endgame Progression: After playing for 262 hours, money has become functionally worthless. The game needs more late-game features or goals that reward veteran players beyond accumulating more cash.\r\n\r\nFinal Verdict\r\n\r\nMotor Town: Behind The Wheel isn't ATS or SnowRunner—it's its own thing. It's an absorbing and fun game if you enjoy the idea of logistics, management, and casual driving. If you go into it knowing you’ll need to do some optimization tweaking and maybe ignore a few grumpy players, you’ll find a unique, addictive world waiting for you.",

      "review": "This game is especially worth checking out for those who enjoy delivering a wide variety of cargo, even with a large group of friends.\nFirst of all, it's worth noting the regular updates that add new vehicles and trailers (particularly tandems).\n- decent physics (center of mass and overall weight, which influences all aspects of vehicle performance).\n- not absolute, but there's freedom to customize the vehicle technically (suspension, gearbox, differential, etc.).\n- there's no full-fledged soft-ground physics, but it's pleasant to drive (once you understand the basic rules).\n- production chains and the special vehicles that require them.\n- flexible global lighting settings, including complete freedom in installing all mounted lighting (and other equipment).\n- the ability to adjust traffic volume as desired.\n- the ability to hire AI drivers for your trucks (to increase population, which will increase overall sector income, or simply to fill production chains).\n\nCons:\n- assistants in the settings menu aren't very intuitive (requires additional time to understand how they work and customize them).\n- larger radiuses would be appreciated. Object rendering. Even at maximum settings, you still notice objects appearing out of thin air.\n- More driving mode options are needed. When driving a truck with a heavy load on normal roads, you'll most often have to use \"Comfort\" mode because you'll get heated up on inclines. But in \"Sport\" mode, it's much easier to avoid rollovers because there's no delay in wheel rotation. Consequently, when parking, you'll have to switch to \"Sport\" mode and then switch to the other mode to hitch and unload. In other words, you'd like to have both quick steering response and engine overheat protection in one mode.",

If you're into stuff like American/European Truck Simulator, Snow/Mud-runner, or even stuff like Farming Simulator, you'll probably enjoy this game.\r\n\r\nOne of the stand-out features, at least to me, is the functional supply/demand economy.  One of the things that always felt disappointing in A/ETS was that the jobs were basically just randomly generated, and so they felt devoid of meaning/purpose.  In Motor Town, there are functional supply chains that actually track their inventory/progress and create jobs to fulfill demands.\r\n\r\nFor example, you can increase the availability of pizza delivery jobs by delivering meat and cheese to pizza stores, which comes from meat and dairy factories.  But those factories need supplies, so you have to bring milk to the Dairy Plant, which comes from local ranches.  And as you bring more milk from the ranches to the Dairy Plant, it's inventory of milk will fill up and it will stop requesting more deliveries of milk.  There are many other supply chains like this, which means the deliveries feel like they actually have a purpose.\r\n\r\nThe driving is also quite good for the type of game it is.  It's not a full on simulator, it's \"sim-cade\", the cars have decent weight and gravity to them, and there's an enjoyable challenge in trying to keep the cars under control at high speeds, or when dealing with the more challenging offroading areas.\r\n\r\nI'm excited to see what other jobs the devs come up with to add to the game, I think a mailman job is in the works possibly, there's definitely a lot of potential for new activities to add.  But even as the game stands right now, it's fully worth the purchase price.",

      "review": "[h1] Main Review [/h1]\n\nMotor Town: Behind the Wheel functions well as a driving sim whilst combining some currently basic aspects of goods transport management.\n\nThe driving aspect of the game, whilst needing some getting used to, is enjoyable and easily adapted to, with good functionality across keyboard and mouse, game-pad and steering wheel setups. The driving itself is not the realistic - think Cyberpunk 2077 or GTA-V for the feeling of the driving, although it does feature more advanced systems such as differential locking and custom assists settings. Motor Town also features an in-depth customisation system for every vehicle (although many of the vehicles are still a little wanting in their options for customisation), and this feature alone can account for my many hours played in the game. If you like to customise and test various different vehicle setups, you'll very much enjoy this aspect of the game.\n\nProgression in the game exists through both the earning of money through completed transports and contracts, and through the earning of experience again through the completion of transports and contracts. This progression is however stymied through a cargo balancing system - the larger your chosen choice of transport, the less money you will make per each piece of cargo. This results in larger, more advanced vehicles and trailers only marginally making more money that smaller vehicles, artificially slowing progression in a way some may find frustrating - especially as not all cargo routes allow for contracts, leaving larger vehicles left out in certain cases. \nYou will find however the AI driver options through the company you can start to be very basic and un-intuitive to use. At the time of this review, only trucks and buses can be setup for AI driving routes through your company, and off-road routes are unable to be serviced by your AI drivers. This means you as the player will have to always transport goods at some point in your cargo routing, which can be both a benefit and a disappointment, depending on the gameplay you are looking for. In reality, larger-scale cargo management isn't truly possible through single-player - and as such, in order to engage on gameplay where all the different cargo routes are being used, joining or creating a multiplayer environment is required.\n\nVisually Motor Town is fairly appealing, though on occasion some areas feel a little sparse in both decoration and texturing variance. The cities themselves are well decorated and interesting, but areas such as the desert and rural roads can feel very empty at times. The simplified texturing style is improved by various different effects being on offer, meaning the game, whilst looking simple, actually turns out to be very pretty and photogenic at times, especially at night.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\n\nMotor Town: Behind the Wheel is definitely worth it's price if it interests you - however, for anyone unsure about diving in, I would recommend playing the demo to get a feel for the game. The demo itself showcases accurately the feeling of the driving, the UI systems and the cargo running you will take part in as a player and well represents the full game.\nI would provide the game a 7/10 general score.",

The more trailers you add on, the less valuable the cargo is? That doesn't make sense because a part of the equation is missing the speed of smaller vehicles being able to deliver at faster times. \n\nAlso, you can't actually save the town economies in singleplayer which is unfortunate. It'd be cool to be able to use your company to bring back the economies to 100% across the island.",

Its the same as online.\n-Also, There is no way to pick up dropped pallets and put them back on a trailer.\n-No way to flip any trailer without a wench (including small ones).\n-If you crash and your trailer detaches from your main vehicle you have to manually get a wench to even attempt to unflip it because the \"rescue tow service\" or whatever doesn't have the ablitly to detect that you had a trailer and lost it when you went off the road. \n-Don't bother with higher grade tires you'll still spin out.\n-Devs make max grade \"Urgent\" taxi service impossible unless you take shortcuts, AND if you try taking them 99% of the time you'll end up SOL because of rocks, mud, spinning out (even though you have max grip tires for the asphalt or dirt (whichever you got them for)), or the car that is perfectly coming over the hill you tried to avoid hitting.\n-If you play want to play solo or offline there is no editing other then despawning specific vehicles and changing rain/weather patterns and vehicle density.
