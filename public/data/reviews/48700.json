      "review": "Mount & Blade: Warband is an absolute gem of a game for anyone who loves strategy, action, and immersive medieval warfare. The game offers a level of freedom and depth that is rarely seen in other titles, and it’s easy to lose yourself in its expansive world.\n\nFirst, let’s talk about the army building. One of the standout features of Warband is how deeply satisfying the process of raising and commanding an army can be. The game allows you to recruit a variety of troops from different factions, train them up, and strategically manage your forces in ways that feel incredibly rewarding. Watching your humble band of ragtag soldiers evolve into a mighty war machine is an experience unlike any other. Plus, you can customize your army’s composition, making every battle feel fresh and unique. The system of managing morale, equipment, and positioning adds layers of strategy that keep you constantly engaged.\n\nThe siege warfare in Warband is equally impressive. Whether you’re attacking a heavily fortified castle or defending one of your own, the siege mechanics are thrilling. You’ll find yourself leading massive assaults, scaling walls with ladders, or even using siege weapons like trebuchets and catapults to break down the defenses. The atmosphere during these massive battles is tense and exhilarating, and the feeling of charging up a hill with your army or watching the castle gates crumble is truly epic.\n\nWhat really ties everything together, though, is the experience of supporting an existing clan or creating your own. Whether you decide to join one of the game’s established factions or strike out on your own to form your own clan, the political and strategic elements add so much depth to the experience. If you go the clan route, there’s a fantastic sense of progression as you build your reputation, forge alliances, and claim territory. The relationships you build with other leaders and factions are dynamic, with every decision impacting your rise to power. If you manage to take control of a kingdom, you’ll get to experience the thrill of not just leading armies but also managing your lands, making decisions that affect the growth of your realm.\n\nOverall, Mount & Blade: Warband is one of those rare games that gives players a true sense of freedom and impact. Whether you’re building the perfect army, storming castles, or shaping the future of a kingdom, every moment feels like a meaningful part of a larger story. It’s a must-play for anyone who enjoys tactical combat, medieval settings, or just a game that lets you carve your own path.",

      "review": "Gotta love this game absolute classic. As you can tell it hasn't aged too well, the animations are stiff and feel odd and the textures aren't great either. Audio sounds pretty average for it's age too. That being said, the rest of the game is amazing. The core gameplay itself is quite repetitive kill, loot sell and recruit. But that's all it needs to make it work and work well it does. Quests are terrible but what do you expect from a game this old... The modding community is amazing, making mods for almost every universe you could think of. I've put hundreds of hours into GOT Persino and Warhammer mods each time I play I love it, they are what make this game what it is. Multiplayer is still active too with thousands of people playing all the time. I recommend getting Warband and it's dlc and giving it a go.",

      "review": "Warband is still the best Mount & Blade game. It lacks some quality of life features found in Bannerlord, but makes up for it with much better balance, mechanics, and personality. And in spite of its age, the actual combat feels a lot sharper. There's a lot less ambiguity in your movements and attacks compared to Bannerlord, and the lances in particular feel a lot more usable. The wide variety of excellent mods is icing on the cake.\r\n\r\nSomeday Bannerlord might overtake Warband. Not today.",

You will have to manage troops, skills, resources morale and more! even more so the modding scene is unmatched. everything from star wars to lord of the rings to roman history to world war 2! The possibilities are endless! My 500 hours is on this device alone, i have around the same amount of time played on counsel and around a quarter of that played on another account! Only thing to keep in mind is that this game does not hold hands at all, there is no tutorial or campaign. in the beginning there is a small questline to get the player started with some money and equipment, but other than that it is a full on sandbox style game whatever you choose to do whenever you want!",

The action never grows old, the fights are epic, and siege warfare is the best.  ALSO, there is no active first person sneaking or stealth in this wonderful game, which I hate.  You can always send a companion to sneak in somewhere, leaving me the heck out of it, LOL.  \r\n\r\nIn the end, with proper planning, battles and careful subterfuge, you can eventually rule the world.  Once you do a legit playthrough with vanilla and rule the world, then I advise cheating with the console and mods,.  It's enjoyable and worth the time, even for an older game with ugly models.  It still looks awesome as all get out when you use your bow to snipe a guy on a castle wall, he grabs his face and screams while dying.  \r\n\r\nEpic.  Fun.  Everything you enjoy about combat based games.  I never did multiplayer, as I am a proud lone wolf.  If I take over the world, it's all on me!  Yeah!",

Kudos to taleworlds for crafting such a great game and embracing a legendary modding community. Yes, do play the mods of Warband. It's the soul of the game and what makes this game some of the most replayable games of all time. And if you haven't inferred, probably more than 90% of playtime here were on mods, so account for the bias here (in my defense, I got bored with the vanilla game quick, but holy shoot, the mods were what made me hooked and caused me to decote so many hours in)",

It might just be the perfect game for you to spend 10.000 hours in.\r\nBut me personally, i'm done, besides, Bannerlord is out, and it does everything this game does, but better and more.\r\n\r\nOf course with modern hardware you can crank up armies on the field to the max with ease, and it is a lot of fun to see two big armies fight eachother and that has always been the main appeal with the 'Mount & Blade' games, but there is more to do and you dont even have to stick to the rules, you can RP as a coastal raider if you want for a thousand hours, or you can conquer the world in 7 days. the possibilites are nearly endless.\r\n\r\nMy enjoyment score at its peak was 91%\r\n\r\nFav quote: \"Thats a nice head you have on your shoulders\"",

It has all the polish of a sandwich and it's as simple too. You'll understand the basics in as little as an hour and even though the combat can be clunky sometimes doesn't mean it's not satisfying (especially on horse back swinging into a mass of enemies). Also this is undoubtedly the most open ended RPG I have ever played. After the first mission you will be completely free to do whatever you want and it will not hold your hand while you are doing it. You can play as a general in an army, a mercenary, a robber baron, a business mogul, an arena fighter, and even a kingdom toppling conqueror. You can ransom lords, sell captives into slavery, rustle cattle, build a massive army or just a small band of companions. You can be a hero, save villages, rescue people, hunt down marauders, rise from a peasant to a noble in so many ways. Yes the graphics are highly dated, yes the missions and dialogue are repetitive, but like a sandwich you can make anything out of it and that is why I would highly recommend this game to anyone who just wants to be free in a medieval RPG.",

From humble beginnings as a lone wanderer to commanding your own army and carving out a kingdom, every moment feels earned. It’s the kind of game that pulls you in for “just one more battle” — and suddenly, it’s 3 a.m.\n\nWhat makes Warband so timeless is its freedom. You can be a mercenary, a trader, a rebel, or a ruler — and the world always reacts to you. The combat, though, is where it truly shines. It’s raw, physical, and deeply immersive — not about flashy combos, but about timing, positioning, and the weight of every swing. Every clash of steel feels personal, every victory hard-fought. Whether you’re leading cavalry across open fields or holding the line in a desperate siege, it never loses its intensity.\n\nThe music deserves its own mention — that bold, medieval soundtrack that somehow makes even a desperate skirmish feel legendary. It captures the soul of Warband perfectly: grand, a little rough around the edges, but full of heart. Every drumbeat and lute string feels like home to anyone who’s spent time in Calradia.\n\nEven with all the newer games that came after, Mount & Blade: Warband remains unmatched in spirit. It’s not just a medieval sandbox — it’s a journey, a memory, and a world that still calls you back years later. ⚔️",

Yet, I find it hard to recommend. It's not so much that some graphics have aged, as the game still looks pretty good. For a game with this much text, I think they could've spent a little bit more time making it readable and well-aligned, but I don't think that's a fatal flaw either. \n\nRather, I just find that there isn't that much detail worth thinking about. Lords, cities, the shape of the continent, your companions and more are so generic they might as well be randomly generated. There are a handful of quests which I can almost see how they were programmed in my head. Battles degenerate into swinging around the enemy and attacking from the back or just spamming your attack. The whole game has a feeling of being a fisher-price version of what it wants to be.\n\nAnother thing lowering my opinion on the game is its cost. Right now Warband is going for $19.99, despite being over 15 years old. Of course, you can wait for it to go on sale, but for a game this old it's probably about time to permanently drop the price so the developers can go below the 90% sale limit. \n\nSo I can't recommend it. Maybe if you get it for 2$ on a huge sale and you don't really value your time very much, or if this type of game is really your thing you'll love it, otherwise it's kinda forgettable.",

First off, its one of those games where you can pick a bunch of options from the start, and you are told to create your own story. What you are not told is that there is only one viable option, and its option 1, for everything. every choice after one is there to pad play time so they can say their game has tons of options. the first character i made started in an area that was way to difficult to do, given i had just downloaded the game. nothing told me that. nothing said, hey, these options are for people who have beat the game already, and want the variety of losing to spice things up. so my first character was a scratch, which you know, no one is ever attached to their first character right? yeah... so once i had done exactly what the developers had wanted, and picked option 1 for everything, and couldn't have cared less about my character (way to go getting me investing in the game...) i started again in the easy area. the first few quests barely set my character up, and the starving peasants that were the only option for me to hire at my current finance level were garbage at fighting. the only option that seemed available to me was to go around and hire as many sickly peasants as i could. those of course dried up very quickly, and i ended up with only 59 men. I did also attempt a tournament, which was awful. The weapons were random, and for several i was given a lance. the lance only does decent (if any) damage at speed, however, the enemies would of course chase me, so i could only slow down and turn to try and hit them, which did no damage. after loading my save 3 times, and running in circles for 10 mins, i finally managed to beat the tournament. my winnings were not even enough to buy a decent weapon or horse. after the tournament, i was bored of skulking around in the shadows and tried getting close to the border. I was immediately charged by 70 horsemen and defeated in battle. i alt f4-ed out and started my review. i have also noticed that people are saying mods make the game great. I am sure after someone has changed core things about the game, and added in things for fun, that this game is good. but take note developers, you did not make a good game, the modding community did after fixing your hot garbage. if i can get a refund after the time it took me to get through the start of this game i will be very happy, as the sale price of $6.50 was too much to waste. If i cannot get my refund, i may attempt to play it after modding it and making it into a game that is fun to play.",

      "review": "terrible combat where soldiers can hit through eachother, its just a spam fest where you spam the best soldiers and win, theres no more to it than that\n\nyou can kite enemies while being on horseback and get them to run in circles trying to attack you, signs of incredibly poor ai right there, everything reacts the same to you, so it makes everything very repetitive and dull, but its not like anyone cares about basic stuff like that, since youre having so much fun after all, beating braindead ai\n\nyou rush up to them with a giant horse, very heavy mind you, charge and then do no damage, so fun, very realistic and appropriate for the time, or you go fighting them on horseback and witness as every soldier has perfect tracking, and can block, and perfectly parry a gigantic heavy plate armoured horse charging straight at them with a lance, the signs of a great combat system start with every enemy having perfect tracking, this compounds on the issue of being able to attack through eachother, by the way (i know you cant attack through eachother, but the weapon length and hitbox allows for it, so it might aswell be allowed)\n\ntaking over castles requires no tactic, starving the castle takes too long to be useful, you mush 100+ heavy infantry up a single ladder or a siege tower and hopefully push through a weak braindead garrison, or not, then if youre lucky, spend the next 10 minutes trying to reach some random enemy your soldiers just ganged up on, not being able to attack him because theyre all jampacked together in one giant sausage party\n\nbattle advantage is arbitrary, does it effect your own soldiers hit rate? i dont know, but they seem more ineffective than usual when the advantage is in the negatives, does that make any sense?\n\nyou have terrain, movement speed being affected by these and it doesnt matter, because my battle advantage is low? so my archers hit less often because of low battle advantage, even while firing at troops and cavalries moving slowly up a mountain? moving slowly and predictably in a braindead AI fashion? and my spear units suddenly find it harder to kill cavalry, walking up to them with no momentum?\n\nbut i dont know what battle advantage does, so whatever, it is still arbitrary, and does not take into consideration of anything but character traits, it should be removed, in my opinion\n\ni believe anyone who has played this for 1k hours+ are autistic, or dumb and maybe both at the same time, as multiplayer is no better, playing as an archer is better than playing as a knight in my opinion, constantly headshotting people as they climb up to you has its clear advantage, truly degenerate\n\nthe only fun mod i had was PARADIGM WORLD, which is an ultra spam fest on steroid,  where you can create your own unit using prisoners equipment, in the form of some sort of synthesis mechanic, where you squeeze 15 prisoners of a type, into your custom unit to get them to use the equipment, you can create very powerful units this way, so it was atleast satisfying to play the game then, having real rewards for time invested\n\nbut other than that, it was still braindead, with braindead AI, so not much different, but atleast everything is more fast paced and fun in that one, is it rather cathartic killing 200 guys with your ultra powerful light sword",

Yet, I find it hard to recommend. It's not so much that some graphics have aged, as the game still looks pretty good. For a game with this much text, I think they could've spent a little bit more time making it readable and well-aligned, but I don't think that's a fatal flaw either. \n\nRather, I just find that there isn't that much detail worth thinking about. Lords, cities, the shape of the continent, your companions and more are so generic they might as well be randomly generated. There are a handful of quests which I can almost see how they were programmed in my head. Battles degenerate into swinging around the enemy and attacking from the back or just spamming your attack. The whole game has a feeling of being a fisher-price version of what it wants to be.\n\nAnother thing lowering my opinion on the game is its cost. Right now Warband is going for $19.99, despite being over 15 years old. Of course, you can wait for it to go on sale, but for a game this old it's probably about time to permanently drop the price so the developers can go below the 90% sale limit. \n\nSo I can't recommend it.
