It does fix and make very good changes over the original.\nFeel the power of the Gods in your hand and become a legend!\nGreat and fun campaigns. Lot of replayability with all the unique civilizations and different god options each of them has.\n\nDLC is worth it as well, specially heavenly spear.",

UI is also a massive downgrade.\n\nSo I *can* \"micro\" in games like this. I did recently in Dragonshard. But if I'm paying for a remake/remaster, I expect some quality of life features in this department and I'm not seeing much.\n\nUltimately, this feels like paying for the privilege of playing what I already own. I'd only buy this version if you don't already own the Extended Edition.\n\n\n[h2]Pros:[/h2]\n\n- Can often reuse god powers, but they'll cost more\n\n- Lots of accessibility options\n\n- I love the idea of having a healer/support main character for a campaign for once (Japanese campaign)\n\n\n[h2]Mehs:[/h2]\n\n- Looks the same as Extended Edition, but with less saturated color. Most noticeable in green vegetation\n\n- Feels like there's lots of missed opportunities to create quality of life features that don't take away from the original experience\n\n- Japanese campaign seems pretty boring. Maybe the game's just boring and I can only play for original campaign nostalgia?\n\n\n[h2]Cons:[/h2]\n\n- Healers try to commit suicide by moving to the attack move point, *then* healing. But the rest of your army is now behind them so your healers are now exposed. Especially bad in the Japanese campaign as the main character is a healer\n\n- Many UI issues. It's sinfully ugly, it's cluttered, the font is inconsistent, and using larger font often doesn't even fit in the UI at all. Huge downgrade from Extended Edition\n\n- People are saying if your internet connection falters for even a moment during your single-player campaign, you'll fail the mission. Seems like a horrible idea\n\n- New voice acting is very poor. Sounds like white people doing racist imitations of Asians like on Family Guy or something",

      "review": "Age of Mythology: Retold is an amazing love letter to Age of Mythology fans because Age of Mythology: Retold not only keeps the soul of the original game and makes it look even better, but also improves upon it by bringing new layers to it's dynamic nature, pushing the chaos to a new peak. Who wouldn't want even more chaos, especially as an Age of Mythology fan? Unfortunately, like every love letter, it might be intended to be pure and sweet, but it might end up as something less. This is exactly how I felt about Age of Mythology: Retold. When the problems I had with the game come to mind, in order, it would probably be like this:\n\n* AI-generated image controversies\n* Pathing issues\n* Miserable AI of the troops and villagers\n* Downgrade of the voice acting\n* Mind-boggling bugs\n* Launch problems (DirectX issues)\n* Greedy policy (No God Freyr standalone DLC)\n\nEven with all these issues, and probably even more that I missed, I still can't stop myself from feeling full of joy to be able to see Age of Mythology being accessible to more people than it ever was. Even if I have mixed feelings about DLCs, seeing new pantheons and campaigns is definitely a lovely sight to see. I just want to say keep them coming and hopefully fix the rest of the issues. Now, if you'll excuse me, I will go and chit-chat with Ajax to learn what I missed since then.\n\nFinal Verdict:⭐⭐⭐⭐(4/5)",

      "review": "TL:DR > A faithful remake that remembers what made AoM fun, fixes what wasn't and adds factions (DLC) that show just how much room this game still has to grow.\n\nAge of Mythology: Retold - The RTS Revival We Actually Deserve\n\nI'll say something that will 100% annoy a few purists: Retold is THE most faithful remake ever [i]not[/i] made.\n\nAnd that is exactly the point.\n\nRetold isn't just a graphical facelift made to milk you with cheap nostalgia tricks. It is the first time in ages Age of Mythology feels like the game we thought we were playing back in 2002 and not the game our CRT monitors were capable of showing us.\n\nThis game is one of those rare breeds where faithfulness with modernization done right shines. Retold copies the originals bones almost 1:1 but modernization is where magic happens. Whether you're a competitive player or just someone who remembgers getting spammed by mass chimers, you'll notice that myth units have clearer roles and less overlap, all nations have their strengths and weaknesses without any single one completely outclassing the others. The scaling between regular units, heroes and myth units is much more impactful. Every faction can cast same god power multiple times after a cooldown and cost of favour.\n\nWhen it comes to DLCs the base game comes with the Original game and the Original Titans Expansion. It does have two DLC's currently. I bought this game Premium Edition when it released and I waited until I got to play both DLCs before I decided to post the review.\n\nI hope that we will get quite a few more DLCs because I want to explore some other nations. Chinese were a given when it started as they had to compensate for the Tale of the Dragon mess that was released for the OG game. It will be really dissapointing if we don't get at least 3-4 more nation DLCs from all around the world, hopefully something Mayans, Aztecs, Slavs, Yoruba, Hindus, Sumer/Babylon.\n\nAs it stands the DLCs have birght future. Both Asian factions feel like they were designed with Retold's new systems in mind. \n\nChinese have flexible early eco that rewards planing especially when it comes to favour generation as it requires more land coverage to produce. Mythunites feel genuinely unique (unlike Tale of the Dragon DLC for original game). Standard units really reward mixing up the units for specific tasks and enemies. Army production buildings can integrate faster production or defence towers.\n\nJapanese generate favour by having the pirest \"pray\" at the temple and the output is determined by the amount of natural resources around the temple. From my experience they have phenomenal defensive play that rewards powerful timing and pushes.\n\nThese factions shake up the meta and in the best way possible. They give me so much hope for the future cultures and myths. And I am kinda glad they are DLCs that they take their time with instead of rushed cashgrab slop.\n\nIs Retold better than the original?\n\nPurists will say no. People who actually play RTS in 2025 will likely say yes.\n\nRetold isn't cheap copy of the original it genuinely tries to fulfill it. If you want perfect 1:1 museum/piece port, play the original you can get the Extended Edition here on steam for like 27€. This version might have some quirks that need to be ironed out at some points but the developers are continiously supporting the game. Retold has modern responsiveness, alive balance and a player base that keeps the game allivethe game averages between 2000-3000 players constantly if you want to play online with random people. It started from 10k first month of release and it steadied to consistent 2-3k after few months and has been there for a year now.",

I played nords and watched my warriors push an ox cart half way across the map. In the original age of mythology, I think they solved this by having units just not collide with the ox cart\n * Abysmal AI. On normal, I feel like they should be stronger, but they don't even upgrade watchtowers.\n\nOther than those two horrible things, I have not experienced a ton of crashes. The tutorial in the original game was decent enough that it didn't need to be changed. I could skip this tutorial because I played the original in 2003.",

It's a great RTS franchise along with Age of Empires and it's rekindled my love for mythology and strategy.\n2. I can see a lot of improvement in the graphics and overall quality of the game and I appreciate the new interface. It feels a lot more sleek and intuitive.\n3.

      "review": "At over 700 hours of gameplay, this is the second most played game in my Steam library. It's hard to hate a game that's provided so much entertainment, but there are three very important key aspects that are slowly but surely killing the game that need to be brought up. These are from the perspective of someone who plays ranked team modes exclusively.\n\n1. DLC. Period. I understand the devs gotta make money, but adding paid civs is a perfect way to ruin the game, ESPECIALLY an RTS. Since nobody will buy an underpowered civ from DLC, they give all the easy, braindead destructive god powers and broken myth units to the DLC in order to get entice people to buy them. You can't tell me this isn't happening. Japanese pantheons literally get 4 destructive god powers that can be used whenever, wherever. Meanwhile as Thor I get one destructive god power that can only be used around trees lol. Freyr also gets an instant fortress early in the game, meaning he just squat on your natural expansion before you can get siege out and deny you expansion unless you are 100% prepared for it, and even then, good luck. Completely unfun. My advice: Stop adding DLC and focus on balancing your game. Monetize using cosmetics until the game is in a good state, and then we can talk about adding DLC civs.\n\n2. Matchmaking is complete garbage. Noobs getting paired against pros, players that instantly disconnect, and blocking players does nothing, meaning you will likely be paired with them in the future. To me, this game is only enjoyable playing in teams. 1v1 is unbelievably boring. They need to take matchmaking more seriously if they intend to keep players around.\n\n3. Random stupid bugs that get introduced every. single. update. There are broken mechanics that have been there since launch. Shift-clicking does not work half the time (unacceptable in an RTS game), pathing issues, AI issues, map-hack style exploits (eg. checking for enemy hunts and TC's), hotkeys not working, etc. Why the devs have not prioritized fixing these basic issues is beyond me.\n\nBottom line: Should you buy this game? Only when it's on sale. Don't expect a super clean, perfect RTS because this is not it. Between balancing issues, horrendous matchmaking, and a cavalcade of bugs, the game has a long way to go before we can call it \"the RTS to play\". As it is now, it will continue driving new players away and slowly decay into an unfriendly shark tank just like every old RTS game out there.",

      "review": "At over 700 hours of gameplay, this is the second most played game in my Steam library. It's hard to hate a game that's provided so much entertainment, but there are three very important key aspects that are slowly but surely killing the game that need to be brought up. These are from the perspective of someone who plays ranked team modes exclusively.\n\n1. DLC. Period. I understand the devs gotta make money, but adding paid civs is a perfect way to ruin the game, ESPECIALLY an RTS. Since nobody will buy an underpowered civ from DLC, they give all the easy, braindead destructive god powers and broken myth units to the DLC in order to get entice people to buy them. You can't tell me this isn't happening. Japanese pantheons literally get 4 destructive god powers that can be used whenever, wherever. Meanwhile as Thor I get one destructive god power that can only be used around trees lol. Freyr also gets an instant fortress early in the game, meaning he just squat on your natural expansion before you can get siege out and deny you expansion unless you are 100% prepared for it, and even then, good luck. Completely unfun. My advice: Stop adding DLC and focus on balancing your game. Monetize using cosmetics until the game is in a good state, and then we can talk about adding DLC civs.\n\n2. Matchmaking is complete garbage. Noobs getting paired against pros, players that instantly disconnect, and blocking players does nothing, meaning you will likely be paired with them in the future. To me, this game is only enjoyable playing in teams. 1v1 is unbelievably boring. They need to take matchmaking more seriously if they intend to keep players around.\n\n3. Random stupid bugs that get introduced every. single. update. There are broken mechanics that have been there since launch. Shift-clicking does not work half the time (unacceptable in an RTS game), pathing issues, AI issues, map-hack style exploits (eg. checking for enemy hunts and TC's), hotkeys not working, etc. Why the devs have not prioritized fixing these basic issues is beyond me.\n\nBottom line: Should you buy this game? Only when it's on sale. Don't expect a super clean, perfect RTS because this is not it. Between balancing issues, horrendous matchmaking, and a cavalcade of bugs, the game has a long way to go before we can call it \"the RTS to play\". As it is now, it will continue driving new players away and slowly decay into an unfriendly shark tank just like every old RTS game out there.",
