The lands you travel are vast and boundless, filled with hidden sects, rival clans, and wandering heroes each chasing their own meaning. The air hums with the quiet power of cultivation, the philosophy of growth and balance shaping every path you take. It is a world that invites you not to follow, but to choose—to craft your own legend within its living, breathing expanse.\n\n[h2]Freedom & Choice: The Essence of Adventure[/h2]\nWhat truly defines Hero’s Adventure is its boundless freedom. Every decision branches into a new story, every choice ripples through your fate. You can walk the path of a righteous sect disciple, a cunning wanderer, a loyal companion—or something entirely your own. Romance, rivalry, friendship, betrayal—each is yours to shape. With dozens of endings and countless ways to play, no two journeys ever feel the same. It is not a game that tells you who to be—it asks you to discover that for yourself.\n\n[h2]Gameplay & Variety: Mastery through Expression[/h2]\nThe world offers more than ten unique weapon styles, each transforming how you approach battle and exploration. The freedom of combat mirrors the freedom of choice; whether you wield a swift sword or a heavy staff, each style feels distinct and rewarding. The replay value is immense—not just because of mechanics, but because you are different every time you return.\n\n[h2]Community & Growth: A Journey Shared[/h2]\nThough the English translation stumbles at times, the heart of the story still shines through—and it grows stronger every day, thanks to passionate fans and volunteer translators. The community surrounding the game is a reflection of its world: warm, dedicated, and eager to help new travelers find their way. Detailed guides, advice, and genuine support make this adventure feel like a shared pilgrimage rather than a solitary one.\n\n[h2]Final Reflection: A Cultivation of the Spirit[/h2]\nHero’s Adventure: Road to Passion is not merely played—it is lived. It embodies the essence of the cultivation genre: perseverance, choice, transformation. In its vastness, you find freedom; in its challenges, purpose. Despite its imperfections, it stands as one of the most open, personal, and heartfelt RPGs.\n\nFor those who seek meaning, growth, and a world that rewards curiosity, this is a journey worth taking—a path where passion truly becomes destiny.\n\n[h2]Rating: ★★★★☆ (Excellent)[/h2]",

Review for the game as a returnee:\n\nThe game is truly the jianghu experience that you're looking for if you're a wuxia enthusiast. So much Techniques, Characters, Alternate routes, Higher Leveled enemies, and Multiple Sects. I loved this game when I first played it as it was my gateway to wuxia type games and will forever hold a place in my dao heart.\n\nSo much build variety, enjoyable soundtrack, wide roster of characters, good world building, insane replay value, Fun Gameplay, Flashy moves, and Pets. It's especially fun navigating through the world and looking for that Legendary manual, Meeting Old Masters, Fateful Encounters, Hidden treasures, and so much more.\n\nNow for the sad part, this game has a lot of issues. From Translation, Forced Softlocks, Breaking Immersion, Loading Screens, and Couplets that were annoying and forced me to reset a lot without a guide. There's also the fact that homestead is quite unbalanced as it makes the game really easy, I genuinely think they made a mistake on that one, it felt unfair that only your characters got the highest level martial arts because of that gimmick making the enemies weak. I also think this game is heavily favored towards solo play after you start getting the achievement bonuses. It takes so much time when playing as a team because you have to level all of them and finishing a run with solo is just so much quicker with how broken the scaling is in this game. Most of these are pretty minor and only slightly affect my rating.\n\nFinally, this game is pretty much a roguelite as in you would need to sacrifice some runs to make your character stronger in the next playthrough (not necessary for getting the best endings if you're good enough). Overall, a 7/10, I wish I could formulate my review better but it's hard as a returnee my memories are no longer fresh :(",

That is an optional part of the game though- I think it wasn't until like my 4th run through the game that I ran into that. \n\nIt's worth getting.

There are multiple endings and you can freely roleplay as anything you wish within the wuxia style RPG\r\n\r\nthe cons however is the translation is rather horrible, the couplets especially since it requires you to not only read wuxia novels but maybe actual Analect of Confucious, hahahahha. \r\n\r\nAnother nitpick might be guides. Indeed you are sooo recommended to read guides (a lot actually) to achieve perfect ending or ending you want. Some part of the game requires you to read no guides at all, but many nice endings requires to read guides extensively (e.g. Marshall Ye endings) \r\n\r\nThere are tropes commonly found in cultivation novels that you will find throughout the games (e.g. cocky young master, or the infamous \"courting death\" phrase). However, this also extends to how the story progress (e.g. the Old man Sect story line) which many of non-wuxia readers find weird or unpleasant\r\n\r\nTRDR;;\r\n\r\nGood game, good wuxia tropes. You may need to have experience in reading wuxia novels to digest some of contents but otherwise good game. and it is so cheap.",

Hero's Adventure: Road to Passion is a TREASURE!  The stories in it are really well made, the power scaling is lore appropriate. It has great mechanics, and this is one of those rare games where you feel like you've been transported into a wuxia novel. So as just a game I give it a solid 9/10 as a 10/10 would mean it is perfect, and while it is great it can't claim perfection as no game can. As a Wuxia game you're getting a 9.9/10. Can it be done better? Of course perhaps it can be, but so far none have!",

      "review": "[h1]Hero’s Adventure: Road to Passion – Freedom Woven into Destiny[/h1]\n\n[h2]World & Atmosphere: A Living Tapestry of the East[/h2]\nHero’s Adventure is not just a story—it’s a journey through the soul of a world that feels ancient, poetic, and alive. The lands you travel are vast and boundless, filled with hidden sects, rival clans, and wandering heroes each chasing their own meaning. The air hums with the quiet power of cultivation, the philosophy of growth and balance shaping every path you take. It is a world that invites you not to follow, but to choose—to craft your own legend within its living, breathing expanse.\n\n[h2]Freedom & Choice: The Essence of Adventure[/h2]\nWhat truly defines Hero’s Adventure is its boundless freedom. Every decision branches into a new story, every choice ripples through your fate. You can walk the path of a righteous sect disciple, a cunning wanderer, a loyal companion—or something entirely your own. Romance, rivalry, friendship, betrayal—each is yours to shape. With dozens of endings and countless ways to play, no two journeys ever feel the same. It is not a game that tells you who to be—it asks you to discover that for yourself.\n\n[h2]Gameplay & Variety: Mastery through Expression[/h2]\nThe world offers more than ten unique weapon styles, each transforming how you approach battle and exploration. The freedom of combat mirrors the freedom of choice; whether you wield a swift sword or a heavy staff, each style feels distinct and rewarding. The replay value is immense—not just because of mechanics, but because you are different every time you return.\n\n[h2]Community & Growth: A Journey Shared[/h2]\nThough the English translation stumbles at times, the heart of the story still shines through—and it grows stronger every day, thanks to passionate fans and volunteer translators. The community surrounding the game is a reflection of its world: warm, dedicated, and eager to help new travelers find their way. Detailed guides, advice, and genuine support make this adventure feel like a shared pilgrimage rather than a solitary one.\n\n[h2]Final Reflection: A Cultivation of the Spirit[/h2]\nHero’s Adventure: Road to Passion is not merely played—it is lived. It embodies the essence of the cultivation genre: perseverance, choice, transformation. In its vastness, you find freedom; in its challenges, purpose. Despite its imperfections, it stands as one of the most open, personal, and heartfelt RPGs.\n\nFor those who seek meaning, growth, and a world that rewards curiosity, this is a journey worth taking—a path where passion truly becomes destiny.\n\n[h2]Rating: ★★★★☆ (Excellent)[/h2]",

But after investing around 11 hours into the game, I can say the translation is not much of an issue. Only a few times did I see non translated Chinese characters in the text and the grammar seems also fine overall. But keep in mind, that the English translation is a community project.\n\nOn the other hand, the localization is a big issue.

Especially as there is close to no recorded history of that time period, which may or may not be related to the cultural revolution where books and their owners were relocated en masse into the “shadow realm.”\nAnyhow, to immerse the player, the decision was made to also use the old Chinese terms for the time, day, and money. For example, the day was divided into the twelve zodiacs, and a short tutorial message will inform you about the details when you start a playthrough, but I forgot almost everything shortly after. Resulting in the situation that I can only estimate the current in-game time and have no idea how much money I have (bigger numbers are better).\n\nYou will also have to get used to cheat sheets and/or look up guides if you want to have an efficient playthrough, as the game is set up to be played many times.

You will regularly encounter events that will “fail” or play out non-optimally, as you lack the skills or resources to influence them in any way.\n\nI chose to play this game blind and did not read any guides, only looked up the answers for some riddles, and had a few issues due to “grind.” At first I filled out my party with every NPC I could, but failed to notice that there are several kinds of XP, engagement, and skill use. Engagement XP levels you up and increases your health and mana (I think). But skills only level with use, so if you have a big party, the characters have less chance to use them. Often your player character is forced to engage in solo fights, which can be challenging if your protagonist is “underleveled.” To mitigate, I reduced my party to 3 characters max, which helped a lot. But the combat turned tedious as a result, especially with many enemies. Thankfully there is an auto-combat option and a combat speed setting; unfortunately, changing the speed to 2x or 4x did nothing. So I set the game to auto-combat and just tabbed out and browsed Reddit or something, only to check in every few minutes to see if the combat was resolved. But then I asked myself why play the game at all, if I am forced to ignore a major part of it.\n\nThere are also many mods in the Steam Workshop, but seemingly 99% of those are in Chinese, and they will disable the inheritance system and achievements.

Engagement XP levels you up and increases your health and mana (I think). But skills only level with use, so if you have a big party, the characters have less chance to use them.

Thankfully there is an auto-combat option and a combat speed setting; unfortunately, changing the speed to 2x or 4x did nothing. So I set the game to auto-combat and just tabbed out and browsed Reddit or something, only to check in every few minutes to see if the combat was resolved.

Only a few times did I see non translated Chinese characters in the text and the grammar seems also fine overall.

For example, the day was divided into the twelve zodiacs, and a short tutorial message will inform you about the details when you start a playthrough, but I forgot almost everything shortly after. Resulting in the situation that I can only estimate the current in-game time and have no idea how much money I have (bigger numbers are better).\n\nYou will also have to get used to cheat sheets and/or look up guides if you want to have an efficient playthrough, as the game is set up to be played many times. There is also some kind of inheritance system in place for skills and traits, but I am not far enough to speak about it. You will regularly encounter events that will “fail” or play out non-optimally, as you lack the skills or resources to influence them in any way.\n\nI chose to play this game blind and did not read any guides, only looked up the answers for some riddles, and had a few issues due to “grind.” At first I filled out my party with every NPC I could, but failed to notice that there are several kinds of XP, engagement, and skill use. Engagement XP levels you up and increases your health and mana (I think). But skills only level with use, so if you have a big party, the characters have less chance to use them. Often your player character is forced to engage in solo fights, which can be challenging if your protagonist is “underleveled.” To mitigate, I reduced my party to 3 characters max, which helped a lot. But the combat turned tedious as a result, especially with many enemies. Thankfully there is an auto-combat option and a combat speed setting; unfortunately, changing the speed to 2x or 4x did nothing. So I set the game to auto-combat and just tabbed out and browsed Reddit or something, only to check in every few minutes to see if the combat was resolved. But then I asked myself why play the game at all, if I am forced to ignore a major part of it.\n\nThere are also many mods in the Steam Workshop, but seemingly 99% of those are in Chinese, and they will disable the inheritance system and achievements. So I also did not bother wiuth them as well.\n\nIn summary, this is a very decent indie game, which will be greatly enjoyed by the target demographic. But to me it is too flawed to recommend it.",

For example, the day was divided into the twelve zodiacs, and a short tutorial message will inform you about the details when you start a playthrough, but I forgot almost everything shortly after. Resulting in the situation that I can only estimate the current in-game time and have no idea how much money I have (bigger numbers are better).\n\nYou will also have to get used to cheat sheets and/or look up guides if you want to have an efficient playthrough, as the game is set up to be played many times.

You will regularly encounter events that will “fail” or play out non-optimally, as you lack the skills or resources to influence them in any way.\n\nI chose to play this game blind and did not read any guides, only looked up the answers for some riddles, and had a few issues due to “grind.” At first I filled out my party with every NPC I could, but failed to notice that there are several kinds of XP, engagement, and skill use. Engagement XP levels you up and increases your health and mana (I think). But skills only level with use, so if you have a big party, the characters have less chance to use them. Often your player character is forced to engage in solo fights, which can be challenging if your protagonist is “underleveled.” To mitigate, I reduced my party to 3 characters max, which helped a lot. But the combat turned tedious as a result, especially with many enemies. Thankfully there is an auto-combat option and a combat speed setting; unfortunately, changing the speed to 2x or 4x did nothing. So I set the game to auto-combat and just tabbed out and browsed Reddit or something, only to check in every few minutes to see if the combat was resolved. But then I asked myself why play the game at all, if I am forced to ignore a major part of it.\n\nThere are also many mods in the Steam Workshop, but seemingly 99% of those are in Chinese, and they will disable the inheritance system and achievements.

Resulting in the situation that I can only estimate the current in-game time and have no idea how much money I have (bigger numbers are better).\n\nYou will also have to get used to cheat sheets and/or look up guides if you want to have an efficient playthrough, as the game is set up to be played many times. There is also some kind of inheritance system in place for skills and traits, but I am not far enough to speak about it. You will regularly encounter events that will “fail” or play out non-optimally, as you lack the skills or resources to influence them in any way.\n\nI chose to play this game blind and did not read any guides, only looked up the answers for some riddles, and had a few issues due to “grind.” At first I filled out my party with every NPC I could, but failed to notice that there are several kinds of XP, engagement, and skill use. Engagement XP levels you up and increases your health and mana (I think). But skills only level with use, so if you have a big party, the characters have less chance to use them. Often your player character is forced to engage in solo fights, which can be challenging if your protagonist is “underleveled.” To mitigate, I reduced my party to 3 characters max, which helped a lot. But the combat turned tedious as a result, especially with many enemies. Thankfully there is an auto-combat option and a combat speed setting; unfortunately, changing the speed to 2x or 4x did nothing. So I set the game to auto-combat and just tabbed out and browsed Reddit or something, only to check in every few minutes to see if the combat was resolved. But then I asked myself why play the game at all, if I am forced to ignore a major part of it.\n\nThere are also many mods in the Steam Workshop, but seemingly 99% of those are in Chinese, and they will disable the inheritance system and achievements. So I also did not bother wiuth them as well.\n\nIn summary, this is a very decent indie game, which will be greatly enjoyed by the target demographic. But to me it is too flawed to recommend it.",

In principle. \nI will definitely be back to play it more in the future, provided the translation improves.\n\nI perhaps was spoiled by playing Wandering Sword first, in it's 2025 state of game.\nThe translations in Hero's Adventure really are terrible in places.  You can find it slapstick and funny, but it's adding another whole level of complexity and complication to an already oldschool, find your own path, style of RPG.\n\nMC is a goofy idiot, regardless of how you try to play him.\nThere's quite a few poems / literary lore / complex storytelling beats that are just completely ruined by terrible translations.\n\nIf they get their translations sorted (honestly chat GPT would do better than a lot of this), then I'll be back.\nHuge promise.  Great game if you read CN.\n\nIf you have to follow a guide, in order to make it through your first playthrough, constantly baffled for where to go, unable to work out where to find simple recipes for upgrading gear or weapons? it needs work, and I think the improved EN translation would make up for a lot of what's missing.",

Only a few times did I see non translated Chinese characters in the text and the grammar seems also fine overall. But keep in mind, that the English translation is a community project.\n\nOn the other hand, the localization is a big issue.
