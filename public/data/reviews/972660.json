It just happens, and you restart or move on. Here, you have to CHOOSE to let them go. To let yourself go. And god, I've never done anything tougher. How do you leave a world you've spent forty, fifty hours in go? How do you say, \"Well, I guess this is it?\" This game asks that question. It forces you to let your friends leave, after truly learning about them and loving them, because it's what they want. It's what's best.\r\n\r\nI think, going forward, my life is forever changed. I get attached to characters so easily, and for a while, I refused to finish my final task. How could I? But, well. I did. And I think that now, maybe it'll become a little easier to let others go. Because I've had to do it, and I've come out alright.\r\n\r\nIf there's one thing I could say to anyone thinking about playing this game... DO IT. Sink hours into it. Complete every quest, every shenanigan, every achievement. Let yourself love the characters, and grapple with letting them go. I think the morals and lessons from this game is one everyone needs to hear.\r\n\r\nTo Thunder Lotus, thank you for making this game, and allowing us all a safe space to learn to process grief.",

      "review": "I love this game. \n\nIt´s incredibelly unique in the themes it is portraying, the artstyle, and the game mechanics. I have never played a game like this. I found it when I was looking for a game similar Stardew Valley to loose myself in during a difficult time, and had no idea that my now favorite game ever would help me make peace with the loss and allow me to process my grief in such a gentle manner. This game is the definiton of bittersweet, in the best way. It shows death in all its variations, from both the perspective of the dying and the ones left behind. You could almost forget the unsettling truth of life, that is unevitable, with how serene and beautiful the enviroments and sound design are, but the game has a very realistic way of bringing the aching reality out again. I have never seen death and grief materialized this perfectly. With the amount of diverse and heartbreaking stories, chances are you will find one or more that particularly resonate with you. And it will transform your  experience of the game, I can promise you that. You are the exception if you did not cry during this game. It is a part of its beauty, embrace it ♡\n\nI would recommend this game to everyone. If you do decide to play it, prepare to have a blast with both hilarious and heartwrenching dialogues. This game will keep you on your toes. You can also expect challanging platformer puzzles and minigames. But also a lot of therapeutic, soothing, liminal \"in between\". The pacing might be out of the ordinary for you, but please, give it a chance. You will grow used to it, fond of it even, and it will be worth it!\n\nMost of all, I just hope that you end up as sucked in and enjoy this extraordinary story, with an equally impressive aesthetic experience, as much as I did. These characters will stay with me forever. Thank you, Thunder Lotus! \n\nPs. I wrote one of my seminar works about how this game tackeled the themes of death and loss, not kidding. This game changed me. And the music has been on repeat for me since.\n\nPps. I will be playing any new game that Thunder Lotus releases. You´ll have a loyal supporter in me, Thuder Lotus, until Stella send me off too ♡",

I first learned of this game through a friend I have lost contact with and man has this game just made that loss hurt so much more. But at the same time it has comforted me. \n\nThis game is perfect in it's imperfections. You know how big corporations water everything down in order to try to appeal to everyone? It's fair to call this game the opposite approach to the same goal. You will not like some of the spirits you encounter and that's just fine. They weren't made for you. A great example of this is Daria. To those she isn't made for at best she's a confusing character and at worst she's just in the game as the token mental health character. But allow me to inform you that is not the case at all. She was made for people like me. And man does she comfort me. Rather than try to make everything appeal to everyone this game instead makes specific parts of it built for specific groups of people.\n\nThis game is genre breaking. No, not in the traditional sense of the word. I play FPS, rougelike, strategy games! Yet here I am with my favorite game being an emotional hotel manager game. It just, hits differently.\n\nSpiritfarer is my favorite game. Not because it is perfect in every aspect. I hate Bruce and Mickey. But because the parts that do work for me hit me harder than any other media. Daria is my favorite character and if you decide to buy and then play through the game to see what I'm talking about chances are high that you won't like Daria. But along the way there will be another spirit that speaks to you emotionally. Don't be afraid to just sit in your chair or on the coach to just think about what you just witnessed what you were just told. A decent portion of your playtime can and should be you staring at the monitor or TV crying as you process what just happened. \n\nSpiritfarer doesn't shine when you are playing the game. Spiritfarer truly shines when you are laying on your bed, the coach, the floor letting the game run while you try to make sense of what you were just told. The more you are willing to put into it the more it will give you. Cannot recommend it enough. I look forward to seeing your reason why it's your favorite game. Will it be Daria? Summer? maybe you can explain to me how Bruce and Mickey affected you. Please do come back and tell me in the event you decide buy this amazing game.",

Spent so much time not wanting to end the game, so did a fairly completionist-ish run.\n\nThere were definitely some moments we got a bit stuck and frustrated from how grindy the game got, but we just put it away for a while and came back later. This game isn't designed to be completed in a single setting, just a bit every now and then, and it feels best to take it at a slow pace.\n\nIt's a beautiful game. A very sad one, but also a cozy one. Definitely one of the best couch co-op games I have ever played, but be prepared to cry several times. Especially Stanley and Jackie hit me hard.\n\nBug sidenote:\nOnly really ran into a single annoying bug: hugging spirits (the blue coloured ones) as Daffodil can lock up the game for player 2 (but this is quite minor and you can just save and quit and reload with 0 progress loss).",

It just sucks you in, really. For me personally it helps that I like both platformers and management/farming sims (my two favourite genres, besides interactive fiction in any sense, which this game ALSO has). I guess I've been speedrunning the process a little, given I've mostly just - kept progressing further and further until now, where I'm at what? Probably somewhere around 80% completion as it stands. I think I only have three more spirits left to ferry away. But it's genuinely such a gem of a game. I love how the shrines and the unlockable abilities can unlock a ton of new parts of specific places you've already been to. Like, I like that kind of replayability. I like returning to places in order to experience them differently now. I assume a lot of people have already commented how the characters are great and that the stories that are embedded into this are amazing. They are correct. I've gotten teary eyed multiple times and it takes skill to actually make me cry. In the sense that I feel a lot of things in general, but oftentimes need more exposure to that in order to truly get to tears. And given I'd consider the balance of story vs gameplay a 40-60 split in this game right? It's truly impressive that I've actually been a little inconsolable about certain characters moving on. I am afraid I'd need to actually progress until the end to fully understand the greater picture BUT. Man is it such a good game. Please do not be like me and genuinely take your time with it. Just enjoy the ride, y'know. I'm enjoying it but I wish I didn't rush through quests to see how the story plays out. The story is written so that you take your time with it.

Everything about it, from the art style to the music to the writing and narrative to the exploration, management, upgrading and platforming aspects to the sheer amount of detail in every single part of this world and story to the emotional gut punch it packs... I'd honestly go so far as to call the game perfect.\n\nIt made me cry on probably fifteen different occasions and that is a huge compliment. The way the characters are written make them so tangible and letting go of them feels very cleansing.\n\nThis game is challenging at times, but at other times purely relaxing, and it is intentionally slow in certain moments, which really allows you to reflect and feel some kind of peace. It's extremely comforting.\n\nThere is exactly one achievement you cannot get on a single playthrough, and I'm so not even mad about it because it gave me an excuse to start a new file on this masterpiece immediately after completing it. I wouldn't have known what to do with myself otherwise.\n\nGive this game a try. You won't regret it.",

I played it every night until I got tired or frustrated (normally at not knowing how to get things before I had stuff unlocked). The game does give you the hints at how the storyline/progress needs to go through the tasks/missions. At the beginning of the game, I found the places I couldn't reach and the things I couldn't get to quite annoying but as I progressed it did make sense and can see why the developers did it that way.\n\nThe characters make you feel so many emotions. There is so much heart in the characters that I genuinely got sad saying goodbye to them or genuinely got annoyed at them. I also liked how the collections were not overloaded with things you didn't need or barely used, all stuff you came across mostly naturally during gameplay.\n\nThe only part I didn't like is how some levels can be hard to control (on PC) like Daria's levels made me rage quit too many times and some of the zipwires in the mines. I'm not sure how this can be improved on but they were frustrating when the rest of the game is quite easy.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend playing this.",

This game puts the player in the shoes of \"Stella\" - a young girl who becomes the new Charon for spirits, having to give them closure before eventually sending them through the Evergate (basically death for spirits).\n\n[h2] Price/replay value [/h2]\nHorrible - Bad - [u] Decent [/u] - Good - Amazing\n\n[h2] Achievement hunting [/h2]\nAll achievements can be gotten within 1 run (assuming a reload for sealed/closed lips) - none are particularly challenging, but some can be missed quite easily e.g.; [i] The Happy Dance.[/i] With proper planning this shouldn't be an issue however.\n\n[h2] Pros/cons [/h2]\n[b] Pros [/b]\n[list]\n[*]Amazing writing with some very realistic characters\n[*]Good graphics and amazing soundtrack\n[*]Very casual\n[/list]\n\n[b] Cons [/b]\n[list]\n[*]Starts out [i] extremely [/i] slow with very little to do\n[*]Incredibly grindy sections during mid/late game\n[*]Spirit pathfinding is a mess \n[/list]\n\n[h2] Overall opinion [/h2]\nSpiritfarer is not a perfect game. \nThat said, I still enjoyed it a lot. The game at first really gave me the \"ick\" if you will, making me consider putting it down due to the tedious early game. After you chew through the tough skin that is the early game though, you'll be blessed with a deliciously juicy game that offers a ton of interesting characters and fun dialogue. From those who yearn to die, to those who fear what the Everdoor might behold, there's a bit of everything. Sadly I can't go into depth without spoiling that though so...\n\nThe gameplay, whilst quite repetitive, does eventually start to snap into place and offers a relaxing, and smooth experience. There's fishing, gardening, woodsawing... All having little minigames that you get to learn and get better at, making your resource production increase alongside your skill level. \nThe main traversal is via a map which simply requires choosing a location and you'll ship automatically go there. Whilst the controls could've used a bit more depth, it overall feels fine and responsive. The game also often does encourage going to unknown dark spots of the map so the player can find secret or obscure islands and treasures.\n\n\n[h2] tldr; [/h2]\nVery laid back, with a beautiful story.\n\n[h2] Should you buy it? [/h2] \nGo for it if you prefer story driven games. If you only care about gameplay, then this isn't for you.",

      "review": "TL;DR - The game starts off interesting enough to pull your attention -- then drops the ball as the game progresses with poorly thought out resource management, and tedious repetition for gameplay length padding.\n\nThe majority of negative reviews hit this one on the mark. Someone came up with an okay story idea, but didn't have a well thought out plan of how to convert that into a long gameplay experience.\n\nThe resource management in the game is ridiculous, and only gets more tedious as the game progresses. There is an excessive amount of backtracking that is made more cumbersome by not being able to custom mark the map for things like abilities needed for certain areas or goals not yet met. There are a good amount of fast travel points, but it still does not offset the need to write down or remember special attributes about each island that you may have to revisit later due to inaccessible areas.\n\nThe gameplay loop starts to get stale after the first couple of completions as the loop does not really change much as you progress further into the story. You get some fetch quests, upgrade homes, then turn them in. The character stories are okay, but there's not too much depth to the characters themselves to pull you into what ails them.\n\nEventually you kind of just stop caring at all what they have to say. You become a dead husk inside from the tedium. As a consequence of this, you kind of start speeding through the dialog so you can take their next request, grind the necessary resources, and then send them on their way -- Spiritfarer: Jaded Edition.\n\nThe hand drawn art is well done, and the character design is neat. Music helps pass the time in game, but it isn't something that will get stuck in your head. Player control is solid, and game customization like display options and control mapping is done well.\n\nThis game was one that I was going to think was okay if you got it on sale. However, after putting more and more time into it to see what direction the game takes after you sink a good chunk of time into it, I really just ended up wishing I hadn't wasted the time I had already put into it.",

      "review": "Devs seem to have struck gold with a certain audience that eats this up writing essays about how the stories made them cry their eyes out, without a single mention of the plethora of flaws this game has. For me, after giving it two chances, 10 hours of playtime each, I can confidently say that there are way too many things wrong with the actual gameplay for me to recommend this game. I continued playing where I stopped last year, and a couple hours in it became clear again why I got tired of playing this game:\n\nSpiritfarer as a videogame is basically tedium in fancy clothes, looks and sounds good but when it comes to the actual gameplay elements? Good Lord what were they thinking... Every single task takes an eternity and has to be repeated in full hundreds of times throughout a playthrough, from the stale minigames to the long and slow animations, farming, mining, cutting trees, processing resources, it all takes such an insanely long time that I really can't be bothered anymore. Each and every single item has to be added one by one to boot, there is no slider or \"add max\" button, nothing, if you want to process 50 logs of wood, guess what? You're pressing that \"add\" button 50 freakin times... only to then manually saw each individual piece during a repetitive mini game. For the last 3 hours in this game I've just constantly been asking myself \"why did they not let players unlock \"auto\" mode after repeating the manual process a set number of times?\", it really, really feels like playtime was padded in the worst way possible, making you repeat tedious needless actions ad nauseam.\n\nTo expand on this a bit further: Take planting crops for example. You build a garden which has 3 plots of land, you put a seed in every plot, every single time you plant a seed, an animation plays. Then you need to water each individual plot separately because why not, and of course another slow animation plays. You'd think that'd be that, now it's waiting time! But nahh, you'll need to water them AGAIN before the plants mature. And that's just a single garden lmao... You could have 4 gardens and 4 fields (or, God forbid, even more), that's 24 plots of land, yeah, it gets insanely tedious. All of this would have been forgiven if you could just upgrade your buildings to maybe automatically water your plants, but no, you'll be doing it manually for literally dozens of hours, hundreds perhaps thousands of times. And that's just your plants, you want to milk cows? Watch a slow milking animation, then watch an animation of the cow lying down, because you can't feed the cow until it finishes the animation, and then you feed the cow or it won't produce milk again over time. Picking apples from your tree? Yeah, watch your character slowly touch the tree until the apples fall off. I mean, what are we doing here, this isn't a chill game, this is watching paint dry almost taken literally.\n\nOn top of all of this, progression is literally just fetch quest after fetch quest, the game constantly sends you back and forth to islands across the map that are all filled with tall buildings that you can enter, but that don't contain a single thing, you can climb them from the inside, but there's no purpose, it's annoying, it's frustrating, it makes me feel like my time is being intentionally wasted. Traversing the map is painfully slow for most of the playthrough as well, and if you pass through an optional event to collect resources, your boat will stop in it's track without exceptions and you'll have to first interact with an NPC on your ship in order to skip the event. Why, just why?...\n\nThere's more small annoyances all over, like your map being inaccessible at night because you can't sail your ship after dark. Ok, but why am I being prevented from seeing the map and planning where I want to sail the next day? It just doesn't make any sense at all, like many things in Spiritfarer.\n\nI'll probably try to finish my run but after 20 hours I am completely and utterly done with the tedious nature of every single repetitive task, and it looks like I'm not even halfway done with the story, so that's promising. It will take some serious surprises to make me change my opinion on this one, not recommended for people who are looking for actual fun gameplay, recommended for people who get emotional easily and have never played an actually fun and engaging resource management game I guess?",

It reminds me of a mobile game you can't put down but leaves you feeling like it was an absolute waste of time afterwards. If I had to describe it with one word, it would be 'stretched'. Everything in this game is stretched ad nauseam.\nThe mini games get worse (!) over time. How is this even possible? The fishing and planting was ok imo (could have developed in a better way to be not that wearing, but well) but what the hell was the Smithy? First you need to simply wait for it to be done, then you need to craft it in an absolutely unenjoyable way. And you can't really do something between the waiting and the crafting 'cause you only have to wait up to ~30 seconds so it's not worth to do something else. It's just boring and time consuming. Like everything else in the game.\nI don't really understand why I only get one onion out of my onion plant. I need to buy seeds, I need to plant them, I need to water them, I need to wait, I need to harvest them and that all for one single onion. Why? \nI also really disliked the mini games to get the lightning in a bottle and the nebula fibre and all the other ones. I mean, the character moves smooth and that's kinda fun, but the ladders. I absolutely despise all the ladders on the boat. Every time I jump, my character ends up hanging on a ladder, every time I move, everytime I try to fall down, boom – stuck on a ladder. It's incredible annoying.\n[spoiler]Eventually you get the dash, but it has a cooldown. Why does this ability have a cooldown? For what reason? It's not as if there are any enemies in the game. Yeah, you would get ridiculous mobility, but isn't that kinda the point? On top of that it shares the cooldown with the Light Burst ability. Just great.\nThe XP potion event is the worst imo. You're just standing there waiting for the purple „enemies“ to appear which you can only kill with the Light Burst, but the Light Burst has a cooldown that's longer than the enemies stay. So if two purple enemies spawn simultaneously, you can just kill one of them, therefore get one potion, and there is not a single thing you can do about it. Funny thing when the event itself isn't spammable and you have to wait ingame time to do it again. What a feature![/spoiler]\nIt's nice that there is a teleportation system, but I ended up ignoring it 'cause it started feeling like another waste of time. Why do I have to sail to the teleportation point to teleport? Yeah, it only takes a few seconds, but I can't really do something in that time. And I need to get in my cabine to set sail, I need to talk to Alex, I need to get in my cabine again to choose my final destination. There are just so many unnecessary steps in between. That's fine in the beginning, but if you have to do it again and again it wears you down.\nThe quests are kinda … meh. The progression is all over the place. [spoiler]E.g. Jackie. He has a pager to contact me. And he contacts me instantly I get back on my boat. Why? I just talked to him, give this guy a little time ffs.[/spoiler]\nAnother problem I had with the game – why can't I sail at night? There is not a single reason not to. The game tells you 'it's too dangerous'. But what should happen? It's just another tool to stretch the game. You can't even access your map to look where you wanna go next or where you missed something. Just annoying, annoying, annoying.\nThen you can't choose the amount of wood you wanna saw, the amount of coal you wanna use in the Foundry, etc. You have to manually transfer every single piece of wood, every single piece of coal. And it goes up to 50. And of course you have to saw every single piece of wood afterwards yourself. So that's fun.\nInteracting with the characters is also a pain in the ass most of the time. I can't count how often I wanted to give Buck something to eat only for him to dump some new info on me and immediately fly across the boat. Wow. So now I have to find him again? On my big ass Fearless Whale without any indicator of where to look for him? Nice.\nBut Mickey and Bruce were the worst. Every time you wanna talk to them, Bruce has to turn Mickey around if you're standing on the wrong side, then Bruce has to fly on Mickey's nose cause otherwise they obviously cannot talk to you. It just takes ages. And then they are so damn demanding about their food. But sorry, I don't know the ingredients for every dish in my inventory, so after a while I just didn't bother to feed them anymore.\n\nI don't have much to say about the story. I lost interest after a few hours cause the gameplay was so flat and stressful at the same time. There's one thing I have to give the game credit for – you always have something to do. It might not be the most interesting thing, but you can always go fishing, try to cook a new meal, plant, water, feed your animals, shear your sheep, play your plants some music, travel somewhere, progress this quest, hug that spirit, … The list goes on. Kinda a wild mix of a slow, emotional story, yet hectic gameplay. Didn't work for me. I skimmed and skipped through most of the dialogue. But I don't think the story would've been my cup of tea anyway. [spoiler]I don't really like that Stella is presented as Charon's heir, but all of the spirits she takes care of are connected to her in one way or another. The game makes it pretty clear from the beginning that it's Stella's journey to the Everdoor and not the tale of a new ferryman for the dead (which I would've been more interested in tbh). Which is why it doesn't make sense that she's supposed to be a new Charon.[/spoiler]\nThe dynamic between Stella and the spirits was a little bit too familiar for my liking. I mean, she is new, but everyone knows her. Didn't really feel right for me. (I know, it makes sense storywise, but idk)\nI must admit the game is visually stunning. The character designs are great, the Everydoor looks phenomenal, the idea of creating new character-based signs of the zodiac is fantastic. But in the end I only had „real“ fun for roughly the first 3 hours, after that it was a very tedious (and addictive) experience. I can't bring myself to recommend this.",

      "review": "TL;DR - The game starts off interesting enough to pull your attention -- then drops the ball as the game progresses with poorly thought out resource management, and tedious repetition for gameplay length padding.\n\nThe majority of negative reviews hit this one on the mark. Someone came up with an okay story idea, but didn't have a well thought out plan of how to convert that into a long gameplay experience.\n\nThe resource management in the game is ridiculous, and only gets more tedious as the game progresses. There is an excessive amount of backtracking that is made more cumbersome by not being able to custom mark the map for things like abilities needed for certain areas or goals not yet met. There are a good amount of fast travel points, but it still does not offset the need to write down or remember special attributes about each island that you may have to revisit later due to inaccessible areas.\n\nThe gameplay loop starts to get stale after the first couple of completions as the loop does not really change much as you progress further into the story. You get some fetch quests, upgrade homes, then turn them in. The character stories are okay, but there's not too much depth to the characters themselves to pull you into what ails them.\n\nEventually you kind of just stop caring at all what they have to say. You become a dead husk inside from the tedium. As a consequence of this, you kind of start speeding through the dialog so you can take their next request, grind the necessary resources, and then send them on their way -- Spiritfarer: Jaded Edition.\n\nThe hand drawn art is well done, and the character design is neat. Music helps pass the time in game, but it isn't something that will get stuck in your head. Player control is solid, and game customization like display options and control mapping is done well.\n\nThis game was one that I was going to think was okay if you got it on sale. However, after putting more and more time into it to see what direction the game takes after you sink a good chunk of time into it, I really just ended up wishing I hadn't wasted the time I had already put into it.",

      "review": "Devs seem to have struck gold with a certain audience that eats this up writing essays about how the stories made them cry their eyes out, without a single mention of the plethora of flaws this game has. For me, after giving it two chances, 10 hours of playtime each, I can confidently say that there are way too many things wrong with the actual gameplay for me to recommend this game. I continued playing where I stopped last year, and a couple hours in it became clear again why I got tired of playing this game:\n\nSpiritfarer as a videogame is basically tedium in fancy clothes, looks and sounds good but when it comes to the actual gameplay elements? Good Lord what were they thinking... Every single task takes an eternity and has to be repeated in full hundreds of times throughout a playthrough, from the stale minigames to the long and slow animations, farming, mining, cutting trees, processing resources, it all takes such an insanely long time that I really can't be bothered anymore. Each and every single item has to be added one by one to boot, there is no slider or \"add max\" button, nothing, if you want to process 50 logs of wood, guess what? You're pressing that \"add\" button 50 freakin times... only to then manually saw each individual piece during a repetitive mini game. For the last 3 hours in this game I've just constantly been asking myself \"why did they not let players unlock \"auto\" mode after repeating the manual process a set number of times?\", it really, really feels like playtime was padded in the worst way possible, making you repeat tedious needless actions ad nauseam.\n\nTo expand on this a bit further: Take planting crops for example. You build a garden which has 3 plots of land, you put a seed in every plot, every single time you plant a seed, an animation plays. Then you need to water each individual plot separately because why not, and of course another slow animation plays. You'd think that'd be that, now it's waiting time!

Which is why it doesn't make sense that she's supposed to be a new Charon.[/spoiler]\nThe dynamic between Stella and the spirits was a little bit too familiar for my liking. I mean, she is new, but everyone knows her. Didn't really feel right for me. (I know, it makes sense storywise, but idk)\nI must admit the game is visually stunning.

      "review": "Devs seem to have struck gold with a certain audience that eats this up writing essays about how the stories made them cry their eyes out, without a single mention of the plethora of flaws this game has. For me, after giving it two chances, 10 hours of playtime each, I can confidently say that there are way too many things wrong with the actual gameplay for me to recommend this game. I continued playing where I stopped last year, and a couple hours in it became clear again why I got tired of playing this game:\n\nSpiritfarer as a videogame is basically tedium in fancy clothes, looks and sounds good but when it comes to the actual gameplay elements? Good Lord what were they thinking... Every single task takes an eternity and has to be repeated in full hundreds of times throughout a playthrough, from the stale minigames to the long and slow animations, farming, mining, cutting trees, processing resources, it all takes such an insanely long time that I really can't be bothered anymore. Each and every single item has to be added one by one to boot, there is no slider or \"add max\" button, nothing, if you want to process 50 logs of wood, guess what? You're pressing that \"add\" button 50 freakin times... only to then manually saw each individual piece during a repetitive mini game. For the last 3 hours in this game I've just constantly been asking myself \"why did they not let players unlock \"auto\" mode after repeating the manual process a set number of times?\", it really, really feels like playtime was padded in the worst way possible, making you repeat tedious needless actions ad nauseam.\n\nTo expand on this a bit further: Take planting crops for example. You build a garden which has 3 plots of land, you put a seed in every plot, every single time you plant a seed, an animation plays. Then you need to water each individual plot separately because why not, and of course another slow animation plays. You'd think that'd be that, now it's waiting time! But nahh, you'll need to water them AGAIN before the plants mature. And that's just a single garden lmao... You could have 4 gardens and 4 fields (or, God forbid, even more), that's 24 plots of land, yeah, it gets insanely tedious. All of this would have been forgiven if you could just upgrade your buildings to maybe automatically water your plants, but no, you'll be doing it manually for literally dozens of hours, hundreds perhaps thousands of times. And that's just your plants, you want to milk cows? Watch a slow milking animation, then watch an animation of the cow lying down, because you can't feed the cow until it finishes the animation, and then you feed the cow or it won't produce milk again over time. Picking apples from your tree? Yeah, watch your character slowly touch the tree until the apples fall off. I mean, what are we doing here, this isn't a chill game, this is watching paint dry almost taken literally.\n\nOn top of all of this, progression is literally just fetch quest after fetch quest, the game constantly sends you back and forth to islands across the map that are all filled with tall buildings that you can enter, but that don't contain a single thing, you can climb them from the inside, but there's no purpose, it's annoying, it's frustrating, it makes me feel like my time is being intentionally wasted. Traversing the map is painfully slow for most of the playthrough as well, and if you pass through an optional event to collect resources, your boat will stop in it's track without exceptions and you'll have to first interact with an NPC on your ship in order to skip the event. Why, just why?...\n\nThere's more small annoyances all over, like your map being inaccessible at night because you can't sail your ship after dark. Ok, but why am I being prevented from seeing the map and planning where I want to sail the next day? It just doesn't make any sense at all, like many things in Spiritfarer.\n\nI'll probably try to finish my run but after 20 hours I am completely and utterly done with the tedious nature of every single repetitive task, and it looks like I'm not even halfway done with the story, so that's promising. It will take some serious surprises to make me change my opinion on this one, not recommended for people who are looking for actual fun gameplay, recommended for people who get emotional easily and have never played an actually fun and engaging resource management game I guess?",

      "review": "Well, well, well, this game is definitely addictive, but in a very bad way. It reminds me of a mobile game you can't put down but leaves you feeling like it was an absolute waste of time afterwards. If I had to describe it with one word, it would be 'stretched'. Everything in this game is stretched ad nauseam.\nThe mini games get worse (!) over time. How is this even possible? The fishing and planting was ok imo (could have developed in a better way to be not that wearing, but well) but what the hell was the Smithy? First you need to simply wait for it to be done, then you need to craft it in an absolutely unenjoyable way. And you can't really do something between the waiting and the crafting 'cause you only have to wait up to ~30 seconds so it's not worth to do something else. It's just boring and time consuming. Like everything else in the game.\nI don't really understand why I only get one onion out of my onion plant. I need to buy seeds, I need to plant them, I need to water them, I need to wait, I need to harvest them and that all for one single onion. Why? \nI also really disliked the mini games to get the lightning in a bottle and the nebula fibre and all the other ones. I mean, the character moves smooth and that's kinda fun, but the ladders. I absolutely despise all the ladders on the boat. Every time I jump, my character ends up hanging on a ladder, every time I move, everytime I try to fall down, boom – stuck on a ladder. It's incredible annoying.\n[spoiler]Eventually you get the dash, but it has a cooldown. Why does this ability have a cooldown? For what reason? It's not as if there are any enemies in the game. Yeah, you would get ridiculous mobility, but isn't that kinda the point? On top of that it shares the cooldown with the Light Burst ability. Just great.\nThe XP potion event is the worst imo. You're just standing there waiting for the purple „enemies“ to appear which you can only kill with the Light Burst, but the Light Burst has a cooldown that's longer than the enemies stay. So if two purple enemies spawn simultaneously, you can just kill one of them, therefore get one potion, and there is not a single thing you can do about it. Funny thing when the event itself isn't spammable and you have to wait ingame time to do it again. What a feature![/spoiler]\nIt's nice that there is a teleportation system, but I ended up ignoring it 'cause it started feeling like another waste of time. Why do I have to sail to the teleportation point to teleport? Yeah, it only takes a few seconds, but I can't really do something in that time. And I need to get in my cabine to set sail, I need to talk to Alex, I need to get in my cabine again to choose my final destination. There are just so many unnecessary steps in between. That's fine in the beginning, but if you have to do it again and again it wears you down.\nThe quests are kinda … meh. The progression is all over the place. [spoiler]E.g. Jackie. He has a pager to contact me. And he contacts me instantly I get back on my boat. Why? I just talked to him, give this guy a little time ffs.[/spoiler]\nAnother problem I had with the game – why can't I sail at night? There is not a single reason not to. The game tells you 'it's too dangerous'. But what should happen? It's just another tool to stretch the game. You can't even access your map to look where you wanna go next or where you missed something. Just annoying, annoying, annoying.\nThen you can't choose the amount of wood you wanna saw, the amount of coal you wanna use in the Foundry, etc. You have to manually transfer every single piece of wood, every single piece of coal. And it goes up to 50. And of course you have to saw every single piece of wood afterwards yourself. So that's fun.\nInteracting with the characters is also a pain in the ass most of the time. I can't count how often I wanted to give Buck something to eat only for him to dump some new info on me and immediately fly across the boat. Wow. So now I have to find him again? On my big ass Fearless Whale without any indicator of where to look for him? Nice.\nBut Mickey and Bruce were the worst. Every time you wanna talk to them, Bruce has to turn Mickey around if you're standing on the wrong side, then Bruce has to fly on Mickey's nose cause otherwise they obviously cannot talk to you. It just takes ages. And then they are so damn demanding about their food. But sorry, I don't know the ingredients for every dish in my inventory, so after a while I just didn't bother to feed them anymore.\n\nI don't have much to say about the story. I lost interest after a few hours cause the gameplay was so flat and stressful at the same time. There's one thing I have to give the game credit for – you always have something to do. It might not be the most interesting thing, but you can always go fishing, try to cook a new meal, plant, water, feed your animals, shear your sheep, play your plants some music, travel somewhere, progress this quest, hug that spirit, … The list goes on. Kinda a wild mix of a slow, emotional story, yet hectic gameplay. Didn't work for me. I skimmed and skipped through most of the dialogue. But I don't think the story would've been my cup of tea anyway. [spoiler]I don't really like that Stella is presented as Charon's heir, but all of the spirits she takes care of are connected to her in one way or another. The game makes it pretty clear from the beginning that it's Stella's journey to the Everdoor and not the tale of a new ferryman for the dead (which I would've been more interested in tbh).

Every single task takes an eternity and has to be repeated in full hundreds of times throughout a playthrough, from the stale minigames to the long and slow animations, farming, mining, cutting trees, processing resources, it all takes such an insanely long time that I really can't be bothered anymore. Each and every single item has to be added one by one to boot, there is no slider or \"add max\" button, nothing, if you want to process 50 logs of wood, guess what? You're pressing that \"add\" button 50 freakin times... only to then manually saw each individual piece during a repetitive mini game. For the last 3 hours in this game I've just constantly been asking myself \"why did they not let players unlock \"auto\" mode after repeating the manual process a set number of times?\", it really, really feels like playtime was padded in the worst way possible, making you repeat tedious needless actions ad nauseam.\n\nTo expand on this a bit further: Take planting crops for example. You build a garden which has 3 plots of land, you put a seed in every plot, every single time you plant a seed, an animation plays. Then you need to water each individual plot separately because why not, and of course another slow animation plays. You'd think that'd be that, now it's waiting time! But nahh, you'll need to water them AGAIN before the plants mature. And that's just a single garden lmao... You could have 4 gardens and 4 fields (or, God forbid, even more), that's 24 plots of land, yeah, it gets insanely tedious. All of this would have been forgiven if you could just upgrade your buildings to maybe automatically water your plants, but no, you'll be doing it manually for literally dozens of hours, hundreds perhaps thousands of times. And that's just your plants, you want to milk cows? Watch a slow milking animation, then watch an animation of the cow lying down, because you can't feed the cow until it finishes the animation, and then you feed the cow or it won't produce milk again over time. Picking apples from your tree? Yeah, watch your character slowly touch the tree until the apples fall off. I mean, what are we doing here, this isn't a chill game, this is watching paint dry almost taken literally.\n\nOn top of all of this, progression is literally just fetch quest after fetch quest, the game constantly sends you back and forth to islands across the map that are all filled with tall buildings that you can enter, but that don't contain a single thing, you can climb them from the inside, but there's no purpose, it's annoying, it's frustrating, it makes me feel like my time is being intentionally wasted. Traversing the map is painfully slow for most of the playthrough as well, and if you pass through an optional event to collect resources, your boat will stop in it's track without exceptions and you'll have to first interact with an NPC on your ship in order to skip the event. Why, just why?...\n\nThere's more small annoyances all over, like your map being inaccessible at night because you can't sail your ship after dark. Ok, but why am I being prevented from seeing the map and planning where I want to sail the next day? It just doesn't make any sense at all, like many things in Spiritfarer.\n\nI'll probably try to finish my run but after 20 hours I am completely and utterly done with the tedious nature of every single repetitive task, and it looks like I'm not even halfway done with the story, so that's promising. It will take some serious surprises to make me change my opinion on this one, not recommended for people who are looking for actual fun gameplay, recommended for people who get emotional easily and have never played an actually fun and engaging resource management game I guess?",

      "review": "Well, well, well, this game is definitely addictive, but in a very bad way. It reminds me of a mobile game you can't put down but leaves you feeling like it was an absolute waste of time afterwards. If I had to describe it with one word, it would be 'stretched'. Everything in this game is stretched ad nauseam.\nThe mini games get worse (!) over time. How is this even possible? The fishing and planting was ok imo (could have developed in a better way to be not that wearing, but well) but what the hell was the Smithy? First you need to simply wait for it to be done, then you need to craft it in an absolutely unenjoyable way. And you can't really do something between the waiting and the crafting 'cause you only have to wait up to ~30 seconds so it's not worth to do something else. It's just boring and time consuming. Like everything else in the game.\nI don't really understand why I only get one onion out of my onion plant. I need to buy seeds, I need to plant them, I need to water them, I need to wait, I need to harvest them and that all for one single onion. Why? \nI also really disliked the mini games to get the lightning in a bottle and the nebula fibre and all the other ones. I mean, the character moves smooth and that's kinda fun, but the ladders. I absolutely despise all the ladders on the boat. Every time I jump, my character ends up hanging on a ladder, every time I move, everytime I try to fall down, boom – stuck on a ladder. It's incredible annoying.\n[spoiler]Eventually you get the dash, but it has a cooldown. Why does this ability have a cooldown? For what reason? It's not as if there are any enemies in the game. Yeah, you would get ridiculous mobility, but isn't that kinda the point? On top of that it shares the cooldown with the Light Burst ability. Just great.\nThe XP potion event is the worst imo. You're just standing there waiting for the purple „enemies“ to appear which you can only kill with the Light Burst, but the Light Burst has a cooldown that's longer than the enemies stay. So if two purple enemies spawn simultaneously, you can just kill one of them, therefore get one potion, and there is not a single thing you can do about it. Funny thing when the event itself isn't spammable and you have to wait ingame time to do it again. What a feature![/spoiler]\nIt's nice that there is a teleportation system, but I ended up ignoring it 'cause it started feeling like another waste of time. Why do I have to sail to the teleportation point to teleport? Yeah, it only takes a few seconds, but I can't really do something in that time. And I need to get in my cabine to set sail, I need to talk to Alex, I need to get in my cabine again to choose my final destination. There are just so many unnecessary steps in between. That's fine in the beginning, but if you have to do it again and again it wears you down.\nThe quests are kinda … meh. The progression is all over the place. [spoiler]E.g. Jackie. He has a pager to contact me. And he contacts me instantly I get back on my boat. Why? I just talked to him, give this guy a little time ffs.[/spoiler]\nAnother problem I had with the game – why can't I sail at night? There is not a single reason not to. The game tells you 'it's too dangerous'. But what should happen? It's just another tool to stretch the game. You can't even access your map to look where you wanna go next or where you missed something. Just annoying, annoying, annoying.\nThen you can't choose the amount of wood you wanna saw, the amount of coal you wanna use in the Foundry, etc. You have to manually transfer every single piece of wood, every single piece of coal. And it goes up to 50. And of course you have to saw every single piece of wood afterwards yourself. So that's fun.\nInteracting with the characters is also a pain in the ass most of the time. I can't count how often I wanted to give Buck something to eat only for him to dump some new info on me and immediately fly across the boat. Wow. So now I have to find him again? On my big ass Fearless Whale without any indicator of where to look for him? Nice.\nBut Mickey and Bruce were the worst. Every time you wanna talk to them, Bruce has to turn Mickey around if you're standing on the wrong side, then Bruce has to fly on Mickey's nose cause otherwise they obviously cannot talk to you. It just takes ages. And then they are so damn demanding about their food. But sorry, I don't know the ingredients for every dish in my inventory, so after a while I just didn't bother to feed them anymore.\n\nI don't have much to say about the story. I lost interest after a few hours cause the gameplay was so flat and stressful at the same time. There's one thing I have to give the game credit for – you always have something to do. It might not be the most interesting thing, but you can always go fishing, try to cook a new meal, plant, water, feed your animals, shear your sheep, play your plants some music, travel somewhere, progress this quest, hug that spirit, … The list goes on. Kinda a wild mix of a slow, emotional story, yet hectic gameplay. Didn't work for me. I skimmed and skipped through most of the dialogue. But I don't think the story would've been my cup of tea anyway. [spoiler]I don't really like that Stella is presented as Charon's heir, but all of the spirits she takes care of are connected to her in one way or another. The game makes it pretty clear from the beginning that it's Stella's journey to the Everdoor and not the tale of a new ferryman for the dead (which I would've been more interested in tbh). Which is why it doesn't make sense that she's supposed to be a new Charon.[/spoiler]\nThe dynamic between Stella and the spirits was a little bit too familiar for my liking. I mean, she is new, but everyone knows her. Didn't really feel right for me. (I know, it makes sense storywise, but idk)\nI must admit the game is visually stunning. The character designs are great, the Everydoor looks phenomenal, the idea of creating new character-based signs of the zodiac is fantastic. But in the end I only had „real“ fun for roughly the first 3 hours, after that it was a very tedious (and addictive) experience. I can't bring myself to recommend this.",

      "review": "TL;DR - The game starts off interesting enough to pull your attention -- then drops the ball as the game progresses with poorly thought out resource management, and tedious repetition for gameplay length padding.\n\nThe majority of negative reviews hit this one on the mark. Someone came up with an okay story idea, but didn't have a well thought out plan of how to convert that into a long gameplay experience.\n\nThe resource management in the game is ridiculous, and only gets more tedious as the game progresses. There is an excessive amount of backtracking that is made more cumbersome by not being able to custom mark the map for things like abilities needed for certain areas or goals not yet met. There are a good amount of fast travel points, but it still does not offset the need to write down or remember special attributes about each island that you may have to revisit later due to inaccessible areas.\n\nThe gameplay loop starts to get stale after the first couple of completions as the loop does not really change much as you progress further into the story. You get some fetch quests, upgrade homes, then turn them in. The character stories are okay, but there's not too much depth to the characters themselves to pull you into what ails them.\n\nEventually you kind of just stop caring at all what they have to say. You become a dead husk inside from the tedium. As a consequence of this, you kind of start speeding through the dialog so you can take their next request, grind the necessary resources, and then send them on their way -- Spiritfarer: Jaded Edition.\n\nThe hand drawn art is well done, and the character design is neat. Music helps pass the time in game, but it isn't something that will get stuck in your head. Player control is solid, and game customization like display options and control mapping is done well.\n\nThis game was one that I was going to think was okay if you got it on sale. However, after putting more and more time into it to see what direction the game takes after you sink a good chunk of time into it, I really just ended up wishing I hadn't wasted the time I had already put into it.",

But sorry, I don't know the ingredients for every dish in my inventory, so after a while I just didn't bother to feed them anymore.\n\nI don't have much to say about the story. I lost interest after a few hours cause the gameplay was so flat and stressful at the same time. There's one thing I have to give the game credit for – you always have something to do. It might not be the most interesting thing, but you can always go fishing, try to cook a new meal, plant, water, feed your animals, shear your sheep, play your plants some music, travel somewhere, progress this quest, hug that spirit, … The list goes on. Kinda a wild mix of a slow, emotional story, yet hectic gameplay. Didn't work for me. I skimmed and skipped through most of the dialogue. But I don't think the story would've been my cup of tea anyway. [spoiler]I don't really like that Stella is presented as Charon's heir, but all of the spirits she takes care of are connected to her in one way or another. The game makes it pretty clear from the beginning that it's Stella's journey to the Everdoor and not the tale of a new ferryman for the dead (which I would've been more interested in tbh). Which is why it doesn't make sense that she's supposed to be a new Charon.[/spoiler]\nThe dynamic between Stella and the spirits was a little bit too familiar for my liking. I mean, she is new, but everyone knows her. Didn't really feel right for me. (I know, it makes sense storywise, but idk)\nI must admit the game is visually stunning. The character designs are great, the Everydoor looks phenomenal, the idea of creating new character-based signs of the zodiac is fantastic. But in the end I only had „real“ fun for roughly the first 3 hours, after that it was a very tedious (and addictive) experience. I can't bring myself to recommend this.",

      "review": "TL;DR - The game starts off interesting enough to pull your attention -- then drops the ball as the game progresses with poorly thought out resource management, and tedious repetition for gameplay length padding.\n\nThe majority of negative reviews hit this one on the mark. Someone came up with an okay story idea, but didn't have a well thought out plan of how to convert that into a long gameplay experience.\n\nThe resource management in the game is ridiculous, and only gets more tedious as the game progresses. There is an excessive amount of backtracking that is made more cumbersome by not being able to custom mark the map for things like abilities needed for certain areas or goals not yet met. There are a good amount of fast travel points, but it still does not offset the need to write down or remember special attributes about each island that you may have to revisit later due to inaccessible areas.\n\nThe gameplay loop starts to get stale after the first couple of completions as the loop does not really change much as you progress further into the story. You get some fetch quests, upgrade homes, then turn them in. The character stories are okay, but there's not too much depth to the characters themselves to pull you into what ails them.\n\nEventually you kind of just stop caring at all what they have to say. You become a dead husk inside from the tedium. As a consequence of this, you kind of start speeding through the dialog so you can take their next request, grind the necessary resources, and then send them on their way -- Spiritfarer: Jaded Edition.\n\nThe hand drawn art is well done, and the character design is neat. Music helps pass the time in game, but it isn't something that will get stuck in your head. Player control is solid, and game customization like display options and control mapping is done well.\n\nThis game was one that I was going to think was okay if you got it on sale. However, after putting more and more time into it to see what direction the game takes after you sink a good chunk of time into it, I really just ended up wishing I hadn't wasted the time I had already put into it.",

      "review": "Devs seem to have struck gold with a certain audience that eats this up writing essays about how the stories made them cry their eyes out, without a single mention of the plethora of flaws this game has. For me, after giving it two chances, 10 hours of playtime each, I can confidently say that there are way too many things wrong with the actual gameplay for me to recommend this game. I continued playing where I stopped last year, and a couple hours in it became clear again why I got tired of playing this game:\n\nSpiritfarer as a videogame is basically tedium in fancy clothes, looks and sounds good but when it comes to the actual gameplay elements? Good Lord what were they thinking... Every single task takes an eternity and has to be repeated in full hundreds of times throughout a playthrough, from the stale minigames to the long and slow animations, farming, mining, cutting trees, processing resources, it all takes such an insanely long time that I really can't be bothered anymore. Each and every single item has to be added one by one to boot, there is no slider or \"add max\" button, nothing, if you want to process 50 logs of wood, guess what? You're pressing that \"add\" button 50 freakin times... only to then manually saw each individual piece during a repetitive mini game. For the last 3 hours in this game I've just constantly been asking myself \"why did they not let players unlock \"auto\" mode after repeating the manual process a set number of times?\", it really, really feels like playtime was padded in the worst way possible, making you repeat tedious needless actions ad nauseam.\n\nTo expand on this a bit further: Take planting crops for example. You build a garden which has 3 plots of land, you put a seed in every plot, every single time you plant a seed, an animation plays. Then you need to water each individual plot separately because why not, and of course another slow animation plays. You'd think that'd be that, now it's waiting time! But nahh, you'll need to water them AGAIN before the plants mature. And that's just a single garden lmao... You could have 4 gardens and 4 fields (or, God forbid, even more), that's 24 plots of land, yeah, it gets insanely tedious. All of this would have been forgiven if you could just upgrade your buildings to maybe automatically water your plants, but no, you'll be doing it manually for literally dozens of hours, hundreds perhaps thousands of times. And that's just your plants, you want to milk cows? Watch a slow milking animation, then watch an animation of the cow lying down, because you can't feed the cow until it finishes the animation, and then you feed the cow or it won't produce milk again over time. Picking apples from your tree? Yeah, watch your character slowly touch the tree until the apples fall off. I mean, what are we doing here, this isn't a chill game, this is watching paint dry almost taken literally.\n\nOn top of all of this, progression is literally just fetch quest after fetch quest, the game constantly sends you back and forth to islands across the map that are all filled with tall buildings that you can enter, but that don't contain a single thing, you can climb them from the inside, but there's no purpose, it's annoying, it's frustrating, it makes me feel like my time is being intentionally wasted. Traversing the map is painfully slow for most of the playthrough as well, and if you pass through an optional event to collect resources, your boat will stop in it's track without exceptions and you'll have to first interact with an NPC on your ship in order to skip the event. Why, just why?...\n\nThere's more small annoyances all over, like your map being inaccessible at night because you can't sail your ship after dark. Ok, but why am I being prevented from seeing the map and planning where I want to sail the next day? It just doesn't make any sense at all, like many things in Spiritfarer.\n\nI'll probably try to finish my run but after 20 hours I am completely and utterly done with the tedious nature of every single repetitive task, and it looks like I'm not even halfway done with the story, so that's promising. It will take some serious surprises to make me change my opinion on this one, not recommended for people who are looking for actual fun gameplay, recommended for people who get emotional easily and have never played an actually fun and engaging resource management game I guess?",

      "review": "Well, well, well, this game is definitely addictive, but in a very bad way. It reminds me of a mobile game you can't put down but leaves you feeling like it was an absolute waste of time afterwards. If I had to describe it with one word, it would be 'stretched'. Everything in this game is stretched ad nauseam.\nThe mini games get worse (!) over time. How is this even possible? The fishing and planting was ok imo (could have developed in a better way to be not that wearing, but well) but what the hell was the Smithy? First you need to simply wait for it to be done, then you need to craft it in an absolutely unenjoyable way. And you can't really do something between the waiting and the crafting 'cause you only have to wait up to ~30 seconds so it's not worth to do something else. It's just boring and time consuming. Like everything else in the game.\nI don't really understand why I only get one onion out of my onion plant. I need to buy seeds, I need to plant them, I need to water them, I need to wait, I need to harvest them and that all for one single onion. Why? \nI also really disliked the mini games to get the lightning in a bottle and the nebula fibre and all the other ones. I mean, the character moves smooth and that's kinda fun, but the ladders. I absolutely despise all the ladders on the boat. Every time I jump, my character ends up hanging on a ladder, every time I move, everytime I try to fall down, boom – stuck on a ladder. It's incredible annoying.\n[spoiler]Eventually you get the dash, but it has a cooldown. Why does this ability have a cooldown? For what reason? It's not as if there are any enemies in the game. Yeah, you would get ridiculous mobility, but isn't that kinda the point? On top of that it shares the cooldown with the Light Burst ability. Just great.\nThe XP potion event is the worst imo. You're just standing there waiting for the purple „enemies“ to appear which you can only kill with the Light Burst, but the Light Burst has a cooldown that's longer than the enemies stay. So if two purple enemies spawn simultaneously, you can just kill one of them, therefore get one potion, and there is not a single thing you can do about it. Funny thing when the event itself isn't spammable and you have to wait ingame time to do it again. What a feature![/spoiler]\nIt's nice that there is a teleportation system, but I ended up ignoring it 'cause it started feeling like another waste of time. Why do I have to sail to the teleportation point to teleport? Yeah, it only takes a few seconds, but I can't really do something in that time. And I need to get in my cabine to set sail, I need to talk to Alex, I need to get in my cabine again to choose my final destination. There are just so many unnecessary steps in between. That's fine in the beginning, but if you have to do it again and again it wears you down.\nThe quests are kinda … meh. The progression is all over the place. [spoiler]E.g. Jackie. He has a pager to contact me. And he contacts me instantly I get back on my boat. Why? I just talked to him, give this guy a little time ffs.[/spoiler]\nAnother problem I had with the game – why can't I sail at night? There is not a single reason not to. The game tells you 'it's too dangerous'. But what should happen? It's just another tool to stretch the game. You can't even access your map to look where you wanna go next or where you missed something. Just annoying, annoying, annoying.\nThen you can't choose the amount of wood you wanna saw, the amount of coal you wanna use in the Foundry, etc. You have to manually transfer every single piece of wood, every single piece of coal. And it goes up to 50. And of course you have to saw every single piece of wood afterwards yourself. So that's fun.\nInteracting with the characters is also a pain in the ass most of the time. I can't count how often I wanted to give Buck something to eat only for him to dump some new info on me and immediately fly across the boat. Wow. So now I have to find him again? On my big ass Fearless Whale without any indicator of where to look for him? Nice.\nBut Mickey and Bruce were the worst. Every time you wanna talk to them, Bruce has to turn Mickey around if you're standing on the wrong side, then Bruce has to fly on Mickey's nose cause otherwise they obviously cannot talk to you. It just takes ages. And then they are so damn demanding about their food. But sorry, I don't know the ingredients for every dish in my inventory, so after a while I just didn't bother to feed them anymore.\n\nI don't have much to say about the story.
