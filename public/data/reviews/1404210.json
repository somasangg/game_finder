      "review": "This only gets a thumbs up because of all the fun I had when friends still played this game, but unfortunately this went the way of the West when The Powers That Be decided that a roleplaying experience was less lucrative than making GTA forever. Surprised they haven't just pulled the plug already since this is clearly not something anyone in charge gives an ess eche eye tee about. Unplayable without a third party tool that dumps you in a session alone, and just makes me sad to even do that now that everyone has moved on. I had to move on. The world turns, and the vast, beautiful landscape falls silent as gunfighters, thieves, rogues and heroes hang up their belts and vanish.\n\nPlaying now feels like walking through the empty hallways of a place you used to know before a bomb went off in it. It's like seeing one of your loved ones in a hospital bed waiting for their instinctual breathing to cease after their life support is shut off. Looking at a photo of your family as it burns up in your hands.\n\nThe Assassination of a Great Time by the Coward Rockstar Games.",

Its questlines are fun and full of character, and the world itself is stunning—wide-open plains, peaceful forests, snowy mountains, all brought to life with incredible detail. Just exploring can feel like its own reward.\r\n\r\nBut the game has a rough side too. Cheating is unfortunately common, especially during multiplayer events. You might run into players teleporting, spawning explosions, or using invincibility to ruin the fun. It can definitely break the experience at times.\r\n\r\nStill, RDO’s community is a strange mix of chaos and kindness. You’ll even meet “friendly cheaters” who use their powers to help instead of harm—spawning loot, clearing missions, or defending others from trolls.\r\n\r\nOverall, Red Dead Online is a beautiful game with pretty decent quests and atmosphere. The cheating problem is real, but if you can look past it, there’s still a lot of adventure and charm to enjoy.",

It's as if Rockstar doesn't want to hear your complaints.

      "review": "Red Dead Redemption 2 — the story and gameplay in that game are super perfect, but its online version is really the worst. There are so many bugs that if you start the game calmly, you’ll definitely get irritated and end up uninstalling it. That’s how bad the bugs are. For example: if you interact with a shop or something in the game, the camera just freezes and you can’t do anything. Sometimes the horse doesn’t move. Sometimes NPC characters don’t move. Fast travel sometimes doesn’t work properly and you don’t even get the rewards after finishing missions.\n\nThe worst thing is the cheaters. There are cheaters who you can’t do anything about — they can even crash your game. Sure, you can report them to Rockstar and expect them to take action, but from my experience, that doesn’t happen. I reported maybe 150+ cheaters and nothing changed. My friend list is full of cheaters — they roam around freely and nothing stops them. I’ve even spent real money saving up for Rockstar’s gold packs, only to see cheaters get unlimited gold through hacks. It frustrates me so much. This game is garbage.\n\nEven if you’re on a good network, the sessions change randomly. You might have a stable session only rarely; most times you get unpredictable errors and it’s impossible to play peacefully. If you try to be calm and just explore, the game suddenly kicks you out with an error — that’s really stressful. I wanted to play to relax, but instead I get stressed. I’ve uninstalled this game more than 13 times; now this is the 14th time I’m about to uninstall it. There are still many other problems I could list, but I’ve said enough. If you buy this game, congrats!",

I than start thinking about it and now I see RDO as it is a Mobile version of GTA online without any of the fun factors - It is so close but not close enough to say that playing online should require you to give them your banking information and you have to dodge and weave Splashscreens with button presses from them taking funds out of your account, because that is all this game is... What do you truly get out of your grind... outfits and Emotes.... that's about it. \r\n\r\nYou cannot save RDO without removing GOLD and The Timed quest payouts, which rockstar will never do - It's also funny that they have these MTX's when you have TO PAY FOR THIS VERSION - It should be free.  There is nothing in this game to do after completing the roles - unless you want to wait out for the FOMO(yes you heard that right) events which only give you... Cosmetics and Emotes - What's the point - so you can go into a lobby with those emotes to try out only to be teleported in the air and blown up over and over again? That's what your end game is all about - getting stuff you can't use unless you just want your character to flip you off over and over again. \r\n\r\nThis version should be Delisted as the game is abandoned - Buy Red Dead Redemption 2 when it's on sale - Play the online on that version get your achievements and never come back - this game is designed to just take your money and give you nothing in return - it's a shame because it's a beautiful game with so much potential...

I wanted to report these bugs but for the love of this game Rockstar makes it so hard for me to report an issue, I tried navigating to their website but would get suddenly shifted to GTA V articles, or other articles. It's as if Rockstar doesn't want to hear your complaints. A billion dollar company doesn't have a running customer service line that says it's 24/7, either they're lying corporate weasels or they just hired the wrong design team to make a customer service option. I really wanna love this game i do, but the bugs makes the game so frustrating. \n\nMy old comment: \nOnly buy on discount, this game crashes every few hours and i loose all my hard earned pelts.... really wanna punch rockstar in the ratings for that. They remember how much bullets you've wasted but not how much pellets you've collected, ughk! But it's fun",

      "review": "Red Dead Redemption 2 — the story and gameplay in that game are super perfect, but its online version is really the worst. There are so many bugs that if you start the game calmly, you’ll definitely get irritated and end up uninstalling it. That’s how bad the bugs are. For example: if you interact with a shop or something in the game, the camera just freezes and you can’t do anything. Sometimes the horse doesn’t move. Sometimes NPC characters don’t move. Fast travel sometimes doesn’t work properly and you don’t even get the rewards after finishing missions.\n\nThe worst thing is the cheaters. There are cheaters who you can’t do anything about — they can even crash your game. Sure, you can report them to Rockstar and expect them to take action, but from my experience, that doesn’t happen. I reported maybe 150+ cheaters and nothing changed. My friend list is full of cheaters — they roam around freely and nothing stops them. I’ve even spent real money saving up for Rockstar’s gold packs, only to see cheaters get unlimited gold through hacks. It frustrates me so much. This game is garbage.\n\nEven if you’re on a good network, the sessions change randomly. You might have a stable session only rarely; most times you get unpredictable errors and it’s impossible to play peacefully. If you try to be calm and just explore, the game suddenly kicks you out with an error — that’s really stressful. I wanted to play to relax, but instead I get stressed. I’ve uninstalled this game more than 13 times; now this is the 14th time I’m about to uninstall it. There are still many other problems I could list, but I’ve said enough. If you buy this game, congrats!",

If you love GTAV's infinite load screens (not due to HDD/SSD or your network/isp) and \"freezing\" when exiting NPC interaction menus, you'll love this game. (\"freezing\" as in all i could do was open the map and ALT F4, which proved the game was not frozen because the game asked if i really wanted to exit the game. straight rockstar bs)\n\nbut hey, at least they fixed the stables so you can actually enter them after the year(s) of that bug existing. (the NPC freezing was also caused by the stables..... i was able to enter, buy things, but never leave. saw another review, ig this bug is consistent)",

And they aren't little bugs (such as getting a random hat stuck on your head) but big bugs like getting completely stuck every time you try to exit the horse stable. Requires a full forced quit and reload, but it will just happen again next time you try. And those aren't the only bugs I have encountered in such a small amount of game time.

I spent 4 hours with my family server hoping to find one server that worked/was not being hacked in random strange ways and was unsuccessful.  Seriously, do not buy RDR2 online.
