You’ll love it, lil bro!”\n\nYeah. Sure. “Fun.”\n\nSo I hop in, thinking it’s some cute \"default\" roguelike where I can throw some potions and blow up stuff with wands just for the lolz.\nTen minutes later I’m being sniped by a flying green eye spamming toxic projectiles in a perfect homing line like I have a giant red target on me.\n\nThen there’s that guy — you know the one — the shotgun dude.\nHe’s not a boss, not a mini-boss, just a random little drunk goblin with a shotgun.\nHe kills you. Again. And again. And again.\nYou try to outsmart him — he dodges into you.\nYou try to prefire him — he shoots, and suddenly you’re flying straight into an acid pool.\n\nFinally, you’re down to 10 HP, sitting on 1200 gold and holding a god-tier wand. \nYou can already see that beautiful, glowing portal 2 feet from you — and then some random little purple blob sneezes in your direction and you instantly explode.\n\nEven after 30 hours of endless, bizarre, and hilarious deaths, you’ll still be discovering new stuff — more than most games could ever dream of showing you.\nNoita is so absurdly detailed that you could practically live an entire second life inside it… and still have way too much left to see.\n\nEvery run is a comedy sketch(not fun tho).\nEvery death is both unexpected and completely your fault.\n\n10 angry gods out of 10",

It makes you feel like an idiot and a genius at the same time. There’s no hand-holding - everything is learned through experience. And death. So much death.\n\nKnow that the trailers and the store description cover maybe 5% of what the game actually is. The fact that most players never even see the other 95%… I still can’t wrap my head around how a tiny indie team created that much content that isn’t even part of the “main” game (biggest air quotes of my life).\n\nI am a full-time preacher of Noita.

I tried to get into them and I really liked a few like Bloodborne and Returnal, but as far as sinking all my time into them, that never really happened.\n\nI saw Noita around on Steam for a good while. I knew it existed. What I didn’t know was that it’s so much more than a roguelite with falling sand physics. So much more. Like thousands of hours and you’ll still get surprised more. I watched a video about it and I immediately bought it because I couldn't believe how many interesting mechanics there were. This game absolutely blows my mind every time I dig into it. Every run is mesmerizing and captivating.\n\nIt’s probably one of the hardest games I’ve ever played. But it’s probably the only hard game that has the best balance of the fear of death and just enjoying the ride and experimenting to learn everything about it. The variety in each run is also just incredible. It’s hilarious, heartbreaking, panic inducing, abundant, scarce and joy filled all at the same time.",

This is a puzzle game where the objective is trolling the game.\n\nAnd also let's don't forget about pixel based physic. It is uncanny and beautiful, and sooner or later the whole screen looks like fireworks on LSD. Speaking about LSD – using mushrooms is one of the funniest strategies in game. You need to see it by yourself.\n\nIf I'm cheating to get manual saves if my build looks interesting? Do I play it like some kind of RPG/Sandbox? Yes. Am I feeling bad about it?

Learn how to judge situational events such as ....Should i fight or pick up the gold?...I could save my health points instead to reach the save spot... This way of thinking will help to find ways around problems. This is a game with a big brain power creep. The more you learn, the further it will take you.

Not only that, but the smallest of particles that you can spot being emitted are simulated and can be dynamically changed. I'm not going to ruin you with spoilers, but there are mods that unbound some of the in-game rules making the whole experience 10x more chaotic, but also show the true reach of the game.\n\nMy advice is, watch a spoilerless tutorial on wands, and just go.

      "review": "This is my first review of a game, I believe, and wow, what a game Noita is! First off, I will state that this game is not easy and can be very frustrating and challenging to even get into. It won't make sense, you will die a lot, and it will often feel like utter BS. It took me 98 tries before I was able to win. When I first started, I did not like it. I think I tried something like 10 times and then stopped, believing it was a boring game. I later decided to give it a true chance and really think about it, and that's when I started to enjoy it for what it was.\n\nIt's endless how many possibilities there are each run, and every run is dramatically different from the previous; it's truly amazing! It has so much room for creativity and problem solving. You don't necessarily need to be great at combat—I'm not!—you just need to be smart about it and sometimes patient. The best advice I would give to those who want to dive into this game is tinker around, pay attention, kick random stuff, and don't be afraid to try new ideas. You will die and fail, but that's part of the fun of discovery! Be patient and you'll be rewarded with a truly unique gem of a game that goes very deep.\n\nDefinitely a 10/10 game and truly one-of-a-kind! I'm looking forward to exploring it more. Almost every time I play, I discover new secrets!\n\nOne small critique: I am colorblind, so the surfaces are very hard for me to see. I died a lot by standing on a substance I shouldn't because I can't see. I know you can hover over them to read, but when there's action happening, you can't do that. I think it would be very helpful if there were a colorblind mode with labels on the surfaces so people like me can see and avoid some frustrating, unnecessary deaths :D. I just sprayed water on everything before I landed, but it would be nice to know for sure if a surface is dangerous without the color cue.",

I enjoy Noita a lot (if the frustrations listed below don't bother you, then GET THIS GAME), but these frustrations are getting in the way of a truly enjoyable experience for me, and I'd love to see them addressed ASAP (if possible).\n\n- There is no quick reset button/key.  I make mistakes often, and I am pretty aware at this point whether a mistake ends a run or if a mistake can be lived through without much issue.  I don't want to have to click something 5 times to make that reset happen.  Quick-resetting is a core feature in most rogue-likes, and is sorely missed here.  I'd love everything in the world to hold down R for a second to reset immediately when I get bomb wand as a starter because bomb wand is gross and you know it - I actually suicide sometimes just to spruce up the resets instead of menu-whoring everytime.  Speaking of which:\n- When starting a new game, you must manually click every button starting from the pause menu...  None of the selections are automatically highlighted to facilitate inputs via spacebar inputs instead of having to aim and click each option, and you can't highlight menu options with WASD keys (YOU ABSOLUTELY SHOULD - accessibility in menus would dramatically improve with this feature, especially for those that struggle to use a mouse and have to use special keyboard inputs to play the game at all).  Restart should be the first highlighted option upon hitting the ESC key, and spamming spacebar should restart the run from there.  If no R key fix, then at least do this for accessibility.\n- There is no separate hotkey for the EAT action.  I hate that you cannot move the EAT action away from the S key, which is a movement key that I find myself pressing inadvertently when around enemies (as a crouch key) or when slamming onto the ground near sloped edges (several video games I am playing right now cause a sliding action when you crouch on a sloped surface from a jump; I find myself mimicking those input styles without intending to).  This action is ingrained in my muscle memory, and I can't tell you how many times I've eaten something by sheer accident in this game because of this issue.\n- Please for the love of the lord let me SPRINT.  Along with the crouch issue that I was having above, I find myself holding down the shift key when I am trying to move fast regardless if it does anything at all.  I don't care if it's a button that gets me killed faster or ends up saving my ass - that's a gamble I'm willing to take.  Just let me have it - it'll be FUN!  (and completely shake up the speedrunning community but that's something we can live with, no?)\n\nIn all seriousness, I want to love this game, but the input issues are preventing me from doing so to the degree that I can recommend it outright; usability and accessibility in control schemes and UI are extremely important to me and my satisfaction with a game, and as it stands, I would NOT recommend this game to a player like me.  If you aren't the anal type like myself, get this game!\n\n[b][u]Edit after putting in a decent amount of time with this game and suffering (got the enraged the gods achievement):[/u][/b] still clunky in the beginning of the game - my opinion won't change on that at this point, and it can completely kill all motivation to play when you finally feel like you have a run going only to get destroyed 0.2 seconds later by a sudden gangbang of gunners that explode out of one of them.  (I'll boot up Vamp Survivors or something just to take a break when a big death happens tbh; it hurts.)\n\nIt feels needlessly slow and painful both in the beginning.  I suffered through the resets though and learned.  The game hotkey for EAT still need to be able to be rebound - I am still making those mistakes.  And yeah, I still feel like sliding and sprinting would make this game feel at least somewhat less clunky and really give some extra dynamics  - sprinting could be like half the speed boost of Accelerium potion or something and affect your levitation time, and sliding could be given different properties depending on the stain you have (slime speeding you up on most surfaces for example; perhaps blood increases friction etc - you get the idea).  I mean, it's just waiting to happen; if it doesn't get done by the dev, I'll probably mod it in at some point soon myself.  \n\nOther than that, I'm going to play my next foreseeable runs with mods at this point even though I'm nowhere near beating this game in vanilla; looking at the steam workshop, adding the Bags mod that adds a whole inventory + the passive health regen mod + health drop mod + Advanced Map sounds like a much more well-rounded experience.  I might even try the checkpoint mod if I still get frustrated to losing a run to a stupid death; perhaps I'll feel a bit more inclined to actually explore the damned game if I feel like I have the survivability to do so, and these mods will give that.",

When the game works, it is a very difficult, often frustrating, but still enjoyable experience.\r\nHowever, the game LOVES crashing whenever it's not the active window. Constantly, yet randomly. Sometimes, it even restarts Steam, which is curious. And, all with absolutely zero crash reports, the crash log file is nice and clean and empty.\r\nMy computer's specs are good, and I've tried changing the settings. Changed the window mode, changed graphics settings, it still happens at seemingly random.\r\nI would normally be fine with this, but it seems to happen whenever the game tries to save while the game is not the active window, because my Holy Mountains keep being deleted from the world (there's just nothing there), and my player position is saved but any recent changes I made to the terrain are reverted (often times putting me inside the terrain to suffocate if I happened to be digging anywhere).\r\nI played with mods for a little bit, QoL stuff, not new content, but since I still haven't gotten all of the achievements I disabled them and have been running vanilla, but it still happens. It has been happening since I started playing, but only recently has it decided to start deleting everything and ruining my save. I shouldn't be expected to make manual backups of my saves; while that is a fix, that is not how a good game is made, I should not have to do that to enjoy the game.\r\nThis has been making the game genuinely unplayable, and for that reason I would not recommend Noita in the state it's in right now. When the game works, I absolutely would recommend it, but it doesn't work and I seem to be constantly punished by the game for crashes I can't control as it effectively bricks my save.\r\nAgain, I want to make it clear that I do like Noita. And, while I can't confirm that it's not just my computer acting up-- at least not right now-- what I can say is that Noita is the only game or piece of software that this has ever happened with. And, since it makes the game unplayable, I can't in good faith tell people that Noita is worth purchasing until this is fixed.",

The game is begging you to break it by 'exploiting' it's mechanics, but punishes you brutally for the slightest mistake such choosing a trap option perk. You will die from things like stepping in a pixle of lava, or flying through a puff of cold vapor, or being turned into a helpless animal and being oneshot nearly instantly no matter what your health was beforehand.

The most interesting parts of Noita are the very deep wand/spell and alchemy systems, which you have to figure out yourself over time because the game doesn't tell you much about them. That in itself isn't an issue, but the incredibly unforgiving difficulty does nothing to contribute to those systems and most of the time simply blocks you from actually exploring them. If you create a new spell from combining effects you've accumulated, there's a decent chance it will get you immediately killed. You can spend a while tinkering with your wands only to get ganked by a new enemy as soon as you enter the next area. And for what? It just feels like you've wasted your time with nothing to show for it. You spend most of your time exploring the first area again and again, with no progression or advancement to make that feel like a fresh experience, and you'll still need to scour it for gold to have a chance of a decent run so you can't just rush through.\n\nThere is the potential for a great game here, but it's hidden under an unnecessary layer of difficulty that ultimately feels like it's only there to pad out the gameplay time.",

I enjoy Noita a lot (if the frustrations listed below don't bother you, then GET THIS GAME), but these frustrations are getting in the way of a truly enjoyable experience for me, and I'd love to see them addressed ASAP (if possible).\n\n- There is no quick reset button/key.  I make mistakes often, and I am pretty aware at this point whether a mistake ends a run or if a mistake can be lived through without much issue.  I don't want to have to click something 5 times to make that reset happen.  Quick-resetting is a core feature in most rogue-likes, and is sorely missed here.  I'd love everything in the world to hold down R for a second to reset immediately when I get bomb wand as a starter because bomb wand is gross and you know it - I actually suicide sometimes just to spruce up the resets instead of menu-whoring everytime.  Speaking of which:\n- When starting a new game, you must manually click every button starting from the pause menu...  None of the selections are automatically highlighted to facilitate inputs via spacebar inputs instead of having to aim and click each option, and you can't highlight menu options with WASD keys (YOU ABSOLUTELY SHOULD - accessibility in menus would dramatically improve with this feature, especially for those that struggle to use a mouse and have to use special keyboard inputs to play the game at all).  Restart should be the first highlighted option upon hitting the ESC key, and spamming spacebar should restart the run from there.  If no R key fix, then at least do this for accessibility.\n- There is no separate hotkey for the EAT action.  I hate that you cannot move the EAT action away from the S key, which is a movement key that I find myself pressing inadvertently when around enemies (as a crouch key) or when slamming onto the ground near sloped edges (several video games I am playing right now cause a sliding action when you crouch on a sloped surface from a jump; I find myself mimicking those input styles without intending to).  This action is ingrained in my muscle memory, and I can't tell you how many times I've eaten something by sheer accident in this game because of this issue.\n- Please for the love of the lord let me SPRINT.  Along with the crouch issue that I was having above, I find myself holding down the shift key when I am trying to move fast regardless if it does anything at all.  I don't care if it's a button that gets me killed faster or ends up saving my ass - that's a gamble I'm willing to take.  Just let me have it - it'll be FUN!  (and completely shake up the speedrunning community but that's something we can live with, no?)\n\nIn all seriousness, I want to love this game, but the input issues are preventing me from doing so to the degree that I can recommend it outright; usability and accessibility in control schemes and UI are extremely important to me and my satisfaction with a game, and as it stands, I would NOT recommend this game to a player like me.  If you aren't the anal type like myself, get this game!\n\n[b][u]Edit after putting in a decent amount of time with this game and suffering (got the enraged the gods achievement):[/u][/b] still clunky in the beginning of the game - my opinion won't change on that at this point, and it can completely kill all motivation to play when you finally feel like you have a run going only to get destroyed 0.2 seconds later by a sudden gangbang of gunners that explode out of one of them.  (I'll boot up Vamp Survivors or something just to take a break when a big death happens tbh; it hurts.)\n\nIt feels needlessly slow and painful both in the beginning.  I suffered through the resets though and learned.  The game hotkey for EAT still need to be able to be rebound - I am still making those mistakes.  And yeah, I still feel like sliding and sprinting would make this game feel at least somewhat less clunky and really give some extra dynamics  - sprinting could be like half the speed boost of Accelerium potion or something and affect your levitation time, and sliding could be given different properties depending on the stain you have (slime speeding you up on most surfaces for example; perhaps blood increases friction etc - you get the idea).  I mean, it's just waiting to happen; if it doesn't get done by the dev, I'll probably mod it in at some point soon myself.  \n\nOther than that, I'm going to play my next foreseeable runs with mods at this point even though I'm nowhere near beating this game in vanilla; looking at the steam workshop, adding the Bags mod that adds a whole inventory + the passive health regen mod + health drop mod + Advanced Map sounds like a much more well-rounded experience.  I might even try the checkpoint mod if I still get frustrated to losing a run to a stupid death; perhaps I'll feel a bit more inclined to actually explore the damned game if I feel like I have the survivability to do so, and these mods will give that.",

      "review": "I'm leaving a negative review to highlight some major frustrations with the game's reset-ability and play-ability.  I enjoy Noita a lot (if the frustrations listed below don't bother you, then GET THIS GAME), but these frustrations are getting in the way of a truly enjoyable experience for me, and I'd love to see them addressed ASAP (if possible).\n\n- There is no quick reset button/key.  I make mistakes often, and I am pretty aware at this point whether a mistake ends a run or if a mistake can be lived through without much issue.  I don't want to have to click something 5 times to make that reset happen.  Quick-resetting is a core feature in most rogue-likes, and is sorely missed here.  I'd love everything in the world to hold down R for a second to reset immediately when I get bomb wand as a starter because bomb wand is gross and you know it - I actually suicide sometimes just to spruce up the resets instead of menu-whoring everytime.  Speaking of which:\n- When starting a new game, you must manually click every button starting from the pause menu...  None of the selections are automatically highlighted to facilitate inputs via spacebar inputs instead of having to aim and click each option, and you can't highlight menu options with WASD keys (YOU ABSOLUTELY SHOULD - accessibility in menus would dramatically improve with this feature, especially for those that struggle to use a mouse and have to use special keyboard inputs to play the game at all).  Restart should be the first highlighted option upon hitting the ESC key, and spamming spacebar should restart the run from there.  If no R key fix, then at least do this for accessibility.\n- There is no separate hotkey for the EAT action.  I hate that you cannot move the EAT action away from the S key, which is a movement key that I find myself pressing inadvertently when around enemies (as a crouch key) or when slamming onto the ground near sloped edges (several video games I am playing right now cause a sliding action when you crouch on a sloped surface from a jump; I find myself mimicking those input styles without intending to).  This action is ingrained in my muscle memory, and I can't tell you how many times I've eaten something by sheer accident in this game because of this issue.\n- Please for the love of the lord let me SPRINT.  Along with the crouch issue that I was having above, I find myself holding down the shift key when I am trying to move fast regardless if it does anything at all.  I don't care if it's a button that gets me killed faster or ends up saving my ass - that's a gamble I'm willing to take.  Just let me have it - it'll be FUN!  (and completely shake up the speedrunning community but that's something we can live with, no?)\n\nIn all seriousness, I want to love this game, but the input issues are preventing me from doing so to the degree that I can recommend it outright; usability and accessibility in control schemes and UI are extremely important to me and my satisfaction with a game, and as it stands, I would NOT recommend this game to a player like me.  If you aren't the anal type like myself, get this game!\n\n[b][u]Edit after putting in a decent amount of time with this game and suffering (got the enraged the gods achievement):[/u][/b] still clunky in the beginning of the game - my opinion won't change on that at this point, and it can completely kill all motivation to play when you finally feel like you have a run going only to get destroyed 0.2 seconds later by a sudden gangbang of gunners that explode out of one of them.  (I'll boot up Vamp Survivors or something just to take a break when a big death happens tbh; it hurts.)\n\nIt feels needlessly slow and painful both in the beginning.  I suffered through the resets though and learned.  The game hotkey for EAT still need to be able to be rebound - I am still making those mistakes.  And yeah, I still feel like sliding and sprinting would make this game feel at least somewhat less clunky and really give some extra dynamics  - sprinting could be like half the speed boost of Accelerium potion or something and affect your levitation time, and sliding could be given different properties depending on the stain you have (slime speeding you up on most surfaces for example; perhaps blood increases friction etc - you get the idea).  I mean, it's just waiting to happen; if it doesn't get done by the dev, I'll probably mod it in at some point soon myself.  \n\nOther than that, I'm going to play my next foreseeable runs with mods at this point even though I'm nowhere near beating this game in vanilla; looking at the steam workshop, adding the Bags mod that adds a whole inventory + the passive health regen mod + health drop mod + Advanced Map sounds like a much more well-rounded experience.  I might even try the checkpoint mod if I still get frustrated to losing a run to a stupid death; perhaps I'll feel a bit more inclined to actually explore the damned game if I feel like I have the survivability to do so, and these mods will give that.",

The pixel physics are unlike anything else out there.\nAnd then you actually try to play it.\n\nYes, Noita was designed to be punishing. The environments are hostile by intent. That’s great — hard games can be amazing. But Noita crosses the line where it stops feeling like a challenge and becomes a completely unnecessary grind.\n\nAn example of this is editing your wands. You have to go back and forth, taking wands from the level, going to the holy mountain, putting them in your inventory or wand, then returning multiple times. This can add about 20 minutes of tedious grind if the spells you want are on a few separate wands. There isn't 'skill' involved here; it's just about how much time you're willing to waste gathering the right components.\n\nThat was just one part of the game that's made into a completely unneeded time-waster. There are Parallel Worlds, early-game excessive gold farming, and scouring for wands and health. All these aren't 'skill issue' things. It's a repetitive grind you have to do that wastes so much time. Simple quality-of-life changes, like making hearts glow like wands or allowing you to take spells off wands without any perks, would make the game so much more enjoyable.\n\nThe one system that really sings is spellcrafting — clever, flexible, endlessly creative. But most of the time, you’ll have to scrounge the entire map or be lucky enough to enjoy it properly.\n\nYes, the physics are amazing. But physics alone don’t make a game. After the novelty wears off, what’s left is a grind that mistakes cruelty for difficulty and chaos for fun.",

How many times I died to the most random shit in this game? An enemy picking up/ having an extremly dangerous wand resulting nuking u and the entire screen. A Worm triggering the anger of gods, so steve whips your a**, because u cannot fight him at that point of time. A teleportbolt slitghtly mislined and hitting a lamp, so u get electirfied to death. The electricity mechanic at all, that forces u for every longer run to have electricity immunity otherwise u get stunlocked to death at some point. Polymorphing liquids and enemies, for which there is no real applicable immunity. And then a lot of spells, which most of the time kill u instead of any enemy. etc etc etc.\r\n\r\nIf u played more of this game, every run tend to revoles around the same 8 perks and the same 15 spells, because most of the other spells and perks are utterly neglectable, except you have some lucky combination. And at some point in a long run, the game itself provides no realy challange except your own stupidity or lack of knowledge. Thus resulting in either blaming yourself for you own inadequateness or studying more the noita wiki pages and youtube videos than actually playing this god damn game.\r\n\r\nAnd its really sad, because overall the wandbuilding, the mystrious sandbox world and even the alchemy are really cool and unique elements to this game and I enjoyed them so much. But too many poorly thoughtout (or just sadistic) game mechanics makes the whole experience either frustating repetative or painfully over-cautious. Either you choose to play nervously patiently for 5 hours, only to die to some random shit or you go more speedy and recklessly, resulting dying over and over again until u hit a promising seed.

There are no explanation at all in the game, no lore no quests, no reason to be there in fact. \nA quick example : I'm buying a spell, the main character looks like a mage, so how can I use that spell ? Well go on reddit and find a guy who asks the same and has luckily an answer telling him spells are a craft component for wands. Why not, but damn give some explanation on how to do stuff in the game if it's not completely obvious!\n\nThe game feels so lazy on the explanation part, that I'm quite frankly not hyped at all.",

      "review": "I'm leaving a negative review to highlight some major frustrations with the game's reset-ability and play-ability.  I enjoy Noita a lot (if the frustrations listed below don't bother you, then GET THIS GAME), but these frustrations are getting in the way of a truly enjoyable experience for me, and I'd love to see them addressed ASAP (if possible).\n\n- There is no quick reset button/key.  I make mistakes often, and I am pretty aware at this point whether a mistake ends a run or if a mistake can be lived through without much issue.  I don't want to have to click something 5 times to make that reset happen.  Quick-resetting is a core feature in most rogue-likes, and is sorely missed here.  I'd love everything in the world to hold down R for a second to reset immediately when I get bomb wand as a starter because bomb wand is gross and you know it - I actually suicide sometimes just to spruce up the resets instead of menu-whoring everytime.  Speaking of which:\n- When starting a new game, you must manually click every button starting from the pause menu...  None of the selections are automatically highlighted to facilitate inputs via spacebar inputs instead of having to aim and click each option, and you can't highlight menu options with WASD keys (YOU ABSOLUTELY SHOULD - accessibility in menus would dramatically improve with this feature, especially for those that struggle to use a mouse and have to use special keyboard inputs to play the game at all).  Restart should be the first highlighted option upon hitting the ESC key, and spamming spacebar should restart the run from there.  If no R key fix, then at least do this for accessibility.\n- There is no separate hotkey for the EAT action.  I hate that you cannot move the EAT action away from the S key, which is a movement key that I find myself pressing inadvertently when around enemies (as a crouch key) or when slamming onto the ground near sloped edges (several video games I am playing right now cause a sliding action when you crouch on a sloped surface from a jump; I find myself mimicking those input styles without intending to).  This action is ingrained in my muscle memory, and I can't tell you how many times I've eaten something by sheer accident in this game because of this issue.\n- Please for the love of the lord let me SPRINT.  Along with the crouch issue that I was having above, I find myself holding down the shift key when I am trying to move fast regardless if it does anything at all.  I don't care if it's a button that gets me killed faster or ends up saving my ass - that's a gamble I'm willing to take.  Just let me have it - it'll be FUN!  (and completely shake up the speedrunning community but that's something we can live with, no?)\n\nIn all seriousness, I want to love this game, but the input issues are preventing me from doing so to the degree that I can recommend it outright; usability and accessibility in control schemes and UI are extremely important to me and my satisfaction with a game, and as it stands, I would NOT recommend this game to a player like me.  If you aren't the anal type like myself, get this game!\n\n[b][u]Edit after putting in a decent amount of time with this game and suffering (got the enraged the gods achievement):[/u][/b] still clunky in the beginning of the game - my opinion won't change on that at this point, and it can completely kill all motivation to play when you finally feel like you have a run going only to get destroyed 0.2 seconds later by a sudden gangbang of gunners that explode out of one of them.  (I'll boot up Vamp Survivors or something just to take a break when a big death happens tbh; it hurts.)\n\nIt feels needlessly slow and painful both in the beginning.  I suffered through the resets though and learned.  The game hotkey for EAT still need to be able to be rebound - I am still making those mistakes.  And yeah, I still feel like sliding and sprinting would make this game feel at least somewhat less clunky and really give some extra dynamics  - sprinting could be like half the speed boost of Accelerium potion or something and affect your levitation time, and sliding could be given different properties depending on the stain you have (slime speeding you up on most surfaces for example; perhaps blood increases friction etc - you get the idea).  I mean, it's just waiting to happen; if it doesn't get done by the dev, I'll probably mod it in at some point soon myself.  \n\nOther than that, I'm going to play my next foreseeable runs with mods at this point even though I'm nowhere near beating this game in vanilla; looking at the steam workshop, adding the Bags mod that adds a whole inventory + the passive health regen mod + health drop mod + Advanced Map sounds like a much more well-rounded experience.  I might even try the checkpoint mod if I still get frustrated to losing a run to a stupid death; perhaps I'll feel a bit more inclined to actually explore the damned game if I feel like I have the survivability to do so, and these mods will give that.",

Where is the detailed so-called simulation when I am digging through ground? Why is the one major selling point of this game absent from one of the core mechanics? The amount of times I have been digging only to be stopped by a single flying pixel is insane.\n\nI also absolutely adore how stains work too, touched one pixel of toxic sludge? Fuck you take 6-12 damage unavoidably. Why do things like lava and toxic sludge completely cover your character from a single touch, but things like water and ambrosia evaporate instantly?",

That makes this game 40 dollars total in order to get out of it what I wanted. an easy to mod game I could play once in a while with my wife.
