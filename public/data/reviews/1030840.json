      "review": "Mafia: Definitive Edition is a masterclass in how to faithfully remake a classic without diluting its original identity. Hangar 13 has managed to respect the 2002 original while modernizing nearly every aspect to meet contemporary expectations, creating a cinematic crime experience that feels both nostalgic and fresh. It’s worth noting that some content from the original game has been trimmed, resulting in a slightly shorter overall experience, but this streamlining mostly benefits pacing and keeps the narrative tightly focused.\n\nThe gameplay is deliberate and rewarding. Driving, while intentionally weighty to reflect the period’s automotive design, feels satisfying and immersive. Gunplay has been upgraded to feel heavier and more impactful, with each shot reinforcing the tension of confrontations. While the game doesn’t offer the freedom of modern open-world titles, this linearity is deliberate: it ensures pacing remains tight, mission design purposeful, and narrative momentum uninterrupted. The world of Lost Heaven is densely crafted not sprawling, but every street, building, and ambient detail contributes to the city’s immersive noir atmosphere.\n\nStorytelling remains the game’s core strength. Without spoiling any narrative beats, the characters are compelling, voice acting is top-notch, and cinematic direction elevates each scene. The missions are structured to complement the story perfectly, with a rhythm that balances action, tension, and quiet moments for reflection.\n\nVisually, the remake shines. Lighting, textures, and environmental details all work in harmony to recreate the 1930s atmosphere with remarkable fidelity. Minor technical hiccups, such as occasional frame drops or slightly rigid NPC animations, are present but rarely detract from the experience. The sound design is exceptional: orchestral scoring, environmental audio, and weapon effects all enhance immersion, reinforcing the period’s tone and mood.\n\nTechnical Performance\nMafia: Definitive Edition performs reliably in most situations. Frame rates are stable, and optimization is solid even in denser city areas. Occasional minor bugs exist, but nothing critically hampers progression or breaks immersion. The game’s engine handles the detailed urban environments well, and crashes are rare under standard conditions.\n\nPros:\n\nFaithful remake with modern enhancements\n\nExcellent storytelling and cinematic presentation\n\nDeeply immersive city design with authentic atmosphere\n\nBalanced and purposeful gameplay design\n\nStrong sound design and orchestral score\n\nSolid PC performance and optimization\n\nCons:\n\nLinear structure may feel restrictive to some players\n\nMinor frame drops and occasional rigid NPC animations\n\nSlightly shorter than the original, with some cut content\n\nMafia: Definitive Edition exemplifies how a remake should be done: respectful, immersive, and emotionally engaging. While slightly shorter than the original, it maintains the essence of the story and gameplay, delivering a tightly-paced, memorable experience. A must-play for fans of narrative-driven crime games, it balances nostalgia with modern polish, creating one of the most cinematic gaming experiences in recent years.",

      "review": "Mafia is one of the best examples of a game whose true potential reveals itself only once you start playing. I'm convinced that every gamer, no matter their experience, has at least heard of this - and I won't hesitate to say it - brilliant series.\n\nCircumstances were such that I never played the original, and only years later I finally decided to give the remake a chance - the version meant to recreate that same atmosphere and spirit in a modern shell. And I don't regret a minute spent on it.\n\nThe story is relatively short, but words can't fully describe how atmospheric and powerful it feels. Mafia becomes so emotional and immersive that only after finishing it do you truly understand why people hold it in such high regard. I would recommend it to absolutely anyone, if only for the incredible story that was once written and brought to life with such skill.\n\nOf course, the story is one thing - certain gameplay mechanics are another. I won't talk much about the driving, since it's extremely subjective and no one can really judge how cars from the 1930s \"should\" feel. But the shooting? That's worth mentioning.\n\nGunfights are a core part of the experience, and if you play on Classic mode, you'll quickly start wondering why three pistol shots feel like you're throwing peas at the enemy. There's almost no impact to the bullets. An enemy can tank three shots and keep sprinting toward you like nothing happened - which gets VERY frustrating in the middle of the game when dozens of them rush you at once.\n\nBut even with that, you can look past the flaws. The heart of the game is simply too good. And one more important thing - Mafia should never be compared to GTA, because these two games aim for completely different experiences.\n\n★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ (10/10)",

It rebuilds the entire game from the ground up while keeping the tone, atmosphere, and story completely intact.\n\nThe strongest part is the narrative. The story of Tommy Angelo and the Lost Heaven crime world is delivered with excellent pacing, memorable characters, and cutscenes that feel like a high-budget crime film. The voice acting and motion capture are genuinely top tier.\n\nThe city itself looks great. Lost Heaven isn’t a sandbox meant for side content; it’s a backdrop for the story, and it works. The rain effects, lighting, and 1930s atmosphere make every mission feel cinematic.\n\nGameplay is tighter than the original, though still a bit old-school. Driving has weight, gunfights feel punchy, and the missions are well directed. Some sections can feel linear, and a few mechanics show their age, but nothing game-breaking.\n\nPerformance is generally solid, but there can be minor dips in crowded scenes. Still, the overall experience is smooth.\n\nIf you want a story-driven crime drama with style, atmosphere, and a faithful remake of a classic, this is absolutely worth playing. It respects the original while making it more accessible and enjoyable today.\n\n[b]Verdict: A faithful, stylish, and emotional remake that does justice to a legendary game.[/b]",

Hangar 13 delivers a beautifully modernized experience that elevates the story, characters, and world without losing the heart and soul of the 2002 classic.\n\nSet in the prohibition-era city of Lost Heaven, the game instantly immerses you with its cinematic storytelling and richly detailed atmosphere. From the vintage cars to the smoky jazz clubs and rain-soaked streets, every scene feels like a frame from an iconic gangster film.\n\nThe narrative remains the star of the show—tight, emotional, and perfectly paced. Tommy Angelo’s rise through the Salieri crime family is a gripping journey of loyalty, ambition, and consequences. Characters are more human and complex than ever thanks to outstanding voice acting, motion capture, and expanded cutscenes that deepen relationships and motives.\n\nGameplay improvements are substantial: driving feels weighty and authentic, gunfights are intense and grounded, and mission design is polished and engaging. Legendary moments like The Race and Omerta are reimagined with cinematic flair and modern mechanics that enhance rather than replace the originals.\n\nThe soundtrack, sound design, and world-building create an atmosphere few games can match. Every detail shows respect for the original vision while delivering a completely fresh, modern experience.\n\nMafia: Definitive Edition isn’t just a remake—it’s a tribute. A beautifully crafted love letter to fans and a definitive way to experience one of the greatest crime stories in gaming.\n\n10/10 – Exceptional, emotional, and unforgettable.",

      "review": "(Game #18 of my 2025 100% Marathon.)\nMafia is a fantastic example of how to do many things right. Adapt a classic game for modern audiences while remaining faithful to the original: check. Portray a slice of history and a subculture in a way that engrosses the player in its worldbuilding: check. Tell a genre story that hits all the expected beats without coming off as overly cliche: check. Offer multiple options that both increase immersion and gameplay depth (manual transmission driving mode): check. Put simply, it's a great experience in a tight package and you won't regret spending a week getting lost in Lost Heaven.\nFrom the completionist standpoint, 100% is pretty easy to achieve. The open world collectibles will give you a tough time if you are going sans-guide, especially the foxes, but magazines and cigarette boxes show up on your minimap when you are close. Beating the game on Classic difficulty is also not too bad, outside of the most infamous mission in the series, aka the Racetrack of Rage. Still, a fair 100% run that won't overstay its welcome.",

      "review": "Review: Mafia: Definitive Edition – A Reborn Classic\r\n\r\nRating: ⭐⭐⭐☆ (3/5)\r\n\r\nWhen Mafia: Definitive Edition arrived, it wasn’t just a remake — it was an attempt to resurrect one of the most iconic story-driven games of the early 2000s for a modern audience. Hangar 13 rebuilt the entire experience from the ground up, aiming to preserve the soul of the original while delivering cinematic visuals, enhanced gameplay, and deeper emotional impact.\r\n\r\nThe result is a stylish and atmospheric return to Lost Heaven, but one that occasionally stumbles under the weight of technical issues and inconsistent AI.\r\n\r\n🎬 Story – The Rise and Fall of Tommy Angelo\r\n\r\nAt its heart, Mafia remains a character-driven crime drama. You follow taxi driver Tommy Angelo as he’s pulled into the criminal underworld of Lost Heaven — a tale of loyalty, betrayal, and survival.\r\n\r\nThe remake amplifies every emotional beat:\r\n\r\nCutscenes are beautifully re-animated.\r\n\r\nCharacters have more depth and nuance.\r\n\r\nDialogues feel sharper and more grounded.\r\n\r\nWhile the plot doesn’t stray far from mafia-genre conventions, it’s engaging from start to finish. The pacing becomes stronger in the later chapters, delivering a memorable and dramatic conclusion that honors the original game.\r\n\r\n🔫 Gunplay – Old-School Action with a Modern Shine\r\n\r\nCombat in Mafia: Definitive Edition strikes a balance between classic and modern. Weapons feel weighty and powerful, and every encounter is tightly scripted to maintain tension.\r\n\r\nThe gunplay isn’t groundbreaking, but it is fun:\r\n\r\nSatisfying recoil\r\n\r\nClear feedback\r\n\r\nPunchy sound design\r\n\r\nHowever, shooting from vehicles is more limited than it could be. The aiming system tends to lock onto targets rather than offering full freedom, making drive-by combat less dynamic. Still, overall gunplay fits the gritty tone of the world.\r\n\r\n🚗 Driving – Heavy, Dangerous, and Atmospheric\r\n\r\nDriving is one of the standout aspects of the remake. Cars feel like authentic 1930s machines — heavy, loud, and sometimes unpredictable. They slide on sharp turns, shake on rough streets, and punish reckless speeding.\r\n\r\nThis gives the gameplay a grounded, dangerous edge. High-speed chases feel intense, and even basic cruising through the city carries a sense of immersion.\r\n\r\nThat said, the handling can feel a bit stiff at times. It’s realistic, but not always smooth.\r\n\r\n👥 NPCs and Police – Immersive but Inconsistent\r\n\r\nNPC behavior is a mixed bag.\r\nSometimes enemies use cover intelligently and provide a solid challenge. Other times they run into your bullets or stand still in the open.\r\n\r\nThe police system is more interesting:\r\n\r\nOfficers respond to speeding, crashes, and violence\r\n\r\nChase intensity escalates logically\r\n\r\nEscaping the law can be thrilling\r\n\r\nHowever, it’s also flawed. Witnesses seem to report crimes instantly, and police can be either too easy or oddly unpredictable. Despite this inconsistency, the police system adds tension and charm to the world — and is often one of the more entertaining mechanics.\r\n\r\n🎨 Graphics – A Beautiful Tribute to a Classic\r\n\r\nVisually, Mafia: Definitive Edition shines.\r\nLost Heaven is fully reimagined with stunning lighting, detailed environments, and expressive characters.\r\n\r\nThe highlight is the atmosphere:\r\n\r\nRain-soaked streets reflect neon lights\r\n\r\nFog-covered docks ooze noir identity\r\n\r\nInteriors feel handcrafted and cinematic\r\n\r\nThe game looks so good that your original 4/5 graphics rating is completely justified.\r\n\r\n🐞 Technical Issues – The Remake’s Biggest Weakness\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the game suffers from frequent issues:\r\n\r\nNPCs getting stuck\r\n\r\nMissions failing to trigger\r\n\r\nCars behaving oddly or clipping\r\n\r\nGraphical glitches\r\n\r\nOccasional crashes\r\n\r\nThese bugs don’t break the game entirely, but they can disrupt immersion and force restarts. For a narrative-focused remake, these problems stand out.\r\n\r\n🏁 Conclusion – A Stylish Return with Noticeable Flaws\r\n\r\nMafia: Definitive Edition succeeds in many ways:\r\n+ Strong narrative and cinematic presentation\r\n+ Excellent atmosphere and visual design\r\n+ Weighty, engaging driving mechanics\r\n+ Authentic worldbuilding and period detail\r\n\r\nBut it’s held back by:\r\n– Frequent bugs\r\n– Inconsistent NPC and police AI\r\n– Some limitations in combat and vehicle shooting\r\n\r\nYour personal rating of 3/5 is a fair reflection. This is a game filled with memorable moments and emotional storytelling, but it struggles to reach true greatness due to technical shortcomings.\r\n\r\nFor fans of crime dramas, 1930s atmosphere, or story-driven experiences, it’s absolutely worth playing — just expect a few rough edges along the way.",

They defy physics as they literally slide left and right instead of just steering like a normal car, causing you to crash into other oncoming vehicles and objects very frequently. \n\nThe range of weapons is quite limited and I found myself using the tommy gun most of the time because it was a good balance of fire rate, range and damage. The stealth mechanics aren't anything special, however if you approach someone with a knife from behind, the character pretty much forgets he has it as he knocks them out with his fists, which works too I guess.\n\nAll in all it's a good game that tells you of the harsh reality of what mafias are really like and what friendship, family and loyalty really mean in the bigger picture.",

The remake will enforce a 60fps lock on the game unless you tick this option. You will notice a big difference in smoothness\nThere is also a lot of blur due to TAA and another upscaling technologies, try turning Anti Aliasing down to Low\n\nA Remake of Mafia 1 from 2002, it shines itself in Classy Gangster Story set between the Prohibition Era and the year prior to WW2. The Remake plays a lot more like Mafia 3, and while not being as ambiguous as that game was, it shines it in straight forward mission, time of of gameplay and setting which they have nailed.\nStarting in the late 1920's you'll experience a series of events between a gang which attempts to assert themself over the fictional city of Lost Heaven, between a man who has to balance between his family and the criminal life.\n\nThe game reflects a lot on morality, while lacking in choice it gives a very good story that you can play on with just within a few days on and off. Time is reflected in the game well with its setting, the longer you play the more the cars change to represent the time for example.\n\nHowever that's not to say there is just good things with the remake of Mafia 1. Cutscenes sometimes do not play Audio which can the immersion a lot before it returns when you start playing. The game is overall blurry, as most modern games has become due to the heavy usage of upscaling technologies. Not only that but during cutscenes, the game uses an extreme amount of resources to play the cutscenes even if they are paused, which should signify a leak.\nThe intro before starting the game is unskippable, and so is the nearly 15 min long credits list at the end of the game, so that can be a drag to have to play through if you are going to open and close the game often. Movement can also feel a bit sluggish, but it was designed in such a way to make it more natural between the mechanics in the game\n\nBut overall it is a very solid good game for both newcomers and returning fans of the franchise.\n\nDrag & Drop mods I used for the duration of the game:\n- No intro mod\nhttps://www.nexusmods.com/mafiadefinitiveedition/mods/1\n- Better Reticles\nhttps://www.nexusmods.com/mafiadefinitiveedition/mods/64\n- FPS lock changer and more FOV options\nhttps://www.nexusmods.com/mafiadefinitiveedition/mods/104",

And in most cases (on Normal difficulty) you can smash your way thru most of the free play missions without even really trying. For ex, there's a racer car driving mission. You can literally send your 30s era race car airborne, smash it into a fuel truck, launch that fuel truck as if you were driving a tank AND still keep racing like none of that just happened. \r\n\r\nBut having said all that, it was still enjoyable. To get the most out of it, you need block of time you can focus on the game (rather than multi-tasking) as it's more like watching a movie with little games mixed in at various points. If I had to 1 line summarize the whole thing, it's a visual novel / movie with a driving simulator. If you're coming into this expecting mostly FPS action because that's how it was marketed? Then you're going to be disappointed as that's few and far in between. \r\n\r\nI got this on a Mafia Triology Package sale and even without it's limitations I still got more than my $s worth out of it.",

The world of Lost Heaven has been beautifully rebuilt, capturing the essence of Prohibition-era America with detailed streets, vintage cars, and a powerful soundtrack that sells the era.\n\nGameplay has been vastly improved.

From the moment the game begins, it pulls you into a beautifully crafted world that feels rich, believable, and full of atmosphere. Lost Heaven isn’t just a backdrop — it’s a living, breathing city that captures the spirit of the 1930s in every street corner, every neon sign, and every radio tune drifting through the air.\n\nThe story is where this game truly shines. It’s emotional, mature, and incredibly well-paced, with characters that feel human and complex. You’re not just playing through missions — you’re watching a man’s life unfold, complete with loyalty, betrayal, and the heavy price of living in the criminal underworld. Every chapter adds something meaningful, and by the end, it genuinely feels like you’ve been part of something special.\n\nThe soundtrack is phenomenal. It sets the perfect tone for every moment — whether you’re in a tense chase, a quiet character scene, or simply cruising through the city at night. Combined with the strong voice acting and cinematic presentation, the entire experience feels like a high-quality crime drama brought to life.\n\nThe missions are varied, dramatic, and incredibly well put together. Not a single one feels like filler. Each has personality and purpose, and they all build the world and story in their own way. It honestly makes me wonder: why aren’t they making games like this anymore? Games with this level of focus, heart, and attention to detail are becoming rare.\n\nOverall, Mafia: Definitive Edition is the kind of remake that sets the standard — respectful to the original, yet polished into something timeless. If you love strong stories, unforgettable characters, and worlds that feel alive, this game is a must-play.\n\nA genuine masterpiece from start to finish.",

The story is OK. It’s a very typical, cliched mafia narrative but engaging enough and the voice acting is mostly good. The remake improved some mechanics and streamlined game play. \n\nIt’s technically “open world,” but most missions are confined to one particular area and there’s basically nothing to do or see to make exploring worthwhile. It can be fun/chill to cruise around the city for a little bit in old cars, but the novelty of that wears off fast.

The jury is still out on that. However, it's a well-executed addition to mob stories. And the Definitive Edition ups the ante - this game is a feast for the eyes!  Mangia!

Can't really comment too much on combat and driving since you're basically handling antiques, it's alright at best.\r\n\r\nWhat I enjoyed the most was seeing how the city evolves each mission, cars get more modern, buildings get bigger, roads get cleaner. Granted, the depression era didn't have much to look at but the world feels alive enough, even though you'll rarely venture off the road the game tells you to go.\r\n\r\nMy biggest complaint would be how unrealistic the game is. It does it's best to stay historically correct but then puts you in missions that feel more like GTA 5 than being in the mob.\r\n\r\nYou go from some random taxi driver to racing in what back would've been the F1. Then you're killing a few precincts worth of cops while smuggling booze, and a few more dozen after you snipe down a congressman. It just all feels a bit too Grand Theft Auto.\r\n\r\nSolid 7/10 game. \r\nCould've used more 'Godfather' and less 'Grand Theft Auto'.",

      "review": "I really enjoy the Mafia series. The world building and environments Hangar 13 creates are some of the best parts of these games, especially since you rarely get to see settings like these in other titles. This remake does a great job capturing the late 20s and 30s, along with the brief time it spends in the 50s. The series means a lot to me. That said, Mafia Definitive Edition somehow made me want to play Mafia 3 instead of continuing with it, which is something I never thought would happen considering Mafia 3 is mostly remembered for the clip of the mom yelling at the kid to go to the bathroom.\r\n\r\nThis game frustrates me as a player. I enjoyed parts of it, but I cannot call it a good game without hesitation. It improves on Mafia 3 in some areas and falls behind in others. Mafia 3 is a full open world game while this one technically has an open world but gives you nothing to do in it outside of the story missions. There are no side missions, no activities, nothing to progress outside the main path. Areas are locked behind story beats along with collectibles. If you miss a collectible during a mission you need to replay the story just to grab it. It drives me crazy because the world itself is incredible, but the game does not make use of it. There is so much potential and it just feels wasted.\r\n\r\nThe gunplay can be great when it decides to function. While driving you can aim your gun, but there is no option to turn off the reticle. It is not awful by itself, except when a police car pulls up beside you and the reticle starts drifting around. When shooting at cars you can wait for the reticle to tighten for better accuracy, but it takes so long that it is easier to just spam the fire button and reload. I would not even bother with the careful shooting mechanic unless the game gave you infinite ammo. Running away is often more effective than actually fighting.\r\n\r\nWhen the shooting works, the game feels fantastic. Sadly there are invisible walls around many objects enemies hide behind. The cover system is decent but not very intuitive, and the controls can feel awkward. The game expects you to rely on cover constantly. On medium difficulty, if you get hit you must take cover right away or you will drop instantly. Running and gunning is almost never allowed. You only regenerate a tiny sliver of health, enough to survive a single hit. I am not asking for the game to let you sprint through firefights with no consequences, but the cover system becomes dull when the game forces you to rely on it every moment. It feels like a version of Gears of War without any of the style or excitement that makes Gears fun. The one thing I can praise without hesitation is the shotgun. It was my favorite weapon in Mafia 3 and it is just as satisfying here.\r\n\r\nThe PC port is rough. It honestly feels like it needed more time in development. All of the cinematics are locked to something above 30 frames but definitely not 60. There is constant pop in that causes lag and ruins the beauty of the city. I often stop to appreciate how incredible the game looks at night only to get distracted by objects and lights popping into existence. Visual fidelity also suffers. I am playing on high settings and reflections sometimes look unfinished, with white specks appearing instead of proper lighting.\r\n\r\nThe controls are another problem. On PC the sensitivity slider is awful. There is no separate slider for the menus, so lowering your in game sensitivity makes the menus painful to use. The default is 5, and I had to drop it to 0.6, but that made navigating menus feel like that image of Syphilis pushing the boulder up a hill. To make it worse the game has mouse acceleration on by default, so the mouse always feels slippery. I switched to a controller because of this, even though the gunplay would be better with a mouse.\r\n\r\nController controls are not great either. It feels like the game intentionally remapped every standard button just to be different. Everyone knows Y or Triangle is used to enter vehicles, it is X or Square. Everyone knows X or Square is used to melee, it is B or Circle. Jump is Y or Triangle instead of A or X. None of it feels natural. There are plenty of unused dpad buttons while the back button is mapped to the car speed limiter for some reason.\r\n\r\nThe game also freezes at random times, and you can die instantly if you run near a sloped surface or anything that is not perfectly flat. I wish I could recommend the game without hesitation, but in its current condition I cannot. If you are a fan of the series and never played the first game because of how rough the original PC version was, I would suggest waiting for a sale. At around nine hours, it is not worth full price in this state.",

      "review": "the game design for the fifth mission is piss poor when played on the highest difficulty\n\ni didn't buy this game to competitively race 1930s cars, but too bad, have to win the race to progress\n\nthis wouldn't be a big deal if the driving mechanics were grounded at all, but of course they aren't\n\nthe only way i found to consistently do well is to use the \"ram another car\" button to carve into turns better, which for a difficulty setting described as \"simulation\", is kind of hilarious\n\nregardless of consistently getting first place into the final lap, the rng with traction causes the car to spin out in situations where it really seems like it shouldn't, leading to frustrating restarts just shy of winning the level\n\nthere also seems to be a rubber banding effect for the CPUs, or maybe their cars are just faster, because the 2nd / 3rd place cars always closed the gap on me in the final turn before the end of lap\n\ni'm going into way too much detail for this, TLDR the base requirement of a game is to be fun or enjoyable, and this mission ruined that for me, which is why I dropped it\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nupdate:\nmanaged to win the race shortly after posting this, a trick i found that i didn't see mentioned online is that on the first corner, you can crash through hay bales and cut over the grass, rather than making that sharp turn with the gravel on the outside, consistently gets me close to 1st place from the start\n\nstill leaving my review as not recommended, because this race left a bad taste in what has otherwise been an entertaining experience\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nupdate 2:\nfinished the game, and feeling very underwhelmed compared to when i played mafia 2 a decade ago\n\nthe story didn't grab me, i did not find the characters particularly compelling, and overall it felt as if large swathes of the content was missing\n\nthere was zero emotional impact that i felt during the narrative's climax, and the reason why is because it was undeserved... the main trio is supposed to come across as best friends, brothers even, but where is that development happening? the plot skipped around so much, running to get to the next action scene, that i never saw these characters live like real people\n\nthe protagonist's family is barely shown, we rarely get to see the cast goofing off or doing low stakes jobs, i don't even recall the characters emotionally opening up to each other until the 2nd last chapter\n\nthis problem extends to other areas as well; thematically, how can i suspend my disbelief that this is about the mafia when the majority of levels play like a GTA mission? there is no discretion and the violence is on display for half the city to see\n\nwhere is the hiding of bodies, covering up crimes, staying off the police's radar, etc? how do these losers not get arrested when there is a literal mountain of evidence left behind after each mission? silencing one witness by starting a massive gang battle that ends with dozens of cops dead would not get you off scot-free in any reality\n\nnot to mention that the gameplay loop gets stale pretty fast anyways; drive here, shoot a couple dozen enemies, oh no the cops showed up, drive away to lose the heat, now drive some more to get back to base!! the only time this gets broken up is with the odd stealth segment, which of course is rarely done well in action games, and this is no exception\n\nthe gameplay systems are also shallow... i recall that in mafia 2, a game released a decade before this remake, if the cops were onto you, they would register your car and license plate, which needed to be ditched or changed at a body shop to become inconspicuous\n\nhowever, none of that applies here, because the police have the memory of a goldfish; drive two blocks away and it's like the crime never happened! that's far from the only aspect of gameplay that was downgraded between these releases, and a similar comparison can be drawn with character customization (ie clothing options), free roam opportunities between missions (such as robbing stores), etc, the list goes on and on\n\nthere are a number of technical issues that impact enjoyment as well, such as full screen / borderless bugs, the game freezing whenever the controller disconnects, cars often getting stuck into positions that prevent further movement, inconsistent rules when it comes to hitting stationary objects while driving, cover that can't be taken on certain objects, or just bugged out entirely, unable to shoot at enemies because the game thinks you're looking at a wall\n\noverall, i did not have much fun playing this game, i would not recommend it to a friend, and i do not understand how this rated so highly with how barebones of an experience it is\n\ninstead, i recommend to play mafia 2, which i think executes the ideas in this game at a higher calibre and to greater player satisfaction",

      "review": "As someone who finished the original Mafia at least 50 times over the last 23 years I can confidently say that this \"remake\" is an absolute travesty. \n\nThe biggest problem that struck me from the get go is the dialogue. It's rewritten in a way that makes characters talk like aliens rather than human beings. In countless moments it even feels like writers mixed up the lines between characters, resulting in pure illogical nonsense. In other cases the wording is more or less on par with the original but the delivery falls flat on its ass because of either poor voice acting or completely misunderstood dramaturgy of a given scene. \n\nFurthermore, whenever script tries to deviate from original it mostly ends up being a disaster. Two examples come to mind: [spoiler]in the remake, Sam actually asks you to spare Michelle but in the end he still tells you \"lmao you let her live and cant be trusted\", ridiculous.[/spoiler] Second example: [spoiler]You are actually told about diamonds by Salieri himself and the twist is replaced by drugs being in the crates instead - another completely unnecessary change.[/spoiler]\n\nGameplay-wise the sandbox feel from the original is gone. Game hand holds you in every direction and even on Classic difficulty you get overloaded with UI guidance. A lot of unnecessary activities like meaningless collectibles were added while genuinely good stuff like Bertone side missions was cut out. The whole experience feels rushed and too streamlined. They cut out like 90% of driving from the original game which is not always a bad thing but...you no longer have time to decompress from the missions by simply driving around town. Game just wraps up one mission and throws you into the next.\n\nOn the positive note, the visual presentation is decent and Lost Heaven has some nice touches to it. I can also appreciate an effort to expand certain parts of the story and give some elements different spin (i.e. making Sara a fully fledged character). \n\nAll in all, in the words of Czech classic: \"Hezký, ale k hovnu.\"",

Red Dead 2 had more gameplay and content over this mostly main story only, glorified chauffering/driving simulator that just so happened to have gunfights every so often. I only just wish it didn't take forever for Angelo to die before letting me retry the mission segment again. Arthur Morgan/Jon Marston took ~1 secs before asking if you want to try again. Gets real frustrating after a while. It's like the game wants to deliberately waste your time by [i]neenering[/i] at you for \"sucking\" I guess.\n\nBesides, the racing segments on both Red Dead games were far more tolerable than this playable movie's. The stealth missions in Red Dead 2 weren't a pain to deal with either. And speaking of racing - whose bright idea was it to make a poorly designed racing segment a mandatory part of the main story? Sure, RDR1 has it but even for a game made in the 2010s it wasn't a huge slog to go through. Just tap the speed button, don't exhaust your horse's stamina, stay on the road and you're good. \n\nHere? Not only does the car you're given handle like shit at fast speed, the racetrack's also littered with these insane curves and obstacles that you need to have the foresight of to be able to drift through without colliding onto them, damaging your car, losing speed and falling back in the process. Oh, and did I mention the mission also demands your car \"not be too damaged\"? Yeah, if you thought just handling your car was bad enough, this game had to give you another thing to worry about. Good luck trying to win this race, even on Easy. You'll be here forever.\n\nSpeaking of cars, despite having multiple vehicles, in truth, there's no incentive to use anything beyond what the game/mission offers you, considering the only content this game has is the main story.\n\nThe story was nice, but it's definitely no Red Dead. More like a Yakuza game with like, 80% of its content missing that skipped QA and called it a day. I mentioned QA because I'd frequently be greeted with a black screen when I boot it up fullscreen. Doesn't happen if I boot it up windowed and then fullscreen it once inside the game though. Besides that, the game also froze up at one point during the Election Campaign mission when I toggled fullscreen. So, there's that.\n\nI'd highly suggest just watching it on YouTube as the story is the main thing here. The gameplay's pretty dull and buggy anyway.",

      "review": "I really enjoy the Mafia series. The world building and environments Hangar 13 creates are some of the best parts of these games, especially since you rarely get to see settings like these in other titles. This remake does a great job capturing the late 20s and 30s, along with the brief time it spends in the 50s. The series means a lot to me. That said, Mafia Definitive Edition somehow made me want to play Mafia 3 instead of continuing with it, which is something I never thought would happen considering Mafia 3 is mostly remembered for the clip of the mom yelling at the kid to go to the bathroom.\r\n\r\nThis game frustrates me as a player. I enjoyed parts of it, but I cannot call it a good game without hesitation. It improves on Mafia 3 in some areas and falls behind in others. Mafia 3 is a full open world game while this one technically has an open world but gives you nothing to do in it outside of the story missions. There are no side missions, no activities, nothing to progress outside the main path. Areas are locked behind story beats along with collectibles. If you miss a collectible during a mission you need to replay the story just to grab it. It drives me crazy because the world itself is incredible, but the game does not make use of it. There is so much potential and it just feels wasted.\r\n\r\nThe gunplay can be great when it decides to function. While driving you can aim your gun, but there is no option to turn off the reticle. It is not awful by itself, except when a police car pulls up beside you and the reticle starts drifting around. When shooting at cars you can wait for the reticle to tighten for better accuracy, but it takes so long that it is easier to just spam the fire button and reload. I would not even bother with the careful shooting mechanic unless the game gave you infinite ammo. Running away is often more effective than actually fighting.\r\n\r\nWhen the shooting works, the game feels fantastic. Sadly there are invisible walls around many objects enemies hide behind. The cover system is decent but not very intuitive, and the controls can feel awkward. The game expects you to rely on cover constantly. On medium difficulty, if you get hit you must take cover right away or you will drop instantly. Running and gunning is almost never allowed. You only regenerate a tiny sliver of health, enough to survive a single hit. I am not asking for the game to let you sprint through firefights with no consequences, but the cover system becomes dull when the game forces you to rely on it every moment. It feels like a version of Gears of War without any of the style or excitement that makes Gears fun. The one thing I can praise without hesitation is the shotgun. It was my favorite weapon in Mafia 3 and it is just as satisfying here.\r\n\r\nThe PC port is rough. It honestly feels like it needed more time in development. All of the cinematics are locked to something above 30 frames but definitely not 60. There is constant pop in that causes lag and ruins the beauty of the city. I often stop to appreciate how incredible the game looks at night only to get distracted by objects and lights popping into existence. Visual fidelity also suffers. I am playing on high settings and reflections sometimes look unfinished, with white specks appearing instead of proper lighting.\r\n\r\nThe controls are another problem. On PC the sensitivity slider is awful. There is no separate slider for the menus, so lowering your in game sensitivity makes the menus painful to use. The default is 5, and I had to drop it to 0.6, but that made navigating menus feel like that image of Syphilis pushing the boulder up a hill. To make it worse the game has mouse acceleration on by default, so the mouse always feels slippery. I switched to a controller because of this, even though the gunplay would be better with a mouse.\r\n\r\nController controls are not great either. It feels like the game intentionally remapped every standard button just to be different. Everyone knows Y or Triangle is used to enter vehicles, it is X or Square. Everyone knows X or Square is used to melee, it is B or Circle. Jump is Y or Triangle instead of A or X. None of it feels natural. There are plenty of unused dpad buttons while the back button is mapped to the car speed limiter for some reason.\r\n\r\nThe game also freezes at random times, and you can die instantly if you run near a sloped surface or anything that is not perfectly flat. I wish I could recommend the game without hesitation, but in its current condition I cannot. If you are a fan of the series and never played the first game because of how rough the original PC version was, I would suggest waiting for a sale. At around nine hours, it is not worth full price in this state.",

      "review": "0/10<--------- My honest rating. HANGAR 13 SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES.\n\nThis so called game has absolutely 0 to do with the original Mafia 1. Its filled with gamebraking bugs. The Saint and the Sinner mission is completely broken and it cannot be completed. Right after the roofs you get into the church where the game just softlocks. Nothing can fix it, the only thing you can do is to skip the mission and not play it. I even replayed the whole game from the start, naively thinking that this would fix it. But no, the shitty game softlocked again. Its increadible that nobody sued this idiotic studio, Hangar 13 for commiting such fraud. This is a spit to the face to our beloved Mafia franchise. \n\nNext, the so called classic mode is just a stupid lazy joke that creates this fake artificial difficulty. The whole game is based around nothing but luck and while forcing you to put up with the shittiest driving physics imaginable. Even GTA IV driving legendary compared to this load of turds. They basicaly took all of the driving missions and made them straight up aids for no reason. 0 skill involved, just 100% RNG based everything. Either the police spawn and you can restart, or they dont spawn and nothing happens. The fairplay mission is probably the most cancer inducing mission ever created and it kills the game completely, dead in its tracks. You just have to put the difficulty to easy during the race, otherwise the AI blatantly cheats. Their cars are like 50% faster and 100% more durrable than yours. \n\nThe gunfights on the other hand are too easy no matter the difficulty. This whole game feels cheap af and Hangar 13 is the new EA for me, after wasting my time while playing this nasty turd of a video game. \n\nCharging 40 euro for this broken, unplayable mess is a crime, because you literaly CANNOT finish the game!\nDONT EVER BUY THIS GAME. Its a waste of time and money. Its the only game ever that actually made me regret wasting my life away, trying to finish this pathetic broken down mess.\n\nSHAME ON YOU HANGAR 13, Ill make sure to never buy anything you donkeys touched.",

      "review": "As someone who finished the original Mafia at least 50 times over the last 23 years I can confidently say that this \"remake\" is an absolute travesty. \n\nThe biggest problem that struck me from the get go is the dialogue. It's rewritten in a way that makes characters talk like aliens rather than human beings. In countless moments it even feels like writers mixed up the lines between characters, resulting in pure illogical nonsense. In other cases the wording is more or less on par with the original but the delivery falls flat on its ass because of either poor voice acting or completely misunderstood dramaturgy of a given scene. \n\nFurthermore, whenever script tries to deviate from original it mostly ends up being a disaster. Two examples come to mind: [spoiler]in the remake, Sam actually asks you to spare Michelle but in the end he still tells you \"lmao you let her live and cant be trusted\", ridiculous.[/spoiler] Second example: [spoiler]You are actually told about diamonds by Salieri himself and the twist is replaced by drugs being in the crates instead - another completely unnecessary change.[/spoiler]\n\nGameplay-wise the sandbox feel from the original is gone. Game hand holds you in every direction and even on Classic difficulty you get overloaded with UI guidance. A lot of unnecessary activities like meaningless collectibles were added while genuinely good stuff like Bertone side missions was cut out. The whole experience feels rushed and too streamlined. They cut out like 90% of driving from the original game which is not always a bad thing but...you no longer have time to decompress from the missions by simply driving around town. Game just wraps up one mission and throws you into the next.\n\nOn the positive note, the visual presentation is decent and Lost Heaven has some nice touches to it. I can also appreciate an effort to expand certain parts of the story and give some elements different spin (i.e. making Sara a fully fledged character). \n\nAll in all, in the words of Czech classic: \"Hezký, ale k hovnu.\"",

Red Dead 2 had more gameplay and content over this mostly main story only, glorified chauffering/driving simulator that just so happened to have gunfights every so often. I only just wish it didn't take forever for Angelo to die before letting me retry the mission segment again. Arthur Morgan/Jon Marston took ~1 secs before asking if you want to try again. Gets real frustrating after a while. It's like the game wants to deliberately waste your time by [i]neenering[/i] at you for \"sucking\" I guess.\n\nBesides, the racing segments on both Red Dead games were far more tolerable than this playable movie's. The stealth missions in Red Dead 2 weren't a pain to deal with either. And speaking of racing - whose bright idea was it to make a poorly designed racing segment a mandatory part of the main story? Sure, RDR1 has it but even for a game made in the 2010s it wasn't a huge slog to go through. Just tap the speed button, don't exhaust your horse's stamina, stay on the road and you're good. \n\nHere? Not only does the car you're given handle like shit at fast speed, the racetrack's also littered with these insane curves and obstacles that you need to have the foresight of to be able to drift through without colliding onto them, damaging your car, losing speed and falling back in the process. Oh, and did I mention the mission also demands your car \"not be too damaged\"? Yeah, if you thought just handling your car was bad enough, this game had to give you another thing to worry about. Good luck trying to win this race, even on Easy. You'll be here forever.\n\nSpeaking of cars, despite having multiple vehicles, in truth, there's no incentive to use anything beyond what the game/mission offers you, considering the only content this game has is the main story.\n\nThe story was nice, but it's definitely no Red Dead. More like a Yakuza game with like, 80% of its content missing that skipped QA and called it a day. I mentioned QA because I'd frequently be greeted with a black screen when I boot it up fullscreen. Doesn't happen if I boot it up windowed and then fullscreen it once inside the game though. Besides that, the game also froze up at one point during the Election Campaign mission when I toggled fullscreen. So, there's that.\n\nI'd highly suggest just watching it on YouTube as the story is the main thing here. The gameplay's pretty dull and buggy anyway.",
