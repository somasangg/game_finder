      "review": "Pros: \r\n-Multiple currencies (gold, copper, stone, wood, food), influencing the way you spread out on the map, the buildings you build, the units you recruit, etc. it's a nice and refreshing take for a tw title that isn't any more or any less tedious to manage - just new and different which for me is a positive \r\n-Battles are and feel really cool. Units CLASH properly! Men feel like men, not mannequins on go-karts. \r\n-Battle Music is really awesome and heavy - I loved it. \r\n-Battles take long and soldiers feel like soldiers, they hold, and will die at what I would imagine is a realistic rate - not too quickly, not too slowly. A man clad in copper armor feels and looks right, they are heavy (for the time), they survive longer, fight longer, sound heavier, idk how to describe it but in battles there's alot of OOMPH I haven't felt since shogun 2 or mtw2. \r\n-Gods/Pantheon gives the religious aspect an interesting spin (buffs) though you don't \"need\" to invest into religion so its not in your face \r\n-I can't accurately judge this from one play-though but I think the game is well-balanced. No units or cultures are op and everyone (or every culture) stands a chance \r\n-Diplomacy AI is good, many QoL options from the menu for quick-selection, AI isn't overly generous or stupidly stubborn either \r\n-Great visuals/art-style and the campaign map is generally very pretty \r\n-Even crappy units look cool.\r\n-Battles are optimized, crashes are super rare.\r\n\r\nCons: \r\n-Not a fan of this forced apocalypse mechanic. Why should my pious kingdom of Babylon suffer just cuz some cities elsewhere aren't max upgraded? Apocalypse mechanics triggering every few turns because an insufficient number of \"holy\" cities are max upgraded on the world map doesn't make sense and isn't thrilling in the slightest. It's more of minor nuisance to deal with than an actual issue to deal with. Like, yeah sure, I'd rather take on 20 more earthquakes than bum-rush invading the campaign map just to avoid these annoying events. \r\n-Instead of focusing so much on this apocalypse theme, make it a war between gods. Faction X following gods A, B, C fight for dominion over a specific region on the campaign map between factions, Y & Z following gods D, E, F,. The winners gain religious buffs and the losers get debuffs. They lost \"holy\" territory to another culture, they deserve the debuffs. Not this forced apocalypse mechanic trash for everyone on repeat that isn't even that detrimental. THIS is way more exciting and makes me really appreciate the pantheon I choose. Now soldiers yelling the names of gods on the battlefield makes even more sense.  \r\n-Battle music was epic but the campaign music makes me sleepy\r\n-I realized as you explore more bits of the campaign map, your fps performance can dip sometimes - nothing game-breaking tho but it's there and can be annoying at times especially if you span around all the campaign map like me. \r\n-Not a fan of the outposts. Sorting them out is tedious and enemy armies absolutely love raiding them, making you have to go through them constantly just to repair the damaged ones. I don't lose anything meaningful when they're raided other than the time to go through them one by one to repair them. It's just one more thing AI armies will mis-prioritize on the grand scale of war. Sure, destroy 20 of my outposts with your intimidating armies, I'll just go ahead and take your cities in the meantime. \r\n\r\nTLDR: The battles are really fun. Managing your resources and economy is also fun. The cultures/factions are interesting too. The apocalypse mechanic is annoying but surprisingly not detrimental or game-breaking so it's excusable. I gib 8/10 for the OOMPH factor in battles.",

I give this game a thumbs up, but if it eventually crashes as past TW games have, I may revisit this rating and change it. I have a very low tolerance for games crashing on state of the art, well-maintained, brand new computers. Am hoping the TW franchise will keep true to its legacy, and ideally branch off into many directions next.

      "review": "I haven't played any total war game since Empire, but I am an archaeologist who specializes in this period, so when I saw this on a 75% off sale, I had to try it out. \n\nIn terms of historical accuracy and authenticity, there's some excellent attention to detail, some anachronistic put acceptable trade-offs, and some immersion-breaking choices. There are a lot of gaps in the historical and archaeological record of this period, and they've filled in some of this with anachronisms (Neo-Assyrian cavalry centuries early, Iron Age Cimmerians and Urartians in the Bronze Age.) This is reasonable in my view (it's not like there's any game where you can play the Neo-Assyrians) and this choice is far less of an issue than having Pharaonic units in a Hellenistic Macedonian Egypt in the original Rome Total War.  Flavor quotes are an odd mix of genuine cuneiform text (including the spectacularly vivid Amarma letters and the ominous letter from Ammurapi of Ugarit) and non-authentic sounding quotes aimed at fleshing out the fanciful personalities of faction leaders. The former really convey how Late Bronze Age kings conceived of themselves and spoke to one another--the latter come across as inauthentic, especially given that there are amazingly personal (and petty) comments from the genuine diplomatic archives of the period.  On the other hand, many of the faction leaders were real people, and the art, and 3D buildings are outstanding--they have clearly done their homework. \n\n\nOverall, what I was hoping for was a feel for a) the interdependence of the system of Bronze Age states and b) a sense of the chaos and instability as that system began to crumble. The trade and barter system does ok reflecting some of this interdependence, though it doesn't quite capture the nature of great power diplomacy and royal gift exchange that characterized the period. From a balance perspective, I think the game effectively shows how you can't succeed without trade. However, for peer polities, the directly transactional exchange doesn't quite feel right, though for gameplay purposes I get why they did it. For within-realm relationships would be interesting to have a more developed vassal system with various tax/tribute systems, with legitimacy and realm stability tied to making sure taxes, tribute, and gifts flowed both ways. (Edit: It seems you can only make vassals as great king/pretender, which I've not played as yet, so my assessment here may be limited. I'd like to see Great kings heavily incentivised to expand through vassalization outside their core regions.)\n\nI like the crisis/collapse system and the systemic effects this has, but I'd love for the effects to be more cascading. So if I'm the Hittites and Alashiya or Ugarit get sacked by the Sea Peoples, I want to see both a significant disruption in my resource supply and a increase in the roving bands of refugees. Maybe this is in \n\nOn the whole, these are forgivable as this is perhaps the only game you can play through the Bronze Age collapse. Until a company like Paradox tackles this period (and I dearly wish they would, though I fear they never will) this is your best bet for a Bronze Age collapse gaming experience. And it's pretty fun.",

      "review": "Hello there, Total War fan(since the first Rome on CD), LOVE the fantasy titles and can't wait for more(Lord of the Rings), and as someone who enjoys the historical titles as well(and can't wait for Medieval 3...I keep doing this to show I'm not biased to either historical or fantasy, I love Total War), I have to say this is, hands down, the BEST historical Total War game, even better than Rome 2 and Attila, even better than Medieval 2 despite the setting being something I like more.\n\nThe reason why I say this is because this game really fleshes out and bring together all the good ideas they've had recently in regards to diplomacy, trade, and faction mechanics from Three Kingdoms, Troy, and Warhammer trilogy. So campaign wise, it is very fleshed out, trade actually becomes NECESSARY at the early and mid game in order to get what you want in terms of buildings or maintain an army you normally couldn't with your own infrastructure. Diplomacy how it is right now with all its options is the best and should not change(as in have anything removed) at all, the ability to do deals on anything, including regions(to say avoid fighting an ally that took a region you wanted to complete a province or that they took after you lost it) and seeing what will balance a deal to make it possible is a godsend, the barter system or single trade, the way vassals work, everything about it is great. The diety system which can be used for other things in future titles, be it knightly orders, or religions, or gods(40k) is also great, you can manage which to follow, they each give intricate and different types of bonuses or combinations of that can affect your playstyle or planning. The OUTPOSTS, god damn I love the OUTPOSTS, one of the best ideas they've had, I really like this system, however I'd say that it'd be nice if Forts get the OPTION to sally out and join a nearby land battles instead of just local region settlement siege, while lookouts straight up just join without a prompt. The Court system, the power plays, the holding of titles(reminiscent of Crusader Kings) that gives you access to specific special units and abilities, all of these are great ideas to flesh out the campaign. Oh right the legacy system, and the mission system giving you mini campaign objectives of your choosing that grant bonuses related to the mechanics of the faction you're playing as, instead of the generic \"defeat X army and get Y amount of gold or, morale boost for Z amount of turns\".\n\nAs far as battles are concerned, I've found the AI enemy units somewhat easy to rout with flanking attacks at times but not always, gradually allowing me to beat a force much larger  than my own, but they haven't been pushovers either. the AI units behave in an annoying way(just like a player would) at times, I've honestly no complaints about how the AI fights or how it feels to fight them.\n\nGraphics are great, nothing new, they just keep improving over time. The units seem very historical to the time period and the different ethnic groups of the time(although Greeks could stand to have more blonde and redheaded people and far more fair skinned but w.e). On this note, unit variety is good, all the different cultures are very clearly different and have their own unique styles.And regarding finisher animations for 2 handed units.....wtf CA.\n\nMods, the game isn't as well known as it deserves to be, there's hundreds of mods but not thousands, and that says something, still good mods exist, to change the strength of morale penalties, change upkeep, or make immortal leaders(if you toggle the option) still die of old age, which I think CA should do because these super unique characters, we want to stay with them for as long as possible or fight them in the battle field instead of having them dying somewhere in a dumb way before you get to meet them, thus choosing to make them immortal, but we want to stick to realism so they should age and pass on like anyone else. And this reminds me, the beginning of a campaign gives you so many options to customize things, from battles, to resources, to some of the campaign systems, it makes me think of a CIV game. In other words CA has taken a few pages from other successful campaign focused titles like Crusader Kings and Civ and applied them here with their own style, and that's a very good thing, take the best from everyone including yourself, and create a masterpiece, and make it the default template for all future titles.\n\n\nAll in all, I'd buy this, and not on sale, I'd buy it full price.\n\nPS: stop making Blood DLC a separate purchasable option and make it a free DLC ffs, how long are we going to have this running gag for",

      "review": "I'll say this: because I got the game from Humble Bundle for 15$, I recommend it. But that is only because it was simply cheap.\r\n\r\nNow, as for the actual review:\r\nThe premise of the game is that, it is a 4X title with real-time battles and on paper, that looks really cool. However, I cannot say the same thing about the practicality of some of the solutions.\r\n\r\n1)Let's start with the interface and mechanics. Whatever was left from the previous Total War titles works just like it should work. It's rather clear and straight-forward. What has been, however, added to the game in the form of Pantheon, Court Actions and some faction-related mechanics and windows is done in an unclear way. Statistics are all over the place, there's a lot of reading because many things are interconnected but the game doesn't clearly communicate that. Imagine having a faction mechanic which works in a way that when you take up a certain pathway for your faction, it'll buff some of your units on the map, give you some bonuses to the campaign map and other things like that. Then to play effectively, you also have to stack those and other bonuses together, connect them and make them work. But then there are also many resource types (which, in of itself is a great idea to be fair), which are also sort of included in the calculations. All in all, the mechanics of the game present themselves as complex but in practice, you'll be juggling with lots of small bonuses to resources and such, stacking them to make your faction work. Such model of gameplay is fine, when some of that stacking isn't micro-heavy but instead it is a part of a broader simulation. Here it's just... too much clicking, too many windows, too many tables of content with small details and bonuses. I wish some of them were more passive, left for the game to simulate instead of being this micro-heavy, with them being divided into grain, stone, wood, gold, bronze, legitimacy, domination, court actions, favor (religion-related).\r\n\r\nThen there are cities, which mechanics are pleasantly improved over the previous titles. There's happiness, influence and workforce. I like it that way and honestly I wish things would've been pushed further here with more realistic population and ethnicity simulation. But then again, CA went out of their way to add something like that but failed to build a real simulation upon it because effectively happiness and influence are practically the same thing but named differently. Happiness simply reflects how content people are (it can be improved by some buildings and region-wide decrees), influence describes the stability and political coherence of the province (also improved by buildings and decrees). Happiness and influence could've been contrasting variables. You can have a happy nation but the kingdom is in shambles due to lack of political influence. Instead of having another boring technology tree which is just named politically, it could've been a table of real laws that can be introduced. Some would make people happy but harm the economy. Others could strengthen the influence but ruin happiness among the populace. Anyhow – you can see where I am going with this – the foundation of the game is good, there are some great ideas put into the game. However, because execution isn't based on unpredictable, and vast simulation but rather flat or percentage-based improvements, the whole system falls flat as extensive but shallow under closer look.\r\n\r\n2) Regarding battles. Some of you won't like what I'm about to write but Bronze Age battles aren't, in of itself, as interesting as Iron Age or Medieval battles. The reason for that is because in Bronze Age, people were few and so were the soldiers. Cavalry was scarce and chariots were basically special units instead of a backbone of every army. The game shows you a lot of different units: spearmen, axemen, swordsmen, bowmen, javelinmen, slingers, two-handed weapon units, chariots, some rare Mesopotamian cavalry. However, all in all most of them play practically the same. There are simply higher-tier variants of the same units. In of itself it isn't a bad idea to have some kind of gradation of power but the factions don't really feel all that asymmetrical. Historically that is sort of okay (not for the Sea People though as they were described as madmen on the battlefield, attacking cities without formations, such a blob of thousands of angry men running with weapons). However, that brings me back to what I've said before – Bronze Age isn't as interesting for battles as Iron Age or Medieval Age is.\r\n\r\n3) Uneven aesthetics and unnecessary Hollywood flashiness. Some portraits are drawn as hieroglyphs which is a great idea, but some aren't, especially in the family tree. That discrepancy just hurts the eyes. The music – it sounds as a mixture of Total War Rome 2 that has been influenced by oriental, arabic-style musical scales. That's not what Bronze Age music sounded like. Electric guitars in battle music? Are you serious? Even if for but a moment, these guitars are just so unnecessary.\r\n\r\n4) Surprisingly good optimization. The game works just fine on Ryzen 5 5600X and RX 6800 in 1440p, will probably run well on anything built past 2020, just make sure to tinker with the options as many of them aren't worth of setting them on ultra or even high.\r\n\r\nSo all in all, is this a good game? It has mixed reviews and I think it is sort of deserving. It can be liked, definitely. I kind of liked it. It's fun, engaging when it is engaging. Once you understand the mechanics and what lies underneath, it can give you joy and you'll play through a few campaigns. However, I believe TW: Pharaoh is a wasted potential. It could've been so much stronger on the political and social simulation, instead it added some mechanics like that but failed to deliver them until the end by having those more pronounced and striking as core and important parts of the simulation, not just the foundation for battles.",

Overall, I think it’s a solid improvement over Three Kingdoms, especially when it comes to the rts-battles.\n\nEdit (45h): My biggest complaint so far would be that the autofight overvalues chariots in my opinion. Also I have fought chariots in my greek campaigns plenty of times in places where they would have absolutely no value (thick forest, rivers, steep terrain, thick gras, city battles with not enough room to manouver) where they still seemed to be somewhat working. I have had situations where my infantery fought chariots in a standstill battle in sieges which makes absolutely no sense that they were not dismounted.\n\nI still recommend the game though, because the battles mostly play great especially in the mid game or in custom battles.",

Its been made by CA Sofia team who made sure the foundations are solid and hopefully the game's code isn't as spaghetti as warhammer's. There will be lots of comparisons I guess.\n\nGame is really polished as far as I see. It is really refreshing playing without bugs I know from WH3 such as cavalry actually killing fleeing units instead of awkwardly circling around them. \n\nAs usual with historical titles the unit variety isn't its strongest aspect but what is here is absolutely fun. It did not bother me in shogun 2 and it does not bother me here.\n\nFrom technical side its perfect. I have high and stable framerate, game does not crash at all even when alt+tabbing regularly. \n\nDiplomacy is great. Not three kingdom levels but great anyway. Bartering game's resources is needed to develop your buildings which is done via diplomacy panel. The AI does not pester player with ridiculous offers, which is also great. Sometimes they even give you deals that benefit both of your factions! \n\nThe amount of addictional mechanics was a bit overwhelming at first but in the end it grew on me. There isnt much variety of flavour to them, you just choose what kind of sidequests you get for rewards. This is something that warhammer does better, especially for dlc factions which are very unique. \n\nOverall its very engaging game, certainly worth its relatively low price. I was afraid it would be a bit like Troy but its full-fledged historical title. Bronze era is really cool.",

After all, I have Total Warhammer 3, it's great, why would I look for anything else?  I finally picked up Pharaoh on sale after seeing it praised online by the remaining historical fans, and I'm glad I did.  Obviously, if you're used to the Warhammer version of Total War, it's an adjustment to come to this, but once you make that adjustment it's a very fun title.  It reminds me of the experimentation of Three Kingdoms, and in a good way.  At first I was really annoyed at how basic the unit rosters were, and had no idea what to do without cavalry.  Embracing that as a challenge, though, is when the game started to get fun.  Because everyone has very similar unit rosters, knowing what unit counters what, and that you need to utilize tactics to win battles, is what historical TW is all about.  And this game makes doing that fun.  The diplomacy function is much more robust, faction politics are ok, the economy makes a lot of sense, the balance between needing to watch your casualties and how long it takes to be ready for the next battle is just right.  The only thing I don't really care for is how the settlement structures have these minor outposts - that felt more tedious than anything, and like it wasn't contributing anything to me.  If you've never played a historical Total War, this is a splendid entrance to a different way of experiencing the series.  If you already know you like historical Total War, this game is a buy.",

Spam clicking is almost a rite of passage for battling TW. Lots of new features that work really well together in the campaign map, surprisingly good unit variety, good polish, well optimised... honestly a refreshing return to Total War of old in a lot of ways. \r\n\r\nBut that bug is really dampening things, not for the bug itself but to see the same old attitude from the developers about it, It completely breaks an entire focal mechanic of the game and can be fixed in 4 lines of code by any modder with half a brain?

Curiously, to me, this one played like some of the oldest games in the series. I enjoyed that simpler focus in this title, but at times it did feel like a step back from a game like TW Three Kingdoms. There were story elements in this game, but they didn't feel as developed as in earlier titles. Also, the characters didn't strike me as interesting or dynamic.\n\nI didn't love the campaign world, having to deal with attrition because of deserts. It made sense, but it made things take longer than I would have preferred. These campaigns are always long without this element. There was an added government element that didn't make much sense, was completely avoidable, and didn't really draw me in to engage with it. It basically added certain buffs to my forces and required investment in time and attention that didn't feel worth the effort.\n\nSo who should play this? Anyone who wants to complete their TW library should enjoy the old-school feel to this title. There are better ways to start with TW, but this one works fine and is modern. Some of the older titles could use a refresh and obviously show their ages. If you want to run an empire and command large armies, this is a fine title to start with.",

Много спорных решений...Однако, каким-то магическим образом - это работает.\n\nПрисутствует пара ляпов, которые однако, может быть когда-нибудь исправят.\nНапример, при выборе фракции-страны (например, греков - Одиссея), почему-то UI и менюшки, все еще показывают все, в египетском стиле. С чего бы это? Почему, к примеру даже в TW Warhammer у любой фракции свои менюшки, а тут только одна на разные страны, и культуры? \nИ, кому, кому пришла гениальная идея , отделять Dynasties от основной версии?\nПочему так мало кампаний, про Египет, можно было бы настругать, еще,как минимум, 2 бесплатных кампаний, из разных веков?\nКазалось бы, сделай кампанию Клеопатра + Ко, добавь элементы Rome Total War, и \"дело в шляпе\".\nИли, сделать кампанию в стиле перехода Египта под арабский (и в последствии, османский) контроль и падение византийского. Или, колонизацию и войны колониального Египта под контролем разных европейских держав.\nСам бронзовый век, как показала практика, не особо интересен массовому игроку в TW.\n\nИ внедрение ресурса - еды, который меня жутко бесит, тем что теперь войска могут потреблять и еду и золото и бронзу. Еще чуть чуть, и Total War станет Excel Total War такими темпами.\n\nОдно из самых спорных решений лично для меня, было убирать режим \"героев\" , это когда полководцы и агенты не сильно влияют на бой с точки зрения прямого вмешательства. Ну ладно, убрали, но можно же было как в Troy, дать выбор игроку - \"Героический\" или обычный. \n\nПомимо, лишнее раздражение вызывает новые спауны номадов , которые могут спауниться в зависимости от ситуации в вашей \"Культуре\" под которой подразумевается состояние всех городов в рамках \"Национальных провинций\", механику которых видимо подсмотрели у пароходов ака Виктория-CK и т.д. Лайфхак - просто заходим и торгуем с ними сразу после спауна, улучшаем таким образом чуть отношения, и вот они уже идут месить вашего соседа а не вас.\n\nИз плюсов, потихоньку добавляют больше фракций, доступных изначально, но это неточно:) В целом, мне до сих пор непонятно, почему покупая игру за овермного денег, доступно не более 25% от всех в фракций в игре. Дело даже не в деньгах, они их даже через dlc не добавляют. \nТак же, из плюсов, могу отметить качественную оптимизацию, которая только улучшается - мой ноут стал меньше греться и в целом шустрее работать с фараоном чем до последних патчей.\n\nВ целом, минусов немного, и это действительно тот случай, когда обидно. \nЧуть-чуть пособранее, поамбициознее, и был бы грандиозный успех. \nНо, его не вышло. Во всяком случае, пока.\n\nupd. UI менюшки для греков поправили. Слава Зевсу! Но если честно, могли бы просто перенести Troy в плане карты , сейчас меньше сама по себе Греция в кампании чем в Troy.",

I thought that maybe it would after the expansion of the map and nations but there's just something about it that doesn't work with me. Same thing happened with Total War Troy, it just sucked and wasn't up to the normal standards of what makes these games special. Wasted money sadly. I do no recommend this game. \n\n-GRAPHICS: 10/10\nSome of the best graphics in the series, the studio definitely knows what they're doing graphically wise. \n\n-GAMEPLAY: 7/10\nPretty good gameplay overall, but not the best in the series. Battles are intense with a good AI enemy, but the campaign map I didn't die for, way too many new mechanics that didn't click at all with me personally. Three Kingdoms and Warhammer are the best still. \n\n-STORY/SETTING: 5/10\nHere is where I didn't like this at all. Never really cared about ancient Egypt, so I wasn't excited with this entry. No one really cares about the story in historical Total War games, so we talk more about the setting. I was excited when they added the Aegean and Babylon expansion in this version (reason why I bought it), but it seems the studio just cannot nail the Bronze Age, there's just something not right about the whole game that doesn't attract me and I'm a fan of ancient Greece as a Greek myself. This is better than Troy but still at the bottom of the pit compared to other Total War titles. Leave the bronze Age behind and make a new Medieval era already. \n\n-BUGS/GLITCHES: -\nDidn't really encounter any in my playtime, but granted I didn't play that long. \n\n-FX/SOUNDTRACK: 9/10\nPretty good and immersive audio overall. Nothing wow, but really good to make you feel you're in the era and battles. \n\n-ORIGINALITY: 6/10\nThey tried some interesting ideas here, but they all fell short for me at least. The whole campaign felt overwhelming and not interesting enough to give the time needed to learn all the new mechanics. One of the other reasons I dropped this game. A lot of familiar things but a lot of new things that just aren't well done. \n\n-MICRO TRANSACTIONS:\nDLCs only. \n\n-WHO SHOULD PLAY THIS:\nI have played every single one of the Total War games, so that makes me a fan with experience on the field. This is not a good Total War game sadly. Play only if you are a fan of the era, otherwise you won't get into it most likely. \n\n-DIFFICULTY:\nPretty decent and flexible. AI is way more intelligent in this installment compared to the past even at the lowest settings. \n\n-LENGHT/REPLAYABILITY:\nIf you get into it you'll be occupied for a long time as usual with these types of games. Also high replayability value. \n\n-PC REQUIREMENTS For Max Settings\nYou'd need a really strong machine to run this at it's peak. People with low tier PCs shouldn't even bother trying, game will be probably running with 5fps at low settings, it's that demanding. \n\n-OVERALL SCORE: 6/10\nI just couldn't get into it, has only happened with this, Troy and Brittania. A lesser entry to an otherwise great franchise.",

      "review": "Let me begin by telling you a story. My first Total War game was Medieval 2, shortly followed by the original Rome and eventually the (then) recently released Shogun 2. I remember that the disc launcher menu for Med2 came with a selection of questions. Like “what is your favourite fashion?” and the like. I don't remember if it was one of those questions or that it is one that just sprung to my mind. The question that I (probably) asked myself was \"What era would I like to see in this series?” The answer? The Bronze Age, growing as far back in history towards the first large scale conflicts. Almost a decade later we have the release of A Total War Saga: Troy. You would think it a dream come true for me? Yet I felt no excitement due to it being a Three Kingdoms reskin (I did not like 3K). Then came Pharaoh and once more 0 interest. Only now that a key came into my hands did I decide to give it a shot. \n\nThere are a lot of issues with it but I want to bring attention to some which bother me the most. Let's start with the strange non responsive moments in battle. Specifically when using the SHIFT key to stack movement orders. I had some two handed axe infantry and wanted to have them come around in a flanking manoeuvre whilst I focus on another part of the battle. Yet when I came back to them they just stood there on the first marker not moving onward to the second command. This is not a case of me misklicking because the movement arrows were clearly viable and that includes the first one. Later I decided to test the unit behavior in a controlled environment. What I found was yet another issue with the SHIFT commands. Namely that you can let go if the key presses it again to issue further commands (It does not reset) yet the unit will only act on the last one given and yet the arrows remain on screen.\n\nNext up is lethality. Let me just say it up front, get rid of the health bars and re-introduce the single HP system. Because this new “lethality” is basically them trying to appease the veterans of the pre rome 2 games. But it proves that the devs do not understand what makes the old system so beloved. Basically this new system is a chanse to kill a unit outright ignoring all other factors. The old HP system was not this, it took in account all defence stats, depending on several factors like does the attack come from the front or left? So yes shield stat is included in defence. And dare I say made armor very important. But this is just a random instant kill, making all stats useless unlike in the older games.\n\nAnd then there is the tech tree, which might be the most boring one in the series. It's literally just numbers, nothing exciting to unlock like a building or units. Instead its “+(number)% to whatever. It’s a giant spreadsheet, nothing more.\n\nThere is a lot I skipped like the inability to have chariots go in a long line and no loose formation. But I just wanted to share some of my greatest issues that make it not enjoyable to me.",

I have played enough to see the difference between my imagination of what a game like this could have been and what it actually is. Of course I didn't expect something perfect, but CA's Total War games are very far from what i would consider acceptable, or even good. From the basic frustrations of units not responding and minor problems, to the greater problems of a useless AI, that can work only through unfair advantages. My main dislikes are two. One, more gameplay related, Total War never feels like leading a campaign. It's very chaotic. You start with no knowledge of the game and you barely survive, being attacked by all sides. Very chaotic, very difficult, no control, no fairness, and simply, no strategy. And you progress into knowing how to work around the game and trivialize it. Again though, this is not because you are playing a strategy, you are not invited to step in the theme of the game, that of being a war general, instead it's all more arcade, you are playing a game, and that to me is bad design. Second and more important to me, TW games don't feel like anything. The late entries lack a thematic feeling that makes them more than a raw strategy, a simple information processing. What i like about games most is the Theme, which is the term i use to describe their artistic aspects, their ability to portray something and lure you into it. This rarely really happens with these titles. Although some positive aspects must be noted, for example in the music of this title and some of the Warhammer series. I think so many players, me included, play it because the concept is attractive. But the concept is different from its rendition, and this one is not a good one, sorry. \r\nAlso, let's note that the managers have been acting unfairly to the development team and are trying to fool players and ignoring their requests, let's not reward this.",

Battles are intense with a good AI enemy, but the campaign map I didn't die for, way too many new mechanics that didn't click at all with me personally. Three Kingdoms and Warhammer are the best still. \n\n-STORY/SETTING: 5/10\nHere is where I didn't like this at all. Never really cared about ancient Egypt, so I wasn't excited with this entry. No one really cares about the story in historical Total War games, so we talk more about the setting. I was excited when they added the Aegean and Babylon expansion in this version (reason why I bought it), but it seems the studio just cannot nail the Bronze Age, there's just something not right about the whole game that doesn't attract me and I'm a fan of ancient Greece as a Greek myself. This is better than Troy but still at the bottom of the pit compared to other Total War titles. Leave the bronze Age behind and make a new Medieval era already. \n\n-BUGS/GLITCHES: -\nDidn't really encounter any in my playtime, but granted I didn't play that long. \n\n-FX/SOUNDTRACK: 9/10\nPretty good and immersive audio overall. Nothing wow, but really good to make you feel you're in the era and battles. \n\n-ORIGINALITY: 6/10\nThey tried some interesting ideas here, but they all fell short for me at least. The whole campaign felt overwhelming and not interesting enough to give the time needed to learn all the new mechanics. One of the other reasons I dropped this game. A lot of familiar things but a lot of new things that just aren't well done. \n\n-MICRO TRANSACTIONS:\nDLCs only. \n\n-WHO SHOULD PLAY THIS:\nI have played every single one of the Total War games, so that makes me a fan with experience on the field. This is not a good Total War game sadly. Play only if you are a fan of the era, otherwise you won't get into it most likely. \n\n-DIFFICULTY:\nPretty decent and flexible. AI is way more intelligent in this installment compared to the past even at the lowest settings. \n\n-LENGHT/REPLAYABILITY:\nIf you get into it you'll be occupied for a long time as usual with these types of games. Also high replayability value. \n\n-PC REQUIREMENTS For Max Settings\nYou'd need a really strong machine to run this at it's peak. People with low tier PCs shouldn't even bother trying, game will be probably running with 5fps at low settings, it's that demanding. \n\n-OVERALL SCORE: 6/10\nI just couldn't get into it, has only happened with this, Troy and Brittania. A lesser entry to an otherwise great franchise.",

I remember that the disc launcher menu for Med2 came with a selection of questions. Like “what is your favourite fashion?” and the like. I don't remember if it was one of those questions or that it is one that just sprung to my mind. The question that I (probably) asked myself was \"What era would I like to see in this series?” The answer? The Bronze Age, growing as far back in history towards the first large scale conflicts. Almost a decade later we have the release of A Total War Saga: Troy. You would think it a dream come true for me? Yet I felt no excitement due to it being a Three Kingdoms reskin (I did not like 3K). Then came Pharaoh and once more 0 interest. Only now that a key came into my hands did I decide to give it a shot. \n\nThere are a lot of issues with it but I want to bring attention to some which bother me the most. Let's start with the strange non responsive moments in battle. Specifically when using the SHIFT key to stack movement orders. I had some two handed axe infantry and wanted to have them come around in a flanking manoeuvre whilst I focus on another part of the battle. Yet when I came back to them they just stood there on the first marker not moving onward to the second command. This is not a case of me misklicking because the movement arrows were clearly viable and that includes the first one. Later I decided to test the unit behavior in a controlled environment. What I found was yet another issue with the SHIFT commands. Namely that you can let go if the key presses it again to issue further commands (It does not reset) yet the unit will only act on the last one given and yet the arrows remain on screen.\n\nNext up is lethality. Let me just say it up front, get rid of the health bars and re-introduce the single HP system. Because this new “lethality” is basically them trying to appease the veterans of the pre rome 2 games. But it proves that the devs do not understand what makes the old system so beloved. Basically this new system is a chanse to kill a unit outright ignoring all other factors. The old HP system was not this, it took in account all defence stats, depending on several factors like does the attack come from the front or left? So yes shield stat is included in defence. And dare I say made armor very important. But this is just a random instant kill, making all stats useless unlike in the older games.\n\nAnd then there is the tech tree, which might be the most boring one in the series. It's literally just numbers, nothing exciting to unlock like a building or units. Instead its “+(number)% to whatever. It’s a giant spreadsheet, nothing more.\n\nThere is a lot I skipped like the inability to have chariots go in a long line and no loose formation. But I just wanted to share some of my greatest issues that make it not enjoyable to me.",

I have played enough to see the difference between my imagination of what a game like this could have been and what it actually is. Of course I didn't expect something perfect, but CA's Total War games are very far from what i would consider acceptable, or even good. From the basic frustrations of units not responding and minor problems, to the greater problems of a useless AI, that can work only through unfair advantages. My main dislikes are two. One, more gameplay related, Total War never feels like leading a campaign. It's very chaotic. You start with no knowledge of the game and you barely survive, being attacked by all sides. Very chaotic, very difficult, no control, no fairness, and simply, no strategy. And you progress into knowing how to work around the game and trivialize it. Again though, this is not because you are playing a strategy, you are not invited to step in the theme of the game, that of being a war general, instead it's all more arcade, you are playing a game, and that to me is bad design. Second and more important to me, TW games don't feel like anything. The late entries lack a thematic feeling that makes them more than a raw strategy, a simple information processing. What i like about games most is the Theme, which is the term i use to describe their artistic aspects, their ability to portray something and lure you into it. This rarely really happens with these titles. Although some positive aspects must be noted, for example in the music of this title and some of the Warhammer series. I think so many players, me included, play it because the concept is attractive. But the concept is different from its rendition, and this one is not a good one, sorry. \r\nAlso, let's note that the managers have been acting unfairly to the development team and are trying to fool players and ignoring their requests, let's not reward this.",

A lot of familiar things but a lot of new things that just aren't well done. \n\n-MICRO TRANSACTIONS:\nDLCs only. \n\n-WHO SHOULD PLAY THIS:\nI have played every single one of the Total War games, so that makes me a fan with experience on the field. This is not a good Total War game sadly. Play only if you are a fan of the era, otherwise you won't get into it most likely. \n\n-DIFFICULTY:\nPretty decent and flexible. AI is way more intelligent in this installment compared to the past even at the lowest settings. \n\n-LENGHT/REPLAYABILITY:\nIf you get into it you'll be occupied for a long time as usual with these types of games. Also high replayability value. \n\n-PC REQUIREMENTS For Max Settings\nYou'd need a really strong machine to run this at it's peak. People with low tier PCs shouldn't even bother trying, game will be probably running with 5fps at low settings, it's that demanding. \n\n-OVERALL SCORE: 6/10\nI just couldn't get into it, has only happened with this, Troy and Brittania. A lesser entry to an otherwise great franchise.",

My life is not able to sustain a consistent internet service for weeks at a time. The greed of this feature ruins this for me, I bough this on sale and still cant recommend this to someone, wish I could tell you this game is trash for its units game play ect. however is simply because of greed, and not accepting its own fans small limitations.",
