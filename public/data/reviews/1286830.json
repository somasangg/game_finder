      "review": "[u][b]-Quick Review-[/b][/u]\r\nStar Wars: The Old Republic is an MMORPG developed by BioWare and later handed off to Broadsword Online Games. You’ll create a character for the Old Galactic Republic or Sith Empire, level up, collect gear, vanity pets and mounts, complete quests, get achievements, collect decorations and buy houses, level up more, and run around on numerous planets from the Star Wars franchise. The biggest standout features in The Old Republic are the Class Related Quests, and the incredible amount of voiced dialogue in the game. I played for around 350 hours as a Free to Play Account before deciding to chip in $15 for a subscription for a month, and to unlock more character slots, and see the rest of the content.\r\nAfter my account relapsed into “Preferred status” (Free to play: Never bought anything. Preferred: Has more perks, but back to FTP restrictions), I finished playing as all the different classes and chipped away at achievements casually. I may resubscribe occasionally for future content, but one subscription was enough for me for now. (If I do resubscribe again I’ll have saved up lots of credits and know exactly what premium stuff I want before my subscription ends again, stuff like housing upgrades requiring over 1 mil credits, or buying stuff in general costing over 1 mil credits.)\r\n\r\n[u][b]Review Video:[/b][/u]\r\nHey hold on! before you keep reading, how about watching a 46 minute video I made instead? If you don't like reading, or are curious about watching gameplay please watch my:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/4-SEahWatcU\r\n\r\n[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]\r\n[b]Story:[/b] In general sweeping terms, you’re playing as a character for the Empire or Republic, who is part of a 3 Act Structure, usually the first act is about some kind of growth or a hunt or something, then the second act is an in-between character development series for you and your crew, and lastly act 3 ends on Correllia (Probably the worst planet to navigate in the game, to think the YT-1300, YT-2000, and YT-2400 light freighters were made here. No wonder everyone wants to leave the darn planet, it’s a cartography-deathtrap).\r\nAfter you’ve, become the Hero of the Republic/Empire, Ultimate Bounty Hunter / Agent, Jedi Master, Sith Lord, whatever your “final form” might be at the end of Act 3, you can continue your journey with the expansions which came out! Even as a Free to Play Account, you can access a few of the expansions: Rise of the Hutt Cartel, Galactic Starfighter, Galactic Strongholds, and lastly Shadow of Revan.\r\nWith the expansions, there will be some call-backs to your past deeds, for example as a Bounty Hunter, on the planet Rishi (the Shadow of Revan Expansion) there was reference to my status as “Grand Champion of the Great Hunt”. And all the way to the Legacy of the Sith Expansion, my status as a Mandalorian is acknowledged and kinship with Torrian being particularly special.\r\n\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3369767723\r\n\r\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] You know how most MMORPG’s control, right? Movement with WASD on the keyboard, looking around with the mouse, abilities and skills bound to 1-9 on the keyboard or click ‘em on the action bar with your mouse, get experience for killing stuff and completing quests, level up to get stronger new abilities, and as you reach higher levels equip gear to give you beneficial stats to increase your damage and health pool. [i](Most people are familiar with MMO concepts, if you’re not feel free to let me know and I’ll write it out or send ‘ya a link to a beginners video or something)[/i]\r\nStar Wars: The Old Republic has all the typical expected MMORPG things with a Star Wars coat of paint over the top. Level up via questing, dungeons, or grinding exp out some other way. At Max level after you’ve finished the content you work at getting the best gear with the best stats. Once I reached that point, I marked The Old Republic as complete, I was in a raiding guild a lifetime ago on World of Warcraft and I won’t go back to that life in any game… and once I reach that point in any MMO it’s time for me to bow out. [i](I’m not going to log on and play a video game like it’s my job… unless you want to pay me how much I earn for working, I’ll do it then! DM me your best offers. lol)[/i]\r\nHowever, the journey to get to that point was enjoyable and I’m satisfied with my experience playing The Old Republic! You have 8 Classes in total, but they mirror each other so, for the Republic you have “Jedi Knight” which plays the same as the “Sith Warrior” on the Empire side… the remaining classes are: Jedi Consular / Sith Inquisitor, Republic Trooper / Imperial Agent, Smugger / Bounty Hunter. Each Class also has its own Starship, and group of companions who join you for the adventure!\r\nAt character creation you choose your faction, be it Republic or Imperial, then choose and customize your species ranging from Human, Cyborg, and Zabrak… then they get ya as a FTP account because you can’t play as Twi’lek, Miraluka, Chiss, Sith Pureblood, etc unless you subscribe.\r\nAfter Character creation, the fun begins! I suggest you sit back and enjoy the ride, don’t worry when the game announces “Exp reduced, subscribe for more perks!”. I think you should play a character through all the free content and then decide at that point if you want to subscribe to increase the level cap and get the rest of the expansions.\r\nAgain, after playing my Bounty Hunter to level 60 and finishing the available expansions, completing the Sith Warrior, Imperial Agent, and Jedi Consular personal stories, I played roughly 350 hours in game. You could quit there, but I enjoyed the game enough to cough up the subscription for a month to unlock more character slots and the expansions.\r\n \r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3392427542\r\n\r\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] Star Wars: The Old Republic has been an adventure. I haven’t been hooked by an MMORPG like this for a long time, and it’s primarily because of the subscription model and coupled with it being a Star Wars Game.\r\nAgain, I would encourage anyone interested in the game to give it a try, the Free To Play Model is very generous, if you play smart you can make it so your first (and possibly ONLY) time subscribing will get you tons of great upgrades and unlocked content.\r\nBut it IS an MMORPG… so expect to spend a lot of time playing, expect to stick around… don’t rush the adventure, sit back, and let your choices guide your characters down their path… be that light side paths, dark side paths… or somewhere in between.",

      "review": "Star Wars: The Old Republic (SWTOR) remains one of the most ambitious MMORPGs ever made, blending traditional MMO gameplay with the narrative depth of a single-player Bioware RPG. Set thousands of years before the Skywalker saga, it offers eight unique class storylines that immerse players in the moral complexity and mythos of the Star Wars universe. Two of the standout experiences—the Smuggler and the Sith Warrior—represent the light and dark extremes of personal ambition, charisma, and power, each offering vastly different tones and gameplay experiences while sharing Bioware’s signature storytelling flair.\r\n\r\nLeveling in The Old Republic has evolved beautifully over the years, transitioning from a traditional MMO grind into a streamlined, story-driven experience. Players can now progress almost entirely through their class storylines and planet arcs without feeling under-leveled or forced into repetitive side quests. Each planet feels distinct, with its own tone and flavor—Nar Shaddaa’s neon skylines evoke criminal chaos, while Alderaan’s regal landscapes teem with political tension. The companions you recruit along the way deepen both the narrative and gameplay loop, offering personal stories, combat assistance, and a genuine sense of camaraderie that keeps the journey engaging from level one to the level cap.\r\n\r\nCombat, meanwhile, balances accessibility with satisfying depth. Every class features distinct abilities that blend traditional MMO cooldown management with cinematic flair. The Smuggler’s cover mechanics and dual blasters make every firefight feel like a shootout straight from the Mos Eisley Cantina, while the Sith Warrior’s lightsaber combat channels raw aggression and elegance, leaping into the fray with devastating precision. Endgame options—operations, flashpoints, PvP arenas, and galactic starfighter battles—ensure there’s plenty to do once the main story concludes. Whether you play solo or with a group, The Old Republic maintains a strong sense of identity in its combat rhythm, bridging classic MMO structure with the pulpy, action-packed heart of Star Wars.\r\n\r\nGraphically, The Old Republic shows its age but compensates with strong art direction and atmosphere. The stylized visuals, somewhere between The Clone Wars and Knights of the Old Republic, have aged gracefully, especially in modern resolutions. Environments remain impressively diverse, from the frozen wastelands of Hoth to the molten industrial hellscape of Corellia. The real star, however, is the game’s sound design. Blaster fire cracks with authenticity, lightsabers hum with menace, and the sweeping orchestral score channels the spirit of John Williams without feeling derivative. Combined with full voice acting for every quest—a monumental feat for an MMO—these elements make The Old Republic a truly cinematic experience that continues to hold its own more than a decade after release.",

This is a must for any fan who wants to expand their SW gaming either single player, multiplayer or as a combination of both... you decide. The game has changed since launch, some areas simplified others expanded, but the feel of the game has continued unabated. I recommend subscribing for a more in-depth experience with all features available but you can easily try it free-to-play (F2P) and sub later. \n\nI play with family members and friends I have known in game for years. I have created characters for different types of play styles; from single player adventurers and explorers to multiplayer specialists, to material gathering and crafting-focused individuals. I have spent hours in great seasonal events, spontaneous fan generated games, contests, giveaways, lore discussions, guild parties and more. It is friendly to both those new to MMO style gaming and veterans of the genre.\n\nNote: When subscribing, adding cartel coins, etc. I [b]strongly recommend[/b] going through the main SW:TOR website rather than doing it through Steam, as it can be buggy.\n\nMay the Force be with you... always.",

Once you finish your character quest (and possibly one run of the galactic war) don't bother playing the story onwards. You WILL be roped in as 'The Super Special Awesome Chosen One', you WILL be forced to lead a resistance (even if you don't want to) and you WILL be given the most dogshit companions that make you wish more games let you shoot them dead mid cutscene like in Rogue Trader. \r\n\r\n2. See the cartel store? Don't. Yes, the skins are pretty, I've done it too, I'm not perfect. But the more we buy from there, the less the devs bother to add ANY NEW CONTENT besides \"Ooh look it's the outfit from Andor! You like Andor, you liiiiiike Star Wars, buy the slop!\" \r\n\r\n3. Play the Flashpoints. Genuinely, some of the most fun this game has. Small, predominantly self-contained little dungeons that give good gear, good interactions, and the best bossfights. Just be aware some of those bosses demand you to deal with some outright silly mechanics.",

There are also a lot of DLC's that tell their own story.\nTo be short: there is enough of story content, no need to worry about that.\n\nAnd now, the most interesting part..\n[h2]GAMEPLAY[/h2]\nI suggest you look at the release date of the game. Once you know it, you can be sure that the battle gameplay is right from that time. It's not cool in 2025, it's not interesting. It's almost the same WoW in this part. But i must say..it looks good.\n But everything good ends someday..\nMoney. That's what devs love the most. They want you to take your money out of your wallet and pay. Pay for subscription to unlock all the DLC and actually enjoy the game. Pay for species that can be your character.\nTheir beloved subscription also allows you to have more than 4 characters on one server.\nYes. that's why i said that you will not be able to experience all the storylines if you are F2P. There is more stories than 4. In short... \n[h3]PAY!!![/h3]\nAnd if you not - get a lot of limitations. Even the privileged players(that paid for sub once) have them. Not all of them though. But the LIMIT OF CREDITS(local currency) is still 1 million like for F2P.\nThere is a hyperinflation in the game and some items on the local market(GTN) cost a lot more than 1m. But devs don't give a f@@@ about that. Go stretch your wallet to play the game normally. \nAs you see, it's the most frustrating part of the game.\n[h2]CONCLUSION[/h2]\nIt's not a bad game. It's definitely worth trying, but if you want to experience the game fully - at some point, you will have to pay.\nAs you see, it has a lot of pros and cons. So go and check it out, if you want.",

If you remember the original Mass Effect and Dragon Age games for their stories and characters, you can still experience some of that classic BioWare writing in this game. Each character class has its own unique full storyline through the base game along with the faction storylines on each planet, and its own unique companions that go with them into the expansion content - all of which can be completed solo with no problems at all, though you will need to still be online to access the game servers. It does use typical tab targeting ability hotbar MMORPG gameplay mechanics so you do have to deal with that, but if it's not a problem then I would say the story is worth it.\n\nSpeaking of the expansion content, that's where another very cool thing about this game comes into play: the pricing. The base game which includes the original story for all player classes is free, but if you play through all of that and decide it was fun and you want more, just paying for a $15 1 month subscription a single time will grant you permanent access to all the expansions, and if during the subscription period you make a character of a subscriber-only race, you can continue playing them after the sub expires and unlock the species permanently by getting that character to level 50.\n\nI'm not a very social MMO player, so I can't speak in detail to the quality of the PvP, raids, and overall multiplayer experience, but the game is very active to this day with strong RP communities as well.

      "review": "Up until the conclusion of the base game (prior to the Rise of the Hutt Cartel expansion), this game is outstanding. Each class has a very engaging and enjoyable personalised storyline that allows you to live your respective Star Wars character fantasy, with tons of old-school Bioware charm. Every quest-giver was a cutscene where you could engage in dialogue and define your character's mentality or attitude! I lost countless hours to this game and it's strong stance on putting narrative first, even moreso than most conventional MMORPGs tend to do.\n\nHowever, it feels like they were victims of their own success - the model was unsustainable. They couldn't continue intricately crafted and personalised content for each of the classes with each expansion as it developed; it was simply too much work to keep up. So things started becoming 'shared' experiences, where a character (regardless of class) would go through the same main plotline as all the other classes, and you'd have barely any recognition of your previous efforts (because to do so would require personalisation of the content, which they can no longer do without drastically extending the development time between updates).\n\nThis ideology of making the universe at large a singular, quasi-linear experience for all characters persists to this day. As much as I enjoyed the game prior to the first expansion, once the Eternal Empire expansions came out and they established a time-jump along with scattering all the class-exclusive companions to the four winds for any character to encounter, I felt like whatever spark had drawn me in had been lost. My character didn't feel unique, with unique adventures, experiences or choices - I was on the same journey as everyone else.\n\nIt's still a fine game, and what made it so special in the beginning still remains. You can still play each of the unique class storylines until they converge - you can even change what class you are mechanically in order to experience a different classes' narrative through a system called Combat Styles (essentially: 'I want to play a character with Sith Inquisitor abilities, but check out the Sith Warrior class storyline/companions') which is really cool! They've also introduced the means to customise your companions to be any role, so previously DPS-exclusive companions can now be Tanks, or Healers. It encourages you to bring the companion you like the most, or the one who's narrative you want to explore at that time, without giving up any synergy with your own character's chosen playstyle. All in all, a fantastic game if you're a Star Wars or KOTOR fan all the same - just go into post Act-3 content with the proper expectations.\n\nOh - and when it went Free to Play, EA nickel-and-dimed it to death with a massive amount of focus on squeezing money out of everything, with things as simple as the ability to hide your head slot item being put behind a paywall. Incredibly egregious and greedy. As the game has transitioned to being put on maintenance mode this mentality has eased up *a little* (presumably to attract more players who don't wish to pay actual money to play) but between that and the Cartel Store pushing every kind of feature/race unlock/cosmetic under the sun exclusively for premium currency it really does feel like they've stripped the F2P model of all it's flesh and are selling it back to you by the pound. Urgh.\n\nNostalgia aside, I have to give the game a thumbs down because I remembered who owns EA now. And all the monetisation, obviously, but mostly the first thing.",

The level scaling...IMO one of the best things about mmorpg's is grinding levels to get more powerful.  That is irrelevant here.  You get a ton of xp boosts for free...yeah i get it everyone wants to get to the endgame content faster.  I have never really been able to run around as my true level because the game scales it down.  Essentially the only thing leveling up does is unlock new skills.\r\n\r\n2.  The crafting at its base is also probably fine, however, as a ftp or even preferred status just feels like a kick to the face.

      "review": "Up until the conclusion of the base game (prior to the Rise of the Hutt Cartel expansion), this game is outstanding. Each class has a very engaging and enjoyable personalised storyline that allows you to live your respective Star Wars character fantasy, with tons of old-school Bioware charm. Every quest-giver was a cutscene where you could engage in dialogue and define your character's mentality or attitude! I lost countless hours to this game and it's strong stance on putting narrative first, even moreso than most conventional MMORPGs tend to do.\n\nHowever, it feels like they were victims of their own success - the model was unsustainable. They couldn't continue intricately crafted and personalised content for each of the classes with each expansion as it developed; it was simply too much work to keep up. So things started becoming 'shared' experiences, where a character (regardless of class) would go through the same main plotline as all the other classes, and you'd have barely any recognition of your previous efforts (because to do so would require personalisation of the content, which they can no longer do without drastically extending the development time between updates).\n\nThis ideology of making the universe at large a singular, quasi-linear experience for all characters persists to this day. As much as I enjoyed the game prior to the first expansion, once the Eternal Empire expansions came out and they established a time-jump along with scattering all the class-exclusive companions to the four winds for any character to encounter, I felt like whatever spark had drawn me in had been lost. My character didn't feel unique, with unique adventures, experiences or choices - I was on the same journey as everyone else.\n\nIt's still a fine game, and what made it so special in the beginning still remains. You can still play each of the unique class storylines until they converge - you can even change what class you are mechanically in order to experience a different classes' narrative through a system called Combat Styles (essentially: 'I want to play a character with Sith Inquisitor abilities, but check out the Sith Warrior class storyline/companions') which is really cool! They've also introduced the means to customise your companions to be any role, so previously DPS-exclusive companions can now be Tanks, or Healers. It encourages you to bring the companion you like the most, or the one who's narrative you want to explore at that time, without giving up any synergy with your own character's chosen playstyle. All in all, a fantastic game if you're a Star Wars or KOTOR fan all the same - just go into post Act-3 content with the proper expectations.\n\nOh - and when it went Free to Play, EA nickel-and-dimed it to death with a massive amount of focus on squeezing money out of everything, with things as simple as the ability to hide your head slot item being put behind a paywall. Incredibly egregious and greedy. As the game has transitioned to being put on maintenance mode this mentality has eased up *a little* (presumably to attract more players who don't wish to pay actual money to play) but between that and the Cartel Store pushing every kind of feature/race unlock/cosmetic under the sun exclusively for premium currency it really does feel like they've stripped the F2P model of all it's flesh and are selling it back to you by the pound. Urgh.\n\nNostalgia aside, I have to give the game a thumbs down because I remembered who owns EA now. And all the monetisation, obviously, but mostly the first thing.",

The ever buggy and stupid Dynamic Encounters, which have no story, no voice acting and feel pretty disconnected from the Base Game setting. It's in fact, the worse content to do in the game. \n\nEver since Zakuul, Onderon, we haven't seen a properly developed planet. Every content added by Broadsword Entertainment has been lackluster. Progressed by through Daily areas or Flashpoints. No new planets, no new side content and no New Planetary Missions. \n\nSince Broadsword took over, they've argubly made the game worse. Ranging from new unfixed bugs to poor content, considerable shop updates, bundles and a regulary updated Cartel Market, this game now resembles as a genuine Dress Up Mobile game. \n\nOverall, it's a good game for new players to run through the Content Bioware Developed over the years, but seeing the stupid anti-consumer practices by a horribly woke , Community Banning, Toxic Developer that's Broadsword Entertainment, I don't see a positive future for this game. It's literally dead, content wise and only milked for profit. \n\nThe only solution for SWTOR to have a future would be without Broadsword Entertainment as it's developer. Shitty Company, Horrific Community Management. They do not listen to feedback, ban people with opposing views. \n\nFor players who want to invest long term into a MMO with active development, good story content and constant updates, I would take a look at other titles on the Market.  Broadsword Entertainment are uncapable of managing expectations.",

      "review": "Up until the conclusion of the base game (prior to the Rise of the Hutt Cartel expansion), this game is outstanding. Each class has a very engaging and enjoyable personalised storyline that allows you to live your respective Star Wars character fantasy, with tons of old-school Bioware charm. Every quest-giver was a cutscene where you could engage in dialogue and define your character's mentality or attitude! I lost countless hours to this game and it's strong stance on putting narrative first, even moreso than most conventional MMORPGs tend to do.\n\nHowever, it feels like they were victims of their own success - the model was unsustainable. They couldn't continue intricately crafted and personalised content for each of the classes with each expansion as it developed; it was simply too much work to keep up. So things started becoming 'shared' experiences, where a character (regardless of class) would go through the same main plotline as all the other classes, and you'd have barely any recognition of your previous efforts (because to do so would require personalisation of the content, which they can no longer do without drastically extending the development time between updates).\n\nThis ideology of making the universe at large a singular, quasi-linear experience for all characters persists to this day. As much as I enjoyed the game prior to the first expansion, once the Eternal Empire expansions came out and they established a time-jump along with scattering all the class-exclusive companions to the four winds for any character to encounter, I felt like whatever spark had drawn me in had been lost. My character didn't feel unique, with unique adventures, experiences or choices - I was on the same journey as everyone else.\n\nIt's still a fine game, and what made it so special in the beginning still remains. You can still play each of the unique class storylines until they converge - you can even change what class you are mechanically in order to experience a different classes' narrative through a system called Combat Styles (essentially: 'I want to play a character with Sith Inquisitor abilities, but check out the Sith Warrior class storyline/companions') which is really cool! They've also introduced the means to customise your companions to be any role, so previously DPS-exclusive companions can now be Tanks, or Healers. It encourages you to bring the companion you like the most, or the one who's narrative you want to explore at that time, without giving up any synergy with your own character's chosen playstyle. All in all, a fantastic game if you're a Star Wars or KOTOR fan all the same - just go into post Act-3 content with the proper expectations.\n\nOh - and when it went Free to Play, EA nickel-and-dimed it to death with a massive amount of focus on squeezing money out of everything, with things as simple as the ability to hide your head slot item being put behind a paywall. Incredibly egregious and greedy. As the game has transitioned to being put on maintenance mode this mentality has eased up *a little* (presumably to attract more players who don't wish to pay actual money to play) but between that and the Cartel Store pushing every kind of feature/race unlock/cosmetic under the sun exclusively for premium currency it really does feel like they've stripped the F2P model of all it's flesh and are selling it back to you by the pound. Urgh.\n\nNostalgia aside, I have to give the game a thumbs down because I remembered who owns EA now. And all the monetisation, obviously, but mostly the first thing.",

      "review": "Don't get me wrong, the game as a whole is probably fine.  However there are several things this game does that I find ridiculously annoying.  \r\n\r\n1.  The level scaling...IMO one of the best things about mmorpg's is grinding levels to get more powerful.  That is irrelevant here.  You get a ton of xp boosts for free...yeah i get it everyone wants to get to the endgame content faster.  I have never really been able to run around as my true level because the game scales it down.  Essentially the only thing leveling up does is unlock new skills.\r\n\r\n2.  The crafting at its base is also probably fine, however, as a ftp or even preferred status just feels like a kick to the face.  You need 1 crafting and 2 gathering professions to make items unless you buy the missing items from the auction house.  F2p and preferred players only get to pick 2 while you need 3. \r\n\r\n3.  Preferred player status gets thrown around on the website like its the holy grail.  Preferred status doesnt do anything for me really,  unlocked expansions from years ago when i first tried the game and still havent made it far enough to reach the first expansion.  \r\n\r\nI just cant in good conscience recommend this game for anyone.  I wish years ago i never spent money so i could be a subscriber.  coming back it just feels like a handicap and i cant play a game with handicap coded into the game.",

Instead, you have to artificially restrict yourself for this to happen, which I just dislike.\n\nIf they ever patch in a hard mode or a difficulty scaling system that can actually present some challenge in the way you play and build your character, I can see myself coming back to it just to enjoy all the different class stories, like a true Star Wars Singleplayer game.",
