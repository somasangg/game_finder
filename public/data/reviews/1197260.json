По мере продвижения открываются десятки механик, от крафта экипировки и наемников до сложных симуляций и престиж-систем.\n\nЧто делает игру особенной, так это её глубина. Постоянно есть что-то новое, чему можно научиться, и способ оптимизировать свою стратегию. Прогресс идет неспешно, но каждое небольшое улучшение чувствуется значимым. Отдельно стоит отметить приятный визуальный стиль и музыку, которые добавляют очарования.\n\nИногда кривая сложности может быть неровной, и гринд становится утомительным, но в целом, The Perfect Tower II - это отличный тайм-киллер для любителей idle-игр с умным и продуманным игровым процессом.

Простой и понятный геймплей с постройкой и улучшением башни поначалу обманчив. По мере продвижения открываются десятки механик, от крафта экипировки и наемников до сложных симуляций и престиж-систем.\n\nЧто делает игру особенной, так это её глубина. Постоянно есть что-то новое, чему можно научиться, и способ оптимизировать свою стратегию. Прогресс идет неспешно, но каждое небольшое улучшение чувствуется значимым. Отдельно стоит отметить приятный визуальный стиль и музыку, которые добавляют очарования.\n\nИногда кривая сложности может быть неровной, и гринд становится утомительным, но в целом, The Perfect Tower II - это отличный тайм-киллер для любителей idle-игр с умным и продуманным игровым процессом.

The game introduces a nice variety of playstyles: build-a-town, explore regions, choose between active and idle modes, experiment with different upgrades and towers. The developer notes that the game is still in Early Access and that “most of the game’s mechanics are done, but lack polish” which is refreshing honesty.\n\nWhat works well\n\nThe core concept is solid: combining town building + automation + tower defence gives the game an interesting hybrid feel.\n\nThere is decent content already: 15 regions with different environments and modes (Normal, Endless, Challenge, Idle, Sandbox) to keep things varied. \nSteam Store\n\nFor players who enjoy tinkering and optimisation (setting up the “perfect tower”, automating things, exploring upgrades) there’s genuine potential.\n\nWhat drags things down (for me)\n\nMy main sticking point: if you care about Steam achievements/hunting them, this game currently falls short in that department. The Steam page doesn’t emphasise a deep or fully developed achievement system (or at least I didn’t feel the achievement layer was present in the way I like).\n\nBecause I like setting long-term goals via achievements, the lack thereof significantly reduces the game’s staying power for me.\n\nBeing in Early Access means the game is still evolving, and this may change — but as it stands, the achievement-component simply isn’t enough to justify my continued investment, even though the gameplay hooks are there.\n\nVerdict\nIf you’re someone who just wants a flexible, creative “build & automate” experience and don’t mind the absence of strong achievement support, The Perfect Tower II has a lot to like. However — if you, like me, live for Steam achievements, you’ll want to hold off or at least go in knowing that this aspect isn’t fully realised yet. In short: promising game, solid foundation, but for achievement-hunters it’s not quite there yet.",

The game introduces a nice variety of playstyles: build-a-town, explore regions, choose between active and idle modes, experiment with different upgrades and towers. The developer notes that the game is still in Early Access and that “most of the game’s mechanics are done, but lack polish” which is refreshing honesty.\n\nWhat works well\n\nThe core concept is solid: combining town building + automation + tower defence gives the game an interesting hybrid feel.\n\nThere is decent content already: 15 regions with different environments and modes (Normal, Endless, Challenge, Idle, Sandbox) to keep things varied. \nSteam Store\n\nFor players who enjoy tinkering and optimisation (setting up the “perfect tower”, automating things, exploring upgrades) there’s genuine potential.\n\nWhat drags things down (for me)\n\nMy main sticking point: if you care about Steam achievements/hunting them, this game currently falls short in that department. The Steam page doesn’t emphasise a deep or fully developed achievement system (or at least I didn’t feel the achievement layer was present in the way I like).\n\nBecause I like setting long-term goals via achievements, the lack thereof significantly reduces the game’s staying power for me.\n\nBeing in Early Access means the game is still evolving, and this may change — but as it stands, the achievement-component simply isn’t enough to justify my continued investment, even though the gameplay hooks are there.\n\nVerdict\nIf you’re someone who just wants a flexible, creative “build & automate” experience and don’t mind the absence of strong achievement support, The Perfect Tower II has a lot to like. However — if you, like me, live for Steam achievements, you’ll want to hold off or at least go in knowing that this aspect isn’t fully realised yet. In short: promising game, solid foundation, but for achievement-hunters it’s not quite there yet.",

Some features get unlocked that you shouldn't even touch or without any explanation on how to further improve them, or what improving them even does.\n\n\nAlso the games really bright for me personally, there's nothing in visuals to mute colours down. I had to do a workaround method of using colourblind mode and blending them to a more suitable level that wasn't hurting my eyes, but this doesn't mute all the colours.",

It kept me happy for 14 hours thinking i'd get close to someting cool and fun to do and it just wasn't fun it was just anxiety and learning and still feeling like i'm missing something in the game. Hint, FAQ everywhere, auto load the Factory, quality of life it all you want or just have a more warm intro into the BIG IDEA of the game don't assume people know or care or are willing to wait for somethign fun to reveal itself in a module....i'm not earning that action you need to cut down the bullshit and tighten up the game i'm not doing multiple run of this kinda game unless I understand what I get from it. I'm not caring about whatever is at the end of this game so give me a hint on where i'm going in this game or just let it be only for people who get it.",

All at once? Who knows. There's too many ressources anyway.\r\n\r\nDuring the first few hours, this game feels like it's throwing meaningless content at you nonstop.\r\nBuildings should definitely be added more widespread during prestiges, so you know that you've got a new focus point, where you can sink time and ressources into to get to the next reset and not be too overwhelming within the first 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe progression in this game really feels odd that way, there is no real direction, it feels like a sandbox and doesn't wave a carrot in front of you, which directs your gameplay\r\n\r\nI've tried this out once more in 1.0 and started a new game, but it didn't get better at all, it is still a mess and unfortunately isn't motivating at all, it's simply overwhelming, especially with the limited ingame help without joining the discord and copying others. \r\n\r\nFiguring out this game for yourself is just not fun.",
