The devs do great work and a lot of the past was not perfect, but they listen to their community and fix the issues when they arise. After a few years of seeing how the devs work I can say they try to listen as much as possible. The game is not perfect as bugs still creep up at times but it is an open space sandbox block game on unity engine after all. I can say with my experiance that the game is worth playing. The hard part is learning the way the mechanices work. I would start with singleplayer tutorial to learn before multiplayer and disabling cpu and weight/volume if its too hard to play with. Regardless the game can be played in any way you like and see fit to your preference even getting workshop scenarios and blueprints others have created for you to spawn in when you get the materials.

It opens up and you're in an escape pod. You're falling to the ground fast! You rush for the controls to see if you can actually control it in any way... You can, but only left and right. Maybe I should aim for the water? Crash! My eyes open and I'm on the ground, outside the escape pod and apparently hurt. A little text shows up and tells me to check the escape pod for anything useful. There are some bandages, rations and other titbits. The text shows up again and it turns out I have a little AI companion that helps me out, it suggests I look for food. Soon I find some and the AI tells me about my survival suit can make a mini constructor for processing things. OK, cool, wait... What are those creatures over there, are they dangerous? Ah no, it appears to be some sort of cow. So I install my constructor and discover I can make a tent and a tool for harvesting/mining. Suddenly out of nowhere something bites me! I run as I look back they appear to be some sort of spiders. I reach the edge of the water and I jump without thinking! It turns out I can swim and hold my breath for a bit. \n\nI notice something at the bottom of the lake/river. My AI tells me I can make fuel out of it, cool! Ouch! Something bites me again I swim to the surface and head for the opposite coast... When I reach it I see these weird looking sea creatures follow me out, but they don't stray far from the water. At this point the sun is going down and I'm getting cold. I look through the things I can build and it turns out there's a heater, but I need a rock to extract metal from. OK, I find one, craft it and put it to work, but it only works in close proximity. Suddenly, what appears to be a small dinosaur appears out of nowhere and starts attacking me... I barely have time to escape with my things. I jump in the water again and swim to what appears to be a small island. \n\nI decide that making a cave is probably the safest thing. I set my tent, my constructor and my heater down. I have a bite to eat but I get sick! I must've eaten something bad. My AI tells me I can take a specific medicine to cure myself, but for that I need some leaves. I venture out into the mini forest on the island and I find them. I craft them and I'm cured. I hear a sound of relief! I head back to my cave and the sun has set on the horizon. The colours are beautiful and they reflect on the water. I can also hear insects and animals far away. I take a moment to enjoy and take it all in and suddenly I hear an ungodly scream right behind me. I turn, but it's pitch black.. Suddenly the ugliest face of the ugliest creature I've ever seen appears from the shadows, boom! I'm dead. My heart is racing, I look at the time, it's only been 20 minutes and I can respawn nearby. I think I'll just start again, that's was intense!\n\nThe game continues like this for quite a while. There are several stories that branch out and eventually you discovers you can make all kinds of bases, vehicles and space ships. The game slows down quite a bit once you reach space and eventually just kind of dies off, which was disappointing. But it was worth every penny till that point. Totally enjoyable!\n\n[h3]Construction-wise don't expect Space Engineers[/h3]\n\nWe do not have pistons, rotors nor hinges. But Empyrion has vastly more blocks and devices that said game. Ramps, doors of all shapes, shutters, retracting gears, weapons, tools, boarding ramps, decorations  and more importantly than all the above: dozens of construction blocks!!! Which means you can achieve far more shapes for ships and vehicles without the need for any Mods. My favourite feature is that you can actually sleep in beds to pass the time when constructing! Which was a feature I suggested, so the Devs listen.... (up to a point 😜)",

For all my 500+ happy gameplay hours on Empyrion, I have to thank the web post that mentioned that DLSS detail. :-) \n\nMy Review:\n\nAmazing!! The game is huge, and the open-world does not feels empty...\n\nI love building-survival games, and Empyrion is adding something interesting:  The opportunity to have your Home-Base move around with you (I am building my Home as a CapitalSPaceSHip, and land-fixed bases are only for auxiliary purposes).\nI am 500 hrs in the game, have not get bored at all, still amasing resources and I have build the mid-game stage of my ships and bases. I have made some of the quests, but, as is my liking, I focused on building my Capital Ship, and still have the target of trying to find the more rare materials to upgrade my ship to the extreme. I like it so much, that I already had a couple of nights staying awake all way till leaving for work in the morning.\n\nAnd tonight, I decided to make some progress into the campain story... To my surprise,  it is good and interesting! It feels like that I will be entertained by Empyrion for longer than the 1000snds of hours I have on 7-Days-To-Die !\n\nAlso, the graphics and the wolds are good and immersive. This is not obvious when you start the game for the first time, because unfortunately the devs have the tutorial mission taking place in a \"not-so-pretty\" and a bit \"block-jagged-simple\" small spaseship in the middle of empty space, and the NPCs sprites are not AAA models... I had stopped the game twice at that first hours, having no idea of the immersive-quality that I would encounter later in the game, and the nice, interesting and beautifull dungeons / space stations / forests that the game has to offer...\n\n Definately recommeded by me!  I still have not tested the DLC, nor any of the proposed Mods, and already I had hundred of quality gameplay hours.   :-) \n\nI did encounter a couple of minor bugs, but it is acceptable considering the enormouse vastness of the game and the depth of freedom and ope-wold elements of it.  It is good that the devs have provided us with all the tools (console commands, god mode, quests auto-finishing etc) to fix-bypass a buggy situation.\n\nThe quest-info interface (datapad) looks too-indie-and-juggy and could make a new gamer stop playing, but after realising how it works, there is no problem at all.",

Compared to other space-based games, Empyrion stands out for its engaging mining and crafting mechanics.\n\nIn contrast, Space Engineers has impressive graphics but for me it soon becomes monotonous due to the lack of interesting gameplay elements and the feeling of grinding for ages to get anywhere. Much of the interesting game content has been made into DLCs, making it feel like a bigger disapointment as you get into it, without spending extra money. Additionally, the game's quite empty space (a few pirates and spiders, but not much else), empty planets and lack of addition of meaningful NPCs made exploration feel lonely. Ships are fragile and crashes a pain in the neck. It's got a few dials, but crash physics are pretty much on or off, and not much in between, \n\nThen there's No Man's Sky which I still enjoy, they have good success with NPC interactions but can feel repetitive after a while. The ships and buildings are modular and largely prefab, unlike the block level in SE or Empyrion, but do at least make slightly less painful building experiences, the game's pace also doesn't allow for easy pausing or saving as compared to  Empyrion which addresses these issues by offering more flexible gameplay options and allowing players to pause and save at their convenience.\n\nI acknowledges that no game is perfect but I still enjoy playing Empyrion after 5000+ hours, it's engaging gameplay mechanics, adjustable difficulty settings, and freedom to play as desired make it one of my all time favourites.\n\nSo in summary, IMO it's really good value.  The graphics are pretty good, no not perfect camera quality, the physics are also pretty good, and crashes not so punishing, and the gameplay is pretty good.

Just try to enjoy things, please. Engage with the program.\n\nThere's a whole game here that people are just ignoring because it's not the specific mish-mash of other games with perfect polish. Like, it's too late to refund the game for most of you, but it's not too late to read the text, play the tutorial and read everything, start a new playthrough on Akua and just go through the fundamentals with a sense of patience. Immerse yourself in the setting [i]like it's a game.[/i]\n\nWhen you play Monopoly, you can't just go to college like it's the Game of Life and not play the game proper. You have to play the game by the rules (at least most of them) that you're supposed to play by. You have to go through the motions of the game. This isn't that much different; it's just on a computer.\n\nInvite new players if you're a veteran of the story line. Take a back seat while they experience the story and provide guidance and hints while you work on silently preparing your perfect multi-seater prepared for the run. It'll be enjoyable to watch your friends see everything unfold and have someone to talk to about the events, and then be there to solve the problems they come to you with. Don't quite play it for them.\n\nI dunno. I just don't need every game to be like every other game. Frankly, I think that kind of thinking is a bit... Well, not quite thought out. I think people can think for longer about things. When you're playing this game, just take your time going through it. Think about things. Read the things and think about them.

      "review": "This review of the game is based around the mod Reforged Eden 2, it's a rework mod that updates all the standard systems and makes the game playable. Very few people play without it, all the positives mentioned in my review will be directly coming from RE2 and not from the vanilla game. \n\n----------------------\n\nPros:\n\n- RE2 introduces a really nice complex ship building system. Tons of dynamic depth and you can spend tens of hours in the build menu learning about it and working out how it works. It's overwhelming at first but is a genuinely interesting experience and is a step-up from vanilla, please keep in mind that vanilla is very simple by comparison when buying the game.\n\n- Dungeons (points of interest) are a mixture of small puzzles and pve zones. You clear enemies, work through the puzzle, then disable the core of the base so you can properly salvage modules and materials from it. Great experience with these so far, my only complaint is enemies spawn-in a bit jarringly near you, and the core of the base could do with better dynamic AI so that they patrol levels properly. Vanilla AI is dead and does absolutely nothing so you need the mod to do much with these.\n\n- The suit system in vanilla is just a 3 stage upgrade system that has you move from light through to heavy armour for better upgrades. In RE2 light, medium, and heavy armour instead has a complex system of sidegrades. Light armour offers more movement and flexibility, medium armour offers good protection with some minor movement limitations, and heavy armour offers optimal protection at the cost of decreased movement and increased food/resource upkeep. There are a number of specialist sub-grades for light and heavy armour as well which offer specialised upgrades/debuffs.\n\n- Base building in this game is a really fun experience. Ground bases are pretty good but it really takes off when you make a space station and have to manage the importing of goods from autominer/oxygen outposts to the base. On your own it's a bit of a slog but with a group of friends you can assign people to do different things and managing the base becomes enjoyable.\n\nCons:\n\n- Character animations, in both first person and third person, are quite poor. They need to be drastically reworked to be up to modern standards. The vast majority are pretty much just standard asset unity store purchased animations and a lot of the reload animations don't make sense for the gun you're using. Your character also stands in a very weird squat when using the jetpack and there's no animation transitions so you instantly snap between your idle animation and the weapon usage animation.\n\n- Alien models are incredibly poor quality and they need to be updated. They're much lower quality than the player model quality, which itself has issues, and they move and look as though they're ripped from a Playstation 2 game.\n\n- Gun animations in first and third person are pretty bad as well. The pistol in third person is held a solid foot above the players head for some reason, the miningun in third person makes you spread your legs and squat when walking around, and generally there are similar issues for everything in-game.\n\n- There isn't enough armour variety visually both in vanilla and Re2. There are 3 models used and that's it forever. Titan armour/epic armour should have a unique heavy armour model variant just for it. Federation/polaris armour, and improved/advanced variants, should all have unique models as well. As it stands you don't feel any true progression visually because of it.\n\n- The building menu is incredibly janky and needs many quality-of-life upgrades. It's an incredibly painful system to use for big builds and it doesn't save block choices, rotation settings, or selections for a lot of things.\n\n-------------------\n\n\nTLDR: This game is worth playing with friends, not really worth playing alone. It's a pretty decent space simulator but has major QOL issues and visual deficits that result in your immersion being broken. The default vanilla I've played in my solo save is really bad compared to Reforged Eden 2 so the mod is absolutely required to have a good time.\n\nThis is effectively an unfinished demo made with unity assets that the developers threw at us. It's held-up on a pillar solely by the community modding teams that handle mods like Reforged Eden 2. This game is best played with 3 to 6 people, or at the very least link-up with people in DIscord and make a dedicated group to live together.\n\nI'd suggest getting the game on sale, it's not particularly worth getting at full-price.",

      "review": "I really want to like this game.  There's no other game that really fits this scifi niche the way Empyrion does.\r\n\r\nI was excited when I saw there was a 10th anniversary release.  I literally bought this game 10 years ago next month, and I have 101 hours.  I've played it off and on over the years, and early on I thought it had a lot of potential.  And Empyrion does _a lot_.  But it does it all a little poorly.\r\n\r\nThe whole game just lacks polish, which is what you would expect devs to be doing over maybe the last 3-5 years of a 10-year development span.  It's not like they quit working on it, they just keep adding new content while neglecting the base game mechanisms.  The quality-of-life things I expected to be developed in 10 years just aren't there... and as the game got more complicated (inventory logistics, etc) the game got harder to understand and play.  It really takes some serious investment to explore everything this game has to offer, which can be a good thing if mastering a difficult system is what you're after.\r\n\r\nExamples of friction: \r\n\r\nA block-based base builder, still doesn't have a \"eye-dropper\" texture picker to match a placed block's texture with the texture tool.\r\n\r\nThe tutorial system is very extensive, but also difficult to understand and broken in places.\r\n\r\nEnemy AI that is at the level of a college intro course to Game AI Programming.\r\n\r\nItem descriptions and stat blocks that are inconsistent... the basic base defense autocannon doesn't say what ammo it requires in the constructor description, but other base weapons do.  You have access to base and vehicle building blocks at the beginning of the game, and it's not obvious that, as just one example, the Large window is for bases and space ships, and the Small window is for personal vehicles.  Or that the constructor doesn't draw from your personal inventory, so when you construct a hoverbike with a \"Hoverbike Construction Kit\" in your inventory, it automatically builds a _new_ kit to build the Hoverbike.\r\n\r\nIt's totally not intuitive that the \"blueprint factory\" happens in your pocket, when basic building blocks can't even be built in the portable constructor.  The tutorial explains it, but it's confusing because it's totally not how you expect it to work.\r\n\r\nEvery time you run out of building block and fetch a new pile from storage, it forgets what wall type you were placing and reverts to the default block.  And you can't just middle-click on a block and \"pick\" that type/texture.  You have to right-click and find it in the menu again... and there are a ton of options.  Good for options, bad for being such a cumbersome building system.\r\n\r\nIt's not that none of these things don't _work_, it's just such a struggle to learn and then interact with the systems, because they're not intuitive, not always well designed (non-intuitive menus, poor feedback about why something doesn't work the way you expect, for something as simple as picking up a base defense gun from storage doesn't say your inventory is over-loaded, it tells you to put it in your inventory bar to place it.)\r\n\r\nIf you really like this kind of game, sci-fi planet-side base-building survival that scales into space-ship building, leaving the planet, and then building more bases on more hostile planets, then what the game _does_ do may outweigh its flaws for you.  It did for me for 100 hours.  But I gave up after 4 this time... this game is just too frustrating and time-consuming for the enjoyment it gives at this point, when I've got so many other, newer, more polished games in my queue.\r\n\r\nI figure, if you haven't discovered Empyrion by now, it's probably not for you.",

      "review": "I already posted a review for this a while ago, and only while poking at it again did I realize I apparently didn't review it. Odd, almost like my review was deleted or something. Wouldn't surprise me given the devs' tendency to ban or remove people that complain or say negative things about the game.\n\nTL;DR: this is a good proof-of-concept for a better game that will never be made.\n\nIt does have all the things it says and which other players praise. Building ships/bases, big galaxy, tons of places to go, loot, gather, attack, etc. It has those things, but none of them work well. Almost all of them feel empty and pointless.\n\nThere is no difficulty curve, it's a sheer cliff. You start with almost nothing, fighting bugs. And the next stage is to have a meta-designed combat vessel to be able to not get instantly killed. I'm not exaggerating. High level enemy combat vessels patrol right near starting planets, and enemy bases in starter systems are the same as what you'll find 500LY across the galaxy.\nThis is not a complaint because I am bad. I understand the meta better than most other players in the game, I have terrorized PvP sectors for years. Other players will actually warp out of areas the moment they see me coming.\n\nBut players shouldn't have to learn as much as I did just to take on starting area enemies. The game itself does not teach you any of the techniques required to progress against its challenges. In fact, all of the built in ships you can spawn are pure trash which will get you killed if you try to fight using them.\n\nAnd that's just the difficulty aspect.\n\nThe rest of the game is buggy beyond reason. I have developed simple fixes in the configs for things the devs still haven't figured out. The economy is broken (as in you can make millions buying from one trader, and selling to the other trader sitting 10m away from him. Some places you can cheese the economy without even moving from where you stand.)\nThe AI is broken for ground enemies. NPCs get stuck on geometry like you'd expect from a student project. AI ships literally do not have AI. They fly in straight lines between set points and their turrets will just shoot you if you get in range; that's it. Again, not exaggerating to say an enemy dreadnought will fly straight into an asteroid and get stuck there. It won't try to avoid or reverse, it'll just sit there forever.\n\nI also love that they still keep quotes on the store page like \"makes me forget those No Man's Sky blues\"\nOH THE IRONY!\nHello Games had a garbage launch with NMS, but they took their profits and built the game into something far more than they promised.\nEleon had a garbage launch with EGS, and while they didn't make as much in sales, the numbers suggest they certainly had enough to hire some QA to at least fix the major bugs. This game, after 10 years, is about on par with NMS' launch as far as bugs and polish goes.\n\nThis is not the game you or I want it to be. It isn't the game it could be.\nBut it does kinda look like it, and the only remaining playerbase is the type that will defend it to the death, allowing no criticism to go unpunished.\n\nThat's what you're in for if you get this game.",

Every single mechanic that was in the original game that I use to know love is completely changed now, and not for the better.  I continue to come back to the game to see if it has improved at all but I just don't see it. \n\nWhile this space adventure may sadly end for me, I hope that new players will find something to attach to within this game as it has a lot of really neat core ideas.

Ship construction is a highlight, but sadly once you do so after great efforts, there is really nothing substantive for you to do. NPC's are terrible,l story is non-existent, bugs are everywhere, and the galaxy just feels devoid of anything of genuine interest past perhaps the initial chance to marvel at some of the structures.\n\nI had a lot of fun in creative mode just building some bases and ships. I'll give it that I've never found a game that offered me any similar chance to design my own spacecraft. But the lack of any real depth to the universe makes actually trying to explore and enjoy the game really just a drag and a slog.\n\nI've heard good things about some modded versions, and seen a bit of them myself, and they are an improvement, but I still always just feel sad and disappointed because this game DID demonstrate how fantastic the possibilities were for something like this, while never fulfilling that promise.

I have this game almost as long as it came out  and since then it changed a lot the only problem I have is the decisions from the developer to have at the first 5-years a bug that your Space shuttles vanish in existence if you log out in a zone between the planet and the orbit for measurement and all other things docked to your ship and if you used a teleporter to teleport to your ship you get teleported in the sky and fall back to the ground of the planet and this hadn`t happened only at the zone between also sometimes random so that it got almost impossible to play the game but back there you could fight against every base because there were damageable but thanks to missions you can`t destroy 50% from the bases so thanks to that you can`t destroy the base but the 50 turrets on the base can destroy your ship in 1minute I must say you can shoot the upgraded T2 shield of the base down and you can destroy the turrets and you can destroy the core but everything else you can’t destroy I which way does this make sense. So this means it took me   36 hours and over 300 deaths to go through the base and there is the next problem enemies in the fucking ground and the walls imagine this you got killed and you spawn on the outside of the base or in your ship and you walk friking 10minutes through the  enemy base to get your stuff back and you get killed through the wall and every time this happened I want to do suicide (in game :P). Then the next thing that happened and this over 20 times that the backpack after looting from the base is glitching in the fucking indestructible floor how you get it out idk maybe cheat and ghost in the floor to get your backpack but why would you play this game if you must cheat to play the game normally and sometimes if you are very LUCKY the backpack can disappear completely or if your multiplayer only the server owner sees the backpack but why Empyrion why you can`t fix you shitty bugs it’s good to add new content but if the game is unplayable the new stuff I absolutely unnecessary. After the raid I got some auto miners that automatically mined a resource. I had 20 Auto miners set up but after 10h I flew around the planet for the interest of bug fixing I was the whole 10h on the planet and also was the whole time logged on and almost every auto miner disappeared if I flew near them so I could see them  and the game was so lovely that I told me with a message above that the auto miner is disappeared without explaining whyyyyyy. And I almost forgot to mention it if you die your backpack can sometimes just disappear not because the time is up, but it is just not there anymore. The next point Teleporters, the Teleporters is a great addon to prior versions to the game and it worked just right in 2022 but now it’s just broken you can teleport to destroyed teleporters so the game just shuts down and when you relog you are just stranded in a random location and sometimes if you teleport the game is just moving your location just like the valheim teleporters or so and it can happen 50% at the time that you get thrown out at your render distance from your location at the teleporter and if it’s on the planet with high g forces you just die from the fall damage and your backpack disappears every time this happened. For the Last point surprisingly, this time it is not a bug and this time I want to said it out loud I build a star destroyer (executer) from star wars at size class 20 with turrets but the developers only let you build 10 turrets of every kind or if you turned the build limit up to the maximum the build limit per turret is unlimited but the maximum that can work at once is 24 and the maximum flight speed in the game is 160m/s with is not even MACH1 and if you now physics you should endlessly accelerate, but not with these DEVELOPERS after you have accelerated from 120 to 160m/s with the jet engine, you will even slow down again in orbit in glide mode with the small ship, which means you only fly at 120m/s, which means 432km/h, so only 100km/h more than a Lamborghini.\n\nIf you want to play this game, you must be very masochistic or play this game 5years after this review if a hundred new bugs weren't produced again. I just hope I can enjoy this game after it’s out of early access, but with the price of 8 Euros you could think it’s good for the price, but the game should give you money to play it.",

      "review": "I really want to like this game.  There's no other game that really fits this scifi niche the way Empyrion does.\r\n\r\nI was excited when I saw there was a 10th anniversary release.  I literally bought this game 10 years ago next month, and I have 101 hours.  I've played it off and on over the years, and early on I thought it had a lot of potential.  And Empyrion does _a lot_.  But it does it all a little poorly.\r\n\r\nThe whole game just lacks polish, which is what you would expect devs to be doing over maybe the last 3-5 years of a 10-year development span.  It's not like they quit working on it, they just keep adding new content while neglecting the base game mechanisms.  The quality-of-life things I expected to be developed in 10 years just aren't there... and as the game got more complicated (inventory logistics, etc) the game got harder to understand and play.  It really takes some serious investment to explore everything this game has to offer, which can be a good thing if mastering a difficult system is what you're after.\r\n\r\nExamples of friction: \r\n\r\nA block-based base builder, still doesn't have a \"eye-dropper\" texture picker to match a placed block's texture with the texture tool.\r\n\r\nThe tutorial system is very extensive, but also difficult to understand and broken in places.\r\n\r\nEnemy AI that is at the level of a college intro course to Game AI Programming.\r\n\r\nItem descriptions and stat blocks that are inconsistent... the basic base defense autocannon doesn't say what ammo it requires in the constructor description, but other base weapons do.  You have access to base and vehicle building blocks at the beginning of the game, and it's not obvious that, as just one example, the Large window is for bases and space ships, and the Small window is for personal vehicles.  Or that the constructor doesn't draw from your personal inventory, so when you construct a hoverbike with a \"Hoverbike Construction Kit\" in your inventory, it automatically builds a _new_ kit to build the Hoverbike.\r\n\r\nIt's totally not intuitive that the \"blueprint factory\" happens in your pocket, when basic building blocks can't even be built in the portable constructor.  The tutorial explains it, but it's confusing because it's totally not how you expect it to work.\r\n\r\nEvery time you run out of building block and fetch a new pile from storage, it forgets what wall type you were placing and reverts to the default block.  And you can't just middle-click on a block and \"pick\" that type/texture.  You have to right-click and find it in the menu again... and there are a ton of options.  Good for options, bad for being such a cumbersome building system.\r\n\r\nIt's not that none of these things don't _work_, it's just such a struggle to learn and then interact with the systems, because they're not intuitive, not always well designed (non-intuitive menus, poor feedback about why something doesn't work the way you expect, for something as simple as picking up a base defense gun from storage doesn't say your inventory is over-loaded, it tells you to put it in your inventory bar to place it.)\r\n\r\nIf you really like this kind of game, sci-fi planet-side base-building survival that scales into space-ship building, leaving the planet, and then building more bases on more hostile planets, then what the game _does_ do may outweigh its flaws for you.  It did for me for 100 hours.  But I gave up after 4 this time... this game is just too frustrating and time-consuming for the enjoyment it gives at this point, when I've got so many other, newer, more polished games in my queue.\r\n\r\nI figure, if you haven't discovered Empyrion by now, it's probably not for you.",

      "review": "I already posted a review for this a while ago, and only while poking at it again did I realize I apparently didn't review it. Odd, almost like my review was deleted or something. Wouldn't surprise me given the devs' tendency to ban or remove people that complain or say negative things about the game.\n\nTL;DR: this is a good proof-of-concept for a better game that will never be made.\n\nIt does have all the things it says and which other players praise. Building ships/bases, big galaxy, tons of places to go, loot, gather, attack, etc. It has those things, but none of them work well. Almost all of them feel empty and pointless.\n\nThere is no difficulty curve, it's a sheer cliff. You start with almost nothing, fighting bugs. And the next stage is to have a meta-designed combat vessel to be able to not get instantly killed. I'm not exaggerating. High level enemy combat vessels patrol right near starting planets, and enemy bases in starter systems are the same as what you'll find 500LY across the galaxy.\nThis is not a complaint because I am bad. I understand the meta better than most other players in the game, I have terrorized PvP sectors for years. Other players will actually warp out of areas the moment they see me coming.\n\nBut players shouldn't have to learn as much as I did just to take on starting area enemies. The game itself does not teach you any of the techniques required to progress against its challenges. In fact, all of the built in ships you can spawn are pure trash which will get you killed if you try to fight using them.\n\nAnd that's just the difficulty aspect.\n\nThe rest of the game is buggy beyond reason. I have developed simple fixes in the configs for things the devs still haven't figured out. The economy is broken (as in you can make millions buying from one trader, and selling to the other trader sitting 10m away from him. Some places you can cheese the economy without even moving from where you stand.)\nThe AI is broken for ground enemies. NPCs get stuck on geometry like you'd expect from a student project. AI ships literally do not have AI. They fly in straight lines between set points and their turrets will just shoot you if you get in range; that's it. Again, not exaggerating to say an enemy dreadnought will fly straight into an asteroid and get stuck there. It won't try to avoid or reverse, it'll just sit there forever.\n\nI also love that they still keep quotes on the store page like \"makes me forget those No Man's Sky blues\"\nOH THE IRONY!\nHello Games had a garbage launch with NMS, but they took their profits and built the game into something far more than they promised.\nEleon had a garbage launch with EGS, and while they didn't make as much in sales, the numbers suggest they certainly had enough to hire some QA to at least fix the major bugs. This game, after 10 years, is about on par with NMS' launch as far as bugs and polish goes.\n\nThis is not the game you or I want it to be. It isn't the game it could be.\nBut it does kinda look like it, and the only remaining playerbase is the type that will defend it to the death, allowing no criticism to go unpunished.\n\nThat's what you're in for if you get this game.",

Every single mechanic that was in the original game that I use to know love is completely changed now, and not for the better.  I continue to come back to the game to see if it has improved at all but I just don't see it. \n\nWhile this space adventure may sadly end for me, I hope that new players will find something to attach to within this game as it has a lot of really neat core ideas.

NPC's are terrible,l story is non-existent, bugs are everywhere, and the galaxy just feels devoid of anything of genuine interest past perhaps the initial chance to marvel at some of the structures.\n\nI had a lot of fun in creative mode just building some bases and ships. I'll give it that I've never found a game that offered me any similar chance to design my own spacecraft. But the lack of any real depth to the universe makes actually trying to explore and enjoy the game really just a drag and a slog.\n\nI've heard good things about some modded versions, and seen a bit of them myself, and they are an improvement, but I still always just feel sad and disappointed because this game DID demonstrate how fantastic the possibilities were for something like this, while never fulfilling that promise.

I have this game almost as long as it came out  and since then it changed a lot the only problem I have is the decisions from the developer to have at the first 5-years a bug that your Space shuttles vanish in existence if you log out in a zone between the planet and the orbit for measurement and all other things docked to your ship and if you used a teleporter to teleport to your ship you get teleported in the sky and fall back to the ground of the planet and this hadn`t happened only at the zone between also sometimes random so that it got almost impossible to play the game but back there you could fight against every base because there were damageable but thanks to missions you can`t destroy 50% from the bases so thanks to that you can`t destroy the base but the 50 turrets on the base can destroy your ship in 1minute I must say you can shoot the upgraded T2 shield of the base down and you can destroy the turrets and you can destroy the core but everything else you can’t destroy I which way does this make sense. So this means it took me   36 hours and over 300 deaths to go through the base and there is the next problem enemies in the fucking ground and the walls imagine this you got killed and you spawn on the outside of the base or in your ship and you walk friking 10minutes through the  enemy base to get your stuff back and you get killed through the wall and every time this happened I want to do suicide (in game :P). Then the next thing that happened and this over 20 times that the backpack after looting from the base is glitching in the fucking indestructible floor how you get it out idk maybe cheat and ghost in the floor to get your backpack but why would you play this game if you must cheat to play the game normally and sometimes if you are very LUCKY the backpack can disappear completely or if your multiplayer only the server owner sees the backpack but why Empyrion why you can`t fix you shitty bugs it’s good to add new content but if the game is unplayable the new stuff I absolutely unnecessary. After the raid I got some auto miners that automatically mined a resource. I had 20 Auto miners set up but after 10h I flew around the planet for the interest of bug fixing I was the whole 10h on the planet and also was the whole time logged on and almost every auto miner disappeared if I flew near them so I could see them  and the game was so lovely that I told me with a message above that the auto miner is disappeared without explaining whyyyyyy. And I almost forgot to mention it if you die your backpack can sometimes just disappear not because the time is up, but it is just not there anymore. The next point Teleporters, the Teleporters is a great addon to prior versions to the game and it worked just right in 2022 but now it’s just broken you can teleport to destroyed teleporters so the game just shuts down and when you relog you are just stranded in a random location and sometimes if you teleport the game is just moving your location just like the valheim teleporters or so and it can happen 50% at the time that you get thrown out at your render distance from your location at the teleporter and if it’s on the planet with high g forces you just die from the fall damage and your backpack disappears every time this happened. For the Last point surprisingly, this time it is not a bug and this time I want to said it out loud I build a star destroyer (executer) from star wars at size class 20 with turrets but the developers only let you build 10 turrets of every kind or if you turned the build limit up to the maximum the build limit per turret is unlimited but the maximum that can work at once is 24 and the maximum flight speed in the game is 160m/s with is not even MACH1 and if you now physics you should endlessly accelerate, but not with these DEVELOPERS after you have accelerated from 120 to 160m/s with the jet engine, you will even slow down again in orbit in glide mode with the small ship, which means you only fly at 120m/s, which means 432km/h, so only 100km/h more than a Lamborghini.\n\nIf you want to play this game, you must be very masochistic or play this game 5years after this review if a hundred new bugs weren't produced again.
