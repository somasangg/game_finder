Desperados III stands out as a meticulously crafted tactical stealth title, with the developers’ attention to detail and creativity evident in nearly every element.\nIts flexible difficulty settings let players shape the adventure to their preferred pace and challenge level. Even the lowest setting still offers meaningful tension and thoughtful gameplay, and the optional badges and Baron Challenges provide a strong incentive to dive back in; encouraging new tactics and alternative routes through each map. The playable cast is varied and memorable, both mechanically and narratively, making it easy to get attached to them.... The plot is simple in the best way; feeling like a heartfelt nod to classic Western stories… and is complemented by excellent cutscenes.\n\nA genuine standout in its genre.",

If you played the first Desperados (or similar games), or any other games from the dev, then this game is very similar.\n\nHowever, for a puzzle game this is really well done and I finished the main story on hard mode in about 25 hours of gameplay. I haven't really looked into all the bonus content yet, which seems to be redoing missions with different enemies/setup.\n\nGood:\n\n* Completely bug-free experience from start to finish.\n\n* No MTX or similar crap. There is an DLC which I haven't played.\n\n* For an RTT game, the characters are very memorable.\n\n* Doesn't try too hard to be nostalgic, and actually improves a lot over the old game's mechanics.\n\n* Nearly all missions have an unique gimmick and style, and they are all enjoyable.\n\n* The learning curve is flat enough that I didn't feel overwhelmed as someone who played the old game.\n\n* The graphics are not too fancy, but the unique level designs make up for that.\n\n* On hard mode, all the puzzles felt like they had the right difficulty. I never got stuck in hard mode, and I didn't struggle with ammo (which seems to be the main thing they reduced in hard mode).\n\nNeutral:\n\n* The story is low-stakes and not too exciting. But it still is enjoyable enough that doesn't distract from the gameplay.\n\n* While there is a lot of potential to cheese missions (which is good), there are a few situations where it felt like there is only one 'valid' solution that you had to guess.\n\nBad:\n\n* Unless I'm missed it, but the \"action scheduling\" (where you queue up actions) could have been made a bit nicer by adding some kind of timing functionality. Without this, you sometimes have to manually add timings by moving characters around or manually trigger the actions of each character.",

The biggest difference would be western aesthetics used in this one compared to the Japanese style used in the previous game, which I liked better, but that's just a matter of personal preference. Also, I believe the story is not as poignant as the one in Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun. Otherwise the game is just as good, and it also has some quality-of-life improvements (e.g. a fast-forward button), a very catchy main theme, and additional unique challenges for each level that make you think outside the box, which become available in a separate menu once you beat the main story.",

I also cannot speak for fans of the previous games, as I have not played any other The Desperados games. But as far as I know this is a prequel, so you can play it without touching the rest of the series if you choose. \n\nI am not usually into strategy games of a similar nature. I'm usually filtered out from the genre because it doesn't gel well with me. But after picking this one up again I feel like I owe it some credit just for how much content it has. Every level feels like a puzzle, and each character plays their specific role in solving parts of it. While the game can take some getting used to, everything will eventually begin to click. You'll start noticing how to utilize your characters more often or testing new routes and possibilities. It does a great job at teaching you each character's strengths and how use their abilities to your advantage while never feeling like it's holding your hand. Everything in this game was good to me, the banter between characters, the story, the lively beautiful maps, the cut scenes, the music, and the sound design. Everything it does it does well. I have almost no issues with this game other than the abrupt ending but that's about it. I love this game. \n\nSadly Mimimi games shut down 2 years ago as of writing this review, being shut down less than a month after their final release Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew. So we're probably not going to be seeing another game like this for a long while. \n\nFly High Mimimi",

The game starts slowly but becomes much harder as you progress. While I enjoy RT stealth tactics, I haven’t really played many since Commandos back in the day, and I found Normal difficulty a real slog after the first 6-7 missions or so, and switched to Beginner, which was still tough (or perhaps I suck at these games now). The gameplay improves over time, with deep tactical options that you can synchronise with crew’s unique skillsets to perform creative kills. My favourite was the Voodoo Queen.\r\n\r\nOverall, it’s an excellent game with strong replay value due to its tactical options, challenges and diverse missions (there's even a bounty hunter mode, which adds new challenges to existing missions).

      "review": "When it comes to pure western-themed games, if you think about it, the choice is not very vast. Besides the obvious Red Dead Redemption series, I can only recall the Call of Juarez and GUN games from 15-20 years ago. For the rest, the western element is mostly contaminated with other elements, usually fantasy and/or post-apocalytptic themes (Evil West, Weird West, and Remnant come to my mind). So, to me, realizing that a modern era Desperados game had been done was quite the joy, but was it good? In short, yes.\nMechanically, the game is a jewel. The five playable characters complement each other well and the missions' level design is immaculate, offering countless different solutions to the same problem. The quicksaving system makes the game accessible and allows the players to either advance step by step or simply push and rush to get to the goal without having to deal with akward checkpoints.\nChallenges and badges expand the playing time (which is already more than enough with the main campaign) without making it a chore, forcing you to think outside of the box to complete them.\nStory-wise, the game is as cliché as a western can get, with all the pros and cons of it, so do not expect any sort of great writing nor a good story-pacing. You'll have to make the best of the characters personalities, which thankfully can count on a pretty good english dub and overall acting. They'll make for a good gang to be the mastermind of.\nTechnically, the game shows that it has been done by competent people. Ok, the maps do not make you drool in awe and the character models could have used a little more polishing, but it's a pleasing game to look at.\nIt's a shame that this genre is not as lively as it was 20 years ago. Besides the very few titans of the genre, not a single brand seems to be able to stay afloat. And considering that the dev team got disbanded, we can expect this to be the last Desperados game. But trust me when I say that if this game got released 20 years ago, today it would be considered a timeless classic. Nowadays, the consideration for this type of games cannot get that far, but even if this jem is destined to fall into oblivion, do yourself a favor and play it.\n8,5/10",

Then finding what guard is the new weak link after removing that last set of eyes.

Guns are generally a last resort due to the noise they make and need to be used sparingly for kill shots and only in very specific situations to avoid alerting the whole map. Most of the time if an enemy spots and start shooting at you its normally time to reload the last save rather than trying to shoot your way out of trouble.\r\n\r\nThis is more of a stealth puzzle game.

The playable cast is varied and memorable, both mechanically and narratively, making it easy to get attached to them....

The biggest difference would be western aesthetics used in this one compared to the Japanese style used in the previous game, which I liked better, but that's just a matter of personal preference. Also, I believe the story is not as poignant as the one in Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun. Otherwise the game is just as good, and it also has some quality-of-life improvements (e.g. a fast-forward button), a very catchy main theme, and additional unique challenges for each level that make you think outside the box, which become available in a separate menu once you beat the main story.",

Desperados III, I assume in an effort to make itself harder to cheese, just kind of enjoys restricting the player. Characters are removed from your party in almost every mission, certain enemy types are immune to most of your abilities, and guns have been nerfed to now have annoyingly long cooldown after every shot. A few classic characters are also missing completely from the game.\n\nBut, I guess those are just petty, old man grievances. Desperados III is definitely a well-made and polished game that offers a good challenge, with plenty of huge missions in the main campaign, and even a good amount of additional side missions that you unlock along the way. It also looks and sounds great. Environments are vast, diverse and beautiful, the writing is decent (even if the main villain is extremely whatever), and the voice acting is good.
