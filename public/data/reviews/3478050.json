      "review": "As someone who plays a lot of FMV games and especially enjoys those with cinematic storytelling, Road To Empress was a pleasant surprise that genuinely made me smile.\n\nIt’s promoted as a “cinematic palace adventure,” and that description fits. This often feels like a palace-drama film you can control. The real actors, authentic sets, and detailed costumes are so well done that at times I forgot I was playing a game—it felt like watching a Chinese historical series.\n\nI used to think choices in FMV games were mostly decorative, but Road To Empress is a bit different. Mistakes can lead to death, and dying here becomes part of the experience. Each failure reveals a new line, a reaction, or a small clue that deepens your understanding of the characters. You die a lot, but that’s how you learn to survive in this scheming harem.\n\nThe story follows Wu Yuan Zhao, who would later become Wu Zetian (武则天). The game doesn’t shy away from trimming or fictionalizing history, but it keeps the heart of the tale—the struggle between wit, power, and human feeling. If you expect strict historical accuracy you may be disappointed; if you want to live inside a palace drama, this is one of the closest FMV experiences right now.\n\nThe acting was better than I expected. Some familiar TV faces appear and they truly know how to perform. Their expressions, the hesitation before a decision, it all feels cinematic. The editing is clean and the pacing balanced, without the cheap-cut feel that spoils many FMV titles.\n\nWhat I appreciate most is that Road To Empress doesn’t try to be pretentious. It simply makes you want to keep playing. It’s not as deep as The Invisible Guardian (隐形守护者), but it’s more approachable while still holding emotional weight and a strong sense of agency—every choice really feels like yours.\n\nI also liked the small additions: a visual branching map, a character journal, and an end-of-chapter personality analysis. Those details make it feel more like a game and less like a straight film.\n\nIf you enjoyed dramas like Story of Yanxi Palace (延禧攻略) or Nirvana in Fire (琅琊榜), or played The Invisible Guardian (隐形守护者), give Road To Empress a try. It’s not finished, but it’s one of the most polished and well-acted FMV titles so far—dramatic enough to make you die repeatedly, and engaging enough to keep you playing.\n\nRoad To Empress is a promising step for Chinese FMV games. It still has rough edges, but few titles balance player respect and entertainment as well. I’m looking forward to Part 2.\n [quote]作为一个玩过许多真人互动影像（FMV）游戏的玩家，我一直很喜欢带有“电影叙事”风格的作品。《女王的游戏：盛世天下-媚娘篇》让我感到意外，也让我露出了笑容。\n\n这款游戏宣传自己是一场“宫廷电影冒险”，事实确实如此。它更像是一部你能亲自参与的宫斗剧。演员都是真人，场景布置精致，服装和画面都有着很高的水准，让我一度忘记自己在玩游戏，而是在看一部古装电视剧。\n\n我以前觉得 FMV 游戏里的“选项”大多只是摆设，但《女王的游戏》有点不同。每一次错误都可能导致死亡，而“死亡”正是乐趣的一部分。每次失败都会出现新的台词、反应或细节，让你更了解角色。虽然死得多，但这正是你学会在后宫中如何生存的过程。\n\n故事围绕 武元昭 展开，她后来成为了 武则天。游戏并不避讳对历史的删改和虚构，但仍保留了核心——关于智慧、权力和人心的较量。\n如果你追求完全的史实，还原可能会失望；但如果你想体验一场宫斗剧，这无疑是目前最接近那种感觉的 FMV 作品。\n\n表演比我预期的要好。一些熟悉的电视剧演员出演，他们真的会演。无论是眼神、语气还是犹豫的细节，都很自然。镜头剪辑顺畅，节奏恰到好处，没有其他 FMV 常见的“拼接感”。\n\n我最喜欢的一点是，《女王的游戏》并没有刻意装得“高深”或“文艺”，而是让人想一直玩下去。\n它没有《隐形守护者》那样的深度，但上手更轻松，同时也保留了情感和代入感——每个选择都真的是你的选择。\n\n我也喜欢游戏加入的小功能，比如分支地图、角色日志、章节结尾的性格分析系统。这些细节虽然小，却让它更像一个真正的“游戏”，而不仅仅是“电影”。\n\n如果你喜欢《延禧攻略》《琅琊榜》这样的宫廷剧，或者玩过《隐形守护者》，那我很推荐你试试《女王的游戏：盛世天下-媚娘篇》。\n虽然还没完结，但它已经是目前制作最精良、表演最出色的 FMV 之一。剧情够精彩，让人一死再死；也够吸引，让人舍不得退出。\n\n对我来说，《女王的游戏：盛世天下-媚娘篇》是中国 FMV 游戏值得鼓励的一步。虽然还有些生硬，但能兼顾玩家体验和娱乐性实属难得。我期待第二章，也希望它能成为亚洲 FMV 的一个新里程碑。 [/quote]\nCheck out more FMV games at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45578719]FMV Asia | 真人互动影像游戏社[/url]",

      "review": "For the low price, I expected a lot less quality, but I was pleasantly surprised.\nThe game is stunning, not just the FMV scenes, but the music and menus as well, with a lot of attention to detail. The costumes and settings look absolutely beautiful, not unlike Chinese TV dramas, but thankfully without the 50+ episodes I've always struggled to commit to. \nYou have to be online to play it, but I had no lag at all, everything ran smoothly without so much as a stutter.\n\nWhile there are a few QTEs, they are incredibly simple, and the only other input the game asks of you is to click and decide what path to take, which allows you to be fully immersed in the story, and meanwhile, you even can enjoy some tea and a snack (preferably not poisoned).\nWhile it was not short at all, I was sad it was over. Though many choices will lead to a bad ending, it's still engaging to try and plot your way to keep Wu Yuanzhao alive. I'm very much looking forward to the sequel.\n\nI could continue to sing praises about this game, but I'm craving a bowl of osmanthus soup.",

      "review": "I liked this – well – let's call it a game. Never played anything of this genre before at all and only had a look at the game because I'm quite into China and Chinese history. I can't compare this game to anything, so no deep review.\n\nGameplay-wise, I wish there were at least a little more quick-time action events to have a little bit more \"gaming\". And story-wise – without spoiling anything – it would be nice or interesting if there were more meaningful decisions. Right now, decisions fall kind of flat: Right → Story Continues, Wrong → Dead. There isn't much in between, no grays, no loops, or anything puzzling. But I also didn't really explore alternative timelines, so maybe I missed a lot. But that's inherent to the genre: It's more interesting to follow the story than to explore everything and die a hundred different ways.\n\nI really liked all the actors and enjoyed the young cast. Good work by everybody.\n\nThe English version needs some improvements though, especially regarding the subtitle timings, maybe a nicer font or at least some subtitle settings (Color, Font, Drop shadow, Outlines). The translation seems good to me. I didn't encounter typical issues Chinese games often have, like text overflows and similar issues. Good work on this.\n\nOn the Chinese: The language is not very \"royal\", but very casual, and modern: For me hearing \"废什么话\" was the funniest moment on the language side. My Chinese isn't very good (anymore :sad:), so take this opinion with a grain of salt.\n\nOverall, I had a lot of fun and am looking forward to the rest of the story.\n\nEDIT: \nAs a note. With a lot of hackery it's possible to run this game on a Steamdeck or SteamOS but it doesn't run out of the box. I hope this changes in the future. In the end I used my SteamOS machine to stream the game from my gaming PC to my TV. Native or Proton support would be nice.",

If you've ever wanted a more focused, accessible version of the political intrigue from Crusader Kings, this is it.   The choices are significant, the art is beautiful, and running your court is highly addictive.  With a lovely, feudal aesthetic, it's a game of numbers and difficult choices.   Be advised that this is not an action game, but rather a thinker's game.  After you get the hang of it, the loop can become monotonous, but for 5 hours, it's an almost flawless political simulation.  For those who enjoy strategy, the cost is well worth it. \r\n👍  Advantages: In-depth, significant decisions.   resource management that is tasteful and well-balanced.   High replay value in a variety of scenarios. \r\n👎  Cons: There is a lot of menu and text in the game.   After you've seen most events, it may seem repetitive.",

I personally was hoping for more involvement in palace intrigue and getting to actually participate. Hopefully their next game, they can provide actual real choices.\n------\nI change my intial thumbs down to thumbs up as the next chapter/game seems to offer at least 2 distinct lifepaths.

Sometimes the options in the choice buttons do not make sense or look too similar to each other. \n- You need to be connected to the internet while playing, and if you let the game running on steam deck for a while, while being away, a login issue appears\n- The story ends with a cliffhanger and it is not really clear when the next part will come out (I hope it will, the trailer looks good)",
