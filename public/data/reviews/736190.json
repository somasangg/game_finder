Don't Bother.”\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI actually really like this game. It’s simple, easy to pick up, and not too hard to manage. Since I last played, the developers have added a pet system, more love interests, and other micro-management features.\n\nThat said, it’s very repetitive. After one or two “generations,” you’ve basically seen everything. It feels like a mobile game — same routine, different numbers — with difficulty coming from higher stat requirements rather than new challenges. Your kid gets smarter each generation, but the gameplay loop doesn’t evolve much.\n\nSmall gripe: you can’t use spaces or dashes in names, so no authentic options like “Li Wei.”\n\nIf I could give a neutral score, I would. But I’ll lean positive — I enjoyed it, even if I wouldn’t recommend it to everyone, especially not at full price.",

So far, I’ve tried 15-ish different career paths, developed different personalities and family traits. \n\nHere's the 100% achievement guide I made based on my own experience. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3579764209\n\nThere is no inheritance or generational wealth in this game. I guess that will break the economic system. Afterall, the imperial examination system was one of the contributing factor in preventing a persistent hereditary nobility-_-",

Every other various event is fun at first but is then the exact same for future cycles. It's really disheartening to dread them more and more each cycle, especially with them being so time-consuming. The game is really charming minus your parents treating you unfairly, especially when you were playing that parent last cycle, but eh, maybe this is true to life.",
