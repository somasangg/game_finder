The game and the fanbase both fail to mention this. Referral codes are available right away though.)\n\nIt's okay. I'm sure you'll quickly slam headfirst into a \"pay or grind for 1000 hours\" wall like everything else Nutaku touches, considering the gazillion shop items and deals you get slapped in your face that wont matter after a while anyway since the game works on a season system to endlessly milk a gazillion dollars out of a bunch of whales.\nPorn's pay/grindwalled, lots of lewd outfits are pay/grindwalled, and so on.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's another one of those simple autobattler things with all the R/SR/SR++++ whatevers.\nThe only things keeping me from rating this game down is that it's very obviously a money hole and it's not entirely being that secretive about it (so if you're spending tons of money, it's YOUR fault), and the boobs are really big.\nTrust me, those milkers visibly SLOSH, it's one of the things this game actually put effort into more than a lot of other games like this.\nCan't speak for the actual sex scenes or any of the paywalled stuff, but there's plenty of eye candy even if you're not unlocking that stuff, (it's not like League of Maidens where the devs lock EVERYTHING up and you're stuck in fully-covered bodysuits, no nudity, no sex, no nothing until you pay. God I wish literally anyone else made LoM, so much potential wasted.)\n\nI honestly probably shouldn't rate this up because it's 100% a game meant to drain you of hundreds/thousands of dollars in a heartbeat, but... boobs man.

The game immediately captures attention with its unique premise: embarking on a critical mission to save Zeus while navigating a world populated by boldly designed goddesses and mature thematic content.\n\nWhat I appreciate most is the deep investment in character development through robust dating sim elements. These features allow players to build meaningful, interactive relationships with the diverse cast, making the narrative connections feel rewarding and personal. Coupled with multiple gameplay modes, Aeons Echo offers considerable depth, ensuring that the central RPG quest—saving the head of Olympus—is supported by engaging side stories and interactive features. The overall presentation is sharp, successfully delivering a unique, mature visual novel experience.\n\nWhile the mature themes are certainly central to the experience, the occasional distraction from the main narrative thread by the exhaustive character routes is the only minor point of consideration.",

      "review": "TLDR:\r\nThere is an actual story that actually has some nice ideas here and there, the artwork is all very nice, the girls are all unique, there are plenty of ways of improving your team, there are plenty of things to do each day, but without taking excessively long to the point it starts to feel like a chore, the interface is not the worst. It's a shame the new player experience/tutorial is so horrendously awful that I imagine most players will probably quit long before they finish them.\r\nIf you either follow a guide so you do everything right for your first three months of playing, or just accept that you have missed out on several permanently-missable skins and power buffs, then it's a good NSFW idle auto-battler... that I do not recommend.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n\r\nStory\r\nThe game has a story - it's an \"amnesiac protagonist is suddenly in a harem world\" as is expected for a NSFW idle game, but there is a lot of story there, and it has some good ideas and funny moments, and keeps moving and changing at a pretty good pace.\r\nThere's plenty to not like though, most notably the SA/rape and crossdressing aspects though (yes, really).\r\n\r\nCombat\r\nCombat is a 6x6 idle auto-battler. You set up your formation and your girls fight their girls.\r\nEach girl has various stats, bonuses for being in formation with specific other girls, and there are goddesses that you can use alongside your formation.\r\nEach girl in your team can also be upgraded in various ways (star level, rarity, gear, etc.) and there are other ways to buff your team.\r\nThere's a lot of ways to upgrade your girls, and the combat can be as simple as using the 6 girls you like the most, or you can give your formation a lot of thought to get the best possible team, so overall it feels like a decent combat system.\r\n\r\nAlso note that since each charater skin gives you a decent boost in power, whales who buy skins will be more powerful than f2p players, and since combat power determines turn order, whales will just outspeed and destroy f2p players, so the top of the PvP leaderboards are for whales only.\r\nThankfully whilst there are several f2p modes, you can still do decently well as an f2p (probably due to each server having a low population, probably due to the awful new player experience) and whilst you get more rewards the better you do, the difference in PvP rewards isn't much in the grand scheme of things.\r\n\r\n\r\nNSFW\r\nThe game does have a lot of NSFW artwork in it, and almost all of it is animated to at least some extent.\r\nThe artwork is all very nice, and there is a wide variety of body types and poses to suit your preference.\r\nYou unlock quite a lot of scenes from the main story, you can view each girl on the games homescreen, there's usually an event going on that has some eye-candy as a reward.\r\nOverall it's an extremel sexualized game, as expected for something that was originally on Nutaku.\r\n(The Nutaku version is the same in terms of NSFW, but is ahead on content, so it has more girls available. The two versions can't crossplay or interact at all.)\r\n\r\nIdle game\r\nThere are many things you can do each day - Play mini games, talk to Lilin, do some story, collect idle rewards from Styx, do Giant's Armory, do the PvP arenas, [if you log in at the right time each day] do guild events, maybe do some story, do some collections or pulls for the current event.\r\nThere's quite a lot to do, but it doesn't take an annoying or problematic amount of time, but it still feels like you are making a decent amount of progress each day.\r\nOverall I'd say it's a pretty good idle game, albeit one that requires quite a lot of clicking.\r\n\r\nEvents\r\nAs above, the game always has several events running.\r\nThese vary considerably, but usually are either summoning for a new girl/skin, or a \"do tasks to get rewards\" type.\r\nIf you are f2p, you will never complete any of these events without many literal months of grinding resources.\r\nRealistically, the only skins you will get as an f2p player are the three skins the game gives you for completing the newbie events that occur at the beginning of the game.\r\nWhen you start the game you will immediately be given two events: \"Newbie Event\", which lasts 7 days, and \"Aeon Rally - Eternal\"\r\nThe Newbie Event is the games tutorial, and you should make sure you are doing everything in that event, as most of the things it wants you to do (advance your Aeons, improve gear, improve your horoscope, level up your Apostle, etc) are all things that are critical to improving in the game, and you get a unique skin for Perseus if you complete enough tasks (you need 280 out of 295 points). This skin gives you a permanent power boost for owning it, and is permanently missable.\r\nOnce the Newbie Event ends you get the \"14-Day Carnival\" event, which is basically more of the same tasks.\r\n\r\nThe \"Aeon Rally - Eternal\" event gives you points for improving the rarity of your Aeons, with Corona Stones (i.e. Premium currency) for meeting certain milestones, and if you complete 2,500 points in time then you get a unique skin for Sphinx, which again gives you a permanent boost for owning it and is permanently missable.\r\nOnce Aeon Rally - Eternal ends, \"Eternal Rally - Tennis Player\" starts, which gives you a skin for Hypnos, which again, gives a power boost to your entire team and is permanently missable. The Hypnos event lasts 3 months.\r\nThe Sphinx skin is pretty difficult to do, and the Hypnos skin is very difficult to get unless you know exactly what you are doing, and both events generally require you to go for that skin only, only spending what you need, and buying up useful items from pretty much the moment you start playing.\r\nIf you play well (only buy what you need, always reclaim the energy itmem from the daily Andromeda event, complete all the event objectives as quickly as you can, don't lag behind in any area) you'll get them, but if you don't then you'll miss them.\r\nHaving fours events that basically require you to play very well right from the moment you start playing, or else miss permanently missable skins/power boosts is extremely poor game design, especially since those are the only skins you can reliably get as an f2p player.\r\nIt is often said on the games dicord that if you can't complete the Newbie event to get the Perseus skin then you should just start again on a different server so you can get it now that you know what to do, and the same is kinda true about the Sphinx skin too - they are permanent boosts that you can never get again, so if you actually want to play the game long-term then you should make the effort to get them whilst you can.\r\nPersonally, I image a lot of people will simply start the game, not play perfectly, fail the Newbie event, then see the 14-Day event and see they will fail that too, and just stop playing.\r\nI also imagine there are many people who fail the Newbie event, look up a guide, start on a new server, complete the Newbie event, fail the Sphinx event, and then quit the game.\r\n\r\n\r\nAeons Echo is a good idle game, and a very good NSFW game.\r\nIf the skins from the beginner events were either not permanently missable, or the events were much easier, then I would happily recommend the game, but as it stands I just can't recommend a game that has a new player experience that is this bad.",

      "review": "TLDR:\r\nThere is an actual story that actually has some nice ideas here and there, the artwork is all very nice, the girls are all unique, there are plenty of ways of improving your team, there are plenty of things to do each day, but without taking excessively long to the point it starts to feel like a chore, the interface is not the worst. It's a shame the new player experience/tutorial is so horrendously awful that I imagine most players will probably quit long before they finish them.\r\nIf you either follow a guide so you do everything right for your first three months of playing, or just accept that you have missed out on several permanently-missable skins and power buffs, then it's a good NSFW idle auto-battler... that I do not recommend.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n\r\nStory\r\nThe game has a story - it's an \"amnesiac protagonist is suddenly in a harem world\" as is expected for a NSFW idle game, but there is a lot of story there, and it has some good ideas and funny moments, and keeps moving and changing at a pretty good pace.\r\nThere's plenty to not like though, most notably the SA/rape and crossdressing aspects though (yes, really).\r\n\r\nCombat\r\nCombat is a 6x6 idle auto-battler. You set up your formation and your girls fight their girls.\r\nEach girl has various stats, bonuses for being in formation with specific other girls, and there are goddesses that you can use alongside your formation.\r\nEach girl in your team can also be upgraded in various ways (star level, rarity, gear, etc.) and there are other ways to buff your team.\r\nThere's a lot of ways to upgrade your girls, and the combat can be as simple as using the 6 girls you like the most, or you can give your formation a lot of thought to get the best possible team, so overall it feels like a decent combat system.\r\n\r\nAlso note that since each charater skin gives you a decent boost in power, whales who buy skins will be more powerful than f2p players, and since combat power determines turn order, whales will just outspeed and destroy f2p players, so the top of the PvP leaderboards are for whales only.\r\nThankfully whilst there are several f2p modes, you can still do decently well as an f2p (probably due to each server having a low population, probably due to the awful new player experience) and whilst you get more rewards the better you do, the difference in PvP rewards isn't much in the grand scheme of things.\r\n\r\n\r\nNSFW\r\nThe game does have a lot of NSFW artwork in it, and almost all of it is animated to at least some extent.\r\nThe artwork is all very nice, and there is a wide variety of body types and poses to suit your preference.\r\nYou unlock quite a lot of scenes from the main story, you can view each girl on the games homescreen, there's usually an event going on that has some eye-candy as a reward.\r\nOverall it's an extremel sexualized game, as expected for something that was originally on Nutaku.\r\n(The Nutaku version is the same in terms of NSFW, but is ahead on content, so it has more girls available. The two versions can't crossplay or interact at all.)\r\n\r\nIdle game\r\nThere are many things you can do each day - Play mini games, talk to Lilin, do some story, collect idle rewards from Styx, do Giant's Armory, do the PvP arenas, [if you log in at the right time each day] do guild events, maybe do some story, do some collections or pulls for the current event.\r\nThere's quite a lot to do, but it doesn't take an annoying or problematic amount of time, but it still feels like you are making a decent amount of progress each day.\r\nOverall I'd say it's a pretty good idle game, albeit one that requires quite a lot of clicking.\r\n\r\nEvents\r\nAs above, the game always has several events running.\r\nThese vary considerably, but usually are either summoning for a new girl/skin, or a \"do tasks to get rewards\" type.\r\nIf you are f2p, you will never complete any of these events without many literal months of grinding resources.\r\nRealistically, the only skins you will get as an f2p player are the three skins the game gives you for completing the newbie events that occur at the beginning of the game.\r\nWhen you start the game you will immediately be given two events: \"Newbie Event\", which lasts 7 days, and \"Aeon Rally - Eternal\"\r\nThe Newbie Event is the games tutorial, and you should make sure you are doing everything in that event, as most of the things it wants you to do (advance your Aeons, improve gear, improve your horoscope, level up your Apostle, etc) are all things that are critical to improving in the game, and you get a unique skin for Perseus if you complete enough tasks (you need 280 out of 295 points). This skin gives you a permanent power boost for owning it, and is permanently missable.\r\nOnce the Newbie Event ends you get the \"14-Day Carnival\" event, which is basically more of the same tasks.\r\n\r\nThe \"Aeon Rally - Eternal\" event gives you points for improving the rarity of your Aeons, with Corona Stones (i.e. Premium currency) for meeting certain milestones, and if you complete 2,500 points in time then you get a unique skin for Sphinx, which again gives you a permanent boost for owning it and is permanently missable.\r\nOnce Aeon Rally - Eternal ends, \"Eternal Rally - Tennis Player\" starts, which gives you a skin for Hypnos, which again, gives a power boost to your entire team and is permanently missable. The Hypnos event lasts 3 months.\r\nThe Sphinx skin is pretty difficult to do, and the Hypnos skin is very difficult to get unless you know exactly what you are doing, and both events generally require you to go for that skin only, only spending what you need, and buying up useful items from pretty much the moment you start playing.\r\nIf you play well (only buy what you need, always reclaim the energy itmem from the daily Andromeda event, complete all the event objectives as quickly as you can, don't lag behind in any area) you'll get them, but if you don't then you'll miss them.\r\nHaving fours events that basically require you to play very well right from the moment you start playing, or else miss permanently missable skins/power boosts is extremely poor game design, especially since those are the only skins you can reliably get as an f2p player.\r\nIt is often said on the games dicord that if you can't complete the Newbie event to get the Perseus skin then you should just start again on a different server so you can get it now that you know what to do, and the same is kinda true about the Sphinx skin too - they are permanent boosts that you can never get again, so if you actually want to play the game long-term then you should make the effort to get them whilst you can.\r\nPersonally, I image a lot of people will simply start the game, not play perfectly, fail the Newbie event, then see the 14-Day event and see they will fail that too, and just stop playing.\r\nI also imagine there are many people who fail the Newbie event, look up a guide, start on a new server, complete the Newbie event, fail the Sphinx event, and then quit the game.\r\n\r\n\r\nAeons Echo is a good idle game, and a very good NSFW game.\r\nIf the skins from the beginner events were either not permanently missable, or the events were much easier, then I would happily recommend the game, but as it stands I just can't recommend a game that has a new player experience that is this bad.",

Another is that the Rewards page that shows once you boot the game is just stuck on Day 1 and never progresses.

That shit is astoundingly frustrating. Even if you're coming here for some hentai (fucking... why? You're on the internet, you can look up whatever you want for free) the 18+ is even made tedious with loading times between dialogue options. Every aspect of this game is weighed down in SLOG, like trudging waist-deep through honey.",

Another is that the Rewards page that shows once you boot the game is just stuck on Day 1 and never progresses. Both Login and Rewards are in an eternal state of being stuck with absolutely no way to get the prizes at all.\n\nThe mini-gachas. Oh my God, where do I start on this? The game is rigged in terms of the roulettes and others since I keep landing on worthless items (don't even dare tell me \"F2P BTW\" if you got better luck because you will never expect me to believe you're Free-To-Play, I'll think of you instead as \"F*****-That-Pays\"). All the events are expensive cash grabs.\n\nNow for the Gacha system. This is the very first time I have ever seen an incredibly high prerequisite to unlock the better gachas, because not even Echocalypse had this kind of thing. Now, is this a good thing?\n\nHa. You'll wish it was a good thing, but no, it is literally the worst thing because you have no idea who's gonna be pulled, and you need to do 10-draw pulls 10 times (equaling 100 pulls) just so you can do a wishlist because the pity on this game is just the worst.\n\n7.7 hours of this game played (yeah, I think I want those hours back except for that time I ran out of material).

      "review": "TLDR:\r\nThere is an actual story that actually has some nice ideas here and there, the artwork is all very nice, the girls are all unique, there are plenty of ways of improving your team, there are plenty of things to do each day, but without taking excessively long to the point it starts to feel like a chore, the interface is not the worst. It's a shame the new player experience/tutorial is so horrendously awful that I imagine most players will probably quit long before they finish them.\r\nIf you either follow a guide so you do everything right for your first three months of playing, or just accept that you have missed out on several permanently-missable skins and power buffs, then it's a good NSFW idle auto-battler... that I do not recommend.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n\r\nStory\r\nThe game has a story - it's an \"amnesiac protagonist is suddenly in a harem world\" as is expected for a NSFW idle game, but there is a lot of story there, and it has some good ideas and funny moments, and keeps moving and changing at a pretty good pace.\r\nThere's plenty to not like though, most notably the SA/rape and crossdressing aspects though (yes, really).\r\n\r\nCombat\r\nCombat is a 6x6 idle auto-battler. You set up your formation and your girls fight their girls.\r\nEach girl has various stats, bonuses for being in formation with specific other girls, and there are goddesses that you can use alongside your formation.\r\nEach girl in your team can also be upgraded in various ways (star level, rarity, gear, etc.) and there are other ways to buff your team.\r\nThere's a lot of ways to upgrade your girls, and the combat can be as simple as using the 6 girls you like the most, or you can give your formation a lot of thought to get the best possible team, so overall it feels like a decent combat system.\r\n\r\nAlso note that since each charater skin gives you a decent boost in power, whales who buy skins will be more powerful than f2p players, and since combat power determines turn order, whales will just outspeed and destroy f2p players, so the top of the PvP leaderboards are for whales only.\r\nThankfully whilst there are several f2p modes, you can still do decently well as an f2p (probably due to each server having a low population, probably due to the awful new player experience) and whilst you get more rewards the better you do, the difference in PvP rewards isn't much in the grand scheme of things.\r\n\r\n\r\nNSFW\r\nThe game does have a lot of NSFW artwork in it, and almost all of it is animated to at least some extent.\r\nThe artwork is all very nice, and there is a wide variety of body types and poses to suit your preference.\r\nYou unlock quite a lot of scenes from the main story, you can view each girl on the games homescreen, there's usually an event going on that has some eye-candy as a reward.\r\nOverall it's an extremel sexualized game, as expected for something that was originally on Nutaku.\r\n(The Nutaku version is the same in terms of NSFW, but is ahead on content, so it has more girls available. The two versions can't crossplay or interact at all.)\r\n\r\nIdle game\r\nThere are many things you can do each day - Play mini games, talk to Lilin, do some story, collect idle rewards from Styx, do Giant's Armory, do the PvP arenas, [if you log in at the right time each day] do guild events, maybe do some story, do some collections or pulls for the current event.\r\nThere's quite a lot to do, but it doesn't take an annoying or problematic amount of time, but it still feels like you are making a decent amount of progress each day.\r\nOverall I'd say it's a pretty good idle game, albeit one that requires quite a lot of clicking.\r\n\r\nEvents\r\nAs above, the game always has several events running.\r\nThese vary considerably, but usually are either summoning for a new girl/skin, or a \"do tasks to get rewards\" type.\r\nIf you are f2p, you will never complete any of these events without many literal months of grinding resources.\r\nRealistically, the only skins you will get as an f2p player are the three skins the game gives you for completing the newbie events that occur at the beginning of the game.\r\nWhen you start the game you will immediately be given two events: \"Newbie Event\", which lasts 7 days, and \"Aeon Rally - Eternal\"\r\nThe Newbie Event is the games tutorial, and you should make sure you are doing everything in that event, as most of the things it wants you to do (advance your Aeons, improve gear, improve your horoscope, level up your Apostle, etc) are all things that are critical to improving in the game, and you get a unique skin for Perseus if you complete enough tasks (you need 280 out of 295 points). This skin gives you a permanent power boost for owning it, and is permanently missable.\r\nOnce the Newbie Event ends you get the \"14-Day Carnival\" event, which is basically more of the same tasks.\r\n\r\nThe \"Aeon Rally - Eternal\" event gives you points for improving the rarity of your Aeons, with Corona Stones (i.e. Premium currency) for meeting certain milestones, and if you complete 2,500 points in time then you get a unique skin for Sphinx, which again gives you a permanent boost for owning it and is permanently missable.\r\nOnce Aeon Rally - Eternal ends, \"Eternal Rally - Tennis Player\" starts, which gives you a skin for Hypnos, which again, gives a power boost to your entire team and is permanently missable. The Hypnos event lasts 3 months.\r\nThe Sphinx skin is pretty difficult to do, and the Hypnos skin is very difficult to get unless you know exactly what you are doing, and both events generally require you to go for that skin only, only spending what you need, and buying up useful items from pretty much the moment you start playing.\r\nIf you play well (only buy what you need, always reclaim the energy itmem from the daily Andromeda event, complete all the event objectives as quickly as you can, don't lag behind in any area) you'll get them, but if you don't then you'll miss them.\r\nHaving fours events that basically require you to play very well right from the moment you start playing, or else miss permanently missable skins/power boosts is extremely poor game design, especially since those are the only skins you can reliably get as an f2p player.\r\nIt is often said on the games dicord that if you can't complete the Newbie event to get the Perseus skin then you should just start again on a different server so you can get it now that you know what to do, and the same is kinda true about the Sphinx skin too - they are permanent boosts that you can never get again, so if you actually want to play the game long-term then you should make the effort to get them whilst you can.\r\nPersonally, I image a lot of people will simply start the game, not play perfectly, fail the Newbie event, then see the 14-Day event and see they will fail that too, and just stop playing.\r\nI also imagine there are many people who fail the Newbie event, look up a guide, start on a new server, complete the Newbie event, fail the Sphinx event, and then quit the game.\r\n\r\n\r\nAeons Echo is a good idle game, and a very good NSFW game.\r\nIf the skins from the beginner events were either not permanently missable, or the events were much easier, then I would happily recommend the game, but as it stands I just can't recommend a game that has a new player experience that is this bad.",
