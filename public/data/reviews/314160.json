      "review": "MSFS is a game I have a lot of nostalgia for. Its an old game and in the past when I was so young that I didn't know what even a game genre was, when I couldn't speak any English and when I used to download cracked games from random sites in my native language all the way back then I played a game very very similar to MSFS. I played several and no matter how much I look for it nowadays I can't find those anymore. I don't think they were MSFS X, just something similar because I remember one of the ones I played had an flyable UFO in it which was the only vehicle I had managed to get off from the ground which is why I remember it. Either way, I can't find that game anymore but I somewhat remember what it looked like and I definitely remember what it felt like. Choosing whatever cool plane you want and flying randomly to wherever. Some small launcher that helps you pick your plane and then the game begins and the rest of my days were spent pressing every button and button combo I could think of on my keyboard till I got something into the air. It was, for young and innocent me, an incredible experience. And thats why MSFS X is so nostalgic to me. Not because \"I played this exact game in the past and I remember the memories\" but because I played something so similar, back from a time where I was clueless about everything and I was nothing like the person I am today. Its fun to look back and realize that \"hey this wasn't the exact game but its so close to feeling like it.\" its fun to say that and its like ironic that I can't find the original game I played anymore similar to how I can't find that original me anymore, the one in the past that had no clue about anything and was randomly pressing buttons and having a ton of fun watching nothing happen. Its... a really weird kind of nostalgia, a very disconnected and hap-hazard or whatever they say in English kind of nostalgia that I can't quite explain. Anyways, time has passed and a lot of things have changed and during one random Steam sale I decided I wanted to taste those memories again so I bought MSFS X along with a few DLCs for it.\n\n+Again, nostalgia. The launcher, selecting a plane, the graphics... They all give me a taste, a small and distant taste of what I used to really enjoy and love when I was a kid. Being able to read and understand everything the launcher says and not having to learn every button through trial and error is a new feeling, thank god I can speak English nowadays but I can't lie, I do miss that trial and error. Either way, really small and stupid thing to praise but I love the launcher and especially the plane selection menu because its so similar to whatever game it was that I played when I was a kid. For you that probably doesn't care about my nostalgia, there's a launcher and it works and you change settings, select a plane and a location to take off from and so on through this launcher.\n+The game, by modern standards, doesn't look great for sure but I don't care. It looks so similar to my memories and thats enough for me. Nostalgia aside I do have to accept that the closer you are to the ground, the worse things look in game. But some scenery, from far away and high in the sky, can look great even with these old graphics.\n+Controls are... something. I haven't messed with the menus enough to try and memorize every keybind or set my own keybinds. I just plugged a joystick in and trial and errored my way through learning the controls. This is a little plane dependent from what I'm seeing but most planes have little text boxes you can open up in game and quickly read through the controls so its all good. We've already talked about the graphics in the previous point, as for sound its again plane dependent but usually I'd say good enough. Some DLC planes I've tried out did leave me wanting more but again, some things are very plane dependent in this game.\n+Its a lot more relaxed and slow then most of the flight sim experiences I've had before. Its similar to what I remember from my childhood but playing a lot of combat flight sim games in the recent years have definitely made this civilian flight sim a little less... exciting. Not an issue for me but something I wanna point out anyways.\n+Once more, plane dependent. From what I'm understanding some planes like the default ones you get with no DLC are made by the devs themselves, Microsoft and some other DLCs are made by different devs. Some quality changes may happen from plane to plane or helicopter to helicopter but that warning aside a lot of planes have interactable cockpits. Not 100% interactable but a lot of important stuff you might need you can just press and worry less about your keybinds which is really fun.\n\n+/- I was aware of this before I bought the game and before I bought some warplane specific DLCs and all but for anyone that doesn't know you can't actually utilize warplanes in any real way in MSFS. No shooting, no bombing, no dying. If you want to do combat with the warplanes you need to look at a combat flight sim. Stuff like DCS, IL-2  or even simulator mode in War Thunder if you're just getting into the genre and not sure if you wanna pay money yet. If you're cool with just flying around go ahead and buy whatever plane you want. If you want combat, you aren't getting it sadly, focus on civilian planes and try out the warplanes in different flight sims. Not a problem for me, I was aware of it before I made my purchases but important to point out for anyone that doesn't know.\n\n-Genuinely not a lot to do. There's missions and all sure but they aren't my main focus. The Free Flight is my main focus and that literally just means select a plane, select an airport, take off and fly and thats it.\n-There's some duplicate DLCs. Like there's two different Spitfires you can buy. I think they're made by different devs but don't quote me on that. And if I'm not mistaken the DC-3 being sold as an DLC is the same DC-3 thats already in the game. Just made by a different dev, I believe it adds some different variants and skins but again don't quote me.\n-Its really sad that we have all these cool, big and small civilian planes and no damage model to go along with it. The no combat rule I mentioned before is definitely annoying but I'm willing to let it slide I guess but this one? I'm not happy with this one. If you don't want me shooting guns in warplanes and dropping bombs and you want me to just fly the warplane ok fine but at least like if I crash into the ground or go over the plane's speed limit and break my wings at least show me it happening. All you get is a game over screen with a small text saying why its game over like \"crashed\" or \"overstressed the aircraft\" and so on. When you crash you don't *crash* your game just freezes right before you hit the ground and you get a game over text. This I'm not cool with.\n\nIts an easy to run game, very old so doesn't need a beefy PC. Its usually on a pretty big discount. If you want something combat oriented, stay away. If you have a modern, good PC and want something that looks good and everything you just wanna fly and don't care about not shooting shit down, maybe look for the more modern MSFS games instead. If you have an old PC, not a lot of money to spare, don't mind the no combat stuff then this might be for you. Its old, its easy to run, its usually on pretty big discounts and gets down to like 5 dollars same for most of the DLCs. The cheap price, the easy to run aspect make it a nice entrance to the flight sim genre because even in combat flight sim games a lot of the time its just flying around and doing nothing. If you enjoy that here you'll probably enjoy the more modern Microsoft Flight Sim games as well and you might enjoy the combat flight sim games like DCS, IL-2, Rise of Flight games as well.",

I enjoyed using FSPassengers so much I never bought MSFS 2000 until this summer. I was holding off hoping and waiting for an all inclusive add on that it was. This game still isn't bad today though for nostalgic flights. Not sure if I would pay the $25 for it I would wait for it to go on a sale. This is still probably in most flight sim fans top 3 best MSFS games of all time in 2025.",

Multiplayer is a blast if you want to race or fly with friends, and there are tons of mods and add-ons to expand the experience even further.\n\nThat being said, it's definitely a product of its time. The graphics look dated by today’s standards, and it takes some patience (and occasional tinkering) to get the most out of it, especially with modern hardware. But for fans of realistic flight sims or anyone wanting to dive into aviation, FSX remains one of the best value-packed simulators out there. \n\nHighly recommended, especially when it’s on sale!",

      "review": "Steam has brought life to this Sim.  It's just a shame that many of these great Sims (box versions) are not really working anymore online.  I have always been a big fan of the FS9 and FSX.  In fact I have 2 box sets of them both.  But not being able to get the SDK's to work from either Box Set,    I was forced to get the FSX SE.  Since this has the simconnect built in, that was needed for flights and log flights online.  It downloaded and installed and was up and running and recording flights with no issues.  I was glad that I caught this on sale just as it was ending.  \r\n\r\nSome are trading in these older sims for the newer MSFS 20 and 24.  But!  There is still life in these games and many are still allowing game play of their on the sites.  The graphics in FSX SE are not really bad either.  And you don't need a super PC to run them.  Many add-ons that were once very pricey in 2010 are really cheap or even free now.  Can' t say that with MSFS 20 or 24.  For the later sims, many are still charging a premium price for scenery and aircraft's.  I just can't do it.  Many aircraft for MSFS 20 and 24 are 10 bucks and upwards,  each.  I have with FS9 over a thousand aircraft, with FSX I have over 200.  And didn't pay anything for any of them.    See where this will add up over time.\r\n\r\nIt's always been a issue with me with MS, that after about 5 years they turn off certain servers like the weather.  And then you have to find 3rd. Party add ons.  No thank you.  Maybe with FSX SE, you may not be able to see fish swimming in the ocean like MSFS.  But that the beauty of this version.    You need a little imagination.  Hats off to Steam for knocking this down 90% from sale price at time of this review.  You can't go wrong with this, you really can't.",
