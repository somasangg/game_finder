The atmosphere is thicker than anxiety at a family reunion. The animations are smoother than butter sliding down silk.\r\n\r\nNo dialogue. No HUD. Just pure emotional damage wrapped in artistic perfection. Every sound, every shadow, every awkwardly-timed jump feels like it’s whispering ancient secrets straight into your spine.\r\n\r\nBy the time I reached the ending, I wasn’t sure if I’d beaten the game or if the game had psychologically adopted me. I closed it, stared into the void for ten minutes, and honestly? The void blinked first.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\nExistential dread (in 4K)\r\n\r\nPuzzles that make you feel both dumb and enlightened\r\n\r\nEnding will haunt your dreams\r\n\r\nLittle boy runs like his life depends on it (because it does)\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\nNone.

The animation, and especially the sound, is exquisite, every little detail is accounted for. As for the gameplay, it's just like Limbo: your controller has two buttons, and you're controlling a young boy, so there's not many variables to contend with, meaning the puzzles are generally not too hard. It took me a little longer to beat than Limbo, but don't let its relatively short length put you off. It's a mesmerising experience - just make sure to turn the lights down and turn your headphones up.",

      "review": "Inside is a masterclass in atmospheric, minimalist game design. Right from the first steps through its rain-soaked woods, it drags you into a bleak, wordless world where every shadow feels significant and every sound is loaded with tension. Rather than pounding you with exposition or tutorial pop-ups, the game trusts you to unearth its secrets and figure things out through movement, experimentation, and sheer intuition.\r\n\r\nYou play as a nameless boy, running for his life across hauntingly rendered environments that echo both dystopian horror and strange beauty. The sense of dread is unmatched—as you crawl through mud, hide from faceless adults, or plunge through icy water, the silence is broken only by subtle, perfectly placed audio cues that make the hairs on your neck stand up. Even with no dialogue and no HUD, Inside communicates everything purely through sound, visuals, and the sheer desperation of your character’s sprint.\r\n\r\nPuzzles are at the core of the experience: never overwhelming, but always clever. They ramp up in complexity but rarely obstruct your path for so long that the tension fades. Some trial and error is required, and a few sections (especially around water) can feel a bit repetitive, but the game always finds its rhythm again. The platforming is tight and responsive, and every animation feels meticulously crafted. It’s not a long game—most players will finish in around three to four hours—but every minute is densely packed with intrigue and uneasy wonder.\r\n\r\nReplay value is mostly found in hunting for hidden secrets and seeing a bizarre alternate ending, but Inside’s main journey is so tightly constructed that its short length never feels like a drawback. If anything, the brevity makes its moments hit even harder. It’s disturbing, mysterious, and gripping without ever feeling over-the-top or exploitative.\r\n\r\nIf you appreciated the strange, silent horror of Limbo, Inside takes everything to the next level: richer visuals, deeper atmosphere, and an ending that will either haunt or puzzle you for days afterward. For fans of moody puzzle-platformers or anyone seeking a genuinely unique experience, it’s an easy recommendation. Turn off the lights, put on headphones, and let yourself get pulled inside.",

Dr Egg man desperately needs rebalancing too; as the final boss, I expected far more polish. Shadow is a far superior boss battle - the player having to actually use timing and quick-reaction based tactics, in order to beat him.\n\nYou see how I started this by reviewing a fictional Sonic game? Weird, eh? That's how confused I was when starting out in this game. If you got someone to play it without telling them it's got a significant horror element to it, I think you'll get some hilarious results. It very quickly goes from confusing, to sh*t-your-pants terrifying! Then back to being a bit confused again, but that's a good thing, as you're trying and figure out the puzzles to progress this time. I'm being a bit stupid, but honestly, this game is a work of art. The art style is absolutely gorgeous and unique; it's extremely both relaxing, and unsettling somehow. The ending is an absolute mind-melter. A real experience of a game. If the aesthetic even remotely appeals to you, just buy it. It's an absolute horrific pleasure to endure.\n\n- Also, Tails is an annoying b*tch.",

The game is a masterclass in art design, sound design, cryptic story telling, puzzle design. It is a short 2 to 3 hour game, but will leave you more satisfied than a lot of 30-40 hour long AAA titles out there.

The atmosphere is amazing — dark, mysterious, and beautifully crafted — but after a while, it all starts to feel the same. The puzzles are simple and repetitive, and the slow pacing made it hard to stay engaged. The story tries to be deep and symbolic, but it ends up feeling too vague, like it’s mysterious just for the sake of being mysterious. The visuals and sound design are top-tier, I’ll give it that, but the gameplay itself felt empty and the ending didn’t feel rewarding enough to make up for the long, slow build-up. It’s not a bad game at all, just not as special as people make it out to be — at least for me.",
