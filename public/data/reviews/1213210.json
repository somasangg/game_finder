The setting for the original C&C is better than Red Alert, with its near-future scifi themes, and Kane is the ultimate bad guy. But Red Alert has better gameplay, with the presence of medics and the fact your basic troops have increased range. Games are super fun to start with when the map is undiscovered and full of possibilities, though are slightly less fun towards the end, as the AI is predictable. There's plenty of extra missions but I got a little tired of those; those FMV cut scenes and watching the cheesy plot unfold really makes the campaign worthwhile!",

      "review": "With the 30th anniversary upon us, I finally decided to give this game a proper write-up. This review may be long, so I'll try to cover the most important parts here in the beginning:\r\n\r\nThis 25th anniversary collection contains the very first game from 1995 (also known as Command & Conquer: Tiberian Dawn or C&C95) and its prequel, the original Red Alert. Both have fundamentally identical gameplay to the originals, but there are many Quality of Life features, bonus content including Behind the Scenes and Missions exclusive to the console ports, visual overhauls, and audio improvements. If you play this, you must keep in mind that the PC RTS genre was merely 3 or 4 years old when these were released. The gameplay tries to be as faithful as possible, so have an open mind about possibly dated level design.\r\nThat being said, this collection is an utter triumph as far as quality remasters go. More importantly, it's a glorious bright spot in the past 15 years of (mostly) neglect this franchise has faced from the holder of its Intellectual Property. EA did the fans right this time. They asked for community input and oversight and involved the Former Westwood Creators. If you're on the fence, this game frequently goes on sale for a bargain.\r\nPlease also consider the Ultimate Collection, which includes all 17 major PC releases (RIP Sole Survivor) including the ORIGINAL Win95 compatible versions ONLY of C&C95 and RA1. If you buy that one on sale it's technically less than $1 a game because of expansions. Finally, The Modding Community is excellent for many games in this series. Seriously, Mods revolutionized things for me once I discovered them. The dedication of the community is keeping this franchise alive even with a decade and a half of relative silence.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith that out of the way, I'm going to devote most of the rest of this to C&C95, so I want to quickly mention my thoughts on Red Alert 1. RA1 is probably the more approachable of the two. It has a fantastic competitive scene with a high skill ceiling (mostly on CNCnet). It can be fast-paced, and marks the birth of the Tank Rush. There are a multitude of missions. There is more variety of technologies and unit types, and the two factions are quite distinct. From a singleplayer/casual standpoint, feel free to experiment. I think it probably has one of the more impressive soundtracks in the series too, especially tracks from the Aftermath. (I have other personal favorites, but that's trying to look at it objectively). All-in-all, Westwood took a large step towards solidifying the identity of the series when they released it in 1996, and while it may be challenging, the gameplay holds up pretty well and the package here in the Remastered Collection has wonderful presentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, on to the main event. Command & Conquer 1 holds a special place in my heart. I am the same age, though I didn't realize how close until a few years ago. I didn't actually play the PC version until I got \"The First Decade\" collection from 2006. I DID however play the Nintendo 64 Port as a child, and I struggled with it. Most of my experience came as I grew up watching my Dad get wrecked by Kirovs in Red Alert 2 until he finally figured out how to prepare anti-air in time and subsequently defeat hard enemies. He showed me how to surround my base with pillboxes, and thus began my long history of turtling. I also yearned for Yuri's Revenge and Generals, which my cousin had. Naturally, I got a lot better with time, and once I got the First Decade, I was able to catch up on all the other games I'd missed. Nowadays I've become our family's resident LAN game and C&C Mod expert, so this series has remained very important to me. TFD is when I started to play C&C1 for real, and it was a journey that helped me improve in other games too.\r\nSo, most people would probably find C&C95's level design to be annoying, cryptic, or punishing. Why? In my opinion, it's a Puzzle game as much as it is an RTS. It quickly gained a reputation for me as \"the game where you never have money.\" You will ALWAYS run out of money unless you farm or make bold moves. I am a shameless turtle, and I like the former method, but there are some impressive ways to humiliate the AI. (Please look up guides from Nyerguds, he loves this game even more than me and he's a pro.) In base-building missions, you need to micromanage your harvester so your Tiberium Field is not consumed. only harvest in diagonal \"checkerboard patterns\" and the resources will slowly grow back. If you don't, then the field will either be permanently gone or take an absolute eternity to grow back with only a Blossom tree.\r\nWhen there is no base, or if you're strapped for cash, here's the other fun part about this game. YOU MUST MAKE EVERY UNIT COUNT... most of the time. I went back to the N64 version later, and I distinctly remember the GDI mission where you start with a few grenadiers on the beach taking out the three turrets so your MCV can arrive. I moved to the right and started getting some minigunners and a guard tower, but I didn't have enough money for a weapons factory. Then an early flame tank ate my infantry for breakfast and buildings for lunch. That left an impression on me that every choice I made in that game mattered. You will struggle to find the right strategy for every situation, but when resources are tight and you are put in impossible situations, you will come to appreciate the niche of every unit. You are also rewarded for keeping your units alive through micromanagement. Most of the series will let you slide by with tank spam, and if you're good enough you can probably get away with it here too (or maybe bike/buggy for Nod,) but this game will actually test you. It's the little things too, like the garbage HP and absurd cost of the Bazooka men is offset by excellent ability to take out tanks and guard towers if you can place them at the perfect range, or facing away with Mammoth Tank turrets to maximize the rocket attack. This is a game where the design is wholly different from everything that came after, and while that means it shows its age, C&C95 has solidified itself as one of my favorites in the whole series for the unique flavor it brings to the table.\r\nAside from gameplay, it was a pioneer in both CD Audio Music and Full-Motion Video in PC games, and has a story which fits the period of the mid-90s well. Most of the characters were simply Westwood Employees on green screen. Joe Kucan is timeless as Kane, but he initially planned to simply direct rather than also star as the villain. The plot is not too exciting if you want a modern drama with twists, turns, and inter-character dialogue, but it does a great job of dropping you into the world and letting you see how war is changing with the proliferation of Tiberium. It's a slow drip-feed of information--you learn things as they develop. The finales are also rather brief and open-ended, leaving the consequences of either Kane and Nod's defeat or their discrediting and humiliation of GDI up in the air. (That is, until Tiberian Sun or the Mod Twisted Insurrection.)\r\n\r\nIn closing, Command & Conquer 1 may not be for everyone, but as the codifier of the RTS genre, it leaves an indelible legacy on everything that came after. It may be tough, but like most things in life it becomes much more enjoyable when you invest the time to get better at it. You can analyze the subtleties of units, learn their strengths and weaknesses, abuse and cheese the AI, micromanage your units, and do the impossible--even the Covert Ops missions which still give me trouble.\r\nI'm enough of a nerd that I have a 486 DOS PC and installed the REAL original from 1995. (By the way, it's a little slow so it's better to at least have a Pentium) I wholeheartedly hope others will come to appreciate this game for what it is. This Remastered Collection is an excellent way to do so.\r\n\r\nHappy 30 years to Tiberian Dawn and the entire Command and Conquer Series!",

However, I DID NOT ENJOY THE OTHER GAME CnC or what ever that garbage is called. controlls are horrid. gameplay, horrid. story  and cutscenes are GOOD. i despise every bit of gameplay and the fact that it has so much of it.... im gonna go insane because of this game (NOT BECAUSE OF RED ALERT) because i have only made progress on it with the help of youtube (YES THATS HOW BAD THIS CnC PART IS). \r\n\r\ni only recommend the Red Alert part of this collection. im only 100% both because Red Alert is in here. Red Alert is the superior game. its fun, enjoyable, awesome, has good content and everything awesome you can immagine.",

Its a Classic redeux lol, granted the graphics overhaul could be better but its good enough to hit nostalgia with an ion cannon. if that dont work, send in a nuke truck lol. game is same as it every was (SAME AS IT EVER WAS, SAME AS IT EVER WAS), Only MUCH BETTER just like thunderdome (ok who gets the references lol). having everything in 1 place is awesome and being 1 of the 1st thousand to register for online gaming with the ps2 internet extension plug-in lol, ive been gaming a long time and can safely say im not senile and remember the double decker bus comes around noon, oh wait, ive strayed a little there. oh yes, C&C, both Tiberium and Red Alert were the best(they got a little carried away with the multi-purpose units from Red alert3 onwards) and this revamp is more of a testament to excellence, these days devs are more interested in appeasing the broken woke mob but back then, you got the game as it was intended without the drama and feelings, and if you didnt like it, you didnt buy it (or traded it in lol). with the map editor this game doesnt get old- its like looking at your 600yr old vampire uncle and thinking, he never gets old and neither does his jokes. Campaigns were great then and still are, the skirmish modes are great and the hidden stuff is still thre(though ive not bothered looking for the ants and extras yet lol). All the characters have aged well and dont look a day older than when they 1st shot the scenes lmao yes yes i know(but do you? lol). i will warn that if you're a core controller player, you will have to spend time configuring the pad or you can give up and use the keyboard and mouse, there are a few community setups based on the ps1/2 controls and im also working on a friendlier pad configuration for the game, selecting groups and assigning units is a bit of a handful when using the controller but practice makes perfect and once you find a setup that you can remember, those woes disappear making way for hours/days/weeks of fun.",
