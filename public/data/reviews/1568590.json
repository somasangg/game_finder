One moment you’re doing tasks, the next you’re yelling at your friends because a duck sabotaged everything and blamed you.\nIt doesn’t take itself seriously at all, and that goofy energy keeps it super replayable.

      "review": "I do not recommend this game. The worst UX \r\n\r\nFirst, you cannot access friend's list while you are playing. On #feedback channel of Goose Goose Duck Discord server, I raised this issue on 6 Nov 25. \r\nChris/Canadian_Thor who is one of the Gaggle Crew (I guess the dev team) replied on 8 Nov 25 that the inability to access Friend's list while in game was \"to prevent coordination and unfair gameplay while in match. Among other reasons\" and that \"Rounds don't last too long\". \r\nThis inability means that you cannot tell your friends while you are still in game that the room has available slots because it is common that when someone dies early, they just leave the lobby.\r\nIt also means that when you see a friend in game, you can message them. But it does not mean they can reply you even though they are online. \r\nI do not find the reasons given to be acceptable.\r\n\r\nSecond, once you edit the note on a friend, you cannot delete it. I raised this issue on the same #feedback channel of Goose Goose Duck Discord server on 8 Nov 25. The same person Chris/Canadian_Thor replied that \"there is a cooldown to avoid spamming this feature\" and a lame condition that \"(you will need to have a stable network connection to access all game features)\".\r\nToday 16 Nov 25 I tried to delete the note again, I can't. So I replied to the message \"there is a cooldown to avoid spamming this feature\" that it has been more than one week and I still can't edit the note. I asked how long is the cooldown and whether they would consider adding visual cooldown so that players are informed on when they can edit notes on Friend's list.\r\nWhat happened next is outrageous. GGDGuidebot deleted my message and replaced it with \r\n\"Moderation\r\nUh-oh!\r\nIt looks like your message was removed because it didn’t comply with the server rules. Please take a moment to review the guidelines before posting again. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation!\".\r\nI saw Chris/Canadian_Thor was typing before my message was removed. It can be implied that the same person Chris/Canadian_Thor decided to remove my message.\r\nWhat is funny is that the description of the #feedback channel of Goose Goose Duck Discord server is \"We welcome all feedback, whether positive or negative, as long as it is constructive and helpful. Rudeness, harassment, dogpiling or disrespect towards the developers, community management, or other members will not be tolerated.\r\nPlease be considerate when submitting feedback: avoid pinging Gaggle staff and strive to provide constructive comments rather than emotionally charged responses.\".\r\nIt seems like they are just all talk about \"welcome all feedback\".\r\nAgain, I do not accept their given reason of \"avoid spamming this feature\". Just compare this feature to that on Discord or any other social media. You can just rename, edit notes without any cooldown. Also, who would spam this feature?\r\n\r\nYou will not encounter these problems if you never want to use those features: connect to friends while in game and editing notes on Friend's list. So feel free to play if you do not think this game will deteriorate your mental health in one way or another. But I do not plan to play this game ever again.",

But for steam deck I can hear people in the lobby.  I can hear the game in the background.  As soon as the game starts however.  I can't hear anything.  The audio of the game is silent i can't hear people talking.  It's a big problem and also my mic stops working.  Major issue. Makes you playing pretty much impossible. I genuinely cannot play this game anymore on steam deck cause of this issue. So I just play on my phone now",
