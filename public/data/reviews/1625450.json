Highly recommend if you like survival games. Also if you decide to read the negative reviews, they will say the exact opposite as me (or be mad that you cant have \"fun\" with the mobs) so you decide whether or not it's a game for you.",

With all that in mind i find myself rather irritated by the fact that I turn off the tutorial like 17 times (Again i like to figure things out for myself, but also that BEEP it makes is so bloody irritating) but no matter what it just turns itself back on as soon as i start a new run. Turn it off before starting run? BEEP blue ring in your face in that ever-annoying handholding fashion. Turn it off while mid run? Nah it doesnt go away just stays there and keeps beeping. This is entirely a personal issue and one that stems from a susceptibility to sensory overload, and i think the game itself is rather nice (I have seen many hours of videos) and could be quite fun once you actually delve into it. But for me, until the tutorial stays off permanently when i turn it off then I just cant do it. Again, game itself has wonderful charm and artstyle, so if you're not a basket case like myself then you'll probably enjoy it. Plus its free!! Thats always a plus. All in all would recommend but also please fix turning tutorial off its the entire sole reason im not going to play the game anymore.",

I've heard there are mods for this, not sure if those mods work with Steam.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I love the design, cows are abstract expressionist, there's a simplicity to the trees, feels like I'm walking thru a Dali painting.  \r\n\r\nEven if you create a session to be Creative, and Easy, you will be attacked.  Eventually.  Basically, to survive, forget about creating a base, stockpiling resources.  It'll get trashed by mobs anyway. Being inside four walls won't protect you.  If not playing Creative, keep moving, get iron asap, get only enough to make better tools/weapons, abandoning anvils, tables, and just keep moving, progress as fast as possible to get to the shipwrecked boat asap.  Cuz it's easier to defend, don't get attacked as much.\r\n\r\nSometimes you may have to reroll, like if you start somewhere with no iron in sight.\r\n\r\nAnd this is precisely the appeal of the game.

Wander too close to enemy mobs and they chase you relentlessly, and come nightfall, will spawn in directly behind you in groups of 2-3, and should you be in combat already, no distinct sound is given to notify you. Current sound notification gets lost in combat noises, making the new mobs appear from nowhere. Day cycle is too short to accomplish any thing of real note. Lastly tutorial is too short before tossing you into the thick of it. Died so many times tryin to figure out how to use the cauldron. Even at its minimalist difficulty without going into 'Creative' mode, this is not a game meant to be played Solo.",

      "review": "First achievement \"Big Mistake\" is right. Not a game to be recommended for Solo game players.  Wander too close to enemy mobs and they chase you relentlessly, and come nightfall, will spawn in directly behind you in groups of 2-3, and should you be in combat already, no distinct sound is given to notify you. Current sound notification gets lost in combat noises, making the new mobs appear from nowhere. Day cycle is too short to accomplish any thing of real note. Lastly tutorial is too short before tossing you into the thick of it. Died so many times tryin to figure out how to use the cauldron. Even at its minimalist difficulty without going into 'Creative' mode, this is not a game meant to be played Solo.",

      "review": "Awfull and messy game with poor lag optimization. Spawned in and im instantly being attacked by two rock monster thingies (Which proceed to chase me for a good while until finnaly shifting their attention to the crafting bench that the tutorial made me make.) I escape and manage to make some progress. I made an axe and pickaxe and went out to get food, but thats when night hit. 1 or 2 minutes of nonstop agony and annoyance as im ganged up on by five or ten different enemies, each being insanely tanky and hard to hit due to the games poor sensitivity options and whatnot. Managed to survive and got food, then went back, built a furnace and started building a base. Not even a minute later its night again and this time its even worse. I end up dying, with my progress being fully deleted with a game over screen, so much for \"Easy mode\". I then noticed the creative gamemode, so i jumped into a creative game. Right off the bat, the only difference here was that i wasnt relentlessly pursued by some tanky enemy, at least not yet i wasnt. Everything was peacefull here, despite the eye strain of the awfully colourfull and badly built landscape. Same as last time, tools, food, base... But when i return to camp, i am once again attacked even though it was broad daylight. I died, creative mode my ass. Overall this game needs a heck ton of work. I get its meant to be silly, but it doesnt make it any more of an enjoyable expeirience.",
