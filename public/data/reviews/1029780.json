The building system is incredibly fun and flexible, letting you design and expand your settlement exactly how you want. I love choosing my initial settlers, managing their needs, and making sure they’re happy, healthy, and well-fed. Combat, crafting, and even tending animals all add extra layers of depth without feeling overwhelming.\r\n\r\nThe game doesn’t try to impress with flashy graphics — instead, it keeps things simple but detailed enough to feel alive. And it works beautifully. The real “goal” isn’t to beat the game, but to survive and see your settlers thrive, which makes every session rewarding in its own way.\r\n\r\nAfter more than 800 hours, I can say it’s very well balanced, with just the right mix of challenge and accessibility. I’d only wish for a bit more content in areas like trading — for example, actually visiting other towns instead of just using a resource pop-up window would add a lot.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is one of my favorite colony sims ever.

It’s incredibly addictive (ruined my sleep schedule, but that’s nothing new).\n\nWhile it’s a fantastic game overall, there are a few quality-of-life improvements that could make it much smoother. As a fellow game dev, here are some ideas:\n\nFarm Management\n - Add a Farm tab where we can custom-group crops. For example, I could stop sowing autumn crops on all crops with a single action.\n - Option to automate seasonal farming tasks.\n\nJobs System\n - The Job page feels intimidating at first. Hide all the individual priority boxes by default.\n - Replace with a pre-made dropdown menu (e.g., Builder, Smith, Cook), each expandable into specific priorities.\n - Allow saving custom job setups (e.g., “Winter Jobs,” “Summer Jobs”).\n - Advanced option: Assign different jobs by time of day (train in the morning, garden in the evening).\n\nDrafting & Combat\n - Add a bulk draft button to instantly draft everyone.\n - Bonus: Add a “fighter” checkbox per villager so only combatants get drafted, while others automatically hide.\n\nSelection Tools\n - Selection boxes should only affect the visible layer, avoiding underground stockpiles.\n - Add a modifier (e.g., Ctrl+drag) to only select items, not villagers.\n\nHauling & Items\n - When selecting items, the Haul button should always appear, even if some items are forbidden or in a stock pile—just assign what’s possible.\n - Add a “refresh selection” button for forbidden items after raids so we don’t have to deselect/reselect everything.\n - Double-clicking should select all connected items of the same type (e.g., every wall piece), not everything in a huge radius.\n\nBuilding & Deconstruction\n - If deleting 50+ blueprint pieces, add a confirmation popup to avoid losing massive amounts of work by accident.\n\nUI/UX\n - In the Overview tab, add a search bar for quick lookups (e.g., “training dummies”).\n - Add clearer guidance for room requirements—I didn’t realize for ~50 hours that efficiency boosts require specific room setups and that was a fluke of wondering what this random button did\n - If a villager takes damage off-screen or on another layer, show a big, obvious popup (maybe even auto-pause).\n\nOnce again Id like to say this is a great game, the kind of game ive always wanted to play even with the frustrating bits",

Why do I bring this up? Both games are colony sims in the vein of \"Dwarf Fortress\", and the gameplay in both games is and feels very similar. The main difference for me is that \"Going Medieval\" feels a lot more rounded, deliberate, and a lot less stupidly and infuriatingly random, whilst looking better, and having a much better UI.\n\nSince purchasing the game (for the first time) in 2021, the game has received regular updates and patches (on a monthly basis), including new features and mod support (which I have not used yet). I do agree that the Early Access phase has been long, and some more QoL features are desireable, but Foxy Voxel have certainly not been inactive!",

Though my settlers lives have been saved more than once by the in-game almanac, which is such a helpful tool I am grateful for. The search isn't super accurate but its easy enough to find what you're looking for when something doesn't pop up.\r\nThe flavour text and worldbuilding is enjoyable, the settler interactions and differing personalities help add a lot of character to the game that makes it stand out.

Especially if you are a bit of a nerd for medieval history and/or architecture.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I would love to see which I don't think has been implemented is the ability for your settlers to have kids.

They seem to find it easy to get down there but then somehow need my guidance to get out. Iv tried putting grated doors down there but my peasants only seem to be able to lock those doors from the inside. So my problem seems to need that i sacrifice a peon forever putting a odd taste to the villages drinking water. Sigh.. \r\n \r\nBut it still got a nice touch to it. Erecting a building in bricks is a time consuming enterprice just as you would expect. Digging a moat took me 2 years etc. It definitly has some cool stuff in it but i would still recommend to hold off for awhile if possible. Its probably a much more enjoyable game in a year from now. And in a few years when mods is somewhere even near Rimworld then im sure this is going to be a truly cool title. They do seem to put in the effort to add stuff now and then.
