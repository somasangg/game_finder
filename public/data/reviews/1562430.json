It's probably not for everyone, but I loved it.\r\n\r\nThe fishing isn't overcomplicated: go to the right spot and play a fairly simple minigame, then maybe do a bit of inventory management to fit the fish in your hold. There are things that want to kill you, but during the day (roughly speaking) they're limited to specific areas of the game world. At night, the monsters come! So it's up to you whether you want to play it safe and sleep through most nights safe at a harbour, or take risks to get the valuable fish that come out at night.\r\n\r\nThe ambience is interesting: a slightly unlikely mix of cozy and creepy. And the story, while light, is fun. If mild horror and fairly chilled out gameplay appeal to you, give this a try. Definitely one where I'll keep an eye on new games from this developer.",

      "review": "The idea of a fishing game with elements of Lovecraftian horror is an interesting one, and Dredge makes good use of it for the first few hours. The cozy atmosphere and music are immediately arresting, and the mysterious narrative hooks and art style make for an intriguing introduction.\n\nOnce the novelty wears off, Dredge quickly settles into going through the motions of checklist gaming. After the first couple areas, you've essentially seen everything the game has to offer, and most of the progression entails optimizing tasks that aren't particularly demanding to begin with. The main threats at hand are nightfall and the leviathans that occupy the different areas, but both of these pose minor inconveniences at best and hardly live up to the mythology the game presents. The various tasks you're given are equally formulaic and rarely require much thought or intrigue to get through. These problems are compounded with the addition of DLC which add more padding to a game that doesn't need it.\n\nUltimately I think the fundamentals of Dredge are solid, and it's worth picking up the base game and spending a few lazy evenings with it. There are a few interesting story beats that crop up, and pulling a new horror out of the water never ceases to be satisfying. But once you hang up your captain's hat, I wouldn't expect much of this largely frictionless experience to stick with you in the long run.",

I first played this for free when it was in early access and enjoyed it so much I bought it and dlc. It's nice to play a game that isn't full of bugs, or with frustrating mechanics. Haven't been this happy with a game since Stardew Valley in 2016.  \n\nThis game combines two of my faves: fishing and real Lovecraft vibes, it's  not a generic gory fish zombie button masher which seems to be the most common Lovecraft interpretation. No, this actually taps into the fear on the unknown and plays with your memory. I don't have thalasophobia, I easily swim in deep water as far as I am legally allowed but even I had some oh shit moments, glad this game is not real life. The jump scare was very well done, I appreciated it. I can't remember the last time I got scared. I'm not a fearful person, I find most horror art-products tedious, boring and very dumb. \n\nPlaying a second time is not as scary true. And many will probably find the game grindy like they complained about SDV, but I don't feel it's so and I am still enjoying it a lot. \n\nI wish it was voice acted and had co-op (though that maybe would defeat the purpose of feeling lonely and alienated) and a better story, a deeper story. But here's my purchase may it lead to a very good sequel. I really want more of this, it's good as is.   Sad more ppl don't like it, my husband couldn't play it even though he likes fishing, but Lovecraft, real Lovecraft has always had a niche appeal. I'll definitely be following this studio's next releases and looking up what else they have made.",

The gameplay is not too difficult once you figure it out and the game can feel a little short, but it is a well crafted world and story.

      "review": "A remarkably relaxing fishing game with competent and logical fishing mechanics that are varied enough to be interesting for the shortish runtime but not complicated enough to prove burdensome.  Now, if you have thalassophobia or ichthyophobia, yeah, you're going to have a very different experience and DREDGE is probably going to be absolutely terrifying.  For everybody else, you might enjoy some rather interesting atmosphere, particularly if you have an affinity for Lovecraftian vibes.\n\nI say it that way because atmosphere and vibes are most of what you'll be getting in that DREDGE does both open world and Lovecraftian flavor very well.  However, those swords each cut both ways and one thing they align on cutting into is narrative.  That isn't to say there is no narrative, there very much is, and it's even well done at that.  The catch is that for the world to be open, regional stories need to be self-contained and effectively modular, and for unspeakable horrors beyond your comprehension to be what they say on the tin, they can't just go bludgeoning you with explanations or indeed, explaining many things at all.\n\nThe result is almost a collection of short stories that give you a tantalizing taste of something more, but then stop.  A part of that is a side effect of the relatively small regions, surely, but I do wish there was some more followup on many of them.  I'm not asking more threads be tied up neatly, again, that's counter to the theme.  Rather, I'd like to pull on a few of these threads further, all the more so if doing so leads to some kind of ramification that extends beyond the small box they are otherwise contained within.\n\nAs a consequence, the main story feels spread thin, its beats dispersed by the regional quests.  This holds all the more true if you have the Pale Reach and Iron Rig.  You could rush the main story to avoid that but then you'll have a short experience and miss out on some interesting things that are worth finding.  Not everything worth discovering shows up on the quest list, log, or encyclopedia.  A very good thing, in my book.  Speaking of books, I'm one of the maniacs who filled in every page of the fish encyclopedia.  There's some neat things in there (including a fun friend on the last page), although hunting them all down also contributes to said spreading of the main story.\n\nI do recommend the Pale Reach and especially the Iron Rig, by the way.  The former is another region, much like the others, with all that entails.  The later is arguably the same, but rather than be wholly self-contained, it spreads across the other regions and ties them together better than really anything else.  It doesn't change their stories, which is a shame, I wouldn't mind a comment here or there from locals as Iron Rig things happen nearby.  It also doesn't go to the Pale Reach at all, probably because there's no guarantee you've got both DLCs.  It adds a lot of mechanical depth too that I appreciated and is relevant outside of just its direct content.\n\nIn all, DREDGE really is worth a go if you've gotten far enough on the page to see reviews.  My biggest complaints come down to wanting more of a good thing, and that's the right kind of problem to have, if you must.  It's competently done, has a solid core gameplay loop (assuming you like fishing), and a fitting style for art and music, both of which I rather enjoyed.  Also, it has one of my favorite archetypes: The merchant that isn't technically everywhere at once, just always where you're going before you without you noticing her passing you.  Plus, she does that solo-operator thing where she darts between stalls with minorly different outfits for each and that always makes me smile.",

      "review": "This is a recommend with caveats for me. TL;DR a lot of this game's appeal to you is going to come down to how you feel about the atmosphere. If you like it, 8.5/10, pick it up with the DLCs on sale (see next paragraph). If you don't like it but find the concept interesting, give it your two hour refund window and keep in mind that the fishing mechanics really don't change much beyond the first couple hours. If you don't like the game loop of fish -> sell -> upgrade -> catch different fish-> repeat, go ahead and sit this one out.\n\nFor some incomprehensible reason, the sales lined up such that buying the digital deluxe edition and then buying the Complete Edition Upgrade Bundle saved me a bit over $15 compared to just purchasing the Complete Edition, so be sure to mess around with the purchase options a bit. Personally, I'd feel I'd overspent if I bought the base game for $25. I haven't fully played through the DLCs, but I'd say pick up Iron Rig and Pale Reach on sale, and avoid Blackstone Key unless it works out cheaper to buy it bundled with the base game, as was the case for me.\n\nNow, on the pros side of the review, this game has an excellent, spooky maritime atmosphere I would describe as feeling a bit Victorian/Steampunk despite the game itself being set in [spoiler]the mid-1900s[/spoiler]. The core game loop and progression feel tight and rewarding, and the controls are pretty slick, if a bit jumpy on keyboard and mouse. The story is quite good, if understated at times, though that can be fairly chalked up to a stylistic preference. I'd have liked to have some more concrete plot elements and outcomes, but the way the story is written lends itself well to the dreamlike atmosphere the game cultivates and the Eldritch fiction legacy it draws from.\n\nWith as much love as I can tell went into this game, I wouldn't feel right criticizing it without offering my opinion on what would improve it.\n\nMenus and UI:\nMany UI elements are animated in the world, such as navigating the different vendor options when you've docked. On the surface, this is very charming, but it has the unfortunate effect of making menuing feel unbearably clunky once you're constantly going back and forth between fishing and selling. Extending the menuing issues, certain portions of the game, particularly towards the end of the main story \"Pursuit\" (this game's equivalent of a quest), feel rushed and unpolished, with some seemingly-arbitrary deviations from the norm in the ways menus and Pursuit items work throughout the rest of the game. [spoiler]I'm specifically talking about the way the Airman's quests and interactions function.[/spoiler] It's a small part of the game, but it felt very odd to have one section simply not match the way the rest of the game had worked up to that point.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game loop is probably the strongest element of this game, but it comes with its own caveats. For as much fun as the fishing is, it's frequently interrupted by frustratingly-poorly-explained features. I found the day/night cycle unenjoyably prohibitive as the game progressed. I get the sense that the way the game scales from the player's perspective doesn't match what the developers envisioned when designing the game, leading to a definite falloff in fun and immersion later in the game. It's also notable that there are secrets and achievements in this game you are straight-up unlikely to encounter unless you look them up or get quite lucky. There were a few points in the game at which I would say my expectations were subverted in a bad way, which once again broke the immersion for me a bit.\n\nI could go on for awhile, but that about sums it up. It's a strong game, not quite worth the full asking price in my opinion, which struggles a lot in areas of polish. If the developers have the time and budget to revise and revisit key areas (and I recognize this is now an old-ish game and unlikely to feasibly receive such treatment), I honestly feel that the bones of a 10/10 product are there. As it is, though, I think the game holds itself back as an experience with many of its design decisions.",

I did need to change off some of the default camera settings, but other than that I've had no problems. It's a pretty game with music that perfectly fits the setting, and give a nice feel of adventure. I give it an 8/10.",

Overall this game is a fun cosmic horror nightmare fishing game with enough lore to cover a good two hours or more. This game really sucks you in I currently have 25 hours playing the game I got most of the achievements, caught all the fish, and several other completionist style things and I bought the game two days ago. It's rather short but I've also played it on the ps5 so I went through it at breakneak speed. For most I would say doing what I've done on their first playthrough may take anywhere from 30-50 hours I'm an outlier as an insomniac with a 5 day weekend and a tendency to get really into games. Would recommend but be aware if you have thallassophobia or any other fear of big wide open space without any visible landmarks or you struggle with movement controls in some games be aware this game is a game that will prey on those fears and weaknesses the most. but aside from that have fun and happy fishing.",

The gameplay is relaxing and calming, going from fishing spot to fishing spot before rushing to a dock before night. It's always fun catching a new [spoiler]aberration[/spoiler] and seeing what it looks like. Finding the perfect rod combinations and managing cargo space is almost like a puzzle. The art is also incredible, the 3D environment looks great and the 2D portraits and sprites are amazing and detailed. \n\nThere are some issues I have with the game, but they're rather minor and don't really take anything away from the experience. Dredge has two total endings, but the requirement for the second one feels ridiculous, [spoiler]it becomes available after interacting with a single NPC, and you have to talk to two more NPCs to actually trigger the ending[/spoiler]. It would make more sense to become available after a side quest, not whatever that was. Another large issue I have with the game is its lack of replayability. Once you do everything in a playthrough, there doesn't feel like any major reason to return. Every game will play almost the exact same, and while this is the case for other games, but there's something about the gameplay of Dredge that makes you enjoy playing it once, but not wanting to have to do it again. Because of this, I would recommend buying the Complete Edition which includes all the DLCs so you can play through everything in one go.",

      "review": "Overall, Dredge is a pretty interesting game, though I do have some complaints about it. Overall I thought the gameplay was fun and I never got tired of it while working through the story, but the story itself was not super interesting to me.\n\nAt first I was VERY invested into the story and I thought the sinister fishing type atmosphere was super cool, and all the hints that you should NOT be out at night kept me on my toes and genuinely stressed me out (in a good way) when night fell and things started happening. I always kept a close eye on my sanity bar to make sure I would be safe, and I always made sure I could make it back to a port in time.\n\nThe issue I have is that the horror is almost completely surface level and once you start to push the boundaries a little by staying out later or letting your sanity go a little farther you start to realize that the VAST MAJORITY of the things you see in the shadows are just cosmetic, and even the things that aren't cosmetic do little more than poke at you 90% of the time. To be honest, this put me off of the game pretty bad because once I realized this, there was pretty much no reason to worry about the night or sanity at all and you could just kinda do whatever.\n\nAnother issue I have is with the story itself, while on the surface it seemed super interesting, things didn't really tie together in a satisfying way, most of the story points were just sidequests that did little to contribute to the overall narrative. These sidequests were still fun to be fair, but really didn't seem all that rewarding. The ,main narrative also went mostly unexplained, there were hints here and there at what was going on but for the most part it was just disconnected story points.",

I don't think it's worth 25 Euro, but if on a good discount, I would recommend it. I bought it on a discount, too. I liked the graphics and the way the game is designed and I absolutely love the soundtrack, I even added it to my playlist. However, it's not worth full price.\n\nSpoiler Free Review:\nMy main reasons of critique are that I thought it was kind of short for a complete playthrough and the story is too boring to play it again for a different ending, in my opinion. I got good stuff relatively quickly, which made the achievement effect a bit too less rewarding. I did like the character interactions, though some characters were rather flat. The ending (at least the one I got) was rather disappointing and it didn't feel like I finished the game since the game doesn't save after the ending and I personally don't like that. When I stopped playing, it didn't feel like I actually played the game through, which was very unsatisfying, because I DID play the game through.\n\nSpoiler Review:\nI got the ending where I brought him every artifact and some giant monster spawned and his (I think) wife got ressurected or something. Getting every artifact was a bit too quick for me and the ending, at least the one I got, was a bit abrupt and very little saying. Like I said, I think getting every upgrade and so on was too easy and I personally didn't struggle at all. Sometimes the night was a bit too drastic, since it was barely night and I already died or something, or I didn't die at all. It was odd. I did like the characters and some side stories, like the one with the researcher.",

A few games mix peace and tension together as smoothly as this one.\n\n At first look, it seems like the world's all chill: soft waves, gorgeous sunsets, and those quiet islands. But the longer you're out on teh water, the more you start to feel that something's off beneath the waves Fog, weird noises, weird shapes on the water — DREDGE builds fear not with sudden scares, but with a steady, nagging unease You often feel alone, watched, and strangely fascinated at the same time.\n\n The day– night cycle really sets the stage, making daytime feel like a warm embrace. But when night comes, things change. When panic strikes, things get all mixed up, and weird stuff happens — it's like a total mood switch without any sense of it being unfair. You're meant to be heading back to the harbor, btu your curiosity just won't let you leave the mysterious depths of the dark sea.\n\n The tunes and sound effects really ramp up the vibe: soothing, sad tunes in the safe spot — and heavy, creepy atmosphere when the sun goes down. This atmospheric gem turns even the simplest things, like catching a fish, into a bit of a suspenseful adventure.\n\n The main gameplay — fishing, upgrading, exploring — rocks and blends seamlessly with the whole vibe. The real star shines bright: mysterious, stunning, spooky, and totally irresistible.\n\n  DREDGE is this atmospheric gem that's got a way of both calming you down and giving you the chills at teh same time If you're into games that mix up mood, tension, and a bit of creepy horror just right, this spooky fishing adventure is a must-do",

The story itself is profound for 10-20 hours of gameplay, the mechanics are fun and not tedious as everytime you think it might get annoying, an upgrade just happens to be around the corner to keep the gameplay fresh and fun. The story / vibe of the game is spectacular, providing you with a unique feel that I've seldom experienced before. The art style is unique and beautiful in its own way, and the sheer variety of fish and their aberrations provides a constant sense of discovery.\r\n\r\nThis game is a perfect example of discovery and exploration done right - feeling perfectly rewarding but not tedious. Additionally, somehow such a small game that is objectively just a couple islands makes you feel like you are part of something far far bigger - it truly depicts grandeur to its world while being a small package of fun.  The story and lore is envigorating and I will need a lore video, although you do understand the general gist of the story by the end, video or not. \r\n\r\nThe game has its thrilling spooky moments and balances out fear and excitement really well. The sheer creativity at work here in not only the art style but the types of ways to spook players is phenomenal. The soundtrack is brilliant, with special shoutout to the collectors theme which really reflects the sense of mysteriousness about him. I still have one dlc left to go, but iron rig was really fun and fit really well into the main story (I finished it before the last island of the main story). It definately rewards this playstyle but makes your map harder - a perfect balance here as the DLC rewards are very much worth it. You also learn more about the world and it further makes the universe of dredge feel that much larger just with one damn oil rig - brilliant writing and very creative with perfect execution. The iron haven corp mystery starts when you see strange crates located around the sea, and the lit up oil rig in the distance starting from the get go makes you really want to explore it. I accidentally made my way to the second DLC towards the end, and it started off well by spooking me to bits.\r\n\r\nStrong recommend here and I am excited to see what this studio releases in the future. \r\n\r\nabove a 9/10 for its genre, now within the 9/10 id say it could have even more to it, but that could affect the charm this game has. I would say the game lands a solid 9.3/10, with only criticisms being that it does get a little too easy towards the end and some more challenge may be warranted, as well as the ending(s) being a little confusing.  Brilliant game try it out !",

I just ended up feeling a little bit disappointed. \n\nThe world starts of as being quite ominous and mysterious at the start, but it never really gets scary. It's actually very easy to avoid danger since the game barely forces you to go out at night, and before you know it your boat is faster than everything else. Similarly, there are a lot of side-quest that have an interesting premise, but ultimately do not go anywhere. An example of this (minor spoiler ahead) is the package you deliver to the dockworker. The package is described as being wet with strange voices emanating from it. You deliver it to the dockworker, who seems happy to receive it and shields the content of the package from your view.

This gameplay loop is satisfying enough, and to be fair you do unlock some more abilities later as well as being able to upgrade your boat. But by the end of the game, I was getting a bit bored of it. And that's saying something because the game does not take long to complete at all. Which by the way can be seen as another point of criticism: I have about 14 hours in the game, and I feel like I have done almost everything the game has to offer.

Speed trivializes every challenge: enemies can’t catch you, travel time disappears, and money pours in effortlessly. Lighting, equipment, and hull upgrades become irrelevant. What’s left is a series of fetch quests scattered across interchangeable regions that you can reach within the first hour.\n\nThe world feels static and underdeveloped. Towns never evolve, NPCs rarely return, and story threads vanish as soon as they appear. Even the supposed mystery ends with a whimper, not a revelation.\n\nWhile the atmosphere and art direction are strong, the gameplay loop is thin, easy to exploit, and ultimately hollow. Dredge could have been a haunting tale of discovery and dread — instead it’s a repetitive checklist that loses tension as soon as it begins to move. \n\n2/5 Rating.",

I like the concept, and style wise is has a lot of charm. But after a while you realise it's just a lot of busy work. Go get a fish. Somewhere. Because someone wants a fish. Rinse and repeat.\n\nThe missions grow in number, but there's no real sense of difficulty arc. I wouldn't say the game is difficult per se, but it can get annoying if you're going on missions you're not ready for and it's not clear you're not ready for them until you attempt them.\n\nExamples of annoyances: you're in the middle of nowhere, your engine has completely broken! You'll need to go load the last save or spend hours trying to get back to the nearest port. Oh your boat scuffed a rock - you've lost your cargo. Why is a ring being left on deck so it can just fly off at the slightest provocation? \n\nThis doesn't make for difficulty, it makes for frustration.\n\nOther annoyances are the steering is the wrong way around when you reverse your ship, so I'm constantly struggling with which way to turn. And you can't just go to a dock and go straight to the screen you want you have to click it, then get some repetitive written dialog. And then you have to have the characters making these weird vocalisations. Urrghgh. Ewwww. Ohehhgh. EVERY. TIME. It grates.\n\nOh and did I mention quick QTE mini games? Yeah they can do one.\n\nThere's glimmers of a nice premise here, but it's just a boring slog. And the game decides challenge = more boring slog.\n\nI find it hard to recommend, even on sale.\n\nAddendum: Despite the above I opened the game again. Picked up a stone tablet. Fish attacked boat immediately. Stone tablet lost. Closed game.",

I completed every side mission and filled the encyclopedia in 17 hrs. For all that, there's no way I can recommend shelling out $25 for a farming game that takes 15 hours or less to beat, not when games like Subnautica and Outer Wilds did so many of the same things years ago. \nThere are a lot of good ideas here, but for the base game specifically it feels like the devs deliberately cut content to paywall behind DLC. It's a bad feeling. If they make a more robust Dredge 2 someday I might check it out, but I can't agree that this experience was \"overwhelmingly positive.\"",

You are slow, you don't have much light or tools at your proposal and the game constantly threatens you with lovecraftian seemonsters that chase after you, hallucinations that appear in front of you and weird fish you pull out of the ocean. This creates an awesome vibe and atmosphere that succeeds at scaring you and makes you stay close to port at all time. The gameplay loop in the first couple of hours of gameplay is perfect.\n\nUnfortunately, the game does not manage to maintain this. As the game progresses, you notice that the mutated and corrupted fish you pull out of the ocean actually have no effect other than being able to be sold for a higher price. Additionally, the game provides you with more and more tools and upgrades that make any sea monsters completely unthreatening. Near the end of the game, you have a jet engine, a floodlight illuminating a footballfield around you, a spell that kills any nearby sea monsters and a teleport that you can always use to excape the most desperate situations. At this point, any lovecraftian threats are more a nuisance - a task on your todo list - rather than actual threats to you. At the end of the game, I felt more like questin in an mmorpg, fulfilling errands on my trip through the ocean.  And as I had this feeling throughout the majority of the game, I simply cannot recommend it - note, however, that my playtime was also stretched by playing the dlc at the same time.",

Although, it does get repetitive so I suggest pacing yourself, not playing too much at once. All that said, my absolute biggest gripe is the endings. Each one is so sudden and feel like a strained, wet, fart.

      "review": "Once again, I was fooled by \"overwhelmingly positive\" reviews for a thin and very shallow game that's anything but good. Lovers of this game can clown-react me all they want, but this doesn't change how shallow and half-assed this game is. Plus, I'll be swimming in Steam points, so absolutely no loss here. Maybe except for the money I put on this steaming pile of garbage.\n\nI understand it has its appeal, and that will be obvious to you from the get-go, but only if you are really into these kinds of games. And, well, I am, and I initially saw that appeal, until the fetch quests started... and stayed as the only type of quest this game offers. You could argue that improving your boat or that fishing itself are also two different types of \"quests,\" but they are solely pursued for one thing and one thing only: doing more fetch quests.\n\nIf you don't get it, I'll try to illustrate it for you:\n\nYou meet an NPC, and 4.5 out of 5 times, this will be the whole interaction: \"Hey, you have a boat. Why don't you spend around two in-game days traveling all the way across the map on those dingy engines for me and bring back some stuff I really don't care much about, but I'll still use them as an excuse to shove these two research parts or (if you're lucky) this book in your face and be done with it. Oh, and don't bother coming back to talk to me. I'll keep saying the same three lines of dialogue for the entire remainder of the game, and I'll never change. Also, I carry no weight to the overall story whatsoever, so bye!\"\n\nThat's it. That's the entire gameplay loop. And for a fishing game, you'd think it would have some nice depth to that mechanic, except... it just boils down to: upgrade boat > go fishing > sell fish > upgrade boat even more > catch even weirder fish (for no reason or no impact on the story whatsoever) > travel farther > upgrade boat > go fishing... rinse and repeat.\n\nAs for the horror part, the only thing I have to say about it is that the REAL horror here is that this game simply doesn't change its core gameplay loop, because ACTUAL horror elements? Nah... at most you'll get some weird ass big fish chasing after you in the dark, which by the way are completely avoidable since the stupidest of boat tiers outrun any \"threat\" the game throws at you. Also, the fish have weird Lovecraftian counterparts that play an eerie tune when you catch them. That's the whole horror in it.\n\nThere's a tremendous lack of depth in the story, characters are impressively uninteresting, and what little side story you get is equally uninteresting and/or as obnoxious as the whole \"go there, fish for something, come back\" mechanic. They even try to sprinkle in some obscure upgrading, but these also serve only as a means to get more fish, to sell more, and to upgrade more of your boat.\n\nI'm terribly sorry for whoever likes this game as much as the reviews suggest, but it simply didn't gel with me, and for all the wrong reasons. What's left are the graphics, music, and general art direction. They couldn't be more vanilla if they tried. The music itself is something you'll get fed up with in the first hour, because you'll be stuck for that entire hour listening to the same track, over and over...\n\nFrom what I gather, I'm actually close to the end, and I STILL haven't seen anything that hooked me in and made me want to explore whatever else the game has to offer. I'm just going to drop it altogether. There's no way an overwhelmingly popular game doesn't offer a sliver of fun in an 8-hour playtime. I am not finishing this game. Even if playing this to the end—just to see what I can safely say will probably be the middest ending ever conceived—would net me 100 bucks for the effort, I still wouldn't.\n\nHell, I even asked Gemini if it knew what game I was talking about when writing this review and it precisely suggested Dredge at the first go...\n\nAll in all, this is barely a 3/10 game. It could be a 6/10 if you really, really, really like having your time wasted. But it's high time people stopped cherishing haphazardly-made slop on pedestals.",

Speed trivializes every challenge: enemies can’t catch you, travel time disappears, and money pours in effortlessly. Lighting, equipment, and hull upgrades become irrelevant. What’s left is a series of fetch quests scattered across interchangeable regions that you can reach within the first hour.\n\nThe world feels static and underdeveloped. Towns never evolve, NPCs rarely return, and story threads vanish as soon as they appear.

I like the concept, and style wise is has a lot of charm. But after a while you realise it's just a lot of busy work. Go get a fish. Somewhere. Because someone wants a fish. Rinse and repeat.\n\nThe missions grow in number, but there's no real sense of difficulty arc. I wouldn't say the game is difficult per se, but it can get annoying if you're going on missions you're not ready for and it's not clear you're not ready for them until you attempt them.\n\nExamples of annoyances: you're in the middle of nowhere, your engine has completely broken! You'll need to go load the last save or spend hours trying to get back to the nearest port. Oh your boat scuffed a rock - you've lost your cargo. Why is a ring being left on deck so it can just fly off at the slightest provocation? \n\nThis doesn't make for difficulty, it makes for frustration.\n\nOther annoyances are the steering is the wrong way around when you reverse your ship, so I'm constantly struggling with which way to turn. And you can't just go to a dock and go straight to the screen you want you have to click it, then get some repetitive written dialog. And then you have to have the characters making these weird vocalisations. Urrghgh. Ewwww. Ohehhgh. EVERY. TIME. It grates.\n\nOh and did I mention quick QTE mini games? Yeah they can do one.\n\nThere's glimmers of a nice premise here, but it's just a boring slog. And the game decides challenge = more boring slog.\n\nI find it hard to recommend, even on sale.\n\nAddendum: Despite the above I opened the game again. Picked up a stone tablet.

      "review": "DREDGE was alright. Not recommending on basis of taking a neutral stance with a short tip into the negative.\n\nThe biggest problem I have with DREDGE is that it nearly does not do enough with its sinister premise of lovecraftian horror and setting. I think that's largely because of these two following points: \n- it's way too easy to avoid any incoming danger, both territorial and otherworldly, \n- and it rarely, if ever, forces you to venture out at night, and if it does, those challenges can be completed without much hassle, or skipped past via other methods.\n\nWhat sucks most about this is that there are more than enough messed up monsters waiting outside in the waters. Quite a bit of care has been given to create an uneasy atmosphere while sailing through the world of DREDGE. The art direction has that slight pinch of uneasiness, which exactly hits the \"I can't tell if you are friend or foe even after meeting you for the 6th time\" these games really need. The soundtrack is sweet but somber. You see fishes sail the water through where you are glad you are not currently on its priority for a snack. A fellow fisher boat suddenly turns out to be something far more sinister. Trees nearby don't wish visitors at night...\n\nIn short, there are more than enough building blocks here for a great horror game. However, avoiding these dangers is just as easy as to take a rest in a port, and then travel by day. Most of what I listed was stuff I had to actively seek out by myself, and that really sucks. \n\nAlongside the anxiety meter discouraging you for staying out for too long at night, where I found the game to be the most fun, DREDGE makes for a game I found mostly boring with some really great heights that were never fully utilised.",

      "review": "For how much good press and reviews this game earned, I found it to be quite basic and short. In other words, I think it was overhyped. It's a fun little fishing game with slight horror touches. But it doesn't go very deep in either gameplay or story. It doesn't do either badly, quite the opposite. It's all just a bit anemic. The variety in fish seems to be where most of the effort went and especially the rare mutated variants are fun and creative. But you've quickly seen all there is to see. The upgrades are straightforward and linear. Nothing to change up the gameplay, just increasing improvements to your core stats. It doesn't take long at all to unlock everything at which point money and therefore the core fishing part are meaningless. There are a handful of side quests, one short questline per location plus a few side activities but they don't add up to very much. Most egregious though is the fact that most of the little secrets you can find around the map are just copies. It defeats the sense of discovery when it all boils down to 'Where is the humming rock/sunken ship/hooded figure in this biome'. One such line of secrets at least unlocks you a set of unique gear to justify having many instances of it but the fact that this is the only set of special unlockables is exactly where my grievance with this game lies. An open ocean exploration game where you've quickly learned what to expect and have likely seen the limits of its scope well before the finale.\nAll in all this feels like a great concept with fantastic art direction but lacks content and doesn't harness the potential of its premise. Maybe the DLC add so much more but the base game feels like a slightly scaled up version of something you'd find for free on itch.io.

You are slow, you don't have much light or tools at your proposal and the game constantly threatens you with lovecraftian seemonsters that chase after you, hallucinations that appear in front of you and weird fish you pull out of the ocean. This creates an awesome vibe and atmosphere that succeeds at scaring you and makes you stay close to port at all time. The gameplay loop in the first couple of hours of gameplay is perfect.\n\nUnfortunately, the game does not manage to maintain this. As the game progresses, you notice that the mutated and corrupted fish you pull out of the ocean actually have no effect other than being able to be sold for a higher price. Additionally, the game provides you with more and more tools and upgrades that make any sea monsters completely unthreatening. Near the end of the game, you have a jet engine, a floodlight illuminating a footballfield around you, a spell that kills any nearby sea monsters and a teleport that you can always use to excape the most desperate situations. At this point, any lovecraftian threats are more a nuisance - a task on your todo list - rather than actual threats to you. At the end of the game, I felt more like questin in an mmorpg, fulfilling errands on my trip through the ocean.  And as I had this feeling throughout the majority of the game, I simply cannot recommend it - note, however, that my playtime was also stretched by playing the dlc at the same time.",

Lovers of this game can clown-react me all they want, but this doesn't change how shallow and half-assed this game is. Plus, I'll be swimming in Steam points, so absolutely no loss here. Maybe except for the money I put on this steaming pile of garbage.\n\nI understand it has its appeal, and that will be obvious to you from the get-go, but only if you are really into these kinds of games. And, well, I am, and I initially saw that appeal, until the fetch quests started... and stayed as the only type of quest this game offers. You could argue that improving your boat or that fishing itself are also two different types of \"quests,\" but they are solely pursued for one thing and one thing only: doing more fetch quests.\n\nIf you don't get it, I'll try to illustrate it for you:\n\nYou meet an NPC, and 4.5 out of 5 times, this will be the whole interaction: \"Hey, you have a boat. Why don't you spend around two in-game days traveling all the way across the map on those dingy engines for me and bring back some stuff I really don't care much about, but I'll still use them as an excuse to shove these two research parts or (if you're lucky) this book in your face and be done with it. Oh, and don't bother coming back to talk to me. I'll keep saying the same three lines of dialogue for the entire remainder of the game, and I'll never change. Also, I carry no weight to the overall story whatsoever, so bye!\"\n\nThat's it. That's the entire gameplay loop. And for a fishing game, you'd think it would have some nice depth to that mechanic, except... it just boils down to: upgrade boat > go fishing > sell fish > upgrade boat even more > catch even weirder fish (for no reason or no impact on the story whatsoever) > travel farther > upgrade boat > go fishing... rinse and repeat.\n\nAs for the horror part, the only thing I have to say about it is that the REAL horror here is that this game simply doesn't change its core gameplay loop, because ACTUAL horror elements? Nah... at most you'll get some weird ass big fish chasing after you in the dark, which by the way are completely avoidable since the stupidest of boat tiers outrun any \"threat\" the game throws at you. Also, the fish have weird Lovecraftian counterparts that play an eerie tune when you catch them. That's the whole horror in it.\n\nThere's a tremendous lack of depth in the story, characters are impressively uninteresting, and what little side story you get is equally uninteresting and/or as obnoxious as the whole \"go there, fish for something, come back\" mechanic. They even try to sprinkle in some obscure upgrading, but these also serve only as a means to get more fish, to sell more, and to upgrade more of your boat.\n\nI'm terribly sorry for whoever likes this game as much as the reviews suggest, but it simply didn't gel with me, and for all the wrong reasons. What's left are the graphics, music, and general art direction. They couldn't be more vanilla if they tried. The music itself is something you'll get fed up with in the first hour, because you'll be stuck for that entire hour listening to the same track, over and over...\n\nFrom what I gather, I'm actually close to the end, and I STILL haven't seen anything that hooked me in and made me want to explore whatever else the game has to offer. I'm just going to drop it altogether. There's no way an overwhelmingly popular game doesn't offer a sliver of fun in an 8-hour playtime. I am not finishing this game. Even if playing this to the end—just to see what I can safely say will probably be the middest ending ever conceived—would net me 100 bucks for the effort, I still wouldn't.\n\nHell, I even asked Gemini if it knew what game I was talking about when writing this review and it precisely suggested Dredge at the first go...\n\nAll in all, this is barely a 3/10 game. It could be a 6/10 if you really, really, really like having your time wasted. But it's high time people stopped cherishing haphazardly-made slop on pedestals.",

It's repetitive to an exhausting extent with no real payoff. Discovery is limited, choices are non-existent, ship upgrades are marginal, and the story definitely doesn't live up to the environment. The \"pursuits\" (which definitely feels like a thesaurus was consulted just to avoid the word \"quest\") are so dry and unimaginative, with hardly a hint of unpredictability or intrigue.\n\nIt's a shame that such a wonderfully stylistic game has such lackluster writing and mechanics. If it's on sale, it could be worth picking up if you have a few hours to kill, but otherwise, I'd pass on this one.",

      "review": "It's not a bad game but I do think it's really overrated. It starts off quite strong, but it doesn't really go anywhere after that. I just ended up feeling a little bit disappointed. \n\nThe world starts of as being quite ominous and mysterious at the start, but it never really gets scary. It's actually very easy to avoid danger since the game barely forces you to go out at night, and before you know it your boat is faster than everything else. Similarly, there are a lot of side-quest that have an interesting premise, but ultimately do not go anywhere. An example of this (minor spoiler ahead) is the package you deliver to the dockworker. The package is described as being wet with strange voices emanating from it. You deliver it to the dockworker, who seems happy to receive it and shields the content of the package from your view. When you visit him later, he can best be described as in a catatonic and zombie-like state. Presumably you gave him a corrupted fish, which he ate, but it never gets explained and he just stays like that for the rest of the game with no new dialogue or anything. In other words, the mystery is never unravelled. Most side-quests are like this and the same is true for the main story. The final cinematics are cool, but I just thought the whole thing was a bit anticlimactic. \n\nThen there's the gameplay. The gameplay at the start is mostly the gameplay you will have for the rest of the game: a fishing mini-game that revolves around you pressing \"F\" at the right time, fitting those fish in your inventory, and selling them or handing them in for certain quests (a lot of quests just boil down to catching a specific combination of fish). This gameplay loop is satisfying enough, and to be fair you do unlock some more abilities later as well as being able to upgrade your boat. But by the end of the game, I was getting a bit bored of it. And that's saying something because the game does not take long to complete at all. Which by the way can be seen as another point of criticism: I have about 14 hours in the game, and I feel like I have done almost everything the game has to offer. The map is quite small and there isn't that much to see, so it just doesn't inspire that feeling of vastness or the dangerous unknown. \n\nIn my opinion, this is a game with a very strong premise but is unfortunately not fleshed out beyond that. It contains a lot of great ideas that do not go anywhere. I was hoping for an intriguing horror story or the feeling of being an insignificant speck compared to the vastness of the ocean. Games like Subnautica did this for me in the past, but unfortunately this game was unable to do so.",

Not a different button depending on which one I'm currently in.\n⦁ The buttons for rotating items and switching inventory tabs are the same.

I like the concept, and style wise is has a lot of charm. But after a while you realise it's just a lot of busy work. Go get a fish. Somewhere. Because someone wants a fish. Rinse and repeat.\n\nThe missions grow in number, but there's no real sense of difficulty arc. I wouldn't say the game is difficult per se, but it can get annoying if you're going on missions you're not ready for and it's not clear you're not ready for them until you attempt them.\n\nExamples of annoyances: you're in the middle of nowhere, your engine has completely broken! You'll need to go load the last save or spend hours trying to get back to the nearest port. Oh your boat scuffed a rock - you've lost your cargo. Why is a ring being left on deck so it can just fly off at the slightest provocation? \n\nThis doesn't make for difficulty, it makes for frustration.\n\nOther annoyances are the steering is the wrong way around when you reverse your ship, so I'm constantly struggling with which way to turn. And you can't just go to a dock and go straight to the screen you want you have to click it, then get some repetitive written dialog. And then you have to have the characters making these weird vocalisations. Urrghgh. Ewwww. Ohehhgh. EVERY. TIME. It grates.\n\nOh and did I mention quick QTE mini games? Yeah they can do one.\n\nThere's glimmers of a nice premise here, but it's just a boring slog. And the game decides challenge = more boring slog.\n\nI find it hard to recommend, even on sale.\n\nAddendum: Despite the above I opened the game again. Picked up a stone tablet.

Not recommending on basis of taking a neutral stance with a short tip into the negative.\n\nThe biggest problem I have with DREDGE is that it nearly does not do enough with its sinister premise of lovecraftian horror and setting. I think that's largely because of these two following points: \n- it's way too easy to avoid any incoming danger, both territorial and otherworldly, \n- and it rarely, if ever, forces you to venture out at night, and if it does, those challenges can be completed without much hassle, or skipped past via other methods.\n\nWhat sucks most about this is that there are more than enough messed up monsters waiting outside in the waters. Quite a bit of care has been given to create an uneasy atmosphere while sailing through the world of DREDGE. The art direction has that slight pinch of uneasiness, which exactly hits the \"I can't tell if you are friend or foe even after meeting you for the 6th time\" these games really need. The soundtrack is sweet but somber. You see fishes sail the water through where you are glad you are not currently on its priority for a snack. A fellow fisher boat suddenly turns out to be something far more sinister. Trees nearby don't wish visitors at night...\n\nIn short, there are more than enough building blocks here for a great horror game. However, avoiding these dangers is just as easy as to take a rest in a port, and then travel by day. Most of what I listed was stuff I had to actively seek out by myself, and that really sucks. \n\nAlongside the anxiety meter discouraging you for staying out for too long at night, where I found the game to be the most fun, DREDGE makes for a game I found mostly boring with some really great heights that were never fully utilised.",

It's a fun little fishing game with slight horror touches. But it doesn't go very deep in either gameplay or story. It doesn't do either badly, quite the opposite. It's all just a bit anemic. The variety in fish seems to be where most of the effort went and especially the rare mutated variants are fun and creative. But you've quickly seen all there is to see. The upgrades are straightforward and linear. Nothing to change up the gameplay, just increasing improvements to your core stats. It doesn't take long at all to unlock everything at which point money and therefore the core fishing part are meaningless. There are a handful of side quests, one short questline per location plus a few side activities but they don't add up to very much. Most egregious though is the fact that most of the little secrets you can find around the map are just copies. It defeats the sense of discovery when it all boils down to 'Where is the humming rock/sunken ship/hooded figure in this biome'. One such line of secrets at least unlocks you a set of unique gear to justify having many instances of it but the fact that this is the only set of special unlockables is exactly where my grievance with this game lies. An open ocean exploration game where you've quickly learned what to expect and have likely seen the limits of its scope well before the finale.\nAll in all this feels like a great concept with fantastic art direction but lacks content and doesn't harness the potential of its premise. Maybe the DLC add so much more but the base game feels like a slightly scaled up version of something you'd find for free on itch.io.

You are slow, you don't have much light or tools at your proposal and the game constantly threatens you with lovecraftian seemonsters that chase after you, hallucinations that appear in front of you and weird fish you pull out of the ocean. This creates an awesome vibe and atmosphere that succeeds at scaring you and makes you stay close to port at all time. The gameplay loop in the first couple of hours of gameplay is perfect.\n\nUnfortunately, the game does not manage to maintain this. As the game progresses, you notice that the mutated and corrupted fish you pull out of the ocean actually have no effect other than being able to be sold for a higher price. Additionally, the game provides you with more and more tools and upgrades that make any sea monsters completely unthreatening. Near the end of the game, you have a jet engine, a floodlight illuminating a footballfield around you, a spell that kills any nearby sea monsters and a teleport that you can always use to excape the most desperate situations. At this point, any lovecraftian threats are more a nuisance - a task on your todo list - rather than actual threats to you.

Although, it does get repetitive so I suggest pacing yourself, not playing too much at once. All that said, my absolute biggest gripe is the endings. Each one is so sudden and feel like a strained, wet, fart. The story elements really feel like they're building up to something, only for the whole thing to crumble apart.\n\nTLDR: Worth it if on sale, enjoyable if played in short sessions. But, falls so short from its highest potential that the experience is tainted.",

      "review": "Once again, I was fooled by \"overwhelmingly positive\" reviews for a thin and very shallow game that's anything but good. Lovers of this game can clown-react me all they want, but this doesn't change how shallow and half-assed this game is. Plus, I'll be swimming in Steam points, so absolutely no loss here. Maybe except for the money I put on this steaming pile of garbage.\n\nI understand it has its appeal, and that will be obvious to you from the get-go, but only if you are really into these kinds of games. And, well, I am, and I initially saw that appeal, until the fetch quests started... and stayed as the only type of quest this game offers. You could argue that improving your boat or that fishing itself are also two different types of \"quests,\" but they are solely pursued for one thing and one thing only: doing more fetch quests.\n\nIf you don't get it, I'll try to illustrate it for you:\n\nYou meet an NPC, and 4.5 out of 5 times, this will be the whole interaction: \"Hey, you have a boat. Why don't you spend around two in-game days traveling all the way across the map on those dingy engines for me and bring back some stuff I really don't care much about, but I'll still use them as an excuse to shove these two research parts or (if you're lucky) this book in your face and be done with it. Oh, and don't bother coming back to talk to me. I'll keep saying the same three lines of dialogue for the entire remainder of the game, and I'll never change. Also, I carry no weight to the overall story whatsoever, so bye!\"\n\nThat's it. That's the entire gameplay loop. And for a fishing game, you'd think it would have some nice depth to that mechanic, except... it just boils down to: upgrade boat > go fishing > sell fish > upgrade boat even more > catch even weirder fish (for no reason or no impact on the story whatsoever) > travel farther > upgrade boat > go fishing... rinse and repeat.\n\nAs for the horror part, the only thing I have to say about it is that the REAL horror here is that this game simply doesn't change its core gameplay loop, because ACTUAL horror elements? Nah... at most you'll get some weird ass big fish chasing after you in the dark, which by the way are completely avoidable since the stupidest of boat tiers outrun any \"threat\" the game throws at you. Also, the fish have weird Lovecraftian counterparts that play an eerie tune when you catch them. That's the whole horror in it.\n\nThere's a tremendous lack of depth in the story, characters are impressively uninteresting, and what little side story you get is equally uninteresting and/or as obnoxious as the whole \"go there, fish for something, come back\" mechanic. They even try to sprinkle in some obscure upgrading, but these also serve only as a means to get more fish, to sell more, and to upgrade more of your boat.\n\nI'm terribly sorry for whoever likes this game as much as the reviews suggest, but it simply didn't gel with me, and for all the wrong reasons. What's left are the graphics, music, and general art direction. They couldn't be more vanilla if they tried. The music itself is something you'll get fed up with in the first hour, because you'll be stuck for that entire hour listening to the same track, over and over...\n\nFrom what I gather, I'm actually close to the end, and I STILL haven't seen anything that hooked me in and made me want to explore whatever else the game has to offer. I'm just going to drop it altogether. There's no way an overwhelmingly popular game doesn't offer a sliver of fun in an 8-hour playtime. I am not finishing this game. Even if playing this to the end—just to see what I can safely say will probably be the middest ending ever conceived—would net me 100 bucks for the effort, I still wouldn't.\n\nHell, I even asked Gemini if it knew what game I was talking about when writing this review and it precisely suggested Dredge at the first go...\n\nAll in all, this is barely a 3/10 game. It could be a 6/10 if you really, really, really like having your time wasted. But it's high time people stopped cherishing haphazardly-made slop on pedestals.",
