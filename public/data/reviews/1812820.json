      "review": "Bitburner is a hacking and cyberpunk themed idle game that's completely unique in that it has an embedded programming language (using the JavaScript engine) that you can use in-game for various idle-game tasks. In it, you make money via simulated hacking of servers (not using any real-world hacking techniques, so don't worry, it's not THAT hard), and later, various other techniques, such as gaming the stock market, working a crime system, or completing coding contracts. This might be a bit difficult for people who are not programming nerds, but boy oh boy, does this game go deep, and it's a lot of fun.\r\n\r\nThis idle game is completely unique in that it has me automating the playing of the game at basically all times I have it running idle. There's always some system to optimize, or something to refactor. It has an uncanny way of eating up all my time despite it being an idle game! The systems at play are never trivial to get right, either, even if you know how to code. The game gradually introduces new systems, too, making for a smooth (if a little slow in the beginning) progression curve.\r\n\r\nI guess the only flaw is that sometimes it can ask a lot of you. Like, I am a professional software engineer of many years with a postgraduate degree in computer science and in the later-game, Bitburner makes me scratch my head sometimes as to how to reasonably do something well. A lot of my solutions aren't optimal (yet), and some optimal solutions I feel like I need to read academic papers to do best. A select few things are truly tasks people a thousand times better than me have put a thousand more times of work into, and still have not perfected it. Madness.\r\n\r\nDo I recommend this if you just want to jump in to learning how to program? I don't know. The game will go slower for you than others, and the game isn't fast to begin with. And don't get me started on using other people's scripts. That's cheating! But I mean, this is a free game that will never ask for money, and open-source to boot, so you might as well give it a try. It's a lot of fun and has me hooked.",

      "review": "First and foremost, this is a programming game. It is going to be basically impossible to play without programming knowledge. It uses Javascript or Typescript depending on your preference. I don't know if the internal text editor supports TS, but it's much better to use an external one anyway.  It has its own custom APIs, but otherwise it runs in a browser and every browser Javascript API is available to use/abuse. (Check out Viteburner for automated script synchronization)\n\nOther than programming, the game has the typical incremental game loop. Progress/buy upgrades/reset.\n\nI started this game for the first time almost two years ago when I was on vacation. I write software professionally, and I usually enjoy it. I just don't often want to write code after doing it all day at work. So I often start a small project that I can do in a week when I'm on vacation.\n\nWell, that vacation I chose to play Bitburner, and it's great. It's probably the best programming game out there, and it's not even close. I honestly wish they charged a few bucks here, because it's worth it. I'll have to see if they have a donation/charity where I can contribute a few bucks.\n\nRecently, I purchased another programming game involving a farm. It's not bad, but it just made me think I should come back and see about finishing Bitburner.\n\nIt's taken me several hours to somewhat re-familiarize myself and figure out the (of course insufficiently documented) code I wrote so long ago, but I've actually made some progress. I [i]was[/i] shocked that the code wasn't nearly as bad/messy I was expecting it to be, so documenting it wasn't that bad. Good job, old me.\n\nAnyway, fundamentally the game is about hacking and writing automation in Javascript to automatically do things for you. At the start, this is hacking a few machines to make some cash. As you progress, however, other gameplay features come up. This includes things like a stock market, employment, real life crime, etc. There's even a Go game which I've yet to even attempt to make a smart AI. I'll take the abysmal win percentage of random placement before trying to write a Go algorithm. As new features are unlocked, that means more things to automate. Even going as far as automating things you do in the physical world.\n\nThe automation can be as simple or complex as you want, really. I ended up writing a scheduler that distributes running programs across my network of hacked machines. Did I need to do that? Nope. And in hindsight, it probably wasn't worth the effort, but the code is still solid today and makes tons of money and allows me to essentially have a single giant pool of resources to run every script I've written. I just send a script/args to the scheduler and it figures out which machine has the resources to run it.\n\nThis game just runs in a browser, so if you want to be a real sneaky hacker you can even manipulate the DOM and do stuff that normally requires an upgrade. It's actually not a bug. It's allowed, but requires significant (in game) system resources.\n\nI highly recommend Bitburner if you're looking for a programming game, and especially if you like the idle/incremental game loop. Some of the tasks can be pretty complex, so it's likely best to have at least some professional experience, but a CS student could absolutely learn a lot here as well with the right amount of stubbornness.",

It combines incremental game mechanics with strategic scripting and automation.\r\n\r\nWhat Makes It Great\r\n\r\nIt makes you think—you decide which servers to hack, how to script growth or weaken loops, and how to scale your operations.\r\n\r\nThe scripting is flexible and accessible: even players with little programming experience can follow tutorials and use community code to get started.\r\n\r\nIt’s a sandbox: you’re free to choose your path—hacking networks, joining factions, automating buy/upgrade loops, taking on special missions.\r\n\r\nThere’s a satisfying progression: from basic scripts and a handful of servers to whole networks, optimized routines, and advanced automation.\r\n\r\nA vibrant community shares scripts, guides and tools across GitHub and Steam, helping both novices and veterans alike.\r\n\r\nWhy It Works\r\n\r\nBitburner respects your time: you can work on your scripts, walk away, and your operations still generate progress (especially at the grow/weaken level). It rewards creativity rather than forcing a rigid path. That said, there is a learning curve—documentation exists, but you’ll benefit from exploring and experimenting rather than relying on heavy guidance.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy solving problems, writing or tweaking code, or building efficient systems, Bitburner is an outstanding choice. It blends hacking-themed aesthetics with real scripting and automation depth.\r\n5/5 – A smart, empowering, and endlessly modifiable experience.",

So I was able to lay down a few of my fundamentalist prejudices against it.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, it's still a horrible language. But the number of people telling you this about a programming language is a hallmark of its success. What you are hearing are the tortured voices of the many poor souls who have to earn a living with this abominations. Cold machines of logic. Implementing the coffee fueled fever dreams of delusional people. Until those people can afford cocaine.. then it really gets interesting.\r\n\r\nBut wait.. I'm starting to babble again..\r\n\r\nI'm safe here. This is a game. The business people can't hurt me.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo.. where was I... yes, for the first time since about 10 years I had fun coding again. Imagine that. So I decided to give a warm recommendation for this game.\r\n\r\nI have to say, this game is getting dangerously close to what I did in my dayjob as a sofware developer. Not only in the sense of getting screwed over by the small shortcuts I take, really. But simply the fact that most of the things I'm doing is pulling data from somewhere by combing documentation, reformat it and/or do some calculations with it to then shove the data elsewhere. So familiar.\r\n\r\nOf course the devil is in the details and \"reformat\" and \"do some calculations\" is easily said. And those few harmless seeming words contain a world of horror and harebrained schemes.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlaying this really can make you understand what is meant with \"scalability\" in software development. You start with scarce resources, reach a level of plenty but will be reset to a period of scarcity again before you can progress the game.\r\nThis causes many interesting problems regarding scalability for your scripts.",

      "review": "Bitburner is a hacking and cyberpunk themed idle game that's completely unique in that it has an embedded programming language (using the JavaScript engine) that you can use in-game for various idle-game tasks. In it, you make money via simulated hacking of servers (not using any real-world hacking techniques, so don't worry, it's not THAT hard), and later, various other techniques, such as gaming the stock market, working a crime system, or completing coding contracts. This might be a bit difficult for people who are not programming nerds, but boy oh boy, does this game go deep, and it's a lot of fun.\r\n\r\nThis idle game is completely unique in that it has me automating the playing of the game at basically all times I have it running idle. There's always some system to optimize, or something to refactor. It has an uncanny way of eating up all my time despite it being an idle game! The systems at play are never trivial to get right, either, even if you know how to code. The game gradually introduces new systems, too, making for a smooth (if a little slow in the beginning) progression curve.\r\n\r\nI guess the only flaw is that sometimes it can ask a lot of you. Like, I am a professional software engineer of many years with a postgraduate degree in computer science and in the later-game, Bitburner makes me scratch my head sometimes as to how to reasonably do something well. A lot of my solutions aren't optimal (yet), and some optimal solutions I feel like I need to read academic papers to do best. A select few things are truly tasks people a thousand times better than me have put a thousand more times of work into, and still have not perfected it. Madness.\r\n\r\nDo I recommend this if you just want to jump in to learning how to program? I don't know. The game will go slower for you than others, and the game isn't fast to begin with. And don't get me started on using other people's scripts. That's cheating! But I mean, this is a free game that will never ask for money, and open-source to boot, so you might as well give it a try.

      "review": "First and foremost, this is a programming game. It is going to be basically impossible to play without programming knowledge. It uses Javascript or Typescript depending on your preference. I don't know if the internal text editor supports TS, but it's much better to use an external one anyway.  It has its own custom APIs, but otherwise it runs in a browser and every browser Javascript API is available to use/abuse. (Check out Viteburner for automated script synchronization)\n\nOther than programming, the game has the typical incremental game loop. Progress/buy upgrades/reset.\n\nI started this game for the first time almost two years ago when I was on vacation. I write software professionally, and I usually enjoy it. I just don't often want to write code after doing it all day at work. So I often start a small project that I can do in a week when I'm on vacation.\n\nWell, that vacation I chose to play Bitburner, and it's great. It's probably the best programming game out there, and it's not even close. I honestly wish they charged a few bucks here, because it's worth it. I'll have to see if they have a donation/charity where I can contribute a few bucks.\n\nRecently, I purchased another programming game involving a farm. It's not bad, but it just made me think I should come back and see about finishing Bitburner.\n\nIt's taken me several hours to somewhat re-familiarize myself and figure out the (of course insufficiently documented) code I wrote so long ago, but I've actually made some progress. I [i]was[/i] shocked that the code wasn't nearly as bad/messy I was expecting it to be, so documenting it wasn't that bad. Good job, old me.\n\nAnyway, fundamentally the game is about hacking and writing automation in Javascript to automatically do things for you. At the start, this is hacking a few machines to make some cash. As you progress, however, other gameplay features come up. This includes things like a stock market, employment, real life crime, etc. There's even a Go game which I've yet to even attempt to make a smart AI. I'll take the abysmal win percentage of random placement before trying to write a Go algorithm. As new features are unlocked, that means more things to automate. Even going as far as automating things you do in the physical world.\n\nThe automation can be as simple or complex as you want, really. I ended up writing a scheduler that distributes running programs across my network of hacked machines. Did I need to do that? Nope. And in hindsight, it probably wasn't worth the effort, but the code is still solid today and makes tons of money and allows me to essentially have a single giant pool of resources to run every script I've written. I just send a script/args to the scheduler and it figures out which machine has the resources to run it.\n\nThis game just runs in a browser, so if you want to be a real sneaky hacker you can even manipulate the DOM and do stuff that normally requires an upgrade. It's actually not a bug. It's allowed, but requires significant (in game) system resources.\n\nI highly recommend Bitburner if you're looking for a programming game, and especially if you like the idle/incremental game loop. Some of the tasks can be pretty complex, so it's likely best to have at least some professional experience, but a CS student could absolutely learn a lot here as well with the right amount of stubbornness.",

It combines incremental game mechanics with strategic scripting and automation.\r\n\r\nWhat Makes It Great\r\n\r\nIt makes you think—you decide which servers to hack, how to script growth or weaken loops, and how to scale your operations.\r\n\r\nThe scripting is flexible and accessible: even players with little programming experience can follow tutorials and use community code to get started.\r\n\r\nIt’s a sandbox: you’re free to choose your path—hacking networks, joining factions, automating buy/upgrade loops, taking on special missions.\r\n\r\nThere’s a satisfying progression: from basic scripts and a handful of servers to whole networks, optimized routines, and advanced automation.\r\n\r\nA vibrant community shares scripts, guides and tools across GitHub and Steam, helping both novices and veterans alike.\r\n\r\nWhy It Works\r\n\r\nBitburner respects your time: you can work on your scripts, walk away, and your operations still generate progress (especially at the grow/weaken level). It rewards creativity rather than forcing a rigid path. That said, there is a learning curve—documentation exists, but you’ll benefit from exploring and experimenting rather than relying on heavy guidance.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy solving problems, writing or tweaking code, or building efficient systems, Bitburner is an outstanding choice. It blends hacking-themed aesthetics with real scripting and automation depth.\r\n5/5 – A smart, empowering, and endlessly modifiable experience.",

If you're scared about getting lost with this much freedom, fret not, there is also well put together documentation in game if you need an early-game walkthrough, explanation on mechanics, or just a refresher. Plus, programmers will feel right at home flipping between it and the terminal or your scripts, given the frequent visits to Stack Overflow. The gameplay loop is also soundly made, mixing coding with automation downtime that can happen even when you close the game. The interface is friendly and simple, allowing you to focus on what's important. And maybe best of all is it really sells itself on the theming and concept. Beyond aesthetic choices that mimic the common style of hacker memes, the gameplay is truly in the spirit of hacking and coding, and nothing demonstrates that better than the fact you can simply hack in all of the achievements. Sure it'd be cheating anywhere else, but that perfectly aligns with what a game about hacking should be about, and I think that's awesome.",
