      "review": "Honestly i cant even begin to describe the experience with this game.  EVEN though the first 15-20 min were spent trouble shooting the main menu not loading up servers (turns out i had to restart steam)  i HAVE to admire the absolute fuck out of it.\r\n\r\nThere's just something... NOSTALGIC about the entire game, from the way round endings just dump everyone's voice chats in to the same pool, to the \"gmod gamemode\" feel to the very idea of being in this scp universe with all these other fucking clowns lol. \r\nRight down to the voice chat too. So clear you can quite literally make out the differences in everyone's mic quality,  like you'll have these sick fucks with 600 dollar mics sounding like voice actors doing impeccable impressions of of the most memable characters, right next to some asshole whos not even using a microphone but instead has a stale 6 dollar \"buy one get one\" winndixie \"freshly baked\" bread stick with a singular corroded copper wire jammed inside of it plugged in to his pc's audio port and promptly turned up the volume to 6000% using ileagal ear rape software, and hes just SCREAMING.  \r\nThen theres the guy who decided instead of speaking hes just gonna reroute his system audio in to his mic and play music as he scampers around the demons, his soul purpose getting to the PA system so he can play his music over the intercoms of the entire station. \r\n\r\nThen theres the actual gameplay, honestly i DO NOT LIKE running away from shit, something about it stresses me deep to my core. its not so much that im afraid of anything in the game (on the contrary i love SCPs) its this odd primal warning system in my body that overdoes it because me being a 280 pound lumberjack irl that could kill a SCP with my bare hands and fuck its corpse, if im EVER running from something... its a BIG DEAL and everyone should be scared lmfao.  \r\nAs such i mostly just dick around till i die as anything other than an scp or \"a guy with gun\" lol .\r\n\r\nLastly ill say ive never had a bad experience playing this game, its not super fun for me because im fucking terrible at it and i have terrible luck when it comes to running in to tryhards but it is hysterical af and deserves a thumbs up.",

      "review": "very fun game with proximity chat and I love the SCP universe with all the whacky and terrifying scp objects/entities however there is a few balance issues that will make the replay loop repetitive after a while. \r\n\r\nAfter many hours in the game my enjoyment has started to decrease as I have noticed a few consistent issues. The \"meta\" of the game devolves into incentivizing cheesy uncreative tactics such as scps bolting to light containment to kill unarmed people who have spawned making it difficult to escape without hiding in a corner or getting lucky. There is spawn camping the opposing team (this one kills the vibe the most for me), grenade trapping elevators (also spawn camping a little bit), camping specific choke points for long periods of time, grouping up with unrealistic mass of 10-20 team members in a cluster (or all your scp team) for damage and protection. All these tactics make it less fun for me because when I die to these tactics I have to spectate for 5+ minutes waiting to respawn in which when I do respawn the same tactics above will most probably send me back to spectator mode and which further incentivizes me to play more cheesy by camping and hiding to preserve my life which makes the game significantly more boring and when I want to play exciting by taking risks and plays I most likely will be sent back to the spectator screen. \r\n\r\nFurthermore it makes the game feel like a macro game where your choices dont really matter that much and its up to how your team plays that decide the victory. Also to elaborate on the macro point the respawn system can feel a bit frustrating at times where you spawn as mtf team and your entire team gets wiped out because they played poorly and you survived by playing smart but you will end up dying because the chaos team will spawn next which is going to be all the people who died as mtf but they know exactly where you are, what guns/items you have, how many teammates you have because they are in spectating mode so its you vs 20 people spawning with that knowledge and there is few ways to even the playing field and it incentivizes dying when your team dies because of that exact hopeless situation.\r\n\r\nAll that said its still a great game that gave me many hours of enjoyment and I am just nitpicking balance issues that have killed the vibe for me recently.",

It’s like Among Us, if being sus was legally justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cons\n\n* New player experience:\n\n  * Spawn in\n  * Pick up a keycard\n  * Open one door\n  * Instantly turned into neck confetti by SCP-173.\n* You will get betrayed by Class-D, Chaos, *and* your own “teammates” closing doors on you “by accident.”\n* Half of your deaths come from SCPs, the other half from elevators and “friendly fire that totally didn’t look like on purpose.”\n* Public lobbies are 50% incredible roleplay, 50% improv comedy with light war crimes.\n\n---\n\n### Peak SCP:SL Moments\n\n* Entire group staring at 173, one guy blinks IRL, all of you scream anyway.\n* Chaos and MTF meeting in a hallway, instantly turning it into a very loud, very short-lived democracy.\n* Escaping as Class-D, feeling proud… then getting gunned down by Chaos because they “didn’t recognize you.”\n* Playing as an SCP with full comms, coordinating like a deadly esports team while your victims yell in proximity chat about “balance.”\n\n---\n\n10/10\nMultiplayer horror where the real monster is poor decision-making under pressure.\nWould spawn as Class-D, swear I’m going to “play it smart this time,” and die in Light Containment in 45 seconds again.",

The game is also really badly optimized and just one late game with 25+ players and bodies can really lag your game out, even with good pcs!\n\nI can't really complain tho because the game is free and really fun, but a BIG downside is that it has a really hard learning curve, and it's even harder mastering the game, I have around 600h on the game and I haven't even mastered it.\n\nSome people (like me) have a problem with launching the game with steam. I did however find a workaround which isn't to hard to do, that is:\n1. Right-clicking the game (on the column with all your games)\n2. Hover over manage\n3. Click \"Browse local files\"\n4. Look for the \"SCPSL.EXE\" file (could just be \"SCPSL\" depending on what settings you have on your file explorer)\n5. Dubble left-click on the file and the game should start as normal except the steam overlay and other steam features\n\nOverall the game is fun to play, and with the interactions you can have with other people it can be way more fun, but there are some downsides like learning curves, infuriating rounds, and the optimization. But since it's free im gonna have to give it a strong 8.9/10!",

      "review": "SCP: Secret Laboratory — Chaos, Tension, and Teamplay\r\nRating:\r\n★★★★☆ (4/5)\r\n*SCP: Secret Laboratory* (SCP:SL) is a multiplayer horror/action game set in a mysterious underground facility during a containment breach. Players take on different roles—Class-D, Scientists, MTF, Chaos Insurgency, or SCP entities—and must either escape, survive, or take advantage of the chaos depending on their objectives.\r\nEvery match plays differently thanks to the role variety, and the game’s tension-filled SCP universe atmosphere makes each round unpredictable and fun.\r\n---\r\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\r\n1. [b]Wide Variety of Playable Roles[/b]\r\n   The game includes many different classes such as Class-D, Scientists, MTF units, Chaos Insurgency members, and of course SCPs. This creates tons of strategic variety and ensures no two matches feel the same.\r\n2. [b]Intense Atmosphere and Horror Elements[/b]\r\n   The dark facility, ambient sounds, and unpredictable containment breach events create a genuinely tense environment. The SCP universe’s sense of mystery and danger is captured very well.\r\n3. [b]Community and Multiplayer Interaction[/b]\r\n   SCP:SL has an active community and heavily relies on teamwork and communication. Proximity voice chat adds depth to strategic play and leads to hilarious (and chaotic) moments.\r\n4. [b]Free-to-Play[/b]\r\n   The game is completely free, making it easily accessible for anyone curious about the SCP universe or multiplayer horror games.\r\n5. [b]Consistently Updated[/b]\r\n   The developers frequently update the game with balance changes, bug fixes, and new content, keeping the experience fresh.\r\n6. [b]Low System Requirements[/b]\r\n   SCP:SL runs smoothly on most systems, making it an accessible option for players with older hardware.\r\n---\r\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\r\n\r\n1. [b]Technical Issues and Bugs[/b]\r\n   Players often report optimization issues, occasional bugs, and performance drops—especially on crowded servers.\r\n2. [b]Steep Learning Curve[/b]\r\n   Understanding all the classes, mechanics, and strategies can be overwhelming for newcomers. The game does not offer much onboard guidance.\r\n3. [b]Role Imbalance[/b]\r\n   Some roles (especially certain SCPs) can feel too strong or too weak depending on the match, leading to balance complaints.\r\n4. [b]Toxic Players / Server Problems[/b]\r\n   As with many multiplayer games, some servers may have toxic players or unbalanced rules, affecting the experience.\r\n5. [b]Random Role Assignment[/b]\r\n   Roles at the beginning of matches are often completely random, which can frustrate players who want to consistently play as specific classes or SCPs.\r\n\r\n---\r\n[h1]Conclusion & Recommendation:[/h1]\r\n\r\n[b]SCP: Secret Laboratory[/b] offers a chaotic, tense, and highly entertaining multiplayer experience—especially for fans of the SCP universe. If you enjoy teamwork, unpredictable encounters, and strategic survival gameplay, this game is absolutely worth trying. The fact that it’s free is a huge bonus.\r\n\r\nHowever, be prepared for a learning curve, occasional bugs, and the typical issues that come with player-run servers.\r\n\r\n[b]Overall:[/b] A fun, unique, and surprisingly deep multiplayer experience—definitely worth a shot.",

The gameplay feels chaotic in all the wrong ways—controls are clunky, hit detection is inconsistent, and the AI (both human and SCP) is unpredictable, often punishing you unfairly.\n\nThe maps are poorly designed in places, with confusing layouts and hiding spots that feel cheap rather than strategic. Matches often devolve into random chaos where luck matters far more than skill, making even successful runs feel hollow. The progression system is minimal, and the game offers little reward for repeated play, which makes it feel repetitive very quickly.\n\nPerformance issues are common. Lag, desync, and occasional crashes break the immersion, and the game feels rough around the edges despite being around for years. Communication is key in multiplayer, but the interface makes coordination awkward, leaving teamwork frustrating rather than fun.\n\nSCP: Secret Laboratory has the bones of an interesting horror multiplayer, but clunky mechanics, unbalanced gameplay, and technical issues turn it into a grindy, stressful, and often unfair experience.\n\nFinal Rating: 3.7 / 10\n\nFrustrating, inconsistent, and unpolished.

So many good moments, so many good times but sadly that is no longer possible due to the updates they gave to the game which Ill be honest I love for the atmosphere of the game but it really hit the game hard and a wave of try hards with no life and people taking the game way way too seriously has ruined the game and drains all the fun that came with it. It rubs me the wrong way so much that people want to ruin other peoples fun in a non competetive basically RP game that had its high moments from the people making it funny and not just a 24/7 moshpit where there is almost zero chance for you to survive as a d class, facillity guard or scientist and most games just end in a brawl between chaos, MTF or scp's which is EXTREMELY repetitive and boring. This game is the definition of ripping someones personality out of their body replacing it with hollowness. It has been a good few years but I am done with this game, If you're looking for a fun game then I do not recommend this because it rarely ever pays off and I feel bad you missed out on the peak of this game.",

I really don't get why there is this itchy need to rework everything and make it more \"realistic\" rather than just add new and fun stuff to an SCP game - a game based on pure fiction and fantasies.\nWhere are the horror stingers? Why is the facility so bright? Why do the rounds need to end up a battle royale match instead of focusing on killing SCPs and the quirky social interactions? Why are the SCPs reworked to be juked rather than left to be a living horror you should avoid at all costs, and if you fail - you die with a single click of a button, not dozens of them if you're \"skilled\" enough (stacked with 3 medkits and some 500s). Why am I supposed to outlive 049's touch? How is 096 unable to rip me apart the moment it gets my hands onto me? Why is 939 unable to talk to human classes now?I have to admit, stealing voices of the dead is honestly amazing, but talking to the living gave so many opportunities for either funny or semi-scary situations. Why does everything need to be balanced so much it's not really fun anymore? I remember when 330s could transform me into a funny candy monster or make me explode - and now it's gone because it was \"unbalanced\". Even the hands cutting thing doesn't work properly - they fall beneath you, but at the same time, your playermodel (and soon ragdoll of it) still has them attached.\nThis whole game blew up back then because it was both scary and silly at times. It wasn't because it was a \"super realistic, real life based SCP game with even more realistic pew pew gun mechanics\".\nI really want to enjoy this game and love it like I loved it years ago, but I truly can't.",

Sometimes switching perspectives to different players causes the game to crash.

The lighting does not give same effects as before its too bright and atmosphere is not same.Moreover i was very angry when they removed Contain procedure of 106 , in first place we need to look up to what this game took inspiration from : SCP Contaiment breach were u could contain some scp starting from : 106, ending with scp 173 were NTF  captured it , in my view this would bring more teamwork and more mechanics rather than stupic arcade shooter over a team work and cool atmosphere with lore of scp.I really love this game and i see it drifting farther and farther from its original rout so we need people who would speak up and save this game all of people who enjoy or once enjoyed this game, i have one thing to ask , spread the word and reach game studio so they hear what community really want.",
