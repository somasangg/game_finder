I tell you what we need a developer who develops this game to teach us how to do tricks and moves by stick movement tutorial of a stick movement as you're doing them. This way we can get the muscle memory and it's easier true learn the trick doing it hands on so when you do go out to the field you come to the field with a much more skill and show your friends off all the tricks you learned on uncrashed. Otherwise I wouldn't buy any other game I bought them all but I always come back to uncrash because it has the largest open world than any other ones in a lot more maps fpv logic is only limited to not very many but can we please get this game to work on cheap laptops in a tutorial on how to do tricks and to learn to fly better.",

Gradually pour in the water, constantly stirring. Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic.\nResting the dough: Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or cover it with a towel and let it rest for 30 minutes.\nPreparing the filling:\nBoiling the potatoes: Peel the potatoes, cut them into large pieces, and boil until tender in salted water.\nPreparing the onions: While the potatoes are boiling, finely chop the onions. Sauté the onions in lard or butter until golden brown.\nMaking the potato puree: Drain the potatoes and mash them. Add the sautéed onions, salt, and pepper to taste, and mix well.\nForming the dumplings:\nRolling out the dough: Roll out the dough into a thin sheet about 2-3 mm thick. Use a glass or cutter to cut out circles approximately 7-8 cm in diameter.\nForming the dumplings: Place a spoonful of potato filling on each circle of dough. Fold the dough in half and pinch the edges tightly to seal the dumplings.\nCooking the dumplings:\nBoiling water: Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add salt.\nCooking the dumplings: Gently drop the dumplings into the boiling water, stirring carefully to prevent sticking. Cook until done (approximately 5-7 minutes after they float to the surface).\nServing:\nRemoving the dumplings: Remove the dumplings with a slotted spoon and place them on a plate.\nServing: Serve the dumplings hot, optionally drizzling with melted butter, sour cream, or sautéed onions.\nEnjoy your meal!",

The flight seems realistic, graphics look decent and once you start getting the hang of it, it's good fun just flying around. My only issue with this game is that you pretty much have to have an actual fpv controller to play it, while your xbox, play station or steam controller will work; its just too difficult because of the types of joysticks they have. Your drone will pretty much always be powered to about 40 to 50 percent. I will admit, for learning to fly an fpv drone this was great because i could learn how to turn and move around without having to worry about how much throttle to give it. But once I started trying to adjust throttle on my own, it gets a bit difficult trying to balance the throttle and fight the stick a little as it trys to return to the middle. If you have the gear and you have the gear this game would be amazing and im sure that if I played with the xbox controller for a while I would get used to it and start to fly the drone a bit better as I learnt to fly. This looks like an absolutely fabulous game which is why I didn't give it a negative review, I just can't enjoy it properly without the right equiptment.",

The sim runs great and works well with all my radiomaster TX's without issue. My only complaint is the limited default models, but the workshop makes up for that in droves! \r\n\r\nAs others mention, gravity feels a bit low so turning that up helps quite a bit but overall I feel its a great tool.",

I tell you what we need a developer who develops this game to teach us how to do tricks and moves by stick movement tutorial of a stick movement as you're doing them. This way we can get the muscle memory and it's easier true learn the trick doing it hands on so when you do go out to the field you come to the field with a much more skill and show your friends off all the tricks you learned on uncrashed. Otherwise I wouldn't buy any other game I bought them all but I always come back to uncrash because it has the largest open world than any other ones in a lot more maps fpv logic is only limited to not very many but can we please get this game to work on cheap laptops in a tutorial on how to do tricks and to learn to fly better.",

Your race time will start out at 16-20 + min, but as u learn control you will shave off minutes every time\n\nFew things in life are as rewarding as learning a slower drone u can control than plowing through with a flashy one\n\nThen as your learning to control the more powerful drones any your ghost of your former run passes you really teaches u to mind your limits untill you have the same level of skill\n\nStick with it! You will find yourself recovering automagicly with pure skill\n\nI would buy this again at full price because it scratches an itch i never knew i had",
