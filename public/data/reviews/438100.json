It is a realm where one may either find peace among friends or be virtually molested by the chaos of the human mind.\nTake a quiet stroll through worlds of shimmering light, and you might witness a minor tragedy: a virtual child defiled by a man twice his age. It is beauty and horror entwined..a portrait of the internet’s true face.\nThis is a sanctuary where minds come to be shattered, rebuilt, and shattered again, until death feels like enlightenment.\nAnd yet.. after 4k hours on Quest and 2k+ in PCVR, I find comfort here. The madness becomes home.\n10/10. Do not play this game. But if you must, may the algorithm have mercy on your soul.",

I recommend it to anyone that has a good pc and vr headset and is over 18.\n\n[h1] The good: [/h1]\nThis game is all about creativity and talking with people that you would have never met without this game, you can feel close with people that are thousands of miles away, you can watch movies with people you can play games with people and visually see them, its amazing. This game imo is a good investment if you enjoy it because you will not legally find entertainment for cheaper, i have spent like 4k on hardware for this game and its given me 7k hrs of gameplay so unlike triple A titles where its 80$ for 10-40 hrs of gameplay (8-2$ per hr of gameplay) i get 0.57$ per hr with this game of course mileage will vary.\n\n[h1]The bad:[/h1]\nif you are not 18 I do not recommend this game this game has a bad rep with people getting groomed so if you are under 18 either wait or be really careful, this game like I said is like a 2nd life so it can mess with your emotions just like real life and it can suck you into this game almost full time, and it can make you neglect your actual life and get you to spend thousands on vr and pc equipment just to run this game better or add more features ( I highly recommend getting full body tracking still). \n\n[h2] Extras: [/h2]\nThis game has introduced me into the world of VR hardware, I ended up being really fascinated with how all the VR hardware works so i ended up making my own eye tracking and I'm trying to make my career around working on VR hardware.\n\n[h1] TLDR: [/h1] \nGood game if you are over 18 and are able to control how much time and money you spend on it, it lets you meet people and experience different cultures \n\nI know this is kinda thrown together but thank you for reading and have a good day :3",

The only thing that's good is the Invite to friends+ feature to avoid any drama\n\nBut imma lay down the bad side of this game and get straight to the point:\nIt is definitely filled with Schizophrenic freaks, dumbass whites retarded racist people always thinking they're better even though they're really not and have done worse shit and constantly saying the fucking N word like a bunch of idiots that deserve a shotgun blast to the head. Keyboard warrior fat-fucks that wanna start some stupid high school ass drama just because they dealt with trauma that no one asked or cares about, incel freaks that never went outside and do something worthwhile and are always chronically online like a fucking disease and weird, awkward idiots that tend to get drunk because they're worthless fucking pathetic pieces of shit that have literally no meaning or good purpose in life.\n\nOn top of that its also filled with retarded failed abortions of so-called kids being influence by adults\n(LIKE WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU THINKING DEVS??? CHANGE THE GODDAMN AGE RATING)\nE-girls constantly bitching and moaning for whatever fucking reason such as validation and being crying for help type of hoes on the fucking internet because they lonely sluts nowadays. (AKA Damsel in distress fucking wannabes)\nE-boys being delusional dick munching cunts that every time i look at their face, the structure look like logitech mouses, the buff avis are also screaming \"I'm a fucking loner with no actual experience with relationships or getting girls.\" On top of that with them constantly saying \"they're packing.\" But lets be honest their ego is bigger than their dicks anyways, they'd be microscopic that you need a magnifying glass to see it. Hell, Peter Griffin can't even see his because of the fucking pot belly he has and I bet y'all would have the same situation as him.\n\nin conclusion, Don't go to public worlds, everyone is a failed abortion and god's perfect mistake in VRChat.

As someone like me who is an introvert and perfer solo games, this has plenty of worlds to explore, avatars to be to amuse yourself, (Heads up some avatars do have an in game paywall to them, but there's enough avatar worlds you can get fully free to use) to basically do your own thing, With friends or not. So this is perfect for those that wanted to save money on traveling for cold weather or to escape to in their own paste and do things on their own solo adventures in this game.\n\nHUGE THING TO POINT OUT: Do not let your kids and teens below 18 get on this game alone. Nor with their friends online or offline. There's way too many grown adults on there that have the habit of doing some unsavory, sketchy things. To which no underage individuals should be exposed to at all. That includes teenagers as well. Please be safe and stick to your own morals, standards, and consent beyond all else. NEVER GO TO PUBLIC WORLDS AND DOUBLE CHECK ON GROUP PUBLIC INSTANCES. Be careful as well as there are 18+ avatars that are meant for adults that played this game, hence the WARNING.",

      "review": "[h1]A Reflective Take on VRChat: The Good, The Bad, and A Warning[/h1]\n\nVRChat has been a transformative tool in my life. It's not just a game; it's a social platform that provided me with a unique opportunity to connect with individuals from all walks of life, people I would never have had the chance to meet otherwise.\n\nEven more importantly, it offered a space for self-discovery. The nature of a virtual environment, where you can choose your avatar and interact free from many real-world physical judgements, allowed me to explore facets of my personality, interests, and even my identity that had previously remained hidden. It gave me a canvas to experiment with self-expression in a way that the physical world often restricts, which has been invaluable for my personal growth and has left me a much happier person.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nWith that said, it is important to be honest: [b]VRChat is not a utopia.[/b]\n\nIt has a significant and undeniable \"bad\" side. You will inevitably encounter toxicity, harassment, emotionally draining situations, and behaviors that can be deeply unsettling. It can be a chaotic and overwhelming environment. I know personally I've had to encounter a lot of people not respecting boundaries.\n\nHowever, when I weigh this reality against the positive impact it has had on my life, the conclusion is clear (to me at least). The genuine friendships I’ve forged, the relationships I've had, the support systems I've discovered, and the personal growth I’ve experienced are priceless. For me, the good that VRChat has brought into my life overwhelmingly surpasses the negative aspects I’ve had to navigate. I would rather have this complex experience, with all its flaws, than have never experienced it at all.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nThis positive outcome, however, is not guaranteed. It is not a passive experience.\n\nYou can experience incredible things in VRChat, but it demands active effort and a strong sense of self. You [b]must[/b] be mindful and constantly self-aware.\n\nThis means:\n* [b]Active Curation:[/b] You are the bouncer of your own experience. This means intentionally curating your friend list, being liberal with the 'block' and 'mute' buttons, and learning to identify and leave worlds or instances that are toxic.\n* [b]Setting Boundaries:[/b] You must establish firm personal boundaries and be willing to enforce them, even if it feels uncomfortable.\n* [b]Emotional Awareness:[/b] You have to be conscious of your own emotional state and know when to step away, take a break, or log off for the night.\n\nIt is not a platform that is easy to tackle alone, especially at the beginning. The learning curve for its social etiquette and dangers is steep. Finding a solid, supportive group of friends to explore with and talk to can make all the difference between a positive, enriching experience and a negative, harmful one.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h3]A Critical Warning[/h3]\n\nThis leads to my most important point: [b]I absolutely do not recommend VRChat for minors.[/b]\n\nThe environment is largely unmoderated and inherently adult-oriented. Minors are simply not equipped to navigate the complex social dynamics, the high potential for exposure to graphic or inappropriate content, or the very real dangers of interacting with anonymous adults. Groomers and pedophiles are common in public lobbies and it's really bad, lets be honest.\n\nThe level of emotional and psychological maturity required to safely manage the platform's intensity, filter its content, and protect oneself is something that most younger users do not possess. It is an environment built for adults, and it should be treated as such.\n\nDespite all of this, I still recommend VRChat. Just be careful when using it.",

Definitely cheaper and easier to hangout with friends in here than the real thing, like Putt-Putt, bike riding, Museums and exhibitions, driving through the city etc. Even the game worlds are great, like Hook Junkers, DOOM VR, Flight simulators and the Bomberman world, just to name a few.\r\n\r\nI'd recommend no-one below the age of 16 (or even 18) should be on this platform, there are a lot of creeps and inappropriate content from \"some worlds\" but \"lots more from people\". Avoid big public lobbies, remember that blocking and muting are options, this game CAN BE AMAZING but the people can certainly turn it into a nightmare.\r\n\r\nOverall it's a fun game, met my closest and dearest friends because of VRChat and would recommend anyone who loves thousands of well made FREE experiences and has a tolerance for bull-crap from other players will love it just as much as i have.",

I'm even going out of my way to write this review and scare children away.\n\n-PARENTS BE WARNED-\n\nVrchat is NOT a game for children under the age of 16/18 (depending on their country) It is a Lalaland without authority which is full of degenerate/mentally ill/lost to addiction adults who will not care for your childs well being. If anything a great amount will do them harm mentally or expose them to addiction and other 18+ content. A small group will even try to extort them or physically harm them. If you thought the stories coming from roblox are bad, its been like this on vrchat for quite some time now.\n \nI started playing this game years ago when I was in my early 20's, the majority of poeple did not own a vrheadset. Seeing anyone with one let a lone with full body tracking was rare and special. If anything they where consideret expensive. its wild to me that children get gifted a vrheadset with unsupervised acces to certain games. \n\nEitherway, in the beginning it was great when I did not own a vrheadset/full body tracking. I met a  decent amount of good poeple and had loads of fun with them exploring the world of vrchat. After a year or so I got my first vrheadset and shortly after full body tracking as well, by this time a decent amount of the good poeple had moved on with their life as they did not invest in a headset. After buying the vrheadset it all went down hill as I felt obligated and excited to play vrchat for as long as a I could even sleeping in it ocasionally. \nOwning a vrheadset and full body tracking opens acces to certain activities and poeple that otherwise would not interact with you if you didn't have tracking. It became a feeding source of various addictions and eventually leading to mental illnes. I would say the pandemic did a great number on that front as a lot of things you where not allowed to do in the real world anymore, you could still do on vrchat (for example partying/clubbing) Besides who you meet on vrchat will never only stay on vrchat, it will move on to discord, snapchat ect.\n\nVrchats community simply makes and breaks the game. Its a great thing that there is so much space for creative outlet, creating worlds and your own characters. But without authority and management it turns into a toxic lalaland where poeple can do as they please. \nThere are safety opptions the player can take themselfs but how realistic is it that easily influenced children will actually make use of that...\n\nAlthough vrchat implemented age verification it doesn't solve anything since its up to whoever creates the world instence to implement the age verification. That makes it so that adults who don't want to interact with minors create a safe space for themselfs away from minors. What ever is done by players in public lobbies or private lobbies is not moderated what so ever. They can regulate to some extent the content that gets released on the game but they can't regulate what poeple say/do in that virtual world.",

I've had several interactions where one of my friends and I have gotten audio crashed or worse (bad actors) and I can without a doubt, fully and confidently say that they need to get the youngsters (18-) either off the platform because their safety and security not only for the youngsters but everyone that plays the game is at risk, and its not just limited to audio crashers and bad actors, or, it would also be better if they just made a feature where you're forced to verify your identity and age, in some way completely separate the younger audience from the much older, manipulative and exposing older audience before you're allowed to play the game, The younger audience is exposed to many things I can confidently say they should NOT be seeing. I have blocked several bad actors, hid several crashers avatars yet still I find myself being crashed by the clients they're using. They need to fix these issues and made an improvement to their safety for their players.",

In its early days, I met some very cool people, but quickly it become overrun by very unhinged and, I hate to use this word, toxic people. These are not people you can have a conversation with. I try to speak to others the way I would speak if I were talking to someone at school or at work, and nobody can be polite in return. The only way politeness comes your way is if you're willing to engage in discussion about pornographic content or anything of sexual nature. You have absolutely cruel people with egos in the sky running around on this platform. There needs to be a real investigation into this. \n\nThis isn't a social game at all. I was kicked from an instance of a world simply for asking if the bizarre conversation between a furry and someone roleplaying as a WWII German soldier was a skit or not. I said \"Is this a skit?\" and before that question could be answered, I was kicked. \n\nYou try to talk to anyone anywhere and they either treat you like crap or they do nothing but speak of depravity and illegal activity. It is absolutely insane that this is the audience VRChat's developers have decided to cultivate. There was something good here once. The crazy thing too is I have spoken to people who consider themselves furries but don't use VRChat and even they say that it's a toxic hellhole of some of the most screwed up people you can find on the internet. \n\nThis program used to be something. If people openly discussing illegal digital materials are the kind of people allowed to roam freely on this program, one could surmise what this might indicate about the developers who allow this to happen for over half a decade. It had a fun first year, I met some really cool friends, but every time I return to this program, the active users are so horrible that I cannot stand to use it for very long. None of the original people i met from the first year I used VRChat even use it anymore.\n\nI cannot see this platform changing unless it's sold to another entity at this point.

Regardless, it exposed how insecure VRChat still is after all these years but that isn't a big secret either.\n\nUnless you’re playing in a private instance with people you trust, this game is a risk. I can’t recommend it in its current state. The platform’s open nature allows anyone to upload avatars or worlds that can cause severe crashes or, in my case, potentially damage hardware.\n\nI’ll only ever use private instances again—if at all.

I would imaging it started out way more innocent and civilized with the concept of having fun, making friends, or even finding love, but overtime a lot of that has changed not just because of the developers leaving the corruption in the game unchecked leading it to spread like a virus to where we are now with a lot of twisted people that would not fit into our normal society, But also because of the community of the online world in general praising bad choices over doing the right thing morally.\r\n\r\nVr Chats society has its own rules in general then that of our very own world. The laws that protect the innocent and prevent those who want to do wrong with consequences based on the severity of their actions are gone. Leading to a majority of humanity choosing to do what they want without thinking of the morality of it. And most of the society in VR Chat seems to praise people who do morally questionable actions that tend to fall into sick and wrong. While people who tend to do what is morally right get deemed boring and not worth being around or talking to.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have met a few nice people over the years yes,\r\n\r\nThe good things I have seen.\r\n\r\n#1. Generally nice people who enjoy talking with others about hobbies.\r\n\r\n#2. Friendships and communities built, and also happy romantic relationships.\r\n\r\n#3. Creative exploration with level design and character modeling creation.\r\n\r\n#4. People who offer advice to others that need help with something.\r\n\r\n#5. People talking to other people from different cultures learning about the world and societies of other countries.\r\n\r\n#6. People exchanging language learning between countries.\r\n\r\nBut sadly the bad outweighs the good.\r\n\r\n Bad things I have Seen.\r\n\r\n#1. Crazy people who just are chaotic and want to be the center of attention.\r\n\r\n#2. People who go around claiming to have a army of mental problems.\r\n\r\n#3. people behaving in morally questionable acts.\r\n\r\n#4. People targeting children with verbal actions or worse.\r\n\r\n#5. People who are mean just in general.\r\n\r\n#6. People who are mentally lost and do not know what to do in their life anymore so they spend all their time in a virtual world wanting to belong. Some can sometimes be seen sleeping inside of the world of VR Chat with their virtual reality helmet still on.\r\n\r\n#7. People who look at mirrors all day staring at their own characters wasting away.\r\n\r\n#8. Developers who do not deal with problems that truly needs to be dealt with but not really sure what they can do because the problem is not something that can just be fixed if it is based on the online community in general.\r\n\r\n#9. People being corrupted overtime due to how harmful people in the game is leading to corrupted people spreading overtime.\r\n\r\nRarest things I have seen in VR Chat.\r\n\r\n#1. Normal people.\r\n\r\nOverall I played the game for quite sometime and I got to say I seen a lot of bad stuff and yeah it has mentally changed me a little bit in general over it. Kind of like a sadness for humanity I would suppose. But also hope when I see those who have not been messed up yet or refuse to become messed up keep on going strong.\r\n\r\nI will admit being around people in this game has made me a bit corrupted even with my strong will and beliefs of doing what is morally right. And that does indeed bother me. I have seen what has happened to people with weaker wills then my own and it is not pretty. They end up being messed up people who do and say the most messed up stuff. ( I got the side effect of just saying messed up jokes.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe developers seem kind of questionable. I have heard a lot of bad things about them in general. And if those things are true then that explains why some of the problems are not looked into because it would be hitting to close to home for them.\r\n\r\nOverall I would say do not play VR Chat because it will eventually break you down more and more overtime because of how insane the community is in general with its lack of morals with right and wrong.\r\n\r\nWhat I would recommend is going outside, trying to find places or events that reflect on your hobbies, get to know people at those events and work on building friendships or relationships and stay healthy mentally and keep improving on your own life so you can help others rise up.",

Let the players do the playing why is it our job to be the game police?\n\nThe excessive level of reprobate behavior here leaves a very foul taste in ones mouth. Such as not limited to. \n\nCrashers, laggers, doxxers, griefers, trolls, pedophilia, N word spammers, Death Threats, Zoophilia, Necrophilia, Child Predators, Mic spamming, Mic screaming, Music blasters, Pet death threats, NSFW 18+ sexual content in public worlds, NSFW 18+ sexual avatars in public worlds, racism, sexism, baby murder promoting, Suicide promoting and child murder promoting.\n\nTo be honest i'm not sure how VR chat is dodging the legal system and avoiding lawsuits. This is not a good game to socialize in look else where there is VR chat alternatives out there look for one that has functioning moderation that ensure safety and prevents child predatory behavior.\n\nI never in my life see people act like pure reprobates in all my life as I have when browsing public worlds. Makes me loose whatever faith I got left in humanity. \n\nTill they clean up the reprobate and apostate garbage in this game i'm not coming back. Disgraceful and disgusting.",

A large portion of the player base behaves in ways that make the environment feel chaotic, unmoderated, and often uncomfortable. Many public worlds are filled with people acting in disruptive or attention-seeking ways, making it hard to have any normal conversations or enjoyable interactions.\n\nThere’s also a general lack of moderation in public spaces, which allows immature behavior, trolling, and loud or inappropriate interactions to take over. While everyone has the right to express themselves, the overall atmosphere often feels overwhelming and unwelcoming especially for anyone looking for a more relaxed or social experience.\n\nIf you’re expecting consistent, quality interactions or a friendly community vibe, VRChat can be very hit-or-miss.

And I think there was only one world with 9 people). I pretty much met two cool people right away ..aand somehow ended up in an almost empty gloryhole place.. Followed by a strip club.. :D (nothing sexual happened, btw. Thank god.)\n\nAfter that, I said goodbye to them and uninstalled the game, not because I was freaked out or anything, but simply because I expected rollercoasters, laser tag, adventures and road trips with a group of people you didn't even know just an hour ago. That's what I was after, but it seems like everything in this game is over-sexualized. One of them told me \"if you're not looking for a relationship, you're in the wrong game\". I'm not sure, but maybe I missed something. I didn't feel like exploring any further and seeking the stuff I expected, because I prefer german-speaking people around for social stuff and there barely seemed to be any language-specific worlds or anything.\n\nI'm sorry for the VRChat team. You've created a great game/platform and it looked really fun watching Gronkh's videos about it (he's german Let's Player who played it in ~2018), but somehow it just isn't what I thought it would be. Maybe try and bring some friends along for a better experience :) I went in by myself, cause nobody else I know has a VR headset. ..And yes, I know there's desktop support. But please, look at the game title.\n\n[i]PS: Oh, and in case any of you who think \"Yep, he's definitely an old fuck.\"; I'm 22 :)[/i]",

Firstly MORE MODERATION i dont care if that makes the game paid or anything just get more restrict 18+ things to people who have submitted an ID like avatars and make the emojis and stickers be off by defult and have more moderation\r\nik just saying get more modertation isnt easy but make them game paid increase the Price of VRC or give like an actual reason to use the shop\r\nsorry for the bad spelling and no grammer but i hope you atleast got the point",

IF YOU ARE A CHILD, DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT OR LEAVE ASAP / PRONTO.**\n\nAs of the last few years, the predator problem (We're talking actual freaks attracted to underaged individuals) has become an actual infestation. Every public lobby if full or etc, has at least one \"Diddy Jr\" or someone who knows and supports that shzt in it. They literally group up like little clubs to \"support one another\" and it's actually disgusting. \n\nThe FBI has stats showing that there are an estimate of 500,000 predators online 24/7, You take that and divide it by the population that is active on vrchat and that comes out to 32-38% of the platform being into children or being children that lie about their age because an adult told them to so that that adult could date the kid without looking like what they are, A predator. \n\nThe devs themself are distributors of ch*ld ab^se material and embezzled several MILLION DOLLARS on God knows what. The devs are into kids themselves, this is not a \"drill\" or a \"Hey, here's a rumor that should spread like fire.\" It's a \"You'd think 61,000 (at the time this was written) people writing bad reviews would get listened to.\" They aren't being heard. There is an actual problem, actual crimes, actual people, it went from being \"A game for socializing\" to a literal trafficking / grooming server that needs to be federally investigated and shut offline as soon as possible. This is the kinda platform that eventually is going to end up on a true crime show. How many cases are gonna pop up before you realize your kid didn't join a \"funny little uganda knuckles game.\" : How many actual police reports, How many actual NCMEC (The Child Exploitation Tipline) reports are going out about somebody on VRChat before somebody does something about this app. If anyone out there with some semblance of logic wants to keep their kid safe, do not let them near this game whatsoever. It's an automatic sentence.\n\nAgain. Do not let anyone under the age of 18 play this game. It doesn't matter if you are \"age verified\" or paid the \"10$ fee\" for every month, Hexed.cc and MANY OTHER GROUPS are getting paid 80$ and making bank to bypass age verification for your kid.
