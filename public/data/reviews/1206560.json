Even if you just want to plop a few creatures and civilisations down and watch how the world changes, it's enthralling. I tried putting monoliths everywhere to curse my wildlife with the fruit of knowledge.\n\nThe grasshoppers kept gaining sapience one by one and trying to create civilisation, but they were still grasshoppers with like a 24-hour lifespan, so a hundred kingdoms formed and got wiped out in like one year. Eventually they got enough momentum to start agriculture and windmills, despite not having hands. They lived peacefully for 200 years, before the raccoon bandits decided to blow them to smithereens.\n\nThe cats settled on a shoreline and immediately developed racism. Despite being a relatively small kingdom, somehow they became the cultural epicentre of the world. My rhinoceroses and buffalo were naming their children and cities \"Meeoow Meoww\" like some sort of trend.\n\nThe dogs subjugated the chickens, naming all the chicken villages some variation of \"Woof\" (I'm sure it's more nuanced in their tongue) and enforcing the Woof language. They were on a conquest and close to becoming essentially the Roman Empire—before the entire kingdom burned to the ground during the Age of Sun. The next dogs to gain enlightenment weren't nearly as ambitious, and they splintered off into too many factions to stand a chance.\n\nThe frogs, turtles, and bunnies came together to form \"The Titans of Darkness\" and wage war on the rest of the world. Unfortunately, the frogs were wiped out tragically by an invasion of evil pumpkins, and the turtles got annexed by the garlic men. The bunnies fled and made a new kingdom called... Meow.\n\nThe swamp rats bred a mutation that turns them into walking tentacles. The goats mutated into walking rocks.\n\nThe gingerbread men are pure evil, they feast on blood, and their language drives anyone who reads it to madness.\n\n\"Am I supposed to know what I'm doing now?\" - Garg the rhino, moments after gaining sapience\n\nNo, Garg, you're not. I don't either. Now fight my skeleton army. God loves you.",

It feels relaxing and chaotic at the same time—you can build peaceful kingdoms, watch tiny civilizations grow, or unleash absolute destruction just to see how the world reacts. The little details, the quirky behaviors of the creatures, and the freedom to shape the world however you want make every session feel fresh. It’s the kind of game you can play for minutes or sink hours into without even noticing, and it always leaves you wanting to try “one more experiment.”",

However in the last major update Mastef (the dev) has managed to change my opinion. Genetics are just abstracted enough to not be unreadable and lead to interesting mutations, as well as give almost any animal the ability to become sapient and join a village or kingdom, which also have been expanded upon with the addition of cultures and languages that effect it as a whole. The average ai of each creature is still kind of garbage, and I hope he improves on it in the future (they still blindly stand in arrow fire, and artillery, etc.) but he has laid the groundwork for a really fun sandbox to watch nations grow and fall. If you're familiar with Dwarf Fortress legends mode, this offers a more interactive version of that, and I hope that Mastef continues to make grow this game out into something amazing.",

This game is simplistic but mechanically in-depth through the gene and traits editor, and it's very fun just to watch silly little goobers do silly little goober things! although I already have found a bug, via the achievements where I have the achievement for 40 traits found, but not 20? (I presume this might've been broken after an update or something, or the 20 traits ach only counts trait traits, not all traits). either way, love the game, it's great fun for some unwinding.",
