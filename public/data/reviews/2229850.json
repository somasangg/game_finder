Like wow, y'all think the control scheme here are good? I mean, okay... I STRONGLY disagree, but ya know I didn't grow up with it. \n\nIf anyone has any good UI mods to make this playable, lmk\n\nAgain, pretty cool game though. I inquired as to why this one is the most popular, and unit balance seems to be a big part of it, and, yeah that seems to ring true. I played through the GDI campaign of C&C 3 and yeah, that game was way less balanced. So if you aren't bothered by it having wildly different controls to the vast majority of RTS games, deeeefinitely check it out. It's one of the good ones.",

I played it briefly to test and it ran smoothly and all I had to do was get CNC draw\nPros: Without a doubt the best of the franchise up to the point that it was released from the perspective of the best tactical opportunities. If you can arrange multiplayer then it's Thrilling. Basically every single ability or attack has a counter regardless of who you're playing as or against, a first for command and conquer. Udo Kier Is incredibly charismatic here. In some ways feels like the first red alert on steroids which is mostly a good thing. They finally give useful super weapons to the allied forces. Some of the best cutscenes up to this point especially intro wise. Playing as or against Yuri himself can get trippy. Yuri's revenge has some creative and fun levels including one where you go through Hollywood and can recruit Schwarzenegger Clint Eastwood and others. The Spy is unbelievably useful.\nCons: Getting past the cheesy tone is necessary if you want to play the campaign modes but it takes more than a little getting used to that they're now purposefully going there instead of accidentally ending up there. While thankfully it is remedied in generals which was the very next one of these It is pretty ridiculous to release and RTS in 2001 that still does not for example let you do attack move when that has been in Starcraft One since 1998.\nstrongly recommended for long time fans Or people already used to what real time strategy looked like back when these came out, mildly recommended for people who love RTS",

All other aspects seem per the original game. \nCnCNet can make the games work at the correct speed - why not the Steam platform.\nI bought the games originally on Disc, then from Origin/EA and then finally from Steam. Unfortunately CnCNet cannot detect the files on my system that prove I bought the games previously so will not install on my PC.",

I swear I heard the eeee-errr-khhhhh sound in my head.\n\nVerdict:\nGreat trip down memory lane, but I didn’t sign up for 2001 lag speeds. Someone please patch me back into broadband. Thank you.",
