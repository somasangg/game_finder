      "review": "Darktide is basically what happens when someone asks, “What if Left 4 Dead, but everyone is constantly yelling about the Emperor and hygiene has clearly never been invented?” And honestly? It kind of works. Let me start with saying this; I have NO EXPERIENCE WITH THE WARHAMMER 40k FRANCHISE... But it doesn't mean you can't enjoy the game. Right when i dropped into the game, i noticed 1 simple thing... You are very... VERY... squishy, and if you are not with your team mate, you will fall.. FAST. \n\nThe combat is simple, but very fun. Smacking hordes with a thunder hammer or turning a corner and mag-dumping into a group of cultists just hits a special part of my tisim. The sound design alone deserves from the bop that is the music, to the sounds the specials and elites make to know they are around you and your teammates ready to dodge its attack... But its not all good when it comes to the game, it also has its issues\n\nThe game is full of weird bugs and crashes. Visual bugs where enemies that i am fighting suddenly disappearing as if i just took my dose of my schizophrenia pills, and crashes where the game had to make me verify the integrity files multiple times just to get the game to work. I'm lucky enough to have a Nvidia GPU cause it seems a lot of the issues are AMD related, and performance wise? it could use some tuning up as well.\n\nDarktide is one of those games where, when everything clicks, it feels incredible. When it doesn’t, you wonder if the Emperor truly protects or if He’s just watching you suffer for entertainment. Still, if you like melee-heavy chaos, grimdark humor, and the satisfaction of carrying your team because someone wandered off to poke a daemonhost “just to see what happens,” it’s absolutely worth jumping in.",

You COULD just skip that entirely and give us 1 less long ass loading screen)\n- Havoc's party system requires you to build a party, encouraging elitism and vastly slowing down queue speed. I don't mind playing with bad players and losing, I'd prefer to have fast queue times and not have the highest havoc difficulties get gatekept.\n- The progression doesn't differentiate player skill at all. This means skilled players or even veterans who want to try a different class are forced to play the brain-dead level difficulties again for hours to unlock the harder ones.\n\nSo yeah, I'd describe DT as a 'Flawed Masterpiece'",

Peak concept wrapped in a stutterfest and major fps drops, inconsistent performance on a capable hardware [ above the recommended specs ]. performance fix would make this piece a masterpiece.\n\nIssues with this title : \n- Ray tracing is on no matter if you turn it off, have RTX card or not. The process is running in background, hogs 40% of your CPU and will 100% tank your 1500$ gpu to the max on medium settings. You will need to enter the .ini file and turn it off manually. Offers near 0 visual degradation\n\n- 80% of cosmetics and content is locked behind a hard paywall. What you can unlock in game, will make you look like a default NPC for the most part. The good, warhammer content is locked behind 10 eur a piece at least\n\n- Performance is something i cant be produd of in this title. Without heavy tweaks and digging in files for hours, FPS will drop on a higher end system to all the way down 15 fps. Stuttering is the major concern [ running a m.2 ssd and over sufficient hardware ]. When horde comes , it doesnt seem like the engine can handle all that processing and chokes. Higher difficulties are realistically unplayable. Performance issues are not marginal\n\n- Lack of content. There is about 15 missions i think plus some side missions. I've all done them in 3 hours. Then, you rinse and repeat over and over on higher difficulty. It can be fun if you like to move in that enviroment, but it can become quickly repetetive.\n\nOverall though, its an enjoyable title.

You can dump 80 hours into getting your character max level, then spend another 20 hours just balancing and respecing his abilities. There are 5 classes, but depending on how you do your skill tree, your character can be completely different than someone else of the same class. The combat is straight up addicting, this has the smoothest melee combat I can think of for this style of FPS Horde shooting, the dance of mastering the shove with slashes in between dashing around groups is CINEMA. Updates can sometimes be slow, but at the current state of the game I think there is solid amount of content. One of the biggest complaints you will hear is from day one players who are tired of waiting for content every 6 to 9 months. I wish it had solo offline play, but it doesn't-probably the biggest complaint I have. Highly recommend, 40 bucks aint bad, onsale buy it for a friend too haha!",

It's still a good game, and I would recommend it to friends, the actual gameplay is still satisfying, lucid, and most importantly it's still fun to kill evil creatures. However, seeing as the previous game they released was just a better version of this one, with more maps (and so much more variety in setting/enemies between the maps), more characters, better loot chase, higher skill ceiling, better dialogue between characters (this is coming from someone who likes the 40k setting more than fantasy), grimoires and pick ups in game are actually important and not just an annoying burden you sometimes have to engage with... \n\nWhy they decided to go with a depressing skill tree for each character instead of the 4 different classes for each one in Vermintide? I do not know... it completely flattens the characters identities compared the sharply distinct power fantasies in the previous system. It's also odd how Darktide has significantly lowered the difficulty and skill ceiling overall, while simultaneously removing the post game scoreboard, which means you now need to install a mod in order to see how many kills you got. Once you do install the scoreboard, their choice in doing this is extremely clear- play a few damnation or auric missions and notice how often a couple people are doing pretty much nothing the entire game, completing the mission with less than 1k kills, going down 5+ times, not doing any boss damage, killing 1 special the entire run, etc. This is perhaps weedheads smoking ganja and getting lost/confused/scared, most likely all three, which just makes each game take waay too long and prevents me from wanting to play the highest difficulties without my friend group.\n\nOverall still a fun game, especially if you have friends to play with.",

XD\n\nAt time of writing, some crybabies are mad because the new class DLC, Hive Scum, is not what they wanted or too lame for their tastes. not my cup of tea either, but hey, if you don't like, don't buy.\n\nSo, time for me to give an honest advice on the game, not the DLC.\nYou play as an expandable nobody sent on near-suicidal missions with 3 other rejects like you, against waves of various ennemies, shooting and slashing through hordes of mutants and heretics in confined environnements of a Hive.\n\n- Great graphics, very good rendering of the 40k universe, ambiance is here\n- character creation with different voices (characters conversations in missions are sometimes gold)\n- 4 customizable classes (without DLC), with different perk trees and skills to suit your play style\n- lots of customizable weapons\n- Some 20 missions in 7 different \"biomes\" (at first i thought it would be too few, but I'm still here at 350h of play time so...) ; encounters are randomized, giving more variety to missions\n- Various enemies with specializations (berserkers, trappers with nets, suicide bombs, fun, fun, FUN)\n- a Horde mode with 3 maps\n- communication in-game works great even without mic (pings, voiced infos on ammo, pickups, enemies)\n\nVery satisfied with this game, my only gripes are :\n- bots are limited, better to play with others (even randoms) at higher difficulty.\n- would like more missions added to the game\n- DLC classes too expensive for my taste (but that's not mandatory, so...)\n- too greedy premium Cosmetic store (again, not mandatory, there are other free cosmetics in game)\n\nGreat immersive game, even you're new to the WH40K setting.\nI love the tension during the missions, when you hear the tick-tack of a suicide bomber coming, but from where? The visceral combats, sometimes you feel overwhelmed by enemies, your teammates are all down, a sniper is waiting ready to shoot you while a hulking armored giant is coming at you, you must think fast, but against all odds you survive, put everyone to their feet again, and return to the fight.\nThe team accomplishes its objectives, then rushes to the extraction point while fighting waves of plague zombies rushing at you. You run, then take a look back and cover your teammates with your lasgun until everyone is safe.\nAnd sometimes you just get yeeted in the void by a plague Ogryn while everyone is captured. Nice.\n\nFOR THE EMPEROR!!!",

      "review": "This is my most played and my favourite game. I've played since the beta and realized I haven't done a review yet so here it finally is. \n\nThis game is a FPS PVE hoard shooter/hack and slash game. The game doesn't get really good until you've maxed out your character and started running the harder missions which is a pretty big time investment. What makes this game fun to me is the fast paced aggressive team based gameplay that has a very high skill cap. To be clear, this is not a shooting game, your \"primary weapon\" is your meelee weapon. That being said, you can create a build to be a shooter primarily but if you are not skilled at meelee combat you'll weigh your team down. \n\nSome of the best things about this game are the sound design, atmosphere, and build crafting. The music is phenomenal with a techno synth organ music that is layered with opera singing and punchy baselines that pairs really well with some great voiceacting, sound fx, and sounds cues. The sound plays a huge part in the gameplay as you can hear the sounds very clearly of your enemies and being able to do a 180 and punch an enemy in the mouth before they can finish an attack because you hear the attack sound cue is incredibly satisfying. The maps and atmosphere capture the parts of warhammer 40k that make it so interesting. Looking over the side of the map to see the \"skybox\"/background textures can be very captivating. The class builds you can make keep the game feeling interesting to me as you come to learn what nodes are worth taking and which nodes work better depending on what you're going for with your class. Each class feels unique but similar in many ways and each class can be a lot of fun to play. Getting a well rounded team in an auric lobby and crushing the mission is a feeling that I have never gotten from any other game I've played.\n\nSome of the biggest issues with this game is unfortunately tied to some of the best parts about this game. The most fun content is the harder content and the skill required to play at that level is not always there with people. The reason I find the harder missions more fun is because they up the spawns of all the enemies so there will be times in the mission where you are literally tearing through the hoards of enemies but if you have a teammate who is bad and falls behind, you are not going to have as good of a time. Bad players is not one of the issues I have with this game but rather the community that has arisen around the fact that there is so much varying degrees of skill in this game. Let's face it, we all know warhammer 40k fans can \"just be like that\" . in addition to the fun content being with the harder missions, it takes a significant time commitment to get to that level and often times, the community may not be as welcoming or helpful as it should be which may deter players from getting the same enjoyment from this game as I do. \n\nAll that being said, seeing a massive hoard of enemies and being able to charge into them confidently head first and pushing the hoard back because you have a competent team that is right beside you and ready to back you up is so satisfying. Similarily, seeing your teammate being pushed back by a hoard and popping your ability and feeling the momentum shift from being pushed back by the hoard to pushing the hoard back and creating the space for your team to proceed is the best part of this game. Hitting a charge ability to back up a teammate, popping a damage ult and melting a boss for your team, getting overwhelmed and hitting your support ultimate or dropping a stun ability at just the right time, switching to your range weapon and taking the head off a pox houd that just jumped your teammate. \n\nThis game is a no brainer for me to recommend on sale but if you're on the fence about this at regular price I would recommend at least pushing to level 30 on a couple of classes and playing at least a heresy maelstrom match or three before you decide if you really like the game or not. If you don't have the time to committ to that and don't love PVE hoard shooters than I would not recommend this to you at regular price. I've put in 586 hrs in this game at the time of this review and I'm still getting better at it the more I play and I haven't even tried the true end game yet. You'll probably be able to get at least 10-20 hours out of this game if you're on the fence about it and are ok with failing a bit as you learn it",

      "review": "So far, Darktide is one of the best Warhammer 40k games and one of the best horde shooters on the market. The game has come a long way since its release. Many new missions have been added, character progression trees have been expanded, and weapon progression has been improved. In my opinion, optimization has also improved. New updates are released regularly, so the game is constantly being developed.\n\n   The game offers four very different character classes and one paid class (a second paid class, Hive Scum, will be added on December 2). Character progression is well balanced, with the player receiving one point for the development tree with each level up. This means that the player does not have to grind empty levels to max out a given character. In addition, each class has extensive development trees containing 3 archetypes of a given class that can be freely mixed and matched. The arsenal has also been greatly expanded since the release, and its progression has been improved, with crafting being changed to be fully deterministic instead of random, resulting in easier build creation.\n\n   As for the combat system, it is a slightly modified version of the one from Vermintide 2. The combat system is well suited for fighting numerous enemies thanks to the clave mechanic.  However, this system has a drawback because the only things that limit attacks are attack speed and animation length, so combat can feel like a clicker (though it should be noted that spamming light attacks is rarely profitable/optimal). Each weapon has a different moveset, which means that some weapons are better suited for clearing large waves of smaller enemies, while others are better at dealing with heavy opponents. When it comes to ranged combat, the gunplay is also well done, with ranged weapons having appropriately made animations and good sound effects.  Enemies fighting from a distance can hide behind cover when shot at and can also provide covering fire. In addition, the game is diverse in terms of enemy types. There are 27 different types of enemies in the game (my method of counting enemy types takes into account the type of combat and the type of armor).\n\n   In terms of content, Darktide currently offers 22 missions, a more difficult Havoc game mode, and a similar roguelike mode called Mortis Trials, but to be honest, this particular mode is not very extensive.\n\n   Of course, it's not a flawless game. The game is not without bugs (although I must admit that I encounter bugs less often than not). The game likes to crash, usually during updates or after installing mods. My theory is that the culprit may be the Autodesk Stingray game engine. The same crash problem occurs in both Fatshark and Helldivers 2 games, and the engine itself is no longer being developed. The game itself is also being developed rather slowly, sometimes you really have to wait a long time for new content. Despite being “buy to play,” the game does feature cosmetic microtransactions. The price and content of the paid classes may also be debatable; I think $12 for the basic DLC version is too high (although I can say that the Adeptus Arbites DLC provided me with content for less than 100 hours to completely level up that DLC). \n\n   Darktide has its problems, but today it is one of the best horde shooters and one of the most interesting titles in the Warhammer 40k universe. Fatshark has clearly refined the game after its poor launch, and I can honestly recommend it in its current state. If I had to rate this game on a scale of 1-10, I think 8/10 would be fair, although I would even be inclined to give it 8.5/10. A rating of 9/10 would definitely be too stretched.",

The quality of the acting combined with cleverly written lines that are so refreshing for a game like this.\n\nHats off to the devs for making sure there were a lot of lines for each character. It keeps it from getting stale after hundreds of hours. Very good stuff.\n\nI can't wait to see what fatshark does with the series.

      "review": "Pretty good horde shooter/fighting game. Small variety of classes with highly customisable skill trees make the game less stale than just playing L4D2 (not saying it's bad, just the classes improve that formula). Good variety of enemies, as well as melee combos that tie the satisfaction of combat well. Weapons have a satisfying punch whenever dealing with enemies, no matter what difficulty. Armour on enemies entice players to think about piercing damage as well rather than just cleaving for crowd control.\n\nOnly warnings I will give is the optimisation could have been way better, as well as no offline mode. I am forced to use FSR 3.1 on my mid-range PC just to get a decent framerate (100fps), as well as upscaling from 1080p to 1440p. The game looks amazing after upscaling, and it's actually implemented surprisingly well. Not the worst complaint since the upscaling optimisation was actually done well (unlike Space Marine 2, where I need to render the game native to get decent graphics).\nNo offline mode (so far, apparently they're working on a solo mode?) even though you can play solo with bots if nobody matchmakes with you is kind of ridiculous, like blocking progression behind online servers is reasonable.\n\n^Just take note before buying yeah, it's a fun game either way.

It has flaws but it doesn't matter when heretics die for the glory of the Emperor.\n\nIs this game worth it if you like horde shooters/40k? : Absolutely.\nIs the DLC worth it?: Yes, but try the base game first unless you know why you're getting it.\n\nThis game is amazing but has some noticable flaws.\n\nPros:\n-Great graphics, maps are beautiful and battle effects are immersive.\n-Combat is easy to understand, but extremely satisfying to master. There's a lot technique to be learned with melee weapons.\n-Good variety of maps and objectives. could be expanded more tho.\n-For the 40k nerds, this game scratches the itch for guardsmen lvl battles with added plot armor main character feel.\n-Music is weirdly good\n-In game dialogues between characters are very good. Lots of different voicelines.\n-Good for any skill level. Lowest difficulty for horde shooter newby, Havoc for the 3K hours tryhards.\n-Character variety and build customisation\n-Somewhat regular in game events. Some are cool like increasing flamer spawns and putting the maps on fire, some are just \"pick up stuff while you run around\" levels of boring. New enemies are often tested in those.\n-When you get good enough to solo bosses, you feel like the Doomslayer. FOR THE EMPEROR!\n-Community is friendly in game. Reddit and Youtube people complain a lot tho.\n-You don't need to understand Warhammer40k. Just enjoy the carnage. If you understand 40k, it's even better.\n\nCons:\n-Server stability is sometimes an issue, but I haven't had much issue at all so just be aware it can happen\n-Free (earnable currency) cosmetics are very bland, mostly recolors/slight changes. Paid skins are expensive but that's where you get the cool stuff\n-Class balances can be all over the place between updates. Been better lately, and is not noticable until you start playing auric difficulty (highest difficulty for non-tryhards). \n-Limited range of content able to be added. Thx GW for being so controling over your IP. I guess it makes the game more lore friendly tho.\n-Lore exists i guess... please dont buy this game expecting a story driven game.

Together with some other minor issues, this made me wonder how such things even happen during development — it's a very strange issue for a game to have. However that is very minor. My issues with this game lie elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe character creator is good, but ultimately it doesn't add much to the experience since there aren't many options and some are tied to your character's backstory. For example, if you don't select Cadian as your home planet, two eye colour options will be unavailable. \r\n\r\nI preferred it in Vermintide, where all the playable characters had their own stories and skill sets. Here, your character's dialogue changes slightly depending on the backstory combination you pick, but they still need to fit in with the story that is set in stone, so it's fairly generic stuff by 40k standards. You're not a particularly interesting character; you're Ass Annihilator McGee with a chainsword. I get it's a hack-and-slash game, and that's fine, but I just don't enjoy it as much as games with well-fleshed-out characters that kind of grow on you as you play.\r\n\r\nVermintide had a Fellowship of the Ring-type feel, along with Warhammer brutality and over-the-topness. Darktide, on the other hand, feels like a random mishmash of D&D characters that someone has rolled up with no real focus. However, the gameplay itself is solid.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the game doesn't deserve a bad rating. However, it certainly isn't better than what's already available for far less money.",

A fomo-based rotating shop of cosmetics sours the experience somewhat, as well as some frustrating bugs that show up more in the higher difficulties.

Even at the higher most difficulties where things can get a little over-tuned (I'm looking at you Havocs), you're still more than capable of fending off enemies. Moreover, it forces you to work as a team instead of individuals.\n\nWhile I do have some problems with this game, such as the not-so thought out weapon upgrade mechanics, you can FEEL the passion the developers have for this game. I have been fortunate enough to be around Darktide since its release, and I can say it is in THE BEST state it's ever been. If you're thinking about picking this up but are hesitant due to the \"mixed\" reviews (at the time of me writing this), don't hesitate! Buy it and play it. People are review bombing the game because the newly revealed class IS NOT what they wanted (it's a Hive Scum/Ganger instead of a Mechanicus-based class).\n\nOverall, it's a solid game with addicting gameplay. Nothing short of DOOM: Eternal will have you wading through the gore of your enemies as much as this game will.",

Barely variety for missions comparatively, an achingly slow release for new, available to all, interesting content. Vermintide 2 has been pumping out more free stuff for its players in the last months than this Cashgrab. I could go into more detail and I might later, but this is a quick and dirty review.\n\nNow for the big reason I'm even writing this despite not having played for some time: Their broken and spat on promise on classes. When people were rightfully outraged that they would only get a meager 4 classes Fatshark promised to release new classes \"roughly every quarter\" and they \"haven't fully decided if we will charge for new classes\". \nNow 3 years after launch and the bare minimum of content we are finally getting the 2nd Class (we should be at 12 now) aaaaaaaaand it costs 12€ or about 3,5 times as much as any of the 5 Vermintide Classes.

There are classes, customization, skill trees, and more.\n\nJust dont expect devs that stick to their promises, or listen to the community even a little bit. \n\nIt took years to rework the skill trees into being what they promised. \n\nThe character customization is atrocious. You get 20 horrific pre-made faces, and and the choice between two body-types with not other fine-tuning. You can try to use the hair and tattoos to make your character look better, but good luck. Since Beta the customization has been complained about, and we've had nothing but radio silence for years.\n\nYou can purchase cosmetics, but just know that its based on a FOMO calendar, and you cant earn the credits in any way other than by shelling out real world money. If they add a new class, it will be several months before you get any new cosmetics. (arbites was added June 23rd, as of November 11th (five months later) there are still not new cosmetics for ONLY this class).\n\nThey promised to add a new class every quarter. Several years in, they finally add one. Things seem good. Another was slated to be announced today, the 11th! They decided to postpone the release of the class, despite a countdown being available on the launcher. Apparently they didnt realize they werent ready until the last few hours.\n\nThere is a popular mod that allows for customizing your weapons, something people have asked for for years. The two biggest dev responses bring lots of clarity to this issue however. Their first point, \"This isnt Call of Duty\" makes a lot of sense. After all, Call of Duty is the only game that has ever had weapon customization. If they added this, what would separate these two games? Nothing of course. They'd be the exact same game, completely indistinguishable from each other. Could you imagine the mayhem?\n\nTheir second point is that it doesnt fit the setting, which also makes sense. You never hear about different kinds of weapons with different pros and cons to each one. Could you even imagine a 40k game that allows for a Space Marine to approach the on-ship Mechanicus technoarchaeologist to improve their weapons? It would be ridiculous. Thats why ours can upgrade ours, but not in any way thats visible. \n\nSo again, its a great game, but know that for over a decade these developers have had a terrible track record of ignoring their fan base, lying to them, over-promising, and under-delivering",

There are 3, this one i made up, but you had no fucking clue did you?)\n\nAnd in typical Fatshark fashion the answer was silence and/or lies.\n\nFrom launch you can NOT play solo with bots (something you could do in previous titles), they promised \nsolo mode, 3 years later, still no solo mode...\n\nThey recently introduced \"HAVOC game mode\" good concept, is basically an endgame mode that exponentially ramp up the difficulty by throwing more and tougher shit at you all the time.\n\nSadly it has THE WORST match making system in THE HISTORY of gaming.\n\nNot joking, not exaggerating, i had better communication options when i was setting up lan-party for 12 ppl with my neighbor via a phone cable going out his window and into mine 2 floors below, 25+ years ago...\n\nFirst of all, THERE IS NO WAY TO DIRECTLY TALK TO OTHER PLAYERS UNLESS THEY ARE IN YOUR PARTY.\n\nSo how it works?\nWell you can either host a mission or join someone else mission.\n\nIf you hosting you see join requests from players that you can accept or decline, but the problem is that the ONLY information you have are the player class and highest difficult mission he played.\nYou can not talk to each other, can not inspect them either to see what kind of build they running.\nYou have to invite them first, talk to them using party chat, and if you dont like them, you have to hope they willingly leave the party (yeah as party leader you can not remove players) or you have to leave and restart the process.\n\nIf you are trying to join is even worst!\nLet's say you playing with a Veteran and you see a party without an Ogrin, but you are flexible, you can switch to Ogrin no problem, but they have no way to know that, you can not talk to each other; \nif you apply right away they might reject you cause they want an Ogrin, so your ONLY option is to go back to the character selection screen, pick Ogrin, wait 10-20 second for the character to load, open the looking for team window, search for the team again and WOOOPS they gone now, they invited someone else.\nNow you see a team that lack a Psyker but they already have an Ogrin...\n\nAnd unless you are in the 0.1% of the players that can solo a Havoc 40 mission (the hardest), having a Zealot with Chorus or a Veteran with Shout vs NOT having any of that shit, makes a HUGE difference.\n\nNow, 3 years after \"release\" the devs:\n-added a 5th playable class (Arbites) to get on par with previous titles (ofc is behind pay wall).\nNo complaints about that, great class concept, really well made trailer, and they introduced a pet mechanic to a roster that was lacking in it, 8/10.\n-fixed many bugs, the game is now playable, but still crashes/disconnects you from time to time.\n-improved the crafting system from AWEFUL to \"I dont hate it\".\n-added many more ridiculously priced skins to the shop.\n-\"improved\" the non existing campaign/story adding a few voice lines...\n-added few maps but the map variety/naming is still shit.\n-still NO single player mode.\n\nAnd instead of fixing the SHITSHOW that is this game they decided to add another pay-walled class that NOBODY asked for...\n\nThe generic \"Mad Max\"/\"Hokuto no Ken\" villain, you know, the guy that licks his knife menacingly before getting deleted 5 sec later by a named character...",

You, dear read don't have to convern yourself with horrible optimization on launch or for the following 1.5+ years while the first update prioritized adding a real money shop. That alone should give you a fair warning even today. But my problem is with the actual game.\n\nThere is no story to speak of. You do a fairly well done intro section that hints at the existence of a story, then, unlike Vermintide 2 you have a network of random missions instead of a linear mission structure which you can LATER replay in any order. This left me lost and overwhelmed a bit at first, and then later it gave me a \"well, none of this really matters\" feeling. Then I slowly started to discover the intricate web of progression with a half dozen different currencies and resources and skill trees and masteries and weapon modifications and everything giving +0.3% boost to some stat and it gave me this Diablo PTSD of wasted years on grinding worthless items and endless level ups for a marginally higher damage number just to increase the difficulty and start over in an endless loop then complain there is no endgame.\n\nIf you are looking for this, this is propably a great game for you. I consider myself too old and my time too valuable to ever get into that hamster wheel again. Which is why I do not recommend the game for anyone, not specificly because of this game, but because of the \"chain the user to the game with a service\" philosophy behind it, I cannot look in the mirror and honestly say I recommend you any game like that. \n\nThe core game at this point is great: authentic level design, great audio, standard L4D / Vermintide control feels, the game is generally in a good state regarding all of that. And I must highlight the powerful music of Jasper Kyd who is the Hans Zimmer of the gaming industry, and deserves every bit of respect that is tied to his name for decades now - he had it even before Assassin's Creed 2, and what an instant classic that was.\n\nI'll gladly recommend you Space Marine 2 as an alternative, which has identical or better overall quality in every core aspect (art, optimization, fluid gameplay) but it also offers a coherent story in form of a proper singleplayer campaign, and the cooperative repeatable mission grind ties into the singleplayer campaign (such as Titus commands another squad on radio in SP, but you play as that squad in repeatable coop missions) and the unlockables are fixed premade straight up upgrades to weapons, without overcomplicated \"+0.3% damage if the sun is at it's apex while the Emperor is doing a rap battle in the Immaterium and you spin 360 degrees before you click shoot\" skill trees. There is a skill tree even there but it's like, pick 3 out of 9 traits and that's it, no loot, no RNG, and you can easily max out every class in a 100 hours (not each, combined) while Darktide will give you breadcrumbs to make you come back for years and make you addicted to a progression system designed for addiction, serving itself instead of the player.",

It's always been buggy since release (has gotten a little better since, but that took way to long to fix) where even people with decent computers just don't have models loading, any amount of content added feels lackluster or skimped, paid content is ridiculous (12 dollars for a class when Vermintide 2 sells comparatively better DLC content for like 4 dollars), and that's excluding the optional 8 dollar cosmetic pack to go with it. The power fantasy and narrative fantasy just never line up, which kills the vibes of a setting like 40k, and its somehow more aggressive in how money-hungry it is and worse at communication than even GW themselves. It's like they mined diamonds, reconstituted it into coal, then still tried to sell it as diamonds, because it's \"From the people who found diamonds one time!\"\n\nThe gameplay is fun for a bit, it's like Binding of Isaac where after 200-300 hours you start making fun things to do for yourself, but unlike Isaac it gets so stale so quick I can't fathom how people make it that far to begin with - the only thing that could really save it is if they completely restarted the plot of the game and gave more tangible narrative progression and the character options more personality and individuality. A squad based game full of silent-protagonists regarding the actual plot makes you feel so disconnected from what's supposed to be happening.

Why not just get AI to play my whole character too? \n\nThe whole point of this game is 4 player coop but then you go and give a class an AI pet that saves them if they go off solo and kills elites literally without them doing a single thing.

I don't only not want to buy this class; I just don't want to play the game at all now because it ruins every lobby. \n\nWhat is worst of all is the Arbites class literally caters most to the toxic players who always want to run ahead and never pay attention to their team because it REWARDS that play and it always will as long as the dog exists tbh.

Really fucking sad tbh.\n\nI wish I could at least ban the Arbites class from all of my games to salvage it; I'm sick of the dog and how OP they are overall. Instead they make up like half of every group. I've had multiple groups where it is me and 3 Arbites. \n\nI'll be protest NOT buying the Hive Scum too because this just sucks that much to play now. On the bright side, the Hive Scum can never be more stupid than the Arbites because if it doesn't have the dog it will always be punished more for going off solo, not inherently idiot proof, and not totally against the basic game design.",

More dogs, more trappers, more possessed ogryns\n\n- No updates of value. The DLCs come with the class.. and that's it. Nothing more and nothing on the free side like, new maps, modes, bosses.\nThere are thousand of possible enemies in Warhammer 40k, and instead, 3 years of fighting Nurgle spawns\n\nA be aware, when you see something that looks new, it's not. It's recycled.\nMost of the \"different\" missions are in fact, on the same map you have already played, but with a different entrance",

Why do you not care about your playerbase?\n\nWe are still playing the same maps for almost 3 years.\nYou are creating ,,SPECIAL EVENTS,, that add nothing new to the game. An in-game event where you can get a character frame is not a content.\n\nYou've created a lot of these events, so why not just loop them instead of creating new ones? In the meantime create actual new content such as maps for the game or weapons for a selected class or all classes?\n\nMaps from the Operations and Sector Inter-Zone Void Sector Omega-12 categories are a joke because there is only one map in each category.\n\nWhat's the problem with listening to players who want a specific class added—MECHANICUS—which would unlock new mechanics in the game?\n\nAs someone posted on your forum, you created \"Reject Premium.”",

      "review": "I understand the concept that games shouldn't be balanced around the hardest difficulty. In this case havoc. However, I feel that too little thought is currently given to havoc. Possibly even auric. Contaminated Stims is clearly a modifier that was put in without enough testing or thought. 80%  Damage Reduction is completely ass. Yellow that turns a regular stalker into pretty much a gunner or makes crushers over head you 1000 times a minute is completely not fun either. \r\nBut the biggest is blue. Because it can stack with tox gas to much enemies with more than 100%  damage reduction. \r\nCrusher hp was buffed with the promise of less of them. Such a thing hasn't materialized really in practice. Especially not with rotten armor being a modifier. Rotten armor was fine as an event because at the time crushers didn't have as much health.  \r\n\r\nThe number of  mobs was also increased. Except the problem is  inferno staff or flamer helps  keep that  in check. But mainly inferno staff due to the sheer power of psykers. But it would be game breaking if inferno staff or psyker are nerfed now because they're the only one keeping the number of mobs in check. \r\n\r\nHeinous rituals is back. In theory it's an okay modifier except the devs are apparently really bad at coding so there are a bunch of glitched rituals where you're virtually guaranteed to have to fight a demonhost. Which is not fun in the slightest. Comsplex has a ritual with an aggro radius that is far too large. Near the 4th medicaie. Cooling Matrix 17-36 has a glitched spawn with a too large radius also that is again virtually impossible to reach. Especially because there are so many enemies you have to fight your way through to reach the far far end of a room. And if there's two rituals in that room, you have to destroy the closer one or you will fight two demonhosts. Oh, and there's boss spawns there and such. The ritual in refinery delta is still glitched where one cultist spawns above a room and the rest spawn below. These were all glitches that were around before Heinous Rituals rotated out of havoc the first time. But the devs haven't fixed it cuz apparently fixing bugs doesn't make money. \r\n \r\nAs always gun viability and weapon viability in general is still a problem because earlier weapons haven't been buffed enough to keep up with all the hp buffs that mobs are getting. Or others are still far too ammo inefficient. Because of how havoc's party finder works, you can only pray your teammates aren't insane enough to bring these weapons. The already scarce ammo can turn into none if an ogryn brings twin-linked heavy stubber for example. Or somebody decides to bring an autogun. \r\n\r\nThen there's server stability. Server stability remains an issue and absolutely tanks certain games. Sometimes your game is terminated by a server error. And of course that counts as a loss in havoc. In auric and such it's just very very annoying to have your time wasted. \r\n\r\nOverall, I expect the devs to not read this  or read this and ignore it. If they actually cared, they'd fix bugs or change things. \r\n\r\nAs it is, I don't want to even buy the upcoming DLC. It will probably become a recurring pattern of release a strong class that they won't  nerf or anything. Instead it's a continuous power creep that then makes older classes significantly worse.",
