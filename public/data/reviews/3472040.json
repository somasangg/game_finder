Sure, you'll still run into people using a zen (just like console), but compared to all other PC 2k's, it's actually playable and not a hacker every time. Highly recommend if you don't mind the usual pay-to-play myCareer. \n\nPeople need to stop complaining (leaving bad reviews) about 2k's greed, it won't change because millions of PC & console players happily spend 100+ on the game to compete with others. There not going to change anything because your crying in the reviews section.\n\nMy ONLY gripe with this game is ofcourse the zen users, AND NO CROSSPLAY. If there was crossplay, this game would be an absolutely perfect experience compared to consoles. Queue times can be atrocious in certain gamemodes and you'll end up playing the same people over and over again.",

A little arcadey, but not over the top.\n\nPlayed some REC games (online 5v5). Can't say much. Not enough playtime. MyCareer has had my attention.\n\nBought it on sale in Season 1. Have played multiple iterations of NBA2K. I've had fun playing this game.\n\nThings to remember if you do purchase:\nGo receive your daily reward in the City. You can get VC. \nDuring the NBA Season, you can pick who will win IRL and win VC.\nThere are Player builds you can download and use, or build your own to your preference.\nHave fun.",

The message I was prompted with said that I had a parental control restriction preventing me from spending VC. After months of going back and forth with their support and them having no idea how to address this, they provided me a key for the game, suggested I create a secondary Steam account, create a steam family, and then access the game on that new account. That's all fine and dandy, and I'm able to spend VC in MyTeam again on this account I'm using, but I lost all of the progress and save files from the other account. In conclusion, it's a solid game. Micro-transactions are bullshit, though.",

And they added fresh mechanics like Game Changer Cards for more strategy. \r\nIn MyCAREER, you’ll experience a new story called “Out of Bounds”, with more cinematic moments and a more meaningful progression. The City mode is redesigned too — it’s more accessible, and there’s a Swap Build feature so you can tweak your MyPLAYER more flexibly. \r\nVisually, the game looks stunning: improved skin shaders, better lighting in arenas, and more detailed uniforms and courts make every match feel like a real broadcast.",

I'm predominantly a REC player and that has become completely unplayable at this point. It's a split between the in game play being absolutely unpredictable and making no sense what so ever with random events always happening that don't make sense and the lack of ability you have to play defense in the game. Can't get 1 block to save your life no matter what your defensive ratting is. 90% of the time you play people don't pass the ball and think they're Michael Jordan and take all the shots. and most of the time they either leave because the other team knows they don't pass. So then you got the AI which 110% useless in this game because the AI doesn't guard spot up shooting so everyone who's on the other team just gives it to the guy who has the AI and he drops 35+ points. So, if you enjoy random unexplainable events that are so enraging and can't ever play a decent game of basketball where the game is always screwing you or your teammates are then your in luck. Overall complete disappointment. I've played a lot of 2k. I so want to enjoy playing it, but I'm telling ya your going to have a hard time doing it especially if your a casual player. Builds are also so much money. Console is probably better. At least they get VC discounts. Overall pretty unplayable unless you want to play people who play all day, or lose games due to bad game mechanics and AI players.\nDon’t play this game, absolutely unplayable, I’ve played in 10 games and in all of them random players leave who are on your team after forcing every shot and missing. Nobody will pass the ball. Your just taking lose after lose. Completely unbearable to play. Unfortunately. Wish I had my time and money back.",

This game is what happens when you have the resources to improve your game until perfection, but you just don't listen/care enough to fix issues, there are very polished aspects of the game, but most of these aspects are small things the fanbase doesn't want/care about. \n\n   -There are at least TWO SPELLING errors in the main storyline, not a big deal on its own, but this is a Colossus of a game as far as success, a spelling error is an easy fix for a company that cares.\n   -If you flip through certain menus too abruptly, it can straight up just freeze your game, I was doing team practice in MyCareer and as I was deciding on a drill, poof! I couldn't do anything on my main monitor.\n   -Simple quality of life features are lacking to a large extent, I went back to replay some of my already completed MyCareer storyline to see if there was something else I could do, and when I did, there were several unskippable cutscenes lasting minutes for events I had already played through.\n   -There is STILL, after all these years of people complaining and negative attention, a very, very, heavy emphasis on \"pay-to-progress\" virtual currency packages, and I understand if you prefer to shell out the 100 USD or so that it costs to get to a maxed character, but it feels like half of the content in this game has a price tag next to it, it really makes you feel like you should just spend the money to avoid the grind.\n\n   At the end of the day, I like NBA basketball, so I'm going to play NBA 2K at times, but if ten companies had the rights to make a game based on the NBA, NBA 2K would most likely be the 9th or 10th game I'd pick when I get the urge to shoot some hoops.

And in those 5 games I used 3 DIFFERENT SHOOTING ARCS, not because I manually changed them, but because I loaded into the first 2 games with the one that i picked last time i loaded the game, then it reset to the default bar for the next 2, and for the final one it changed the shooting arc AGAIN to a completely different arc.

But here, everything is silent, everything is static.\r\nPlaying NBA 2K26 isn't much different from playing NBA 2K05. Only worse.\r\nAdd to this, in a game that costs €60, all the gambling mechanics that, fortunately, don't interest me, but if I were still 14, I probably would have been tempted to try them, even if only out of FOMO.\r\nAnd if someone wanted to try the story mode (My Career), they'd be forced to endure excruciating grinding and a cringe-worthy, stupid, and horrible story. Moreover, this mode is only available online and has an expiration date, because when the next season begins, this part of the game will be completely removed, as will online PvP.\r\nThis game is the emblematic example of this industry: prone to exploiting its fans, resource-hungry, cringe-worthy, and monstrous.\r\n\r\nIf you're a NBA basketball fan, only buy it when it's heavily discounted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSe una persona ama il basket, e per svariati motivi di salute non può stare in un campetto ad tirare un pallone dentro al canestro, questo gioco rappresenta praticamente l'unica possibilità per farlo.\r\nQuesto gioco e questa serie, ormai hanno intrapreso un cammino di sfruttamento e mancanza di rispetto della propria fan base comune a praticamente tutti i videgame sportivi di squadra.\r\nIl numero di innovazioni portate a questo gioco si possono riassumere in: cosmetiche, gioco d'azzardo, grind.\r\nLo stato del gioco è orrendo, soprattutto se si guardano le partite giocate, ci si rende conto di come il basket venga giocato in modo differente da 20 anni fa e di come sopratutto le squadre utilizzino diverse versioni della motion offense per segnare. Qua tutto tace, tutto è statico. \r\nGiocare  a NBA 2K26 non è molto diverso di giocare a NBA 2K05. Solo peggio.\r\nA questo si aggiungono, in un gioco che costa 60 euro, tutte le meccaniche di gioco d'azzardo che fortunatamente a me non interessano ma, se avessi ancora 14 anni, sarei probabilmente stato portato a provarle, anche solo per FOMO. \r\nSe una persona poi volesse provare la modalità storia (My Career), si troverebbe costretto ad un grinding esasperato e una storia cringe, stupida e orribile. Tra l'altro questa modalità è possibile soltanto online ed ha una data di scadenza, perché quando la prossima stagione inizierà, questa parte del gioco verrà completamente esclusa, così come il pvp online.\r\nQuesto gioco è l'emblematico esempio di questa industria: prona a sfruttare i suoi apassionati, vampiresca di risorse, cringe, mostruosa.\r\n\r\nSe siete apassionati di basket NBA, compratelo solo quando è in forte sconto.",

      "review": "This is an in-depth critique of this horrendous game and franchise. I’m tired of how surface-level the praise and criticism of this series always are.\n\nThere’s this old shoemaker who’s too cheap to toss out an old mangled boot. Instead he keeps slapping patch after patch onto the same rotten leather. Each fix creates a new problem, so he patches that too, then patches the patch, until it becomes a towering, misshapen, unrecognizable pole of garbage. This is the 2K franchise.\n\nThis game is a decade-old skeleton propped up by duct tape and copium. \nPeople keep saying the series peaked at 2K11, 2K14, and 2K16. The movement is still the same bumper-car nonsense it has been since 2K14. Players snap to invisible grid points like they’re being teleported by a drunk stagehand. Footwork has no bearing on defense. It is a rubber-band tug-of-war where the engine jerks your player into angles at velocities no human body would survive. \nLocomotion, real physics, and actual momentum do not exist. What you get instead is a poorly choreographed imitation of offense and ball movement.\n\nPassing is bipolar. The same input produces a different result every time. High passes never seem to exist unless the animation library feels generous. You can have Wembanyama wide open, yet the game throws a chest-high lob directly into Tyler Herro’s hands like you are secretly running point for the other team. Outlet passes trigger on pure whim. Magnetic steal animations bend the ball’s path as if the defender is an air bender. Passing drills are so broken they feel like parody.\n\nThe engine’s philosophy is simple: animation first, reality second, physics never.\n\nBallhandling is a shrine to invincibility frames. It would make fighting games blush.\nReal basketball logic, such as protecting the ball or shielding it with the off-shoulder, means nothing. The dribble ball is glued to an animation tag instead of existing in actual space. You can read the ballhandler perfectly, cut the angle, watch them expose the ball like they are sleepwalking through a pickup game, and the game still hands you a reach-in foul for pressing steal. Meanwhile Unpluckable and its clones override basic logic and give even sloppy handlers a forcefield.\n\nThis is especially bad this year. The game will call you for a reach-in foul just for attempting a poke when the ballhandler is bulldozing through his defender and colliding with you while the on-ball hand is fully exposed. When Kyrie Irving, Wardell Stephen Curry, or Allen Iverson do that in real life, it is a miracle when the ball is not stripped. It is a highlight. In this game it happens every other possession and nobody bats an eye, yet you get punished for playing disciplined and sane on-ball defense.\n\nOff-ball players are Stonehenge with jerseys. Without automatic playcalling or constant manual plays, four teammates plant themselves like ancient monuments. No off-ball screens. No intelligent cuts. No recognition of double teams. You can draw two defenders, leave an entire lane open, and your wide open teammate will still stand on the perimeter admiring scenery. Actual NBA role players, and even NBA busts, would riot if they had to run with this AI.\n\nNow defense. Or rather the ghost of defense.\nThe coverage system is busted in ways that have never been fixed. The feedback does not reflect what your eyes see. The system’s bipolar tendencies return. Identical situations produce wildly different outcomes. A layup is labeled open, and the same layup against the same defender from almost the same position suddenly becomes heavily contested. I once had Kevin Love on the opposite side of the rim, barely even involved, a full step away with his hand lazily raised. Yet the coverage read 54 percent and called it heavily contested. The game created geometry that simply did not exist.\nOn ball defense is a joke. The player you are defending will warp past you half the time no matter how precise you try to be.\n\nThis engine can’t produce fluid motion, can’t respect spatial logic, and can’t simulate basic basketball IQ.\nNBA 2K26 is a time capsule proving exactly how far a series can fall when it refuses to rebuild the foundation.\n\nP.S. I forgot to add that the game actually has typos in numerous instances in interviews and such. Truly indicative of the love and care poured into this game",

Every year it feels like the company tries harder and harder to design such a level difference between yourself and everything else in the game that it forces you to spend an unreasonable amount of money just to make it \"fun\", even though it's still not fun, it's just operating how it should've been. But the story is lack luster, which is wild since they take off every other year from designing a MyCareer story, and if there is no money to gain from the game mode they don't bother to try to improve it.",

I've looked for help everywhere, tried everything, but nothing works. I took my computer to a repair shop in case that was the problem, but they told me that if it only happens in one game, its only game fault. I haven't played NBA 2K in a long time, and I'm disappointed that this is the impression I've had since NBA 2K 21 (which was my first 2K). If anyone has a solution or knows when this will be fixed, please let me know.",
