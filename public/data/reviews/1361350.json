Gacha mechanics are quite commonplace with games like these but after playing for over a thousand hours on multiple accounts it is clear that the percentage chances shown do not reflect your actual chances of drawing an SSR item. There are obvious hidden stats here that go into robbing you of your money. On one account I drew 420 times and got a measly 8 swimsuits at a supposed 3.3% chance. On another, I drew 240 times and got ZERO items at a 3.3% chance! And oh my God is this game expensive! Most of the time, depending on your currency, you are paying roughly $35 CAD for 10 pulls of a gacha that has a 1.1% chance! Oh, but it gets even worse. For birthday events, 10 pulls actually have a 0.78% to pull the featured item.  To make matters worse, the game consistently gives you copies of the same swimsuit!. The game does grant you these special swimsuits automatically once you have accumulated 200 paid pulls (or $700 CAD). So, as my previous example showed when I pulled 240 times and got nothing, it is very possible that it may take you $700 just to get that ONE featured swimsuit that you want! Please, do NOT waste your time and money on this pathetic, shallow release from Koei Tecmo. You are far better off to just pay for a real, human girl, as it would be far cheaper. If you MUST play a game featuring DOA characters then either buy a PS4 or PS5 and get Dead or Alive Xtreme 3 Fortune/Scarlet instead. Not sure why the Japanese love gacha mechanics so much. Stop bending over for Keoi Tecmo, this game ain't worth your time and money!",

      "review": "This is by far one of the most frustrating games I have ever played. Never have I experienced a game where the developers go out of their way to cheat the consumer. Every aspect of this game seems to have some level of controlled RNG where the odds are never in your favor. From the unfair AI, to the corrupt casino and the ridiculous gacha pull rates, this game is an absolute chore to play! \n\nThe match AI is one of the worst I have ever seen. Instead of making the game competitive, Koei decided to take the lazy route by just simply making the AI overpowered, with fully unlocked skills for event matches. This is to encourage you to pull from the gacha in order to get special swimsuits that grant significant stat bonuses. This is the heart of what makes this game so frustrating.  The gacha has ridiculously low pull rates coupled with expensive micro-transactions. I mean, it's not even close to reasonable! I will list some of the end of the review. To make matters worse, the game loves giving you copies of the exact same swimsuit! It is NOT a coincidence that this occurs. As an example, on the Denier event, 6 of 9 swimsuits I pulled were copies. This was across 2 different accounts. And It gets even worse! For the monthly ticket pull, across THREE different accounts I pulled the exact same swimsuit FOUR TIMES. This is out of 20 possible swimsuits to pull from!  This works out to a 5% chance for each swimsuit. Yet, I somehow drew the same one 4 times. It is thus obvious that there is a higher probability of pulling certain characters/swimsuits than others, even though the game wants you to believe that the odds are all equal. And you NEED these special event swimsuits in order to progress through the missions at an efficient pace. Otherwise, it will take you significantly longer to grind through events. In fact, some of the matches aren't even possible to win unless you have the stat buffs that these special swimsuits grant. \n\nEven with an M.2 SSD the game and feels really sluggish and unresponsive in the menus. Almost everything you click has some sort of loading screen. This is made worse by the animation that the onscreen girl needs to finish before you are able to move on to the next screen. While this may seem like a minor issue, when you are grinding this becomes really annoying. Of course, this is further exacerbated by the game's need to constantly be connected to the servers. If you're not located in Asia there will be a notable difference in load times and random game crashes, even on a connection of 50Mbps or higher.\n\nThere is no \"true\" option to quick play matches. The game's \"autoplay\" feature still has to load and simulate each and every match onscreen. If you try the \"skip match\" button the game will simulate the match WITHOUT using your special skills. This too often leads to a loss and a waste of precious stamina. Koei easily could have allowed the AI to incorporate the calculation of skills when skipping a match but they would much rather you waste your time by having to sit through each individual match-up.\n\nPlease, do NOT waste your time and money on this pathetic, shallow release from Koei Tecmo. There seems to be no end to their greed when it comes to DOA, and Venus is no exception. Everything here is meant to waste your time and money. Almost every aspect of this game feels rigged! The game is just one big giant tease that leads nowhere. There are far better choices for Waifu's on the internet! Don't let your hormones trick you into believing that this is a good game! Koei Tecmo couldn't care less about you. This game spits in your face, bends you over, and then gives you the middle finger afterwards. \n\nHere are some other fun facts:\n\n-On one account I drew 690 gacha's and got a measly 13 swimsuits at a supposed 3.3% chance. This works out to a 1.8% actual rate. I guess it all evens out when you draw one million gacha's...\n\n-On another account, I drew 240 times and got ZERO items at a 3.3% chance! \n\n-Roughly ¥3000 for 10 pulls of a gacha that has a 1.1% chance!\n\n-For birthday and special events, 10 pulls actually have a 0.67% chance to pull the featured item. \n\n-It may take you ¥70,000 or more just to get that ONE featured swimsuit that you want! \n\n-Monica drew seven, 21's in a row on me in Blackjack. \n\n-I grew new grey hairs at a rate of 2 per day for 4 months of playing this game.",

The beginning seems generous with how liberal it hands out the currency and tickets to buy gacha packs, but I can easily see that generosity getting turned off later in the game, after you have committed enough time where you feel like it's necessary to keep playing the game you sunk so much time into.\nLook; I'm a reptile, and I like looking at women. So, I expected this game to be shallow, but all you do is look at women and use gacha mechanics to raise arbitrary numbers. The only decision you can make during volleyball is calling a time out or unleashing their limit break (or whatever they call it in the game). For most of the beginning matches, you won't need to do either of these. Again, I somewhat expected that. This is more a game about ogling polygonal women. However, unless I missed something in the tutorial (I am using the Google Translate app on my phone), you can't even cheer your girls on from the sideline to try to increase stats or luck...or whatever.\nThe only part of this game that actually has interesting choice making is....the blackjack casino. I spent quite a bit of time there, had fun with that.\n\nThere are a number of different currencies that can be bought (of course) with real money. There is a relationship mechanic with the girls, though it's shallow. Just drag and drop gifts onto them and watch a meter fill. I tried dropping some french fries on a girl in real life and she didn't love me...in fact, she hasn't talked to me since.\nYou can use the currencies to buy these gifts, as well as items that can be used to upgrade swimsuits. If you are an RPG player, you can consider swimsuits as your gear. Swimsuits increase arbitrary stats. Higher the number = being \"better\" at the game. Swimsuits are (annoyingly) divided into 2 categories. \"Private\" swimsuits and \"tournament\" swimsuits. Private swimsuits (which do have stats) are the swimsuit the girl will wear in the menus and other locations of the app. Tournament swimsuits will the the swimsuit the girl wears during a volleyball match. I'm not sure why they felt it necessary to have 2 different categories. The result is that, while you can wear private swimsuits to a volleyball match, you cannot wear a tournament swimsuit in the menus. You must unlock character specific swimsuits via the gacha to wear them in private. General swimsuits (swimsuits all characters can wear) are limited to volleyball matches only. NBD, other than 1) Chances are, the gacha will unlock a general swimsuit. 2) If the gacha unlocks a character-specific swimsuit, it likely won't be for the character you want. I spent half of the free gacha tickets trying to unlock a character-specific swimsuit for Marie, and wound up with a handful of character specific swimsuits for characters I hadn't even unlocked yet.\n\nI just don't recommend this game unless you have deep pockets and are willing to spend money on luck based microtransactions.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that some of the music is pretty good.

Gacha mechanics are quite commonplace with games like these but after playing for over a thousand hours on multiple accounts it is clear that the percentage chances shown do not reflect your actual chances of drawing an SSR item. There are obvious hidden stats here that go into robbing you of your money. On one account I drew 420 times and got a measly 8 swimsuits at a supposed 3.3% chance. On another, I drew 240 times and got ZERO items at a 3.3% chance! And oh my God is this game expensive! Most of the time, depending on your currency, you are paying roughly $35 CAD for 10 pulls of a gacha that has a 1.1% chance! Oh, but it gets even worse. For birthday events, 10 pulls actually have a 0.78% to pull the featured item.  To make matters worse, the game consistently gives you copies of the same swimsuit!. The game does grant you these special swimsuits automatically once you have accumulated 200 paid pulls (or $700 CAD). So, as my previous example showed when I pulled 240 times and got nothing, it is very possible that it may take you $700 just to get that ONE featured swimsuit that you want! Please, do NOT waste your time and money on this pathetic, shallow release from Koei Tecmo. You are far better off to just pay for a real, human girl, as it would be far cheaper. If you MUST play a game featuring DOA characters then either buy a PS4 or PS5 and get Dead or Alive Xtreme 3 Fortune/Scarlet instead. Not sure why the Japanese love gacha mechanics so much.

Instead of making the game competitive, Koei decided to take the lazy route by just simply making the AI overpowered, with fully unlocked skills for event matches.

The gacha has ridiculously low pull rates coupled with expensive micro-transactions. I mean, it's not even close to reasonable! I will list some of the end of the review.

As an example, on the Denier event, 6 of 9 swimsuits I pulled were copies. This was across 2 different accounts. And It gets even worse! For the monthly ticket pull, across THREE different accounts I pulled the exact same swimsuit FOUR TIMES. This is out of 20 possible swimsuits to pull from!  This works out to a 5% chance for each swimsuit. Yet, I somehow drew the same one 4 times. It is thus obvious that there is a higher probability of pulling certain characters/swimsuits than others, even though the game wants you to believe that the odds are all equal.

The beginning seems generous with how liberal it hands out the currency and tickets to buy gacha packs, but I can easily see that generosity getting turned off later in the game, after you have committed enough time where you feel like it's necessary to keep playing the game you sunk so much time into.\nLook; I'm a reptile, and I like looking at women. So, I expected this game to be shallow, but all you do is look at women and use gacha mechanics to raise arbitrary numbers. The only decision you can make during volleyball is calling a time out or unleashing their limit break (or whatever they call it in the game). For most of the beginning matches, you won't need to do either of these. Again, I somewhat expected that. This is more a game about ogling polygonal women. However, unless I missed something in the tutorial (I am using the Google Translate app on my phone), you can't even cheer your girls on from the sideline to try to increase stats or luck...or whatever.\nThe only part of this game that actually has interesting choice making is....the blackjack casino. I spent quite a bit of time there, had fun with that.\n\nThere are a number of different currencies that can be bought (of course) with real money. There is a relationship mechanic with the girls, though it's shallow. Just drag and drop gifts onto them and watch a meter fill.

Gacha mechanics are quite commonplace with games like these but after playing for over a thousand hours on multiple accounts it is clear that the percentage chances shown do not reflect your actual chances of drawing an SSR item. There are obvious hidden stats here that go into robbing you of your money. On one account I drew 420 times and got a measly 8 swimsuits at a supposed 3.3% chance. On another, I drew 240 times and got ZERO items at a 3.3% chance! And oh my God is this game expensive! Most of the time, depending on your currency, you are paying roughly $35 CAD for 10 pulls of a gacha that has a 1.1% chance! Oh, but it gets even worse. For birthday events, 10 pulls actually have a 0.78% to pull the featured item.  To make matters worse, the game consistently gives you copies of the same swimsuit!. The game does grant you these special swimsuits automatically once you have accumulated 200 paid pulls (or $700 CAD). So, as my previous example showed when I pulled 240 times and got nothing, it is very possible that it may take you $700 just to get that ONE featured swimsuit that you want! Please, do NOT waste your time and money on this pathetic, shallow release from Koei Tecmo. You are far better off to just pay for a real, human girl, as it would be far cheaper. If you MUST play a game featuring DOA characters then either buy a PS4 or PS5 and get Dead or Alive Xtreme 3 Fortune/Scarlet instead. Not sure why the Japanese love gacha mechanics so much.

Every aspect of this game seems to have some level of controlled RNG where the odds are never in your favor. From the unfair AI, to the corrupt casino and the ridiculous gacha pull rates, this game is an absolute chore to play! \n\nThe match AI is one of the worst I have ever seen. Instead of making the game competitive, Koei decided to take the lazy route by just simply making the AI overpowered, with fully unlocked skills for event matches. This is to encourage you to pull from the gacha in order to get special swimsuits that grant significant stat bonuses. This is the heart of what makes this game so frustrating.  The gacha has ridiculously low pull rates coupled with expensive micro-transactions. I mean, it's not even close to reasonable! I will list some of the end of the review. To make matters worse, the game loves giving you copies of the exact same swimsuit! It is NOT a coincidence that this occurs. As an example, on the Denier event, 6 of 9 swimsuits I pulled were copies. This was across 2 different accounts. And It gets even worse! For the monthly ticket pull, across THREE different accounts I pulled the exact same swimsuit FOUR TIMES. This is out of 20 possible swimsuits to pull from!  This works out to a 5% chance for each swimsuit. Yet, I somehow drew the same one 4 times. It is thus obvious that there is a higher probability of pulling certain characters/swimsuits than others, even though the game wants you to believe that the odds are all equal. And you NEED these special event swimsuits in order to progress through the missions at an efficient pace. Otherwise, it will take you significantly longer to grind through events. In fact, some of the matches aren't even possible to win unless you have the stat buffs that these special swimsuits grant. \n\nEven with an M.2 SSD the game and feels really sluggish and unresponsive in the menus.

      "review": "Gacha filth.\nI sort of expected that to be the case since it's f2p and published by Koei Tecmo. So, it's not a surprise that it is Gacha filth. The beginning seems generous with how liberal it hands out the currency and tickets to buy gacha packs, but I can easily see that generosity getting turned off later in the game, after you have committed enough time where you feel like it's necessary to keep playing the game you sunk so much time into.\nLook; I'm a reptile, and I like looking at women. So, I expected this game to be shallow, but all you do is look at women and use gacha mechanics to raise arbitrary numbers. The only decision you can make during volleyball is calling a time out or unleashing their limit break (or whatever they call it in the game). For most of the beginning matches, you won't need to do either of these. Again, I somewhat expected that. This is more a game about ogling polygonal women. However, unless I missed something in the tutorial (I am using the Google Translate app on my phone), you can't even cheer your girls on from the sideline to try to increase stats or luck...or whatever.\nThe only part of this game that actually has interesting choice making is....the blackjack casino. I spent quite a bit of time there, had fun with that.\n\nThere are a number of different currencies that can be bought (of course) with real money. There is a relationship mechanic with the girls, though it's shallow. Just drag and drop gifts onto them and watch a meter fill. I tried dropping some french fries on a girl in real life and she didn't love me...in fact, she hasn't talked to me since.\nYou can use the currencies to buy these gifts, as well as items that can be used to upgrade swimsuits. If you are an RPG player, you can consider swimsuits as your gear. Swimsuits increase arbitrary stats. Higher the number = being \"better\" at the game. Swimsuits are (annoyingly) divided into 2 categories. \"Private\" swimsuits and \"tournament\" swimsuits. Private swimsuits (which do have stats) are the swimsuit the girl will wear in the menus and other locations of the app. Tournament swimsuits will the the swimsuit the girl wears during a volleyball match. I'm not sure why they felt it necessary to have 2 different categories. The result is that, while you can wear private swimsuits to a volleyball match, you cannot wear a tournament swimsuit in the menus. You must unlock character specific swimsuits via the gacha to wear them in private. General swimsuits (swimsuits all characters can wear) are limited to volleyball matches only. NBD, other than 1) Chances are, the gacha will unlock a general swimsuit. 2) If the gacha unlocks a character-specific swimsuit, it likely won't be for the character you want. I spent half of the free gacha tickets trying to unlock a character-specific swimsuit for Marie, and wound up with a handful of character specific swimsuits for characters I hadn't even unlocked yet.\n\nI just don't recommend this game unless you have deep pockets and are willing to spend money on luck based microtransactions.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that some of the music is pretty good. Nice beach tunes to bob your head to.",

Gacha mechanics are quite commonplace with games like these but after playing for over a thousand hours on multiple accounts it is clear that the percentage chances shown do not reflect your actual chances of drawing an SSR item. There are obvious hidden stats here that go into robbing you of your money. On one account I drew 420 times and got a measly 8 swimsuits at a supposed 3.3% chance. On another, I drew 240 times and got ZERO items at a 3.3% chance! And oh my God is this game expensive! Most of the time, depending on your currency, you are paying roughly $35 CAD for 10 pulls of a gacha that has a 1.1% chance! Oh, but it gets even worse. For birthday events, 10 pulls actually have a 0.78% to pull the featured item.  To make matters worse, the game consistently gives you copies of the same swimsuit!. The game does grant you these special swimsuits automatically once you have accumulated 200 paid pulls (or $700 CAD). So, as my previous example showed when I pulled 240 times and got nothing, it is very possible that it may take you $700 just to get that ONE featured swimsuit that you want! Please, do NOT waste your time and money on this pathetic, shallow release from Koei Tecmo. You are far better off to just pay for a real, human girl, as it would be far cheaper. If you MUST play a game featuring DOA characters then either buy a PS4 or PS5 and get Dead or Alive Xtreme 3 Fortune/Scarlet instead. Not sure why the Japanese love gacha mechanics so much.

Every aspect of this game seems to have some level of controlled RNG where the odds are never in your favor. From the unfair AI, to the corrupt casino and the ridiculous gacha pull rates, this game is an absolute chore to play! \n\nThe match AI is one of the worst I have ever seen. Instead of making the game competitive, Koei decided to take the lazy route by just simply making the AI overpowered, with fully unlocked skills for event matches. This is to encourage you to pull from the gacha in order to get special swimsuits that grant significant stat bonuses. This is the heart of what makes this game so frustrating.  The gacha has ridiculously low pull rates coupled with expensive micro-transactions. I mean, it's not even close to reasonable! I will list some of the end of the review. To make matters worse, the game loves giving you copies of the exact same swimsuit! It is NOT a coincidence that this occurs. As an example, on the Denier event, 6 of 9 swimsuits I pulled were copies. This was across 2 different accounts. And It gets even worse! For the monthly ticket pull, across THREE different accounts I pulled the exact same swimsuit FOUR TIMES. This is out of 20 possible swimsuits to pull from!  This works out to a 5% chance for each swimsuit. Yet, I somehow drew the same one 4 times. It is thus obvious that there is a higher probability of pulling certain characters/swimsuits than others, even though the game wants you to believe that the odds are all equal. And you NEED these special event swimsuits in order to progress through the missions at an efficient pace. Otherwise, it will take you significantly longer to grind through events. In fact, some of the matches aren't even possible to win unless you have the stat buffs that these special swimsuits grant. \n\nEven with an M.2 SSD the game and feels really sluggish and unresponsive in the menus. Almost everything you click has some sort of loading screen. This is made worse by the animation that the onscreen girl needs to finish before you are able to move on to the next screen. While this may seem like a minor issue, when you are grinding this becomes really annoying. Of course, this is further exacerbated by the game's need to constantly be connected to the servers. If you're not located in Asia there will be a notable difference in load times and random game crashes, even on a connection of 50Mbps or higher.\n\nThere is no \"true\" option to quick play matches. The game's \"autoplay\" feature still has to load and simulate each and every match onscreen. If you try the \"skip match\" button the game will simulate the match WITHOUT using your special skills. This too often leads to a loss and a waste of precious stamina. Koei easily could have allowed the AI to incorporate the calculation of skills when skipping a match but they would much rather you waste your time by having to sit through each individual match-up.\n\nPlease, do NOT waste your time and money on this pathetic, shallow release from Koei Tecmo. There seems to be no end to their greed when it comes to DOA, and Venus is no exception. Everything here is meant to waste your time and money. Almost every aspect of this game feels rigged! The game is just one big giant tease that leads nowhere. There are far better choices for Waifu's on the internet! Don't let your hormones trick you into believing that this is a good game! Koei Tecmo couldn't care less about you. This game spits in your face, bends you over, and then gives you the middle finger afterwards. \n\nHere are some other fun facts:\n\n-On one account I drew 690 gacha's and got a measly 13 swimsuits at a supposed 3.3% chance.

      "review": "If there ever was a game that deserved to be review bombed it's this one! I really am quite dumbfounded at the amount of positive reviews. Gacha mechanics are quite commonplace with games like these but after playing for over a thousand hours on multiple accounts it is clear that the percentage chances shown do not reflect your actual chances of drawing an SSR item. There are obvious hidden stats here that go into robbing you of your money. On one account I drew 420 times and got a measly 8 swimsuits at a supposed 3.3% chance. On another, I drew 240 times and got ZERO items at a 3.3% chance! And oh my God is this game expensive! Most of the time, depending on your currency, you are paying roughly $35 CAD for 10 pulls of a gacha that has a 1.1% chance! Oh, but it gets even worse. For birthday events, 10 pulls actually have a 0.78% to pull the featured item.  To make matters worse, the game consistently gives you copies of the same swimsuit!. The game does grant you these special swimsuits automatically once you have accumulated 200 paid pulls (or $700 CAD). So, as my previous example showed when I pulled 240 times and got nothing, it is very possible that it may take you $700 just to get that ONE featured swimsuit that you want! Please, do NOT waste your time and money on this pathetic, shallow release from Koei Tecmo. You are far better off to just pay for a real, human girl, as it would be far cheaper. If you MUST play a game featuring DOA characters then either buy a PS4 or PS5 and get Dead or Alive Xtreme 3 Fortune/Scarlet instead. Not sure why the Japanese love gacha mechanics so much. Stop bending over for Keoi Tecmo, this game ain't worth your time and money!",

      "review": "This is by far one of the most frustrating games I have ever played. Never have I experienced a game where the developers go out of their way to cheat the consumer. Every aspect of this game seems to have some level of controlled RNG where the odds are never in your favor. From the unfair AI, to the corrupt casino and the ridiculous gacha pull rates, this game is an absolute chore to play! \n\nThe match AI is one of the worst I have ever seen. Instead of making the game competitive, Koei decided to take the lazy route by just simply making the AI overpowered, with fully unlocked skills for event matches. This is to encourage you to pull from the gacha in order to get special swimsuits that grant significant stat bonuses. This is the heart of what makes this game so frustrating.  The gacha has ridiculously low pull rates coupled with expensive micro-transactions. I mean, it's not even close to reasonable! I will list some of the end of the review. To make matters worse, the game loves giving you copies of the exact same swimsuit! It is NOT a coincidence that this occurs. As an example, on the Denier event, 6 of 9 swimsuits I pulled were copies. This was across 2 different accounts. And It gets even worse! For the monthly ticket pull, across THREE different accounts I pulled the exact same swimsuit FOUR TIMES. This is out of 20 possible swimsuits to pull from!  This works out to a 5% chance for each swimsuit. Yet, I somehow drew the same one 4 times. It is thus obvious that there is a higher probability of pulling certain characters/swimsuits than others, even though the game wants you to believe that the odds are all equal. And you NEED these special event swimsuits in order to progress through the missions at an efficient pace. Otherwise, it will take you significantly longer to grind through events. In fact, some of the matches aren't even possible to win unless you have the stat buffs that these special swimsuits grant. \n\nEven with an M.2 SSD the game and feels really sluggish and unresponsive in the menus. Almost everything you click has some sort of loading screen. This is made worse by the animation that the onscreen girl needs to finish before you are able to move on to the next screen. While this may seem like a minor issue, when you are grinding this becomes really annoying. Of course, this is further exacerbated by the game's need to constantly be connected to the servers. If you're not located in Asia there will be a notable difference in load times and random game crashes, even on a connection of 50Mbps or higher.\n\nThere is no \"true\" option to quick play matches. The game's \"autoplay\" feature still has to load and simulate each and every match onscreen. If you try the \"skip match\" button the game will simulate the match WITHOUT using your special skills. This too often leads to a loss and a waste of precious stamina. Koei easily could have allowed the AI to incorporate the calculation of skills when skipping a match but they would much rather you waste your time by having to sit through each individual match-up.\n\nPlease, do NOT waste your time and money on this pathetic, shallow release from Koei Tecmo. There seems to be no end to their greed when it comes to DOA, and Venus is no exception. Everything here is meant to waste your time and money. Almost every aspect of this game feels rigged! The game is just one big giant tease that leads nowhere. There are far better choices for Waifu's on the internet! Don't let your hormones trick you into believing that this is a good game! Koei Tecmo couldn't care less about you. This game spits in your face, bends you over, and then gives you the middle finger afterwards. \n\nHere are some other fun facts:\n\n-On one account I drew 690 gacha's and got a measly 13 swimsuits at a supposed 3.3% chance. This works out to a 1.8% actual rate. I guess it all evens out when you draw one million gacha's...\n\n-On another account, I drew 240 times and got ZERO items at a 3.3% chance! \n\n-Roughly ¥3000 for 10 pulls of a gacha that has a 1.1% chance!\n\n-For birthday and special events, 10 pulls actually have a 0.67% chance to pull the featured item. \n\n-It may take you ¥70,000 or more just to get that ONE featured swimsuit that you want! \n\n-Monica drew seven, 21's in a row on me in Blackjack. \n\n-I grew new grey hairs at a rate of 2 per day for 4 months of playing this game.",

      "review": "Gacha filth.\nI sort of expected that to be the case since it's f2p and published by Koei Tecmo. So, it's not a surprise that it is Gacha filth. The beginning seems generous with how liberal it hands out the currency and tickets to buy gacha packs, but I can easily see that generosity getting turned off later in the game, after you have committed enough time where you feel like it's necessary to keep playing the game you sunk so much time into.\nLook; I'm a reptile, and I like looking at women. So, I expected this game to be shallow, but all you do is look at women and use gacha mechanics to raise arbitrary numbers. The only decision you can make during volleyball is calling a time out or unleashing their limit break (or whatever they call it in the game). For most of the beginning matches, you won't need to do either of these. Again, I somewhat expected that. This is more a game about ogling polygonal women. However, unless I missed something in the tutorial (I am using the Google Translate app on my phone), you can't even cheer your girls on from the sideline to try to increase stats or luck...or whatever.\nThe only part of this game that actually has interesting choice making is....the blackjack casino. I spent quite a bit of time there, had fun with that.\n\nThere are a number of different currencies that can be bought (of course) with real money. There is a relationship mechanic with the girls, though it's shallow. Just drag and drop gifts onto them and watch a meter fill. I tried dropping some french fries on a girl in real life and she didn't love me...in fact, she hasn't talked to me since.\nYou can use the currencies to buy these gifts, as well as items that can be used to upgrade swimsuits. If you are an RPG player, you can consider swimsuits as your gear. Swimsuits increase arbitrary stats. Higher the number = being \"better\" at the game. Swimsuits are (annoyingly) divided into 2 categories. \"Private\" swimsuits and \"tournament\" swimsuits. Private swimsuits (which do have stats) are the swimsuit the girl will wear in the menus and other locations of the app. Tournament swimsuits will the the swimsuit the girl wears during a volleyball match. I'm not sure why they felt it necessary to have 2 different categories. The result is that, while you can wear private swimsuits to a volleyball match, you cannot wear a tournament swimsuit in the menus. You must unlock character specific swimsuits via the gacha to wear them in private. General swimsuits (swimsuits all characters can wear) are limited to volleyball matches only. NBD, other than 1) Chances are, the gacha will unlock a general swimsuit. 2) If the gacha unlocks a character-specific swimsuit, it likely won't be for the character you want. I spent half of the free gacha tickets trying to unlock a character-specific swimsuit for Marie, and wound up with a handful of character specific swimsuits for characters I hadn't even unlocked yet.\n\nI just don't recommend this game unless you have deep pockets and are willing to spend money on luck based microtransactions.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that some of the music is pretty good. Nice beach tunes to bob your head to.",
