      "review": "Brotato is, without question, one of the most addictive arena survival shooters to come out in recent years. For the first dozen or so hours, the core loop is pure, frantic fun. Mowing down hundreds of aliens with six absurdly scaled weapons feels immensely satisfying, and the sheer variety of characters and weapon types promises a playground of build crafting and experimentation. The game starts strong, reeling you in with that sweet, chaotic dopamine rush. (Time Played: 30+ Hours)\n\nMy enthusiasm, however, hit a brick wall right around the Danger 5 difficulty. The game shifts from a playful sandbox to a brutally rigid challenge where the initial promise of variety completely evaporates. The freedom to experiment is swiftly replaced by the grim necessity of following the current meta. If you don't commit to a handful of hyper-optimized builds (like Engineer/Wrench or specific high-harvesting stat-checkers), you end up getting utterly wrecked. Many characters and weapons simply feel non-viable for top-level completion, making the game feel lacking in the variety it initially advertised.\n\nThe most potent source of frustration lies specifically in the boss encounters. They feel less like a true skill check on your dodging and more like a cruel, pass/fail test on your build's DPS. The bosses’ movement, characterized by sudden, dramatic leaps, combined with the immediate threat of high-damage red circles that gimp you if you stand in it before they go off, creates a disproportionately punishing experience. It often feels cheap, demanding flawless execution while simultaneously requiring you to have scaled your damage stats to an insane degree just to burn them down before they overrun the screen. The end result is runs being repeatedly killed by a single, unforgiving two-boss wave, regardless of how cleverly or defensively you played the previous 19 waves.\n\nFinal Verdict: Brotato is an easy recommendation for anyone looking for a highly addictive, fast-paced rogue-lite to sink 10-20 hours into casually. It's a fantastic game for clearing the lower difficulty levels and enjoying the diverse cast. However, if you are seeking a diverse, high-difficulty challenge where a wide range of creative builds are viable, or if you plan to conquer Danger 5 with every potato, prepare for genuine frustration. The late-game forces a stale, meta-driven grind that tarnishes the game's otherwise brilliant foundation.",

The sheer variety of characters, items, and synergies allows for an incredible number of distinct builds, ranging from absurdly powerful to hilariously chaotic. Every run feels different, and the unlock progression keeps you coming back for “just one more wave.”\nThe base difficulty is genuinely challenging and rewarding, but if you ever want to dial it back (or crank it up even further), the modding support is outstanding and seamlessly integrated.\nMy only real complaint is the arena size. Compared to similar titles like Vampire Survivors, the play area feels noticeably more confined, which can make certain builds (especially melee or high-mobility ones) feel a bit cramped.\nAside from that minor gripe, Brotato is polished, addictive, and packed with replay value. Easily worth full price, and an absolute steal on sale.\n9.5/10 – Highly Recommended",

      "review": "Definitely my least favorite rogue-like that I've played. Half the time I die is because my mouse cursor leaves the screen while moving. I like playing mouse-only controls because WASD was super janky. I'd just stand still randomly, and my character wouldn't always move in a diagonal pattern. If that's by design, it's bad design. Otherwise, it's bad coding. I'm not looking for a game like this to play with a controller, so that's out of the question. Mouse-only controls are super convenient and preferred. However, not being able to boost the size of the cursor or even highlight it makes it super hard to see when thousands of enemies are on the screen or it just blends in with default debris on the ground. It's really not a fun way to lose because you can't find the cursor. Especially not fun because it's on another screen despite being in full screen. This is the only game I've played where the mouse leaves the screen during active play regardless of being in Windowed or Fullscreen. No other game, rogue-lite/like or otherwise, does this unless I'm playing in Borderless Windowed AND I'm actively paused. Super bad game design. The only thing that keeps me attempting runs is the accessibility option to retry failed waves. I beat Difficulty 5 with the base character before turning this on. That said, if I didn't turn it on, I wouldn't be completing any runs because I'm dying to reasons out of my control. It shouldn't be this hard to actually be able to play the game. But then when you're playing the game, the balancing isn't fun. Builds are rarely fun even if I get something that feels overpowered. In other rogues, this type of build would just feel average. Other rogues I play also don't have 50 different stats to track to know if the item you're buying is going to make or break your build. That might be fun for some people, but there's a problem when the quantity of stats gets too high. Additionally, there are weapon types that unlock bonuses for having multiple of that weapon type equipped. Cool in concept, poor in execution like most things in this game. Tell me why the shears/trimmers or whatever are not a tool? It's literally a tool. It's only classified as support. Hammer, too. It's a tool. If you're going to make unique categories, make them make sense. That's something small to nitpick, but there isn't anything positive to say about this game. The number of characters is too high. The second zone (The Abyss) really doesn't feel different at all from the first. Every round is the same unless you play a character that has a debilitating ability like One-Armed (by the way, this one has been horrible. Literally pure RNG to get a run going. No way to adapt the run unlike other builds). The game is just poorly optimized in terms of mechanics and builds. There is never a reason for me to build anything other than a ranged build. I'll get the same things over and over just with a different potato. Again, if you like this game, power to you. But this is not for me at all. It's quite terrible. I'll keep trying it while I find another rogue to latch onto. But I do not see this review changing. It feels so uncomfortable to play with the janky mouse controls that leave the screen.",

To give props where they are due this is a great survivor-like and fills the niche for many craving more with a satisfying build system.

      "review": "Definitely my least favorite rogue-like that I've played. Half the time I die is because my mouse cursor leaves the screen while moving. I like playing mouse-only controls because WASD was super janky. I'd just stand still randomly, and my character wouldn't always move in a diagonal pattern. If that's by design, it's bad design. Otherwise, it's bad coding. I'm not looking for a game like this to play with a controller, so that's out of the question. Mouse-only controls are super convenient and preferred. However, not being able to boost the size of the cursor or even highlight it makes it super hard to see when thousands of enemies are on the screen or it just blends in with default debris on the ground. It's really not a fun way to lose because you can't find the cursor. Especially not fun because it's on another screen despite being in full screen. This is the only game I've played where the mouse leaves the screen during active play regardless of being in Windowed or Fullscreen. No other game, rogue-lite/like or otherwise, does this unless I'm playing in Borderless Windowed AND I'm actively paused. Super bad game design. The only thing that keeps me attempting runs is the accessibility option to retry failed waves. I beat Difficulty 5 with the base character before turning this on. That said, if I didn't turn it on, I wouldn't be completing any runs because I'm dying to reasons out of my control. It shouldn't be this hard to actually be able to play the game. But then when you're playing the game, the balancing isn't fun. Builds are rarely fun even if I get something that feels overpowered. In other rogues, this type of build would just feel average. Other rogues I play also don't have 50 different stats to track to know if the item you're buying is going to make or break your build. That might be fun for some people, but there's a problem when the quantity of stats gets too high. Additionally, there are weapon types that unlock bonuses for having multiple of that weapon type equipped. Cool in concept, poor in execution like most things in this game. Tell me why the shears/trimmers or whatever are not a tool? It's literally a tool. It's only classified as support. Hammer, too. It's a tool. If you're going to make unique categories, make them make sense. That's something small to nitpick, but there isn't anything positive to say about this game. The number of characters is too high. The second zone (The Abyss) really doesn't feel different at all from the first. Every round is the same unless you play a character that has a debilitating ability like One-Armed (by the way, this one has been horrible. Literally pure RNG to get a run going. No way to adapt the run unlike other builds). The game is just poorly optimized in terms of mechanics and builds. There is never a reason for me to build anything other than a ranged build. I'll get the same things over and over just with a different potato. Again, if you like this game, power to you. But this is not for me at all. It's quite terrible. I'll keep trying it while I find another rogue to latch onto. But I do not see this review changing. It feels so uncomfortable to play with the janky mouse controls that leave the screen.",
