      "review": "10/10 Kiseff's \"Furry Indoctrination Simulator\" is working as intended. If that's what you're here for, you don't need my approval bc you've already bought the game. \n\nNow for those of us who haven't spent our lives in the bowels of Furaffinity.net and are curious why this game has overwhelmingly positive reviews, I'll start by trying to calm your nerves a bit: \n\nGooner memes overshadow what is a solid casual RPG with MMO-lite features. I'd even argue there's less overtly horny design choices than some popular AAA games like Mass Effect or Persona to name a few. This ain't Conker's Bad Fur Day. A lot of the memeable stuff is front-loaded: the character creator, the kobold goat lady's jiggle physics, the slime diva's slime honkers--you'll understand what I mean when you see it... but after that it really doesn't have anything overtly sexual unless you're deliberately looking for it on a server. It would be like hyper-focusing on WOW tavern ERPers and acting like that's the whole game or something. And all this is keeping in mind the game can be played in single-player, so you can always have a cover when your friends ask you why you're playing the furry MMO. \"I play offline, bro. Pls, believe me, I only joined a discord server as a joke. Everyone is really nice there... Bro, the loot...\" \n\nSo ya, point is, don't let the memes turn you away from a solid game. They're funny and I encourage them, but I think they seriously misrepresent what's here. \n\nAll that aside, my favorite aspects of the game are the fast-pace movement and combat, the mixture of platforming, and Diablo-style looting. That's realistically most of the game right now, that simple but effective loop, it's tried and true. There's also fishing and mining, but admittedly they're a little undercooked when compared to the solid real-time combat and platforming challenges, which I'll elaborate on in a moment. I still like fishing a lot tho, I want the fishing drip, but I'm not braindead enough to lock in and grind out 99 shrimp in fishing's current state. Just make it more than pressing a button twice. \n\nSo yeah, I hyped movement and that's bc you're finessing almost out the gate. Everyone starts with a dash and double jump, I love it. The mage and bandit get more mobility options down the line and they can trivialize platforming challenges, but I take it that's the point. Movement just rules, trust me. Other games feel sluggish to me after playing this, it's so good. \n\nDefinitely recommend making multiple characters and seeing what class you like best, I was a huge fan of the Bandit and Mage class if you can't tell. I never subclassed, so I can't really speak to how they play, but I hear they're still in development and a little underbaked, atm. Updates seem pretty consistent, so maybe more on those later. \n\nOh, and this game has so many nods to older PlayStation and N64 games, like the Majora's Mask style loading screen or the sound design that feels deliberately designed around 64 Zelda's ambient SFXs, it just works. Music too, lots of ambient synth pads and the occasional breakbeat during tense situations. It all comes together so nicely, you won't even be thinking about that thicc kobold goat lady quest giver. \n\nIf I needed to make a few suggestions, nothing major: 1) a less finicky targeting system, it's not necessary to play, but I like using it and wish it was a little fine tuned. 2) better controller support, which I think is in the works. 3) and maybe controversially, more platforming challenges, the movement in the game is too good to not lean into it. 4) make fishing more engaging, it's a nice start tho. \n\nAnyway, I really just wanted to clear up the meme controversy in a review. I was hesitant to play this bc of the meme, but it's definitely worth your money. I'll probably update this from time to time as the game changes. It's a gem and I'm really wishing Kiseff the best of luck in fleshing out the game. Let the guy retire from making NSFW art and start making the next gen of amazing indie games--or both, idc tbh.

It's WAY less inappropriate than some might make it out to be, or think it is.\n\nSome positives i have from my playtime so far (6.2 hours):\nThe game has a pretty good leveling system; some items are locked behind certain levels, understandably!\n-    If the weapons/items were not locked behind those levels, someone could grind all the way to the top instantly. \nThis makes it very easy for the dev(hopefully devS in the future) to add more weapons and levels in the future, so people at max arent left with nothing to do.\n\nThe immersion of the game is great, for how it looks, plays, and feels.\n-    The artstyle is a great mix of low-poly/low-res, grungy, and cutesy.\n-    The character customization lets you customize how you like yourself to look, the addition of the \"illusion stones\" makes this all the more better.\n-    The characters feel semi-alive, wish there was casual dialogue, but this game is still in early access!\n\nSome notes/suggestions:\nI suggest furthering the game scope, to include some more devs working on this, and possibly adding more mechanics, like crafting, and general RPG/MMO actions(food/hydration) and dialogue with other npcs, or even a town with lively npcs in it that you can have a positive or negative relationship with(not in a dating sim way)\n\nExpanding on my suggestion of RPG/MMO actions; Possible OPTIONAL farming, home building, decorating, or even simple ways to hang out and chill after or before another crawl through a catacomb.\n\nSome negatives:\nNot many! Other than the content above not being in the game, i dont see why this game wont become a success, apart from limited playerbase of more mature players.\n\nThe game doesnt need to be exclusively action-adventure, it can also be slightly more life sim-y.\n\nThese are just my opinions. If you disagree, feel free to dislike this comment. Otherwise, feel free to expand on my ideas and leave it in your own review for this game!\n\nWould recommend.",

      "review": "Disclaimer: As of this writing I've only replayed the L1-L10 sections across many characters from me trying too hard to act like there was permadeath. (There's actually little to no penalty for death.) I'll also need to rewrite if and when I do some co-op.\n\n++++ Plays like an action MMO, scratches the looter-shooter itch, but none of the corporate shenanigans of either! NO \"I PAID MONEY TO BE OVERPOWERED\" DLC OR MICROTRANSACTIONS. NO SUBSCRIPTIONS. NOTHING DESIGNED TO MAKE YOU WANT THOSE THINGS. NO ADS unless the furry-ness counts. Just pay the low initial price of admission and you're set!\n++++ RECEIVES CONSTANT UPDATES. I only bought this game about a week ago, and it already feels like there's been a constant stream of quality-of-life updates.\n\n+++ The character creator is simple yet powerful. [spoiler] Plus there's what the last video on the store page teases... [/spoiler] Either I'm the least creative thing ever, or it can get extremely close to all my designs minus the minutiae hand-waved by the low-poly art style and things the compulsion to be unique would ruin.\n++ Extremely replayable. Dungeon layouts are pseudo-randomized between character files. Loot varies just enough to make luck an element and item banking between characters a boost, but you aren't spending half the game agonizing what to drop / scrambling to hack your backpack size either. Platforming set-pieces are not randomized to an unplayable mash.\n\n+ It doesn't reinvent the wheel nor is it flashy, but combat is varied enough once you get used to the parry mechanic. Arrows work well if you can keep a long distance or are [i] that [/i] good at sidestepping enemies faster than you, scepters work well if you can keep some distance, but when cornered there's no substitute for the feel of melee weapons. Fire rate varies between weapon types substantially too. For example, daggers are barely slower than a click; but scythes take what feels like a point-and-click adventure game's amount of time to swipe. Plus, being an Action RPG, you get spells to cast; and they aren't just for magicians.\n+ The low-poly art style is very well done, and also means system requirements are low. Runs buttery smooth on a gaming handheld set to medium TDP. Keeping the store page open as I typed this put the handheld under a similar load if not more than the game itself.\n\n? Very much a furry game. This will either help or hurt your ability to find others to play with. (Hurts in my case.)\n? You can increase or reduce suggestiveness using not-well-hidden settings. If this were 2002, the maximum setting would only register as T; but it's not 2002 anymore. (I find a non-furry boss from a certain T-rated American PS2 RPG flaunts their ...transform-and-lighting a bit more than this game on max.)\n\n-- Not quite enough quests to cover all levels' bases nor feel fleshed out, but this is compensated for by some quests being reissued repeatedly until levelled high enough for the next one. I've forced myself through worse, and this also means sidequests aren't prone to slop.\n- Despite the controller update, some options are still hard to use on a controller. A gaming handheld's touchscreen can compensate for this mostly but not fully. It's early in that update's life, so this may get fixed soon.\n\nHints if you're using this as a respite from looter-shooters:\n. If you miss shields, there's a reason the sit command is there. Sit for a minute.\n. You carry healing items in an inventory separate from your gear. Get out of that awful mindset a certain other game teaches!\n. Generally speaking: Ranged weapons don't have infinite range, but have infinite ammo.\n. You can still parry/guard while wielding ranged weapons, but taking full advantage of parrying needs melee weapons.",

      "review": "THIS IS A WIP. WILL BE RE-EVALUATED AFTER RELEASE. \n\nI'm going to start this out simply and expand more as I go further. This is a dungeon crawler type light RPG with adult-esque physiques. The loop is you go to area, level up, beat area and move to next area. Very simple RPG elements currently like fishing and mining but that's it. \n\nWhy am I giving it a thumbs up? Because I want more support for the Dev. Anything I can do to help them make a smoother transition between updates makes the game that much better. \n\nWhat do I like? The combat feels good. I mean REALLY good. The moves activate with a crisp feel and you never feel like you are slowed down. That keeps the pace of the combat amazing. I love the idea of the skills and sub-classes ( can't wait to see it expanded more). Can't wait to see more professions and complexity in said jobs. I love the elite enemies that can spawn when fighting too many of the same enemy. The day/night cycle to switch mobs is fun as usual. The map layouts feel good (although a little small) and I get feelings of nostalgia because it reminds me of games like Ocarina of Time and Majora's mask. I'm pretty sure i've seen some things that are directly made in honor of said games even. I also like the party system and being able to tele to party leader. Lot's more but ill stop here.\n\nObviously there is still a lot to work on. UI feels chaotic sometimes when switching tabs. Climbing is a janky and frustrating at times. Some classes don't have any subclasses or have very little. A lot more early game content which tracks. Don't let the quirky and clearly biased physics pursuade you away. They give more life to the characters and you can  have any shape and size. \n\nFinal Score for EA: 7/10\n\nPotential Score after EA: 10/10\n\nReview Made on 11/29/2025\n\nSUBJECT TO RE-EVALUTATION AFTER EA",

      "review": "Listen, I don't give this game a thumbs down lightly. It's definitely a labor of love and I can see it being amazing in a years time, with some significant changes/additions.\n\nFirst off, the good.\n- The retro graphics are adorable and I love them.\n- The melee combat is fluid and fun.\n- The MMO feel of the different zones feels like I'm playing FF11 again. I lived that game for its hardcore nature.\n- This game does NOT hold your hand, and in some aspects, that's amazing. Mainly the boss battles. They're hard and that makes them feel rewarding when you finally overcome them.\n- Character customization:\n     - Booba.\n     - Kaboosa.\n- RPG stats! I love me some RPG stat mechanics!\n- Skills seem cool, but I wasn't far enough in the game to see enough to make a complete opinion.\n- IT'S ONLY $5?!? That's cheap as hell!!\n\nThe bad.\n- The music is not great. I'm sorry but it's like rubbing two bricks together next to my ear... I would suggest the developers look at the soundtrack for FF11 and go off of their example.\n- The beginning of the game is ROUGH. I honestly wanted to quit during the first 30-60 minutes because it felt, empty, if that makes sense. The only thing I can suggest for this is a more populated starting zone. This will more than likely improve over time, but right now it feels hollow.\n- The ranged combat, specifically the magic, is bad. As an example, you aim at an enemy and use the icicle spell, it's probably going to miss 75% of the icicles that spawn if you move too much or if the enemy moves too much. What appears to be happening is the spell is targeting the initial starting point for the spell and even if you move the cursor, they're going to go wherever you initially started the spell. I would love to see two revisions to this. Either make the spells follow the cursor more fluidly or do what FF11 does or even the Dark Souls games and give the player a lock-on mechanic.\n- The mining and fishing are BORING. Like PAINFULLY so. I would love to see some kind of mini game added to both. More visual feedback in general would be nice. When you mine, the rock or ore doesn't react to your hits. Honestly I didn't even realize I was actually mining anything when I was because it's just a static standstill and hit this thing over and over until it disappears. No chipping away at the actual model of the rock or ore, nothing. You have this amazing action camera style for your game and combat, use it for the mining! Make it like Fortnite where you have to actively hit glowing nodes while you mine or something. For the fishing... Wow. I was bored out of my mind. A mini game where you actually have to fight to reel in the fish would be nice or something. And please don't make it just a simple quick time event mechanic... That would be lame. I want to feel like I'm battling the fish not simply cast and reel over and over again.\n- WHY CANT I TAKE MORE THAN 5 QUESTS AT A TIME?!? It's such an arbitrary thing, but it's aggravating. ESPECIALLY when 75% of the quests are repeatables where you go here and kill 30 of these things, over and over and over again. Maybe make it so you can only have 5 MAIN quests but unlimited repeatables or something??\n- The drops, at least in the 2.5 hours I played with my friends were butt. It kind of sucks when you spend an hour grinding a extremely hard boss just for it to drop a weapon or item that I don't want or can't use properly because of my class or stat distribution. I mean, technically every character can use every weapon however when I put literally EVERY single point I have in mind, giving me a friggin bow is just going to piss me off. Maybe make the drops lean towards the players favored stat or something??\n- Proper skill trees for the class / race you pick would do a lot help the games feel of progression. I shouldn't have to hoard my skill points and wait for a book to drop for a spell I need. And no, I will not be putting a skill point into \"Throw Rock\" I'm a friggin mage! Why is that even an option?? \n\nTLDR: The game has charm but is ROUGH in its current state. I would wait for more updates to polish some major mechanics and/or systems.",

      "review": "It's known for being a cute, albeit slightly limited, character creator. However, the major visual and functional accessibility issues prevent it from being playable extensively. Bosses in dungeons are prone to using shaders (specifically shaders for ice/water attacks that make heavy use of translucency) that are visually difficult to understand for those with perception issues making their attacks difficult to gauge distance. You cannot assign multiple keys to an action (I have dexterity issues so I need to use macros to assign keys to my mouse in other games which this game does not allow) making the quick action bar functionally useless without incurring hand pain.\n\nHitboxes do not seem to be aligned in some cases, or are much, much too wide. For example, one of the bosses in the Fortress, a giant boar with an elemental multi-cannon, has a damaging hitbox that is so wide that unless I, playing a ranged Mind character, stand far enough away for my spells to be out of range, will constantly take damage. This same boss will launch beam attacks directly in front of it, yet standing either behind it or to the side will still cause damage to the player. Attacks will regularly go through pillars or the environment (walls, doors) as if there is no sense of proper collision detection from launched particles. This is something that can be easily fixed in-engine yet is not, for some reason.\n\nThere are also limits and UI choices that make no sense. I learned far too late that there is a limit to the amount of spells a character can learn (ridiculous for a caster), or that received level-up stat bonuses stop counting after a while until some arbitrary criteria kicks in making them count again, or that you have to manually drag every item from your inventory into storage. Many little quirks that stack up to a clunky experience in a death-by-a-thousand-paper-cuts sort of way.\n\nThe game is definitely currently tailored for those with extensive reflex ability and for those that do not have depth perception issues, which is deeply upsetting. Additionally, when playing in-party, the host can't seem to do a whole lot with the console either. Normally one could say \"just use mods\" (despite the mods available all being related to furthering character customization, both safe and not safe for work) however it should be the developers' focus to fix these things.\n\nDespite the visibility issues of the first few bosses, the initial experience of the game has received decent polish and the style, world setting, characters and lore is charming. However the level 20+ experience leaves much to be desired still and the experience as a whole demands further testing-before-release and further polish.",

I -am- aware it's early access, and normally I don't write a review while a playthrough is unfinished, but after reviewing the images and videos on the store page, I honestly think I've seen all Atylss has to offer at this time. But enough of that, let's dive into why I feel this way:\n\nPros:\n• Controls are insanely fluid. I rarely get stuck on the environment, parry timing isn't punishing or clunky\n• Cute art style!\n• Character creation gives you tons of options to work with, multiple races and what everyone seems to be here for: sliders.\n\n...And sadly that's about where the good ends for this game.\n\nCons:\n• It's a grindfest. Almost every quest is a kill X amount of Y enemies and MAYBE bring me their Z drops.\n• The enemies and progression are boring. At level 5 I was sent to go battle hogs. Now at level 17 I'm still battling hogs. They're bigger, they're angrier, but it's same exact combat loop.\n• Isolated environment. Every zone is a slice of the world with 1, maybe 2 types of enemies in it.\n• Copy-Paste Worldbuilding. You're going to see the same art assets over, and over, and over.  Exploration isn't rewarding (yay a random chest?), and the disjointed nature of teleporting from micro-area to micro-area just makes it feel claustraphobic.\n• Combat is tedious. I could summarize the gameplay experience as holding down LMB until you need to click RMB to block/parry. That's it. Sure you get spells, but you're overlapping them on CD with your auto attacks. It's all just damage damage damage. Doesn't matter if its flavored Mind or Dex or Strength, it's just recolors of the same formula.\n• Dungeons suffer from the same repetition as the above. It's going from one room/arena to the next, with a toggleable difficulty (based off level (yay bigger numbers! monkey brain go brrt)), and the same rehashed enemies.\n\nAtylss has the bones of something great, but it's buried beneath tedium and lack of creativity. Nothing about it screams innovative, or inspired. It's just... cute with sliders that appeal to a hornier audience at the same time. If as much work was put into the jiggle bones on boobs and butts as was put into the game play, I can only imagine how much better this game could be.\n\nI haven't 'finished' (100% achievements) the game yet, and unsure if I will with this game because of how repetitive it is, but I'm holding hope the devs do more with it. I want to see new enemies, new move sets, gain new powers that aren't just DO BIGGER DAMAGE. This isn't an rpg, and it's hardly a 'game', so much as an unpolished proof of concept. As it stands, Atylss is, and overwhelmingly supported by the comments here, furry bait with grindy adventure gameplay. \n\nAnd that's coming from a furry.\n\nI plan to play more in hopes there's more to this title, but as of right now? Not holding my breath, and neither should you. Will update this review if anything changes.",

      "review": "Listen, I don't give this game a thumbs down lightly. It's definitely a labor of love and I can see it being amazing in a years time, with some significant changes/additions.\n\nFirst off, the good.\n- The retro graphics are adorable and I love them.\n- The melee combat is fluid and fun.\n- The MMO feel of the different zones feels like I'm playing FF11 again. I lived that game for its hardcore nature.\n- This game does NOT hold your hand, and in some aspects, that's amazing. Mainly the boss battles. They're hard and that makes them feel rewarding when you finally overcome them.\n- Character customization:\n     - Booba.\n     - Kaboosa.\n- RPG stats! I love me some RPG stat mechanics!\n- Skills seem cool, but I wasn't far enough in the game to see enough to make a complete opinion.\n- IT'S ONLY $5?!? That's cheap as hell!!\n\nThe bad.\n- The music is not great. I'm sorry but it's like rubbing two bricks together next to my ear... I would suggest the developers look at the soundtrack for FF11 and go off of their example.\n- The beginning of the game is ROUGH. I honestly wanted to quit during the first 30-60 minutes because it felt, empty, if that makes sense. The only thing I can suggest for this is a more populated starting zone. This will more than likely improve over time, but right now it feels hollow.\n- The ranged combat, specifically the magic, is bad. As an example, you aim at an enemy and use the icicle spell, it's probably going to miss 75% of the icicles that spawn if you move too much or if the enemy moves too much. What appears to be happening is the spell is targeting the initial starting point for the spell and even if you move the cursor, they're going to go wherever you initially started the spell. I would love to see two revisions to this. Either make the spells follow the cursor more fluidly or do what FF11 does or even the Dark Souls games and give the player a lock-on mechanic.\n- The mining and fishing are BORING. Like PAINFULLY so. I would love to see some kind of mini game added to both. More visual feedback in general would be nice. When you mine, the rock or ore doesn't react to your hits. Honestly I didn't even realize I was actually mining anything when I was because it's just a static standstill and hit this thing over and over until it disappears. No chipping away at the actual model of the rock or ore, nothing. You have this amazing action camera style for your game and combat, use it for the mining! Make it like Fortnite where you have to actively hit glowing nodes while you mine or something. For the fishing... Wow. I was bored out of my mind. A mini game where you actually have to fight to reel in the fish would be nice or something. And please don't make it just a simple quick time event mechanic... That would be lame. I want to feel like I'm battling the fish not simply cast and reel over and over again.\n- WHY CANT I TAKE MORE THAN 5 QUESTS AT A TIME?!? It's such an arbitrary thing, but it's aggravating. ESPECIALLY when 75% of the quests are repeatables where you go here and kill 30 of these things, over and over and over again. Maybe make it so you can only have 5 MAIN quests but unlimited repeatables or something??\n- The drops, at least in the 2.5 hours I played with my friends were butt. It kind of sucks when you spend an hour grinding a extremely hard boss just for it to drop a weapon or item that I don't want or can't use properly because of my class or stat distribution. I mean, technically every character can use every weapon however when I put literally EVERY single point I have in mind, giving me a friggin bow is just going to piss me off. Maybe make the drops lean towards the players favored stat or something??\n- Proper skill trees for the class / race you pick would do a lot help the games feel of progression. I shouldn't have to hoard my skill points and wait for a book to drop for a spell I need. And no, I will not be putting a skill point into \"Throw Rock\" I'm a friggin mage! Why is that even an option?? \n\nTLDR: The game has charm but is ROUGH in its current state. I would wait for more updates to polish some major mechanics and/or systems.",

      "review": "It's known for being a cute, albeit slightly limited, character creator. However, the major visual and functional accessibility issues prevent it from being playable extensively. Bosses in dungeons are prone to using shaders (specifically shaders for ice/water attacks that make heavy use of translucency) that are visually difficult to understand for those with perception issues making their attacks difficult to gauge distance. You cannot assign multiple keys to an action (I have dexterity issues so I need to use macros to assign keys to my mouse in other games which this game does not allow) making the quick action bar functionally useless without incurring hand pain.\n\nHitboxes do not seem to be aligned in some cases, or are much, much too wide. For example, one of the bosses in the Fortress, a giant boar with an elemental multi-cannon, has a damaging hitbox that is so wide that unless I, playing a ranged Mind character, stand far enough away for my spells to be out of range, will constantly take damage. This same boss will launch beam attacks directly in front of it, yet standing either behind it or to the side will still cause damage to the player. Attacks will regularly go through pillars or the environment (walls, doors) as if there is no sense of proper collision detection from launched particles. This is something that can be easily fixed in-engine yet is not, for some reason.\n\nThere are also limits and UI choices that make no sense. I learned far too late that there is a limit to the amount of spells a character can learn (ridiculous for a caster), or that received level-up stat bonuses stop counting after a while until some arbitrary criteria kicks in making them count again, or that you have to manually drag every item from your inventory into storage. Many little quirks that stack up to a clunky experience in a death-by-a-thousand-paper-cuts sort of way.\n\nThe game is definitely currently tailored for those with extensive reflex ability and for those that do not have depth perception issues, which is deeply upsetting. Additionally, when playing in-party, the host can't seem to do a whole lot with the console either. Normally one could say \"just use mods\" (despite the mods available all being related to furthering character customization, both safe and not safe for work) however it should be the developers' focus to fix these things.\n\nDespite the visibility issues of the first few bosses, the initial experience of the game has received decent polish and the style, world setting, characters and lore is charming. However the level 20+ experience leaves much to be desired still and the experience as a whole demands further testing-before-release and further polish.",

Why is that even an option?? \n\nTLDR: The game has charm but is ROUGH in its current state. I would wait for more updates to polish some major mechanics and/or systems.",

      "review": "It's known for being a cute, albeit slightly limited, character creator. However, the major visual and functional accessibility issues prevent it from being playable extensively. Bosses in dungeons are prone to using shaders (specifically shaders for ice/water attacks that make heavy use of translucency) that are visually difficult to understand for those with perception issues making their attacks difficult to gauge distance. You cannot assign multiple keys to an action (I have dexterity issues so I need to use macros to assign keys to my mouse in other games which this game does not allow) making the quick action bar functionally useless without incurring hand pain.\n\nHitboxes do not seem to be aligned in some cases, or are much, much too wide. For example, one of the bosses in the Fortress, a giant boar with an elemental multi-cannon, has a damaging hitbox that is so wide that unless I, playing a ranged Mind character, stand far enough away for my spells to be out of range, will constantly take damage. This same boss will launch beam attacks directly in front of it, yet standing either behind it or to the side will still cause damage to the player. Attacks will regularly go through pillars or the environment (walls, doors) as if there is no sense of proper collision detection from launched particles. This is something that can be easily fixed in-engine yet is not, for some reason.\n\nThere are also limits and UI choices that make no sense. I learned far too late that there is a limit to the amount of spells a character can learn (ridiculous for a caster), or that received level-up stat bonuses stop counting after a while until some arbitrary criteria kicks in making them count again, or that you have to manually drag every item from your inventory into storage. Many little quirks that stack up to a clunky experience in a death-by-a-thousand-paper-cuts sort of way.\n\nThe game is definitely currently tailored for those with extensive reflex ability and for those that do not have depth perception issues, which is deeply upsetting. Additionally, when playing in-party, the host can't seem to do a whole lot with the console either. Normally one could say \"just use mods\" (despite the mods available all being related to furthering character customization, both safe and not safe for work) however it should be the developers' focus to fix these things.\n\nDespite the visibility issues of the first few bosses, the initial experience of the game has received decent polish and the style, world setting, characters and lore is charming. However the level 20+ experience leaves much to be desired still and the experience as a whole demands further testing-before-release and further polish.",

      "review": "If I hadn't received this game for free, I likely would have requested a refund. Even for $10 USD, Atylss is an uninspired, unfinished title. I -am- aware it's early access, and normally I don't write a review while a playthrough is unfinished, but after reviewing the images and videos on the store page, I honestly think I've seen all Atylss has to offer at this time. But enough of that, let's dive into why I feel this way:\n\nPros:\n• Controls are insanely fluid. I rarely get stuck on the environment, parry timing isn't punishing or clunky\n• Cute art style!\n• Character creation gives you tons of options to work with, multiple races and what everyone seems to be here for: sliders.\n\n...And sadly that's about where the good ends for this game.\n\nCons:\n• It's a grindfest. Almost every quest is a kill X amount of Y enemies and MAYBE bring me their Z drops.\n• The enemies and progression are boring. At level 5 I was sent to go battle hogs. Now at level 17 I'm still battling hogs. They're bigger, they're angrier, but it's same exact combat loop.\n• Isolated environment. Every zone is a slice of the world with 1, maybe 2 types of enemies in it.\n• Copy-Paste Worldbuilding. You're going to see the same art assets over, and over, and over.  Exploration isn't rewarding (yay a random chest?), and the disjointed nature of teleporting from micro-area to micro-area just makes it feel claustraphobic.\n• Combat is tedious. I could summarize the gameplay experience as holding down LMB until you need to click RMB to block/parry. That's it. Sure you get spells, but you're overlapping them on CD with your auto attacks. It's all just damage damage damage. Doesn't matter if its flavored Mind or Dex or Strength, it's just recolors of the same formula.\n• Dungeons suffer from the same repetition as the above. It's going from one room/arena to the next, with a toggleable difficulty (based off level (yay bigger numbers! monkey brain go brrt)), and the same rehashed enemies.\n\nAtylss has the bones of something great, but it's buried beneath tedium and lack of creativity. Nothing about it screams innovative, or inspired. It's just... cute with sliders that appeal to a hornier audience at the same time. If as much work was put into the jiggle bones on boobs and butts as was put into the game play, I can only imagine how much better this game could be.\n\nI haven't 'finished' (100% achievements) the game yet, and unsure if I will with this game because of how repetitive it is, but I'm holding hope the devs do more with it. I want to see new enemies, new move sets, gain new powers that aren't just DO BIGGER DAMAGE. This isn't an rpg, and it's hardly a 'game', so much as an unpolished proof of concept. As it stands, Atylss is, and overwhelmingly supported by the comments here, furry bait with grindy adventure gameplay. \n\nAnd that's coming from a furry.\n\nI plan to play more in hopes there's more to this title, but as of right now? Not holding my breath, and neither should you. Will update this review if anything changes.",

So not only can you never escape even early game enemies by running away, but if you do kill them you don't have time to loot and open your inventory before the same little enemies respawn and aggro\n\nSo where it's at now? Glad I got it for $8. But it just really can't hold my attention for long, and not without frustrating me.",

I think this is somewhat a problem against the backdrop of a novel world. There is no protection against harassment with this type of account / identity management. I was approved to begin making characters with a mysterious delay, which I do not know if it was an automated or manual approval.\n\nBecause of the \"lewd\" nature of some of the designs, but without an adult content warning or even filter for account management signup and approval, I cannot recommend the game at this time. The developer will need to implement a more robust identity management platform in which to be able to guarantee at least some semblance of safety from the more sexually inclined furry community.
