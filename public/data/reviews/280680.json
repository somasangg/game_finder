I can honestly say that Krita is the only program that I would ever recommend as a genuine replacement for photoshop, it has more blend modes, more filters, more default brushes, better quality default brushes, tons of photo editing and animation potential, and so much more. I have been using it for years and decided to buy it off steam in order to help fund the company and also to keep track of my hours just for fun. The fact that it doesnt charge you monthly AND its genuinely better quality than photoshop is mind boggling to me, I honestly feel the only reason people still use PS is because of its industry standard reputation, but I genuinely believe that after using both programs for more than a decade Krita has come a long way in its development and I can honestly consider it better than PS and PSCC at this point. They even have an option which allows you to set up your hotkeys to be similar to photoshop, for those who are switching over. Have fun!",

I just got the Steam version today to support the devs, they really deserve it. A strong art community that is defiantly anti-(generative)AI is important now more than ever, and I am happy to help support that however I can.\r\n\r\nKrita can be difficult to learn at first, but it becomes comfortable quickly (it's the first program I used when I moved to using a drawing tablet, so I had no prior experience!) and is an incredible tool for artists of any level and experience. It allows you to record speedpaints, create animations, or just make some regular ol artwork with an incredible array of brushes at your disposal! I've never had to download new brushes (yet, I might someday), since the base ones work great on their own.\r\n\r\nFor anyone else thinking of making the switch from a free version of Krita to the Steam version, know that all your settings and formats will be saved! Some UI may change, but Krita will carry over your brush folders, canvas layout, recent files, theme etc. so you don't have to redo your settings from scratch!\r\n\r\nAt least now I can rack up an ungodly amount of play hours and prove that I am addicted to making art >;)",

      "review": "Don't be fooled by the lack of playtime, I've used Krita for like 50 or 60 hours outside of Steam after 250+ hours using Clip Studio Paint. I usually won't bother with software on Steam because I prefer to use Steam just for games, but I bought it here to support the developers. This is not only a solid piece of drawing software, it's a competent Photoshop alternative for Linux as well (While alternatives like GIMP have remained the same for over a decade). I wanted to move to Krita for a while because Clip Studio was the thing keeping me stuck on Windows.\n\nHere's some positive things that I can say about Krita:\n[list]\n[*]It's actually cross-platform, iOS withstanding. Meaning you can use this on Windows, Mac, Android, AND Linux.\n[*]Surprisingly good plugin support, it's quite extendable thanks to it using Python.\n[*]An absurd and dizzying amount of blend modes.\n[*]Really good perspective tools (Although I hope for 4 point and 5 point perspective rulers to get added soon)\n[*]Two layer features I've found myself using to accelerate how I approach shading/rendering, those being clone layers and layer effects (that can be toggled or manipulated without destroying the layer). No art editing software other than Krita has clone layers, I use it to mask certain things (like highlights, bounce lighting, outline shading) out/in light, I use it for easy outline coloring (Put my color layers in a group, make a clone layer, and then clip it to my outlines). This is the closest you are getting to node-tier compositing like from Blender/Adobe After Effects in a piece of drawing software until Graphite matures.\n[*]It's easy to save your settings and put them in cloud storage with your brushes and other things, while Clip Studio and similar software makes this quite convoluted.\n[*]There's also a nice feature where you can color pick the color on a specific layer, or adjust the size of the color picker to a ridiculous size where it will give you the average color of a layer (this comes in handy paired with a fill layer in the color blend mode to have easy color correction on foreground objects).\n[/list]\n\nHow differently brushes are handled compared to Clip Studio's organization might throw some people off, but it's not that functionally different from Photoshop or Drawpile. Just mess around with the brushes, and favorite the ones you like.\n\nI do however have some criticism regarding how certain parts of the software are handled: \n[list]\n[*]Timelapses save a load of loose images (rather than storing them in a single compressed file).\n[*]You have to mangle around scripts and a separately installed ffmpeg to get GPU encoding working for the export, so videos export faster. Ideally, it would be nice if the software detected this for you.\n[*]The built-in reference feature not having a feature to have reference images follow where you are on the canvas.\n[*]Using a load of clone layers and layer effects makes the document much slower to load into (I doubt GPU acceleration is being used for this).\n[*]There's no document work timer feature like what Clip Studio has (No, the timer plugin is not the same, there is a elapsed work time for documents in the document properties, but this doesn't have any functionality exposed for plugins to read).\n[*]There's no mode that is optimized for touchscreens and smaller resolution tablet displays. I certainly miss how customizable Clip Studio's UI is, being able to put a load of dockers into tabs to clean up space, and if those other things get fixed, it would be fantastic.\n[*]Krita does not treat white the same as transparency in masks, so I had to make a group with a white fill layer background and black foreground, alongside clone layers and the \"erase\" blend mode to recreate the setup that I had in Clip Studio.\n[*]There's also no easy layer color modifier feature that can be accessed outside of the layer properties, which was a feature I used quite often for quickly adjusting the color of certain color layers in Clip Studio if I needed changes. That however, works similarly to a gradient map layer effect.\n[/list]\n\nRegarding plugins, I would recommend these plugins:\n[list]\n[*][url=https://krita-artists.org/t/composition-helper/14263]Composition Helper[/url]\n[*][url=https://krita-artists.org/t/plugin-blender-layer-live-3d-view-in-krita/63394]Blender Layer[/url]\n[*][url=https://github.com/Firstbober/krita-rpc]Krita RPC[/url] (For improved Discord Rich Presence)\n[*][url=https://krita-artists.org/t/pigment-o-plugin/4531]Pigment O[/url] (Basically a vastly improved and customizable color wheel that even gives you hex values for colors if you desire)\n[*][url=https://krita-artists.org/t/plugin-reference-tabs-docker/47732]Reference Tabs Docker[/url] (Which gives you a similar reference docker to Clip Studio or older versions of Krita)\n[*][url=https://krita-artists.org/t/touchify-plugin-tablet-touch-friendly-accessibility-more/74630]Touchify[/url] (This bundles a bunch of different UI related plugins together and generally makes the UI much cleaner to work with.\n[/list]\n\nIf you are coming from Clip Studio with the mannequin feature, use the Blender Layer plugin alongside VRoid Studio 1.26.0 (with the [url=https://github.com/xiaoye97/VRoidXYTool]VRoidXYTool[/url] plugin if you need to reference the proportions of character art), and the [url=https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/vrm/]VRM Import[/url] and [url=https://github.com/nanoskript/vrm-rigify]VRM Rigify[/url] plugins that are available online.

Also has nice support for drawing pads and has a nice context menu you can open with the stylus while drawing. \n\nI think its a great tool and I'm glad that this project exists when nearly every other software is asking for a monthly subscription fee.",

Tho check steam forums more if any issue arises honestly, (saying this because I was having a hard time installing UI modification but didnt work to no avail of figuring out what is wrong)",

I can honestly say that Krita is the only program that I would ever recommend as a genuine replacement for photoshop, it has more blend modes, more filters, more default brushes, better quality default brushes, tons of photo editing and animation potential, and so much more. I have been using it for years and decided to buy it off steam in order to help fund the company and also to keep track of my hours just for fun. The fact that it doesnt charge you monthly AND its genuinely better quality than photoshop is mind boggling to me, I honestly feel the only reason people still use PS is because of its industry standard reputation, but I genuinely believe that after using both programs for more than a decade Krita has come a long way in its development and I can honestly consider it better than PS and PSCC at this point. They even have an option which allows you to set up your hotkeys to be similar to photoshop, for those who are switching over. Have fun!",

I just got the Steam version today to support the devs, they really deserve it. A strong art community that is defiantly anti-(generative)AI is important now more than ever, and I am happy to help support that however I can.\r\n\r\nKrita can be difficult to learn at first, but it becomes comfortable quickly (it's the first program I used when I moved to using a drawing tablet, so I had no prior experience!) and is an incredible tool for artists of any level and experience. It allows you to record speedpaints, create animations, or just make some regular ol artwork with an incredible array of brushes at your disposal! I've never had to download new brushes (yet, I might someday), since the base ones work great on their own.\r\n\r\nFor anyone else thinking of making the switch from a free version of Krita to the Steam version, know that all your settings and formats will be saved! Some UI may change, but Krita will carry over your brush folders, canvas layout, recent files, theme etc. so you don't have to redo your settings from scratch!\r\n\r\nAt least now I can rack up an ungodly amount of play hours and prove that I am addicted to making art >;)",
