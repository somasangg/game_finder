Only gripe is the gameplay felt too repetitive and some forced side quests I didn’t like. If you want a compelling story in the crime/thriller genre, this is a must play.\nSolid 9/10 for the story alone.",

My only issue is pacing, can be a bit slow at times, between the 100 episode length cutscenes and running around doing side quests, the urgency of the main quest does shine through but thats a good thing as well.

Most characters are complex and well thought.\r\nThe story is a gem and this game has to be played at least once if you're a fan of the studio. \r\nMini games are fun. I especially liked the VR mini game. I liked quite a lot the side cases too. \r\n\r\nBut : \r\n- You have to do mini games in order to access certain things in the game. (even for the main story) \r\n- There is not enough time to defeat all four Keihin gang bosses in one go.\r\n- Drone races were okay at best and the fact that you have a health bar during races and you get disqualified when it depletes wasn't a fun experience for me.\r\n- I would have liked to earn money faster. (The possibility to sell extracts to the pawn shop would have been a plus to earn money faster, for example)\r\n\r\nOverall, it's an amazing game. Try it if you're already a fan of RGG. If you're new to the RGG studio games, I'd suggest to start with Like A Dragon then play this game.",

Played Yakuza 0-8 and then started this, great game and I would recommend it over Yakuza IF you're looking for a more edgy and darker story with 0-6 gameplay, Yakuza offers edgy stuffs sometimes but they take a few more steps forward in that regard with Judgment, otherwise its just more dragon engine gameplay but with improved combat, still on the easy side though because its on dragon engine. Great thing to compliment people who completed 0-6 and want more of that, people who started/only played 7-8 probably would have a harder time getting into this entry however.",

I ran into it twice and even with auto save I got set further back than I’d have liked, but redoing the sections did not take that long. However, this should not be an issue, so I recommend a sale only.\n\nI’m glad I hit the streets of Kamurocho once again, I’ve taken a break from the Yakuza games, longer than I should have, but I binged 3-6 on ’22! So, this different approach to Kamurocho was a great way to start playing again, the district still feels like a 2nd home to me lol.\n\nAs with the other entries to the Yakuza series, there are things I like and dislike. One is the key ring system, I understand if there was a time limit or something, but picking out a key is not fun just to do it. The second is kind of multiple things meshed together, but the big part is mortal wounds. This mechanic would not be so bad if it was not a pain to cure, only one place on the map to cure and pick up portable cures, and if guns did not inflict it. Once you get far enough in the game, some thugs will be packing a pistol, I can’t tell you how many times  I’ve been shot trying to get to the gunman first.",

I will say I do think it is impossible to guess where it goes which great for a plot twist but does dull the fun of a detective story. Which while this is a detective story in a lot of parts or at least thats the themeing it may be closer to a actoin thriller with clear clear Jackie Chan stlye influnce. \r\n\r\n Honestly I recommend everyone play this game at least once in their lifes it is a master class.\r\n\r\n Even learned about Alzhemirers",

      "review": "[b]Review by [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33369540-Abrix/]Abrix\n Gaming[/url] – 4K quality gameplay reviews and recommendations.[/b]\n\n[b]Judgment – A Gritty Detective Thriller with Heart, Style, and the Soul of the Yakuza Series[/b]\n\n[i] A Special Thanks To My Friend Mute For Gifting This Game [/i]\n\n[i]Judgment[/i] takes the foundation of the beloved Yakuza franchise and reinvents it into a gripping, grounded noir-style legal drama — one that combines intense action, emotional storytelling, investigative gameplay, and moral complexity without losing the series’ signature style and charm. It’s one of the finest crime stories RGG Studio has ever delivered.\n\nAt the center of the narrative stands Takayuki Yagami — a former lawyer turned private detective haunted by one devastating case. His search for redemption becomes the emotional backbone of the story. What starts as a murder investigation spirals into conspiracies that link powerful corporations, the legal system, organized crime, and personal trauma. Yagami isn’t a fighter because he wants to be — he’s a fighter because the truth demands it.\n\nThe supporting cast is exceptional. Kaito serves as both muscle and emotional anchor, bringing loyalty, warmth, and surprising depth. Antagonists are layered and human, driven by ideology rather than cartoonish evil. Every character — allies and enemies — has purpose, weight, and believable motivations. The longer the mystery unravels, the more you realize there are no easy answers, and morality is never black and white.\n\nCombat is fluid and exhilarating thanks to Yagami’s martial arts-based fighting styles. Switching between Crane and Tiger styles mid-battle gives every encounter flexibility and identity — crowds can be dispatched with sweeping acrobatics while tough opponents demand precise, powerful strikes. Heat actions are fast, stylish, and painful in the best way possible, and boss fights feel personal and cinematic.\n\nWhat truly sets [i]Judgment[/i] apart is its investigative gameplay. Chasing suspects across rooftops, examining crime scenes, tailing targets, interrogating witnesses, and piecing together evidence through logic and intuition makes the player feel like a detective rather than just a fighter. It blends beautifully with the drama, never feeling gimmicky or forced.\n\nOf course, this is still RGG Studio — the world is overflowing with personality. Kamurocho returns in all its neon glory, filled with arcade games, restaurants, Romance of the Three Kingdoms club management, gambling dens, drones, darts, girlfriend relationships, and some of the funniest and most heartfelt side cases ever written. One moment you'll be cracking an impossible murder case; the next you'll be helping a shut-in overcome social fears or dealing with an actor stuck in method acting mode. It’s chaotic, warm, and endlessly rewarding.\n\nVisually and cinematically, [i]Judgment[/i] stands tall. The Dragon Engine brings gritty atmosphere to every street and alley, but the real magic lies in the direction — intense close-ups, emotional monologues, courtroom confrontations, and brooding rain-covered scenes that hit harder than most movies. The soundtrack mixes dark detective tones with high-energy battle themes and emotional orchestral pieces that amplify every major moment.\n\n[i]Judgment[/i] is a masterpiece — a legal thriller, a character drama, and an action brawler fused into one unforgettable experience. It carries the spirit of Yakuza while forging its own identity, delivering tension, humor, action, mystery, and heart at a level few games can match.\n\nTakayuki Yagami isn’t just trying to solve a case — he’s trying to prove that justice still matters in a world determined to bury the truth. And watching him fight for that truth is nothing short of incredible.\n\nYou can check my gameplay video [b][url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxvWbrDkSJsAhHOqFl8LqiG8l0NGEnNAX]here[/url][/b]\n\nSubscribe To My Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1ZOvQERjGtRkl7ImTcDzdw?sub_confirmation=1\nJoin My Discord - https://discord.gg/uM94ehT7hv",

You play as Takayuki Yagami, a lawyer turned private investigator, unraveling a dark murder case in the heart of Kamurochō. The story is gripping from start to finish, filled with twists, great performances, and cinematic cutscenes.\n\nThe combat feels smooth and stylish, with two fighting styles to switch between, and the side content — from quirky cases to mini-games — keeps things entertaining for hours. The PC version runs great, offering stable performance and crisp visuals.\n\nSome detective mechanics (like tailing and clue searching) are pretty basic, but they don’t ruin the experience. If you loved the Yakuza series or just want a great story-driven action game, Judgment absolutely delivers.\n\nVerdict: Stylish, story-rich, and full of heart.\nScore: 8.5/10",

      "review": "Didn't expect much from this series, since I didn't really hear anything good about it aside from some youtube brainrot content. I also wasn't realy thrilled with a new LaD protagonist, so I really thought that it's going to take only a few hours before it would bore me to death. On the grand scheme of things it seemed like yet another Yakuza game - 3rd person brawler that takes place in Kamurocho in requires you to chug Staminians. However...\r\n  First of all - Kamurocho. The city didn't exactly change, it wasn't mowed down and rebuilt from ground up, but the sheer amount of new details brings exactly enough for it to feel lot fresher. Additional courtyards and narrow passages between the building that you can actually traverse now, multi-storey buildings that aren't just empty lifeless husks - it all feels really great.\r\n  Second of all - there are quite a lot of new and revamped old mechanics. Even though sometimes they can overstay it's welcome (like fifth in a row tailing for the last hour) or straight up questionable (extracts? do I have to use them? is the game balanced around them?), it's really nice to see that RGG understands its playerbase sometimes - imagine chases that don't suck? Yeah, it's right there.\r\n  The characters are simply remarkable, they're not just some leeches on Yakuza's legacy - they are in the league of their own and they're not any less cool than a band of OGs. I didn't miss Kiryu or the friendly cyclops through the whole playthrough and it is a huge quality mark in my eyes.\r\n   Lastly, the combat. I would love to say that you have 2 styles here, alas, tha't not the case. RGG forgot to make abilities for the Crane style, so the Tiger outshines it very quickly. The Tiger style also plays different from what I got used to in Yakuza, it's pretty refreshing, though takes some time to understand how to use it efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, with all that being said, the game's not flawless.\r\nFor example, the combat system has a horrible disease - Kiwami 2 syndrome. It wasn't fun in Kiwami 2 to have your strikes bounce off of enemies, it's not fun here either. It becomes worse the more 'elite' an enemy is, with bosses being the worst offenders. I didn't have a lot of trouble fighting big boys, probably because I cheesed the worst fights with a Tiger Drop, but still - they're doable, just mostly unfun and annoying.\r\nOr as another example - a lot of upgradable abilities are hidden behind skill books that you need to find during some of the missions. They are easily missable, and even though they can be bought from an underground trader for a hefty sum of upgrade points, he's not open from the very beginning and you don't really know at what moment you should go and check his assortment. Coupled with abysmal amount of upgrade points you actually receives from random fights and side cases, some of them will never be unlocked. And i'm not talking about some fancy stuff - basic vital stuff such as re-guard and double quickstep is locked away behind 'You need to find a book, idk when or where, just find it man'. It's stupid and I hate it.\r\nYou can find a lot more to mald about, but still, it's not that bad, the game is very enjoyable, and the story is good enough to grab you by your cockles and make you dump more and more time into it. I'm overall happy that the series did make it's way to PCs, and if your life is ruined by the Yakuza series as my - you should be happy too.",

Very familiar gameplay if you have played those, but it has its own vibe and a unique detective mystery type story, with a cool MC. Great English AND Japanese voice acting. Feels like a movie with hundreds of hours of gameplay interspliced. Combat is flashy and cool as hell with a ton of moves to learn and utilize. Only two fighting styles though.

      "review": "Very good game. I've read people complain about the tailing missions and the mortal wound mechanic. I actually didn't mind those at all. As simple as the tailing missions are I thought they were fine and helped me LARP as a detective. The mortal wound mechanic is completely fine. The strong attacks are pretty easy to avoid so I didn't find it annoying at all. If anything it made the combat have a bit more stakes than the usual Yakuza combat, so you could even say I liked it. The game has incredibly strong side content, some of the best RGG has crafted and it was my favorite part of the game. I find Yagami to be a pretty dull character but I did like the side characters. The combat system is very fun but for me the biggest and pretty much only complaint I have with the game is there is too much combat. The enemy spawn rate is ridiculous, the highest out of any Yakuza game. Most of the game you're either fighting or running away from the enemies because you're tired of fighting all the time. They seriously should have turned the enemy spawns down, it doesn't make any sense that as a detective I'm doing more fighting than I'm doing in the Yakuza games. I would have liked a bit more of the detective LARP stuff. Because in the end there isn't that much of it and the game just turns into a Yakuza game where you are beating up thugs. Anyway, great game and I'm looking forward to playing the sequel.",

      "review": "Judgment, developed by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and published by SEGA, is a compelling and stylish action-adventure game that masterfully blends intense detective storytelling with exhilarating combat and open-world exploration. Set in the vibrant yet seedy district of Kamurocho, Tokyo—a fictionalized version of Kabukicho known for its nightlife and criminal underbelly—Judgment takes players on a gripping journey filled with twists, emotional depth, and a captivating cast of characters. As a spin-off from the acclaimed Yakuza series, it both honors and expands upon the studio’s signature formula, offering something fresh and accessible even for newcomers.\n\nThe game centers around Takayuki Yagami, a former defense attorney turned private investigator, who finds himself embroiled in a complex murder case that threatens to unravel the fragile peace of Kamurocho. Unlike the larger-than-life protagonists of traditional crime dramas, Yagami is portrayed with nuance—gritty, smart, and deeply human. His pursuit of truth is driven by a strong sense of justice but also by personal demons and a desire for redemption. This narrative foundation grounds the game’s more sensational elements, creating a story that balances drama, intrigue, and moments of levity with great skill.\n\nOne of Judgment’s greatest strengths lies in its storytelling. The plot unfolds through detailed investigations, intense interrogations, and cinematic cutscenes that rival those of high-quality TV dramas or movies. Players must gather evidence, question suspects, and follow leads, turning the game into a detective experience that goes beyond standard action tropes. These investigative sequences are thoughtfully designed, requiring observation, logical thinking, and sometimes creative problem-solving. The writing is sharp and engaging, with a strong supporting cast that brings Kamurocho’s world to life, including colorful side characters and quirky subplots that add depth and humor without detracting from the main story.\n\nCombat in Judgment is fast-paced and satisfying, borrowing heavily from the Yakuza series but with unique twists to suit Yagami’s fighting style. Players can switch between two fighting styles on the fly: the balanced Crane Style and the powerful Tiger Style, each offering different moves and strategic options. The combat system is accessible yet deep, rewarding well-timed counters, combos, and environmental interactions like throwing objects or using the environment to gain an advantage. Boss fights and street brawls feel intense and cinematic, providing a welcome break from the investigative pacing. The game also introduces the \"EX Actions\"—context-sensitive moves that add flair and impact to battles, making every encounter feel dynamic and satisfying.\n\nExploration of Kamurocho is a major part of the experience, and Judgment delivers a dense, lively open world filled with activities and secrets. Beyond the main storyline, players can engage in various side missions that often feature their own mini-stories, blending humor, drama, and oddball characters that enrich the world-building. From karaoke bars and arcades to bowling alleys and underground fight clubs, the game offers a wide range of diversions that reflect the cultural backdrop of Tokyo nightlife. This attention to detail and variety ensures that Kamurocho feels like a living, breathing city rather than just a backdrop for action.\n\nVisually, Judgment impresses with its highly detailed character models, realistic lighting, and richly textured environments. The neon-lit streets and crowded alleyways come alive with atmospheric effects and a bustling NPC population, enhancing immersion. The game runs smoothly on PC with minimal technical issues, and the localization is well done, capturing the spirit of the original Japanese dialogue with voice acting that adds authenticity and emotion.\n\nDespite its many strengths, Judgment is not without minor flaws. Some investigation sequences can feel repetitive or slow-paced for players more interested in action, and the camera can occasionally become unwieldy in tight combat situations. The game’s difficulty curve can also be uneven, with some battles feeling challenging while others are relatively easy. However, these issues are generally minor and do not detract significantly from the overall experience.\n\nIn summary, Judgment is a standout title that successfully blends crime thriller narrative, detective gameplay, and intense action in a richly detailed open world. It offers an engaging and emotionally resonant story that explores themes of justice, morality, and redemption, anchored by a memorable protagonist and a vibrant setting. For fans of narrative-driven games and those who enjoy a mix of investigation and combat, Judgment is a deeply satisfying and polished experience that showcases Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio’s storytelling prowess beyond the Yakuza series. It’s a must-play for anyone interested in a mature, well-crafted crime drama with plenty of heart and grit.\n\nRating: 10/10",

      "review": "This is one of those games that actually warrants extra disclaimers before showing the title. It makes you think, \"wait, is this actually happening IRL right now right now?\" just because of how feasible some in-game events are. The JP title \"Judge Eyes\", as awkward as it may be in English, is a perfect description of the game as a whole because as the main character Yagami, you're the one witnessing important events, gathering as much information as humanly possible, and (accurately) judging the truth for yourself. You will see that in the courtroom, you need to assert the truth often.\r\n\r\nI'd personally say that the setting/framing (not just the location!) is as captivating as Yakuza 0's while at the same time being rather far away from a Yakuza game. Characters weave in and out of the story and gameplay quite naturally, which I would say is this game's greatest strength. I would even go so far to say that the writers achieve their best successes when they're not weighed down by previous games.\r\n\r\nOverall thoughts:\r\n~Gameplay can be a little awkward in the beginning but smoother towards the mid-end game. Sometimes you may run into the issue of doing a full combo string in the opposite direction of the enemy. Otherwise very fun and interesting. Ramming bicycles into bad guys never gets old.\r\n+Excellent story. Side missions (side cases) with their lightheartedness often feel out of place in comparison to the very serious and dark main story, but they don't degrade the overall experience too much.\r\n+The cycle of looping between turning off your brain for button mashing gameplay and turning on your brain to think about detective cases is quite satisfying.\r\n~(Minor nitpick) Some people may be upset with how the lady characters advance the plot or how a few of the guy characters talk to ladies. If I reveal what happens that would be spoiler territory. I'm not talking like fanservice but more stereotype stuff. I'm not upset myself per se but it's enough for me to caution other people if they're interested in trying out this game.",

One is the key ring system, I understand if there was a time limit or something, but picking out a key is not fun just to do it. The second is kind of multiple things meshed together, but the big part is mortal wounds. This mechanic would not be so bad if it was not a pain to cure, only one place on the map to cure and pick up portable cures, and if guns did not inflict it.

Interspersing your time with small side distractions and eccentric narratives that ultimately celebrate Japanese subcultures.\n\nAll the pieces are here, with the series’ trademark quality on full display—and in all its limitations.\n\nCombat, as always, brings excellent animations, highly impactful and satisfying to watch, but, as always, still has a very low skill ceiling and boils down to button-mashing and abusing the band-aids they added to [i]make it look fair[/i], because they still haven’t managed to design combat that doesn’t feel sloppy and immensely inconsistent.\n\nThat old joke about the combat basically being slapping people around while chugging energy drinks on an industrial scale to recover your health? Yes, it's still the same thing.\n\nI’ve been trying to find a video of a skilled player demonstrating the potential of these systems in an elegant and satisfying way to watch, but I never do. It’s always a mess of rules that don’t work properly and unpredictable results.\n\nAt least they finally added a shortcut to use items. Innovation.\n\nThe elements added to differentiate this spin-off from the rest of the franchise—an attempt to sell the idea that you’re an investigator—are frankly pitiful.\n\nInterrogation or simple conversation sequences where they pretend they’re giving you dialogue choices, when in reality all the options are correct or there’s simply no relevant penalty (when there is one at all) for choosing the wrong one.\n\nUsing your phone camera to identify points of interest that the game essentially points out for you. \n\nUsing a drone to identify points of interest, [i]but this time[/i] in higher areas!\n\nTailing NPCs.\n\nLockpicking minigames…\n\nIt’s the laziest effort you could find to pretend you’re getting something resembling actual gameplay. A sketch of an idea that would only make sense in something experimental from the PS2 era, when the franchise was still young and had nothing to compare itself to.\n\nFor a franchise that loves padding itself with irrelevant tasks, this feels like a terrible case of [i]Ubisoftitis[/i].\n\nThe city is more interconnected than ever and impresses at first glance, as always, but it quickly becomes just a repetitive sequence of corridors while you zigzag from one point to another to simply watch cutscenes—while occasionally, once again to pretend there’s some gameplay between scenes, your path is interrupted by generic enemies attacking you randomly in the street.\n\nIt’s just so… bad.

      "review": "I honestly cannot see why people recommend this game. So far, I'm on Chapter 2 (My time is only 16 hours because I have a bad habit of keeping games open when I'm not playing them.) and already stuff like lockpicking and tailing missions just take the wind out of you. I get it, they tried something new. But just because you can doesn't mean you should, and this game is a great example of that. Also, the waiting for simple phone calls makes this even MORE of a slog than it already was. And the combat is hyper janky for no reason. Keep in mind, I have played every Yakuza game on Steam (at the time of this review, I'm aware Kiwami 3 is coming out) before this and LJ, so I have a pretty good idea on the other combat styles from the previous games I played. Not only that, the \"stuffing side quests down your throat\" is way more impeding that you'd think, and it's much of the same issue I had with Ishin Kiwami, where every corner you turned in that game, you'd be dragged into a side quest. I can't say for certain if it's as bad AS IK, but I can certainly hope not. Also, locking half the skill tree behind QR codes and skill books doesn't make the game harder. Just way more annoying. There's a reason why only SOME skills are locked behind that stuff in other games, save for the entirety of Dragon in Kiwami. If you REALLY have to play this game, get it on a very low sale. Otherwise, don't bother.\n\nEdit: I'm going to revise this review. Not because I change my mind... but because I vastly underestimated this game in terms of shittiness. I'll continue to play only because I want to beat every Yakuza game, but I'm not impressed. Doubling down, the side cases this game shoves down your throat... are some of the most bland and boring garbage I've ever seen. It's like RGG wanted to pad out the game time, but couldn't think of anything interesting. Substories are generally goofy, but these are not only so annoying when they crop up, they're not even charming or goofy. They add nothing to the story and feel like last-minute decisions. At least with Ishin, you have the option to not take part of the substories. Here? Fuck you, go solve a \"mystery\" on who ate your former co-worker's cake, only for it to be nobody because everyone in the room has room temperature IQ, and thus wasting everyone's time including the player's. There's even a side case where if you say no to doing it, they just take the option away from you. Yes, they lump it in with the main story. Thanks, RGG. Fuck you for that.\n\nThe gang. I can not be bothered to give a shit about their name, but all I will say is... I thought Yakuza 5 was the worst contender of enemy encounters. I thought wrong. This gang serves no purpose other than to, again, needlessly pad out game time.\n\nI look forward to finishing this game. Not because I'm invested, but so I can get it over with and play Lost Judgment, closing the book on this series until Y3K comes out.\n\nFinal Revise: I've finished the game, finally. And sadly, the negatives outweigh the positives too much for me to consider this a good game. Where the game has one good aspect, two more underlying problems arise. Story gets going at the end... but only at the end. As in, \"Chapters 12 and 13\" end. The final two chapters. Keihin gang has a good theme and the bosses are interesting characters. Kim, the sniper rifle sight of the grunts, and having to navigate Kamurocho like a maze with spawns worse than Y5 make it frustrating to even enjoy that aspect, among other things. Side cases unnecessarily clogging up the story, with Chapter 4 being the absolute worst contender at FOUR SIDE CASES IN ONE CHAPTER. Lack of direction or hints toward solving objectives that the player wouldn't know without having played this game prior, with Chapter 8 being the worst contender. Tiger Style, Crane Style and the restrictive locks for half of the game's entire skill catalogue behind skill books and QR codes.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, this is truly, as someone else put it, the Y3 of the dragon engine, made all the more ironic by the fact that a Y3K is coming out as I type this review. I feel like the only reason it's as well received as it is is because it just so happened to come out after the messes that were Y6 and Y2K. And from a technical standpoint, this game IS an improvement from those games. However, that \"improvement\" isn't exactly a high bar from those games, and like them, still has a lot of problems. At least Y2K has the Silly Mod. I do not think I'll be playing this game ever again, unless I suppress these memories of me playing it.\n\nThat being said, Dice and Cube was probably one of the few aspects of the game where I genuinely had fun. Sadly, the negatives still outweigh the positives, so even that doesn't save it.",

      "review": "I'm gonna keep playing this game because I paid for it and I can't let a Yakuza game go unbeaten, but... FUCK THIS PATHETIC TRASH PILE OF A GAME.\n\nProtagonist is bland and a creep (35yo dating a 19yo), only two combat styles and one is pretty pointless. Tracks enemies poorly, wall moves are tempermental,  enemies can kill you in two hits, and the Mortal Wounds system is stupid. Almost nonexistent XP rewards for doing anything meaning massive grinding is needed.  Not able to make any money from fighting either, so the vast majority of your xp and cash has to come from FUCKING MINIGAMES which are either RNG based, or involve the AI just cheating its ass off.   \n\nThen there's the side quests.. FUCK THE SIDE QUESTS.  You'll get quests interrupting quests interrupting quests, all being interrupted by a gang popping up over and over and forcing you into fights every ten seconds, which would be fine for grinding IF YOU GOT ANY WORTHWHILE XP FROM IT.  So much in the game is designed to waste your time, delay you, and generally just pad out the game time with bullshit.  \n\nWant XP to upgrade your character?  Well you gotta make money and do a bunch of side quests to get passes to play a dice game to make even more money, enough to buy some drinks that give you xp but for those to be really effective they have to be paired with XP boosting extracts, which means MORE side quests and scavenging.  Wanna not bother with that and grind XP the good old fashioned way (beating people up)?  You get 9xp per person you knock out.  The amount of XP you need to START upgrading your stats and abilities is 1000.  You need to beat up over 100 guys just to get a small increase to your health bar (which can be taken away in an instant because of the mortal wound system).  For higher levelling up you need 18000 XP.  Plus you need to spend a good amount of XP just to make other side quests (to do other side quests) doable without looking up guides.  Want drone parts for the races?  Well you gotta find small QR codes scattered around the map on buildings, so you can either run around town looking at every wall on every building trying to find them, or you can spend a bunch of XP and money on getting abilities to have an easier time finding the codes, and that's XP that you'd rather spend on stuff like health, speed, and power.  Oh well, guess you'll have to grind EVEN MORE to get those now.  And if you do get those top tier drone parts you'll still have to put up with rubber banding AI that will fly past you in the last five seconds of a race.\n\nThere are NO weapons or items that help your stats (like any kind of armour), only the extract system for a variety of small temporary boosts, and those extracts require running around looking for components to make them with.\n\nAlso hope you like walking slow and ducking behind cover because there's a LOT of tailing missions.  \n\nSo what in this game isn't dogshit? The story.  It's not great but it's not bad, even if it is pretty predictable and needs better pacing.\n\nIf you HAVE to play a Judgement game, get the second one.  The story isn't as good, but everything else in it is a significant improvement over this one.\n\nJudgement is the worst game in the Yakuza franchise (and yes I'm including Y3).  Anyone who tells you that it's great is either a delusional fanboy, hasn't played any other Yakuza games, or has severe brain damage.",

      "review": "I'm gonna keep playing this game because I paid for it and I can't let a Yakuza game go unbeaten, but... FUCK THIS PATHETIC TRASH PILE OF A GAME.\n\nProtagonist is bland and a creep (35yo dating a 19yo), only two combat styles and one is pretty pointless. Tracks enemies poorly, wall moves are tempermental,  enemies can kill you in two hits, and the Mortal Wounds system is stupid. Almost nonexistent XP rewards for doing anything meaning massive grinding is needed.  Not able to make any money from fighting either, so the vast majority of your xp and cash has to come from FUCKING MINIGAMES which are either RNG based, or involve the AI just cheating its ass off.   \n\nThen there's the side quests.. FUCK THE SIDE QUESTS.  You'll get quests interrupting quests interrupting quests, all being interrupted by a gang popping up over and over and forcing you into fights every ten seconds, which would be fine for grinding IF YOU GOT ANY WORTHWHILE XP FROM IT.  So much in the game is designed to waste your time, delay you, and generally just pad out the game time with bullshit.  \n\nWant XP to upgrade your character?  Well you gotta make money and do a bunch of side quests to get passes to play a dice game to make even more money, enough to buy some drinks that give you xp but for those to be really effective they have to be paired with XP boosting extracts, which means MORE side quests and scavenging.  Wanna not bother with that and grind XP the good old fashioned way (beating people up)?  You get 9xp per person you knock out.  The amount of XP you need to START upgrading your stats and abilities is 1000.  You need to beat up over 100 guys just to get a small increase to your health bar (which can be taken away in an instant because of the mortal wound system).  For higher levelling up you need 18000 XP.  Plus you need to spend a good amount of XP just to make other side quests (to do other side quests) doable without looking up guides.  Want drone parts for the races?  Well you gotta find small QR codes scattered around the map on buildings, so you can either run around town looking at every wall on every building trying to find them, or you can spend a bunch of XP and money on getting abilities to have an easier time finding the codes, and that's XP that you'd rather spend on stuff like health, speed, and power.  Oh well, guess you'll have to grind EVEN MORE to get those now.  And if you do get those top tier drone parts you'll still have to put up with rubber banding AI that will fly past you in the last five seconds of a race.\n\nThere are NO weapons or items that help your stats (like any kind of armour), only the extract system for a variety of small temporary boosts, and those extracts require running around looking for components to make them with.\n\nAlso hope you like walking slow and ducking behind cover because there's a LOT of tailing missions.  \n\nSo what in this game isn't dogshit? The story.  It's not great but it's not bad, even if it is pretty predictable and needs better pacing.\n\nIf you HAVE to play a Judgement game, get the second one.  The story isn't as good, but everything else in it is a significant improvement over this one.\n\nJudgement is the worst game in the Yakuza franchise (and yes I'm including Y3).  Anyone who tells you that it's great is either a delusional fanboy, hasn't played any other Yakuza games, or has severe brain damage.",

      "review": "After almost 10 hours focused almost exclusively on the main narrative (which, according to How Long To Beat, is almost half the length of the entire story), I find myself compelled to drop the game and not recommend it.\n\nIf you are not willing to waste at least this amount of time — potentially much more — with practically nothing meaningful happening and an immensely mediocre gameplay experience, I’d say don’t even go near it.\n\nJudgment it’s a perfectly functional game that, at first glance at least, reproduces the franchise’s particular formula with almost all its elements.\n\nThis blend of a cinematic narrative-driven beat ’em up, set in a small open-world that’s highly immersive and stuffed with details and side activities to do (from simple minigames to several full classic titles from Sega’s catalog), wrapped in a complex and very confident tone that contrasts mature and serious themes with completely insane comedic absurdities delivered impeccably, plus an apparently inescapable PS2-era charm in the form of low-production-value sequences and embryonic gameplay ideas that might have been interesting 20 years ago but feel like a bad joke today.\n\nAll the pieces are here, with the series’ trademark quality on full display—and in all its limitations.\n\nCombat, as always, brings excellent animations, highly impactful and satisfying to watch, but, as always, still has a very low skill ceiling and boils down to button-mashing and abusing the band-aids they added to [i]make it look fair[/i], because they still haven’t managed to design combat that doesn’t feel sloppy and immensely inconsistent.\n\nThat old joke about the combat basically being slapping people around while chugging energy drinks on an industrial scale? Yes, it's still the same thing.\n\nI’ve been trying to find a video of a skilled player demonstrating the potential of these systems in an elegant and satisfying way to watch, but I never do. It’s always a mess of rules that don’t work properly and unpredictable results.\n\nAt least they finally added a shortcut to use items. Innovation!\n\nThe elements added to differentiate this spin-off from the rest of the franchise—an attempt to sell the idea that you’re an investigator—are frankly pitiful.\n\nInterrogation or simple conversation sequences where they pretend they’re giving you dialogue choices, when in reality all the options are correct or there’s simply no relevant penalty (when there is one at all) for choosing the wrong one.\n\nUsing your phone camera to identify points of interest that the game essentially points out for you. \n\nUsing a drone to identify points of interest, [i]but this time[/i] in higher areas!\n\nTailing NPCs.\n\nLockpicking minigames…\n\nIt’s the laziest effort you could find to pretend you’re getting something resembling actual gameplay. A sketch of an idea that would only make sense in something experimental from the PS2 era, when the franchise was still young and had nothing to compare itself to.\n\nFor a franchise that loves padding itself with irrelevant tasks, this feels like a terrible case of [i]Ubisoftitis[/i].\n\nThe city is more interconnected than ever and impresses at first glance, as always, but it quickly becomes just a repetitive sequence of corridors while you zigzag from one point to another to simply watch cutscenes—while occasionally, once again to pretend there’s some gameplay between scenes, your path is interrupted by generic enemies attacking you randomly in the street.\n\nIt’s just so… bad. So, [i]so[/i] bad. The narrative design of this game is horrendous. The mission design (if you can call it that) is even worse.\n\nWhich leads me to the realization, after all these years, that this series is just a one-trick pony. Impressive as a whole when it’s new and still has interesting stories to tell, but one that quickly reveals itself to be formulaic and unable to evolve its experience beyond the stagnation present in the titles from recent years.\n\nNo matter how brilliant the new effects and animations are, how well they’ve balanced stylization and realism in the graphics, or how refined the formula becomes, it still feels like you’re playing a game stuck in PS2-era conventions.\n\nMaybe things get better later on, but the price of admission—as often happens with these narrative-driven Japanese games stretched to extremes—is simply pure boredom.\n\nMost of my time with the game was spent going from point A to point B to watch cutscenes, then going to point C to watch more, then back to A to watch even more. Cutscenes that, for the most part, are redundant, delivering information about a barely engaging murder mystery, with no personal involvement for the characters beyond some shallow idealism from the protagonist.\n\nIt may be detailed and presented with cinematography that makes watching them a bit more tolerable. And the franchise is quite notorious for dumping highly drawn-out exposition bombs on the player. But it doesn’t change the fact that the game doesn’t even feel like it has started after all this time.\n\nI didn’t even have the opportunity to actually enjoy the combat, shallow as it is.\n\nSo, at this point, I can’t recommend the game to anyone. Not to newcomers looking for a good entry point, nor to veterans wanting to check out what this story and these new characters are about.\n\nI’ll keep trying in the next few days, hoping for a hook that justifies the money spent, but I don’t think it’s going to work this time.",

      "review": "I honestly cannot see why people recommend this game. So far, I'm on Chapter 2 (My time is only 16 hours because I have a bad habit of keeping games open when I'm not playing them.) and already stuff like lockpicking and tailing missions just take the wind out of you. I get it, they tried something new. But just because you can doesn't mean you should, and this game is a great example of that. Also, the waiting for simple phone calls makes this even MORE of a slog than it already was. And the combat is hyper janky for no reason. Keep in mind, I have played every Yakuza game on Steam (at the time of this review, I'm aware Kiwami 3 is coming out) before this and LJ, so I have a pretty good idea on the other combat styles from the previous games I played. Not only that, the \"stuffing side quests down your throat\" is way more impeding that you'd think, and it's much of the same issue I had with Ishin Kiwami, where every corner you turned in that game, you'd be dragged into a side quest. I can't say for certain if it's as bad AS IK, but I can certainly hope not. Also, locking half the skill tree behind QR codes and skill books doesn't make the game harder. Just way more annoying. There's a reason why only SOME skills are locked behind that stuff in other games, save for the entirety of Dragon in Kiwami. If you REALLY have to play this game, get it on a very low sale. Otherwise, don't bother.\n\nEdit: I'm going to revise this review. Not because I change my mind... but because I vastly underestimated this game in terms of shittiness. I'll continue to play only because I want to beat every Yakuza game, but I'm not impressed. Doubling down, the side cases this game shoves down your throat... are some of the most bland and boring garbage I've ever seen. It's like RGG wanted to pad out the game time, but couldn't think of anything interesting. Substories are generally goofy, but these are not only so annoying when they crop up, they're not even charming or goofy. They add nothing to the story and feel like last-minute decisions. At least with Ishin, you have the option to not take part of the substories. Here? Fuck you, go solve a \"mystery\" on who ate your former co-worker's cake, only for it to be nobody because everyone in the room has room temperature IQ, and thus wasting everyone's time including the player's. There's even a side case where if you say no to doing it, they just take the option away from you. Yes, they lump it in with the main story. Thanks, RGG. Fuck you for that.\n\nThe gang. I can not be bothered to give a shit about their name, but all I will say is... I thought Yakuza 5 was the worst contender of enemy encounters. I thought wrong. This gang serves no purpose other than to, again, needlessly pad out game time.\n\nI look forward to finishing this game. Not because I'm invested, but so I can get it over with and play Lost Judgment, closing the book on this series until Y3K comes out.\n\nFinal Revise: I've finished the game, finally. And sadly, the negatives outweigh the positives too much for me to consider this a good game. Where the game has one good aspect, two more underlying problems arise. Story gets going at the end... but only at the end. As in, \"Chapters 12 and 13\" end. The final two chapters. Keihin gang has a good theme and the bosses are interesting characters. Kim, the sniper rifle sight of the grunts, and having to navigate Kamurocho like a maze with spawns worse than Y5 make it frustrating to even enjoy that aspect, among other things. Side cases unnecessarily clogging up the story, with Chapter 4 being the absolute worst contender at FOUR SIDE CASES IN ONE CHAPTER. Lack of direction or hints toward solving objectives that the player wouldn't know without having played this game prior, with Chapter 8 being the worst contender. Tiger Style, Crane Style and the restrictive locks for half of the game's entire skill catalogue behind skill books and QR codes.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, this is truly, as someone else put it, the Y3 of the dragon engine, made all the more ironic by the fact that a Y3K is coming out as I type this review. I feel like the only reason it's as well received as it is is because it just so happened to come out after the messes that were Y6 and Y2K. And from a technical standpoint, this game IS an improvement from those games. However, that \"improvement\" isn't exactly a high bar from those games, and like them, still has a lot of problems. At least Y2K has the Silly Mod. I do not think I'll be playing this game ever again, unless I suppress these memories of me playing it.\n\nThat being said, Dice and Cube was probably one of the few aspects of the game where I genuinely had fun. Sadly, the negatives still outweigh the positives, so even that doesn't save it.",

I'll continue to play only because I want to beat every Yakuza game, but I'm not impressed. Doubling down, the side cases this game shoves down your throat... are some of the most bland and boring garbage I've ever seen. It's like RGG wanted to pad out the game time, but couldn't think of anything interesting. Substories are generally goofy, but these are not only so annoying when they crop up, they're not even charming or goofy. They add nothing to the story and feel like last-minute decisions. At least with Ishin, you have the option to not take part of the substories. Here? Fuck you, go solve a \"mystery\" on who ate your former co-worker's cake, only for it to be nobody because everyone in the room has room temperature IQ, and thus wasting everyone's time including the player's. There's even a side case where if you say no to doing it, they just take the option away from you. Yes, they lump it in with the main story. Thanks, RGG. Fuck you for that.\n\nThe gang. I can not be bothered to give a shit about their name, but all I will say is... I thought Yakuza 5 was the worst contender of enemy encounters. I thought wrong. This gang serves no purpose other than to, again, needlessly pad out game time.\n\nI look forward to finishing this game. Not because I'm invested, but so I can get it over with and play Lost Judgment, closing the book on this series until Y3K comes out.\n\nFinal Revise: I've finished the game, finally. And sadly, the negatives outweigh the positives too much for me to consider this a good game. Where the game has one good aspect, two more underlying problems arise. Story gets going at the end... but only at the end. As in, \"Chapters 12 and 13\" end. The final two chapters. Keihin gang has a good theme and the bosses are interesting characters. Kim, the sniper rifle sight of the grunts, and having to navigate Kamurocho like a maze with spawns worse than Y5 make it frustrating to even enjoy that aspect, among other things. Side cases unnecessarily clogging up the story, with Chapter 4 being the absolute worst contender at FOUR SIDE CASES IN ONE CHAPTER. Lack of direction or hints toward solving objectives that the player wouldn't know without having played this game prior, with Chapter 8 being the worst contender. Tiger Style, Crane Style and the restrictive locks for half of the game's entire skill catalogue behind skill books and QR codes.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, this is truly, as someone else put it, the Y3 of the dragon engine, made all the more ironic by the fact that a Y3K is coming out as I type this review. I feel like the only reason it's as well received as it is is because it just so happened to come out after the messes that were Y6 and Y2K. And from a technical standpoint, this game IS an improvement from those games. However, that \"improvement\" isn't exactly a high bar from those games, and like them, still has a lot of problems. At least Y2K has the Silly Mod. I do not think I'll be playing this game ever again, unless I suppress these memories of me playing it.\n\nThat being said, Dice and Cube was probably one of the few aspects of the game where I genuinely had fun. Sadly, the negatives still outweigh the positives, so even that doesn't save it.",

      "review": "I'm gonna keep playing this game because I paid for it and I can't let a Yakuza game go unbeaten, but... FUCK THIS PATHETIC TRASH PILE OF A GAME.\n\nProtagonist is bland and a creep (35yo dating a 19yo), only two combat styles and one is pretty pointless. Tracks enemies poorly, wall moves are tempermental,  enemies can kill you in two hits, and the Mortal Wounds system is stupid. Almost nonexistent XP rewards for doing anything meaning massive grinding is needed.  Not able to make any money from fighting either, so the vast majority of your xp and cash has to come from FUCKING MINIGAMES which are either RNG based, or involve the AI just cheating its ass off.   \n\nThen there's the side quests.. FUCK THE SIDE QUESTS.  You'll get quests interrupting quests interrupting quests, all being interrupted by a gang popping up over and over and forcing you into fights every ten seconds, which would be fine for grinding IF YOU GOT ANY WORTHWHILE XP FROM IT.  So much in the game is designed to waste your time, delay you, and generally just pad out the game time with bullshit.  \n\nWant XP to upgrade your character?  Well you gotta make money and do a bunch of side quests to get passes to play a dice game to make even more money, enough to buy some drinks that give you xp but for those to be really effective they have to be paired with XP boosting extracts, which means MORE side quests and scavenging.  Wanna not bother with that and grind XP the good old fashioned way (beating people up)?  You get 9xp per person you knock out.  The amount of XP you need to START upgrading your stats and abilities is 1000.  You need to beat up over 100 guys just to get a small increase to your health bar (which can be taken away in an instant because of the mortal wound system).  For higher levelling up you need 18000 XP.  Plus you need to spend a good amount of XP just to make other side quests (to do other side quests) doable without looking up guides.  Want drone parts for the races?  Well you gotta find small QR codes scattered around the map on buildings, so you can either run around town looking at every wall on every building trying to find them, or you can spend a bunch of XP and money on getting abilities to have an easier time finding the codes, and that's XP that you'd rather spend on stuff like health, speed, and power.  Oh well, guess you'll have to grind EVEN MORE to get those now.  And if you do get those top tier drone parts you'll still have to put up with rubber banding AI that will fly past you in the last five seconds of a race.\n\nThere are NO weapons or items that help your stats (like any kind of armour), only the extract system for a variety of small temporary boosts, and those extracts require running around looking for components to make them with.\n\nAlso hope you like walking slow and ducking behind cover because there's a LOT of tailing missions.  \n\nSo what in this game isn't dogshit? The story.  It's not great but it's not bad, even if it is pretty predictable and needs better pacing.\n\nIf you HAVE to play a Judgement game, get the second one.  The story isn't as good, but everything else in it is a significant improvement over this one.\n\nJudgement is the worst game in the Yakuza franchise (and yes I'm including Y3).  Anyone who tells you that it's great is either a delusional fanboy, hasn't played any other Yakuza games, or has severe brain damage.",

Yes, it's still the same thing.\n\nI’ve been trying to find a video of a skilled player demonstrating the potential of these systems in an elegant and satisfying way to watch, but I never do. It’s always a mess of rules that don’t work properly and unpredictable results.\n\nAt least they finally added a shortcut to use items. Innovation!\n\nThe elements added to differentiate this spin-off from the rest of the franchise—an attempt to sell the idea that you’re an investigator—are frankly pitiful.\n\nInterrogation or simple conversation sequences where they pretend they’re giving you dialogue choices, when in reality all the options are correct or there’s simply no relevant penalty (when there is one at all) for choosing the wrong one.\n\nUsing your phone camera to identify points of interest that the game essentially points out for you. \n\nUsing a drone to identify points of interest, [i]but this time[/i] in higher areas!\n\nTailing NPCs.\n\nLockpicking minigames…\n\nIt’s the laziest effort you could find to pretend you’re getting something resembling actual gameplay. A sketch of an idea that would only make sense in something experimental from the PS2 era, when the franchise was still young and had nothing to compare itself to.\n\nFor a franchise that loves padding itself with irrelevant tasks, this feels like a terrible case of [i]Ubisoftitis[/i].\n\nThe city is more interconnected than ever and impresses at first glance, as always, but it quickly becomes just a repetitive sequence of corridors while you zigzag from one point to another to simply watch cutscenes—while occasionally, once again to pretend there’s some gameplay between scenes, your path is interrupted by generic enemies attacking you randomly in the street.\n\nIt’s just so… bad. So, [i]so[/i] bad. The narrative design of this game is horrendous. The mission design (if you can call it that) is even worse.\n\nWhich leads me to the realization, after all these years, that this series is just a one-trick pony. Impressive as a whole when it’s new and still has interesting stories to tell, but one that quickly reveals itself to be formulaic and unable to evolve its experience beyond the stagnation present in the titles from recent years.\n\nNo matter how brilliant the new effects and animations are, how well they’ve balanced stylization and realism in the graphics, or how refined the formula becomes, it still feels like you’re playing a game stuck in PS2-era conventions.\n\nMaybe things get better later on, but the price of admission—as often happens with these narrative-driven Japanese games stretched to extremes—is simply pure boredom.\n\nMost of my time with the game was spent going from point A to point B to watch cutscenes, then going to point C to watch more, then back to A to watch even more. Cutscenes that, for the most part, are redundant, delivering information about a barely engaging murder mystery, with no personal involvement for the characters beyond some shallow idealism from the protagonist.\n\nIt may be detailed and presented with cinematography that makes watching them a bit more tolerable. And the franchise is quite notorious for dumping highly drawn-out exposition bombs on the player. But it doesn’t change the fact that the game doesn’t even feel like it has started after all this time.\n\nI didn’t even have the opportunity to actually enjoy the combat, shallow as it is.\n\nSo, at this point, I can’t recommend the game to anyone. Not to newcomers looking for a good entry point, nor to veterans wanting to check out what this story and these new characters are about.\n\nI’ll keep trying in the next few days, hoping for a hook that justifies the money spent, but I don’t think it’s going to work this time.",

So far, I'm on Chapter 2 (My time is only 16 hours because I have a bad habit of keeping games open when I'm not playing them.) and already stuff like lockpicking and tailing missions just take the wind out of you. I get it, they tried something new. But just because you can doesn't mean you should, and this game is a great example of that. Also, the waiting for simple phone calls makes this even MORE of a slog than it already was. And the combat is hyper janky for no reason. Keep in mind, I have played every Yakuza game on Steam (at the time of this review, I'm aware Kiwami 3 is coming out) before this and LJ, so I have a pretty good idea on the other combat styles from the previous games I played. Not only that, the \"stuffing side quests down your throat\" is way more impeding that you'd think, and it's much of the same issue I had with Ishin Kiwami, where every corner you turned in that game, you'd be dragged into a side quest. I can't say for certain if it's as bad AS IK, but I can certainly hope not. Also, locking half the skill tree behind QR codes and skill books doesn't make the game harder. Just way more annoying. There's a reason why only SOME skills are locked behind that stuff in other games, save for the entirety of Dragon in Kiwami. If you REALLY have to play this game, get it on a very low sale.

Cutscenes that, for the most part, are redundant, delivering information about a barely engaging murder mystery, with no personal involvement for the characters beyond some shallow idealism from the protagonist.\n\nIt may be detailed and presented with cinematography that makes watching them a bit more tolerable. And the franchise is quite notorious for dumping highly drawn-out exposition bombs on the player. But it doesn’t change the fact that the game doesn’t even feel like it has started after all this time.\n\nI didn’t even have the opportunity to actually enjoy the combat, shallow as it is.\n\nSo, at this point, I can’t recommend the game to anyone. Not to newcomers looking for a good entry point, nor to veterans wanting to check out what this story and these new characters are about.\n\nI’ll keep trying in the next few days, hoping for a hook that justifies the money spent, but I don’t think it’s going to work this time.",

      "review": "I honestly cannot see why people recommend this game. So far, I'm on Chapter 2 (My time is only 16 hours because I have a bad habit of keeping games open when I'm not playing them.) and already stuff like lockpicking and tailing missions just take the wind out of you. I get it, they tried something new. But just because you can doesn't mean you should, and this game is a great example of that. Also, the waiting for simple phone calls makes this even MORE of a slog than it already was. And the combat is hyper janky for no reason. Keep in mind, I have played every Yakuza game on Steam (at the time of this review, I'm aware Kiwami 3 is coming out) before this and LJ, so I have a pretty good idea on the other combat styles from the previous games I played. Not only that, the \"stuffing side quests down your throat\" is way more impeding that you'd think, and it's much of the same issue I had with Ishin Kiwami, where every corner you turned in that game, you'd be dragged into a side quest. I can't say for certain if it's as bad AS IK, but I can certainly hope not. Also, locking half the skill tree behind QR codes and skill books doesn't make the game harder. Just way more annoying. There's a reason why only SOME skills are locked behind that stuff in other games, save for the entirety of Dragon in Kiwami. If you REALLY have to play this game, get it on a very low sale. Otherwise, don't bother.\n\nEdit: I'm going to revise this review. Not because I change my mind... but because I vastly underestimated this game in terms of shittiness. I'll continue to play only because I want to beat every Yakuza game, but I'm not impressed. Doubling down, the side cases this game shoves down your throat... are some of the most bland and boring garbage I've ever seen. It's like RGG wanted to pad out the game time, but couldn't think of anything interesting. Substories are generally goofy, but these are not only so annoying when they crop up, they're not even charming or goofy. They add nothing to the story and feel like last-minute decisions. At least with Ishin, you have the option to not take part of the substories. Here? Fuck you, go solve a \"mystery\" on who ate your former co-worker's cake, only for it to be nobody because everyone in the room has room temperature IQ, and thus wasting everyone's time including the player's. There's even a side case where if you say no to doing it, they just take the option away from you. Yes, they lump it in with the main story. Thanks, RGG. Fuck you for that.\n\nThe gang. I can not be bothered to give a shit about their name, but all I will say is... I thought Yakuza 5 was the worst contender of enemy encounters. I thought wrong. This gang serves no purpose other than to, again, needlessly pad out game time.\n\nI look forward to finishing this game. Not because I'm invested, but so I can get it over with and play Lost Judgment, closing the book on this series until Y3K comes out.\n\nFinal Revise: I've finished the game, finally. And sadly, the negatives outweigh the positives too much for me to consider this a good game. Where the game has one good aspect, two more underlying problems arise. Story gets going at the end... but only at the end. As in, \"Chapters 12 and 13\" end. The final two chapters. Keihin gang has a good theme and the bosses are interesting characters. Kim, the sniper rifle sight of the grunts, and having to navigate Kamurocho like a maze with spawns worse than Y5 make it frustrating to even enjoy that aspect, among other things. Side cases unnecessarily clogging up the story, with Chapter 4 being the absolute worst contender at FOUR SIDE CASES IN ONE CHAPTER. Lack of direction or hints toward solving objectives that the player wouldn't know without having played this game prior, with Chapter 8 being the worst contender. Tiger Style, Crane Style and the restrictive locks for half of the game's entire skill catalogue behind skill books and QR codes.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, this is truly, as someone else put it, the Y3 of the dragon engine, made all the more ironic by the fact that a Y3K is coming out as I type this review. I feel like the only reason it's as well received as it is is because it just so happened to come out after the messes that were Y6 and Y2K. And from a technical standpoint, this game IS an improvement from those games. However, that \"improvement\" isn't exactly a high bar from those games, and like them, still has a lot of problems. At least Y2K has the Silly Mod. I do not think I'll be playing this game ever again, unless I suppress these memories of me playing it.\n\nThat being said, Dice and Cube was probably one of the few aspects of the game where I genuinely had fun. Sadly, the negatives still outweigh the positives, so even that doesn't save it.",

FUCK THIS PATHETIC TRASH PILE OF A GAME.\n\nProtagonist is bland and a creep (35yo dating a 19yo), only two combat styles and one is pretty pointless. Tracks enemies poorly, wall moves are tempermental,  enemies can kill you in two hits, and the Mortal Wounds system is stupid. Almost nonexistent XP rewards for doing anything meaning massive grinding is needed.  Not able to make any money from fighting either, so the vast majority of your xp and cash has to come from FUCKING MINIGAMES which are either RNG based, or involve the AI just cheating its ass off.   \n\nThen there's the side quests.. FUCK THE SIDE QUESTS.  You'll get quests interrupting quests interrupting quests, all being interrupted by a gang popping up over and over and forcing you into fights every ten seconds, which would be fine for grinding IF YOU GOT ANY WORTHWHILE XP FROM IT.  So much in the game is designed to waste your time, delay you, and generally just pad out the game time with bullshit.  \n\nWant XP to upgrade your character?  Well you gotta make money and do a bunch of side quests to get passes to play a dice game to make even more money, enough to buy some drinks that give you xp but for those to be really effective they have to be paired with XP boosting extracts, which means MORE side quests and scavenging.  Wanna not bother with that and grind XP the good old fashioned way (beating people up)?  You get 9xp per person you knock out.  The amount of XP you need to START upgrading your stats and abilities is 1000.  You need to beat up over 100 guys just to get a small increase to your health bar (which can be taken away in an instant because of the mortal wound system).  For higher levelling up you need 18000 XP.  Plus you need to spend a good amount of XP just to make other side quests (to do other side quests) doable without looking up guides.  Want drone parts for the races?  Well you gotta find small QR codes scattered around the map on buildings, so you can either run around town looking at every wall on every building trying to find them, or you can spend a bunch of XP and money on getting abilities to have an easier time finding the codes, and that's XP that you'd rather spend on stuff like health, speed, and power.  Oh well, guess you'll have to grind EVEN MORE to get those now.  And if you do get those top tier drone parts you'll still have to put up with rubber banding AI that will fly past you in the last five seconds of a race.\n\nThere are NO weapons or items that help your stats (like any kind of armour), only the extract system for a variety of small temporary boosts, and those extracts require running around looking for components to make them with.\n\nAlso hope you like walking slow and ducking behind cover because there's a LOT of tailing missions.  \n\nSo what in this game isn't dogshit? The story.  It's not great but it's not bad, even if it is pretty predictable and needs better pacing.\n\nIf you HAVE to play a Judgement game, get the second one.  The story isn't as good, but everything else in it is a significant improvement over this one.\n\nJudgement is the worst game in the Yakuza franchise (and yes I'm including Y3).  Anyone who tells you that it's great is either a delusional fanboy, hasn't played any other Yakuza games, or has severe brain damage.",

      "review": "After almost 10 hours focused almost exclusively on the main narrative (which, according to How Long To Beat, is almost half the length of the entire story), I find myself compelled to drop the game and not recommend it.\n\nIf you are not willing to waste at least this amount of time — potentially much more — with practically nothing meaningful happening and an immensely mediocre gameplay experience, I’d say don’t even go near it.\n\nJudgment it’s a perfectly functional game that, at first glance at least, reproduces the franchise’s particular formula with almost all its elements.\n\nThis blend of a cinematic narrative-driven beat ’em up, set in a small open-world that’s highly immersive and stuffed with details and side activities to do (from simple minigames to several full classic titles from Sega’s catalog), wrapped in a complex and very confident tone that contrasts mature and serious themes with completely insane comedic absurdities delivered impeccably, plus an apparently inescapable PS2-era charm in the form of low-production-value sequences and embryonic gameplay ideas that might have been interesting 20 years ago but feel like a bad joke today.\n\nAll the pieces are here, with the series’ trademark quality on full display—and in all its limitations.\n\nCombat, as always, brings excellent animations, highly impactful and satisfying to watch, but, as always, still has a very low skill ceiling and boils down to button-mashing and abusing the band-aids they added to [i]make it look fair[/i], because they still haven’t managed to design combat that doesn’t feel sloppy and immensely inconsistent.\n\nThat old joke about the combat basically being slapping people around while chugging energy drinks on an industrial scale? Yes, it's still the same thing.\n\nI’ve been trying to find a video of a skilled player demonstrating the potential of these systems in an elegant and satisfying way to watch, but I never do. It’s always a mess of rules that don’t work properly and unpredictable results.\n\nAt least they finally added a shortcut to use items. Innovation!\n\nThe elements added to differentiate this spin-off from the rest of the franchise—an attempt to sell the idea that you’re an investigator—are frankly pitiful.\n\nInterrogation or simple conversation sequences where they pretend they’re giving you dialogue choices, when in reality all the options are correct or there’s simply no relevant penalty (when there is one at all) for choosing the wrong one.\n\nUsing your phone camera to identify points of interest that the game essentially points out for you. \n\nUsing a drone to identify points of interest, [i]but this time[/i] in higher areas!\n\nTailing NPCs.\n\nLockpicking minigames…\n\nIt’s the laziest effort you could find to pretend you’re getting something resembling actual gameplay. A sketch of an idea that would only make sense in something experimental from the PS2 era, when the franchise was still young and had nothing to compare itself to.\n\nFor a franchise that loves padding itself with irrelevant tasks, this feels like a terrible case of [i]Ubisoftitis[/i].\n\nThe city is more interconnected than ever and impresses at first glance, as always, but it quickly becomes just a repetitive sequence of corridors while you zigzag from one point to another to simply watch cutscenes—while occasionally, once again to pretend there’s some gameplay between scenes, your path is interrupted by generic enemies attacking you randomly in the street.\n\nIt’s just so… bad. So, [i]so[/i] bad. The narrative design of this game is horrendous. The mission design (if you can call it that) is even worse.\n\nWhich leads me to the realization, after all these years, that this series is just a one-trick pony. Impressive as a whole when it’s new and still has interesting stories to tell, but one that quickly reveals itself to be formulaic and unable to evolve its experience beyond the stagnation present in the titles from recent years.\n\nNo matter how brilliant the new effects and animations are, how well they’ve balanced stylization and realism in the graphics, or how refined the formula becomes, it still feels like you’re playing a game stuck in PS2-era conventions.\n\nMaybe things get better later on, but the price of admission—as often happens with these narrative-driven Japanese games stretched to extremes—is simply pure boredom.\n\nMost of my time with the game was spent going from point A to point B to watch cutscenes, then going to point C to watch more, then back to A to watch even more.

      "review": "After almost 10 hours focused almost exclusively on the main narrative (which, according to How Long To Beat, is almost half the length of the entire story), I find myself compelled to drop the game and not recommend it.\n\nIf you are not willing to waste at least this amount of time — potentially much more — with practically nothing meaningful happening and an immensely mediocre gameplay experience, I’d say don’t even go near it.\n\nJudgment it’s a perfectly functional game that, at first glance at least, reproduces the franchise’s particular formula with almost all its elements.\n\nThis blend of a cinematic narrative-driven beat ’em up, set in a small open-world that’s highly immersive and stuffed with details and side activities to do (from simple minigames to several full classic titles from Sega’s catalog), wrapped in a complex and very confident tone that contrasts mature and serious themes with completely insane comedic absurdities delivered impeccably, plus an apparently inescapable PS2-era charm in the form of low-production-value sequences and embryonic gameplay ideas that might have been interesting 20 years ago but feel like a bad joke today.\n\nAll the pieces are here, with the series’ trademark quality on full display—and in all its limitations.\n\nCombat, as always, brings excellent animations, highly impactful and satisfying to watch, but, as always, still has a very low skill ceiling and boils down to button-mashing and abusing the band-aids they added to [i]make it look fair[/i], because they still haven’t managed to design combat that doesn’t feel sloppy and immensely inconsistent.\n\nThat old joke about the combat basically being slapping people around while chugging energy drinks on an industrial scale? Yes, it's still the same thing.\n\nI’ve been trying to find a video of a skilled player demonstrating the potential of these systems in an elegant and satisfying way to watch, but I never do. It’s always a mess of rules that don’t work properly and unpredictable results.\n\nAt least they finally added a shortcut to use items. Innovation!\n\nThe elements added to differentiate this spin-off from the rest of the franchise—an attempt to sell the idea that you’re an investigator—are frankly pitiful.\n\nInterrogation or simple conversation sequences where they pretend they’re giving you dialogue choices, when in reality all the options are correct or there’s simply no relevant penalty (when there is one at all) for choosing the wrong one.\n\nUsing your phone camera to identify points of interest that the game essentially points out for you. \n\nUsing a drone to identify points of interest, [i]but this time[/i] in higher areas!\n\nTailing NPCs.\n\nLockpicking minigames…\n\nIt’s the laziest effort you could find to pretend you’re getting something resembling actual gameplay. A sketch of an idea that would only make sense in something experimental from the PS2 era, when the franchise was still young and had nothing to compare itself to.\n\nFor a franchise that loves padding itself with irrelevant tasks, this feels like a terrible case of [i]Ubisoftitis[/i].\n\nThe city is more interconnected than ever and impresses at first glance, as always, but it quickly becomes just a repetitive sequence of corridors while you zigzag from one point to another to simply watch cutscenes—while occasionally, once again to pretend there’s some gameplay between scenes, your path is interrupted by generic enemies attacking you randomly in the street.\n\nIt’s just so… bad. So, [i]so[/i] bad. The narrative design of this game is horrendous. The mission design (if you can call it that) is even worse.\n\nWhich leads me to the realization, after all these years, that this series is just a one-trick pony. Impressive as a whole when it’s new and still has interesting stories to tell, but one that quickly reveals itself to be formulaic and unable to evolve its experience beyond the stagnation present in the titles from recent years.\n\nNo matter how brilliant the new effects and animations are, how well they’ve balanced stylization and realism in the graphics, or how refined the formula becomes, it still feels like you’re playing a game stuck in PS2-era conventions.\n\nMaybe things get better later on, but the price of admission—as often happens with these narrative-driven Japanese games stretched to extremes—is simply pure boredom.\n\nMost of my time with the game was spent going from point A to point B to watch cutscenes, then going to point C to watch more, then back to A to watch even more. Cutscenes that, for the most part, are redundant, delivering information about a barely engaging murder mystery, with no personal involvement for the characters beyond some shallow idealism from the protagonist.\n\nIt may be detailed and presented with cinematography that makes watching them a bit more tolerable. And the franchise is quite notorious for dumping highly drawn-out exposition bombs on the player. But it doesn’t change the fact that the game doesn’t even feel like it has started after all this time.\n\nI didn’t even have the opportunity to actually enjoy the combat, shallow as it is.\n\nSo, at this point, I can’t recommend the game to anyone. Not to newcomers looking for a good entry point, nor to veterans wanting to check out what this story and these new characters are about.\n\nI’ll keep trying in the next few days, hoping for a hook that justifies the money spent, but I don’t think it’s going to work this time.",

      "review": "I honestly cannot see why people recommend this game. So far, I'm on Chapter 2 (My time is only 16 hours because I have a bad habit of keeping games open when I'm not playing them.) and already stuff like lockpicking and tailing missions just take the wind out of you. I get it, they tried something new. But just because you can doesn't mean you should, and this game is a great example of that. Also, the waiting for simple phone calls makes this even MORE of a slog than it already was. And the combat is hyper janky for no reason. Keep in mind, I have played every Yakuza game on Steam (at the time of this review, I'm aware Kiwami 3 is coming out) before this and LJ, so I have a pretty good idea on the other combat styles from the previous games I played. Not only that, the \"stuffing side quests down your throat\" is way more impeding that you'd think, and it's much of the same issue I had with Ishin Kiwami, where every corner you turned in that game, you'd be dragged into a side quest. I can't say for certain if it's as bad AS IK, but I can certainly hope not. Also, locking half the skill tree behind QR codes and skill books doesn't make the game harder. Just way more annoying. There's a reason why only SOME skills are locked behind that stuff in other games, save for the entirety of Dragon in Kiwami. If you REALLY have to play this game, get it on a very low sale. Otherwise, don't bother.\n\nEdit: I'm going to revise this review. Not because I change my mind... but because I vastly underestimated this game in terms of shittiness. I'll continue to play only because I want to beat every Yakuza game, but I'm not impressed. Doubling down, the side cases this game shoves down your throat... are some of the most bland and boring garbage I've ever seen. It's like RGG wanted to pad out the game time, but couldn't think of anything interesting. Substories are generally goofy, but these are not only so annoying when they crop up, they're not even charming or goofy. They add nothing to the story and feel like last-minute decisions. At least with Ishin, you have the option to not take part of the substories. Here? Fuck you, go solve a \"mystery\" on who ate your former co-worker's cake, only for it to be nobody because everyone in the room has room temperature IQ, and thus wasting everyone's time including the player's. There's even a side case where if you say no to doing it, they just take the option away from you. Yes, they lump it in with the main story. Thanks, RGG. Fuck you for that.\n\nThe gang. I can not be bothered to give a shit about their name, but all I will say is... I thought Yakuza 5 was the worst contender of enemy encounters. I thought wrong. This gang serves no purpose other than to, again, needlessly pad out game time.\n\nI look forward to finishing this game. Not because I'm invested, but so I can get it over with and play Lost Judgment, closing the book on this series until Y3K comes out.\n\nFinal Revise: I've finished the game, finally. And sadly, the negatives outweigh the positives too much for me to consider this a good game. Where the game has one good aspect, two more underlying problems arise. Story gets going at the end... but only at the end. As in, \"Chapters 12 and 13\" end. The final two chapters. Keihin gang has a good theme and the bosses are interesting characters. Kim, the sniper rifle sight of the grunts, and having to navigate Kamurocho like a maze with spawns worse than Y5 make it frustrating to even enjoy that aspect, among other things. Side cases unnecessarily clogging up the story, with Chapter 4 being the absolute worst contender at FOUR SIDE CASES IN ONE CHAPTER. Lack of direction or hints toward solving objectives that the player wouldn't know without having played this game prior, with Chapter 8 being the worst contender. Tiger Style, Crane Style and the restrictive locks for half of the game's entire skill catalogue behind skill books and QR codes.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, this is truly, as someone else put it, the Y3 of the dragon engine, made all the more ironic by the fact that a Y3K is coming out as I type this review. I feel like the only reason it's as well received as it is is because it just so happened to come out after the messes that were Y6 and Y2K. And from a technical standpoint, this game IS an improvement from those games. However, that \"improvement\" isn't exactly a high bar from those games, and like them, still has a lot of problems. At least Y2K has the Silly Mod. I do not think I'll be playing this game ever again, unless I suppress these memories of me playing it.\n\nThat being said, Dice and Cube was probably one of the few aspects of the game where I genuinely had fun. Sadly, the negatives still outweigh the positives, so even that doesn't save it.",

      "review": "I'm gonna keep playing this game because I paid for it and I can't let a Yakuza game go unbeaten, but... FUCK THIS PATHETIC TRASH PILE OF A GAME.\n\nProtagonist is bland and a creep (35yo dating a 19yo), only two combat styles and one is pretty pointless. Tracks enemies poorly, wall moves are tempermental,  enemies can kill you in two hits, and the Mortal Wounds system is stupid. Almost nonexistent XP rewards for doing anything meaning massive grinding is needed.  Not able to make any money from fighting either, so the vast majority of your xp and cash has to come from FUCKING MINIGAMES which are either RNG based, or involve the AI just cheating its ass off.   \n\nThen there's the side quests.. FUCK THE SIDE QUESTS.  You'll get quests interrupting quests interrupting quests, all being interrupted by a gang popping up over and over and forcing you into fights every ten seconds, which would be fine for grinding IF YOU GOT ANY WORTHWHILE XP FROM IT.  So much in the game is designed to waste your time, delay you, and generally just pad out the game time with bullshit.  \n\nWant XP to upgrade your character?  Well you gotta make money and do a bunch of side quests to get passes to play a dice game to make even more money, enough to buy some drinks that give you xp but for those to be really effective they have to be paired with XP boosting extracts, which means MORE side quests and scavenging.  Wanna not bother with that and grind XP the good old fashioned way (beating people up)?  You get 9xp per person you knock out.  The amount of XP you need to START upgrading your stats and abilities is 1000.  You need to beat up over 100 guys just to get a small increase to your health bar (which can be taken away in an instant because of the mortal wound system).  For higher levelling up you need 18000 XP.  Plus you need to spend a good amount of XP just to make other side quests (to do other side quests) doable without looking up guides.  Want drone parts for the races?  Well you gotta find small QR codes scattered around the map on buildings, so you can either run around town looking at every wall on every building trying to find them, or you can spend a bunch of XP and money on getting abilities to have an easier time finding the codes, and that's XP that you'd rather spend on stuff like health, speed, and power.  Oh well, guess you'll have to grind EVEN MORE to get those now.  And if you do get those top tier drone parts you'll still have to put up with rubber banding AI that will fly past you in the last five seconds of a race.\n\nThere are NO weapons or items that help your stats (like any kind of armour), only the extract system for a variety of small temporary boosts, and those extracts require running around looking for components to make them with.\n\nAlso hope you like walking slow and ducking behind cover because there's a LOT of tailing missions.  \n\nSo what in this game isn't dogshit? The story.  It's not great but it's not bad, even if it is pretty predictable and needs better pacing.\n\nIf you HAVE to play a Judgement game, get the second one.  The story isn't as good, but everything else in it is a significant improvement over this one.\n\nJudgement is the worst game in the Yakuza franchise (and yes I'm including Y3).  Anyone who tells you that it's great is either a delusional fanboy, hasn't played any other Yakuza games, or has severe brain damage.",

The story isn't as good, but everything else in it is a significant improvement over this one.\n\nJudgement is the worst game in the Yakuza franchise (and yes I'm including Y3).  Anyone who tells you that it's great is either a delusional fanboy, hasn't played any other Yakuza games, or has severe brain damage.",
