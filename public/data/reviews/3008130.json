      "review": "Dying Light: The Beast Why You Should Play It\n\n1. The Zombies Actually Get Torn Apart\nThe game delivers one of the most satisfying dismemberment systems ever made. Every hit reacts with flesh, bone, and blood effects that feel incredibly real, making it fun enough to keep you playing for hours.\n\n2. Parkour Is Back and Better Than Ever\nThe signature parkour system returns stronger than before. Jumping from rooftop to rooftop, dodging zombies, and feeling that rush of adrenaline is still an absolute thrill.\n\n3. The Storytelling Is Much Stronger Than DL2\nCompared to Dying Light 2, this game tells its story in a more focused, emotional, and dynamic way. The mission flow feels natural, and character motivations are much more believable.\n\n4. The Volatiles Are Back\nThe most terrifying enemies of the series make a comeback. Going out at night still requires courage, and the tension they create gives the game a chilling atmosphere.\n\n5. The Graphics Are Beautiful\nLighting, shadows, and environment details all look fantastic by modern standards. Night scenes, in particular, are a true visual feast.\n\nCons\n\n1. The Vehicle System Feels Unnecessary\nYou almost never need to use a car. The parkour system is already so fun and fluid that driving feels like a distraction from the core gameplay.\n\n2. The Skill System Is Too Shallow\nWith a level cap of only 15 and very few skill branches, the progression system feels limited and does not provide long-term satisfaction.\n\n🎯 Final Score: 100/92\nDying Light The Beast stands out with its atmosphere, dismemberment mechanics, and terrifying night sequences. Despite a few small flaws, it remains a must-play for anyone who loves zombie action games.",

      "review": "This game is amazing.\n\n\nI've been playing Dying Light since 2015. The first game is one of my favourite games of all time, and even with it being a decade old it is still the best game of the 3. Tell me I'm blinded by nostalgia, I don't care because I've followed the journey nearly every step of the way. I put so much time into DL1 only to be massively disappointed by DL2. DL the Beast is a huge upgrade from DL2. \n\nYes The Beast runs on the same engine but overall it feels smoother and less janky than the second game. The only issues I have are with combat, the npcs and UI. After exiting the weapon wheel, your character will be stuck in the direction of which key you are pressing until you release and repress the key. \n\nThe human npcs dodge a bit too much. It wouldn't bother me if it actually made sense, they dodge backwards when my weapon is clearly hitting them, if they blocked or actually moved away from my attack then it would be better...also the grenade spam they do when you're driving near them is pretty annoying.\n\nThen there's the charged kick which does absolutely nothing to stop enemies below you, whether they're on the ground or climbing a building to get to you, you can only use the charged kick if the zombie/npc is standing on the same level as you otherwise you will miss. Please fix all this it's been like this since release ^^^\n\n\n\nNow on to the things that Techland did right. The story was awesome. And it felt great to play as Kyle Crane again. The 3rd person cutscenes were implemented quite well, there weren't too many and they picked the right moments to switch back to 1st person. It was also good to see Kyle from another perspective where you can actually see his emotions on display. There are no boring missions and even the side missions were quality, some of them even felt like they were from DL1. The atmosphere is perfect. It has the ambience from the first game, the soundtracks are great and they absolutely nailed the horror aspect.  The behaviour of the infected is terrifying and I love that they respond to the torch shining on them. They can sneak up on you, wait for you behind corners and sometimes they just stare you down...creepy af. It also looks like they upped the gore a little bit from DL2. Though nothing beats the first games gore system.\n\nThe parkour flow is great, sometimes you can get stuck on small objects in the environment but it's a very minor issue. I have seen a lot of people complaining about parkour, unlike DL2 The Beast actually feels like a zombie game with parkour, not the other way around. DL2 parkour was too easy, too many parkour paths where it literally paves the way for you. \n\nIt could be due to how small the map is but the zombies are always looking to grab you, which I actually like because it makes them more of a threat. Plus that wont matter when legend levels and NG+ arrives because most zombies will be 1-2 hit kill. There is a lot of weight behind each swing, when you miss you really pay for it and when you hit an enemy you can feel how much damage you are doing. It feels more gritty and less like a superhero game than DL2. Though Kyle is stronger than Aiden, he feels more realistic to control, more like a human and less like a weightless monkey jumping from rooftop to rooftop.\n\n\nThere are a lot of improvements to make but in comparison to DL2 this game is a masterpiece. Considering this was only released in September I am very impressed with it's current state. Would give it 8.5/10.\n\nThings I would like to see in DL the Beast:\n\n\n*Occasionally slow down time/X ray on critical hits and kills\n*Stab/lunging stab animation for knives\n*Overhand attack when facing down with fists or melees.\n*OG block charge animation from the first game where it actually knocks zombies over.\n*Harder dark zones in the day (volatiles included)\n*More voicelines for hostile npcs, and survivors in the town hall.\n*More shops\n*Turbo boost on cars, (to throw volatiles off like in the following)\n*More takedowns/executions (currently repetitive even after update)\n*Maybe the Paraglider from DL2\n*Future DLC Missions or content\n*Hypermode event/Super crane\n*More volatile screams in chase and mid attack\n*OG screeching noise to volatiles falling from high places\n*More OG viral screams when drawn to loud noises\n*fully body OG gore system\n\nThe thing that impresses me most about Techland is their ability to listen to fans and the Dying Light community to improve their games. Thank you Techland for this banger of a game.",

      "review": "First off I would like to be entirely clear here. Most of these negative reviews are bullocks. I'm not going to lie, their are a few misses here with this game but they are few and far between. The biggest one in my personal opinion is really just the writing. The story while it isn't bad at all is a bit cliche. It is a pretty typical big bad hurt you go get revenge story. The big bad being the Baron who I do agree doesn't get enough spotlight time. I genuinely love what we have with the Baron though. And yes what ends up happening with the Baron when you finally get there. Is on the less than savory side of things. Still they genuinely wanted to make you hate him and feel resentment towards him. Could have been wrote slightly better and that's entirely true. We got what we have here though and it still works just as fine. \n\nLets get right into the game play though. Kyle Crane is back Roger Craig Smith the absolute mad lad is back voicing him and his voice is a treasure. He delivers with every line and he is back with a vengeance. Kyle Crane as we should all know by now is half man, half beast. They make it so well known in this game. You are a power house. Between the incredible combat of bashing, slashing, and shooting. And the ability to activate your beast mode going hand to hand ripping zombies into little pieces. Punching their heads clean off their shoulders. The combat feels GREAT. I can't tell you how many times I have been tickled by just how visceral the combat feels. The sounds, the incredible feeling of how smooth each strike feels against every walking corpse in your wake. Smacking a zombie so hard you blow its bottom jaw clean off. Splitting them completely in two with a solid crunchy swing. They sugar coated this combat with so many cool details. All the new abilities and returning ones feel great. They are weighty and not as floaty as the second but feel just as good as they did in the first game. Windmill my least favorite skill in the first game. Is my absolute favorite group clearing tool in this one. The skill tree is not as complex in here, but will most likely soon change with the introduction of the legends skills. What we have here though is a mix of some new mostly returning but improved skills. Then all of the skills Kyle had in the first are here. Just oriented a little different in the skill tree. They are also given to you slowly while leveling Kyle. The guns in the game while being hard to find significant amounts of ammo for are super fun. The human enemies aren't as crazy as the first games but just as dangerous. Usually carrying guns that will significantly hurt you if you aren't being smart around them. They pay attention to your cues very well. If you have a gun and they don't they will surrender now. Was not a feature at launch but due to fans bringing it up it has returned. If you are fighting them and have a fire arm. They will communicate and push you if they catch you reloading. They truthfully feel alive capable of figuring you out and pressuring you. Whether it be grouping up on you, or finding different angles to shoot you from. These bandits, and the Barons soldiers are out to get you. They will too if you don't deal with them quickly. Aside from them the typical mutations and dangerous zombies have returned. This time with a few different looks, and unique boss versions of them too. Each of them being a different form of threat. Whether hitting you with bile from a distance, lunging and leaping at you from large distances. Or the massive tank muscle monsters ready to run you down and pancake you. They all feel great to fight and should be a challenge for new players. That being said if you played the first or second game you know what you are getting into with them. You just have new tools and abilities to crush them. Each of these enemies also have unique ways to execute them too. Beast mode lets you really show them who is boss with a very well animated execution. You can even execute normal zombies in human form. All with great and gruesome glory kills basically. Like I said this game is a power trip. If you like being a badass zombie stomping menace. You will enjoy the combat here.\n\nOf course this is a dying light game. So you know you're going to be climbing buildings and jumping across rooftops. That being said this game definitely can feel a little less parkour saturated then the rest. This is a country side town with somewhat smaller buildings and less of them than the other two games. I don't understand the complaints about it though. Yes you are running around or driving a lot. Their is still a hefty amount of parkour and movement here though. It's not like the game is completely void of free running and parkour. You will be sent out to climb buildings and towers that most people would not dare to ascend. It doesn't feel repetitive or lackluster though. Plus this environment while being way more rural than the first two games is absolutely alive and breathtaking. The world here is beautiful. It fits the apocalyptic vibe that a good zombie slasher should have. It genuinely suites this type of game. Even if you aren't climbing and jumping around like the first two. It's open and vast in the country. If you go out at night and are will-nilly running around and get caught. You do not have many place to run to. You signed your own death warrant going into the open fields with volatiles. The volatiles are the one few special infected that are on your level in lethality. They will destroy you if you also don't use your head around them. You gotta think quick and move quicker. That being said it is still oh so satisfying to pummel a group of volatiles. It is entirely possible to fight back against them. It is for sure a challenge though.\n\nI am not the best at reviewing games and honestly who cares about my opinion anyways. But I will stick my neck out for Techland. I have loved Dying Light since I saw the first game announced. I still have my cheap plastic volatile mask from the announcement of the first game mounted on my wall. I love these games. I am a fan and will remain as one until Techland does something to change that. With that being said though I am incredibly happy with how much they have been listening to the fan base. This game ran very well for me at launch. Wasn't flawless for sure and I have a rig that was built in 2019. Still the game ran great and looks incredible. With recent updates though I do not even get the occasional hiccups I used to. And I know for a fact it will only get better as time goes on. Also this game was supposed to be DLC for Dying Light 2. Then they decided to release it as a standalone game. PLUS if you had the Ultimate edition of the second game they gave The Beast to you for free! Though I did pay for my copy and had no problem with that at all. Name one game dev that would ever do that in today's day and age? This game is my game of the year for 2025 and should set an example to the many greedy AAA game devs of today. Techland you kicked ass here. You showed us that you listen, care, and want to make quality games. Thank you Techland. You all have my heart.",

      "review": "[h1] Two steps forward, three back. [/h1]\n\nI'll first start by stating that I am mostly an ambivalent fan of the franchise. Zombie games ruled the landscape of 2012-2016, and Dying Light was the only exception that added anything to the stale formula that had grown old, stale and safe. The parkour, the grappling hook, Be The Zombie, and all of the other unique and special things made me both love and dislike the game. Until today, I would say DL was a great game for the time (Albeit, with its issues of the story, and the following, but that's for the past.)\n\n10 years later, and the rather unexceptional release of DL2, we have finally arrived at Dying Light: The Beast, and with Crane back, it was the signal for a return to form for the franchise, with new mechanics, and a hopefully revamped story... Or so it was to be.\n\n[h3] So how is it? [/h3]\nGood-ish. Once again, Techland hit some marks, missed (this time a lot), and missed some hits so far off the mark you can't even score it. \n\n[h2] On the World (The Map) [/h2]\nDL is a franchise that lives and dies through the parkour and movement mechanics. DL:TB does not compliment this at all. In fact, it's rather mediocre, sometimes even just bad. The Slums and Old Town of Harran perfectly complimented the mechanics of the first game, there was enough both to run, sprint, vault, wall run, ledge, perch, and climb on, without flat fields of nothing (until you reached Old Town, and even these were minor.) In TB, half of the map is literal countryside/suburbish areas. Only the Old Town of this game compliments the mechanics this franchise is best known for. Flat open fields of nothing but grass, hills, sometimes roads, a highway, and the occasional house or small building is not. This isn't as much of a problem by the first few hours of gameplay, but as soon as you get out of the Old Town and the quests of Town Hall and explore the rest of the map you realize that Techland has adopted the Ubisoft Open World model of dropping a few keypoints of interest/places to do quests in, and the rest of the world simply serves as the mandatary form of wasting your time by either having to run (or drive) your way hundreds of kilometers off in Narnia to do one specific thing of a quest, or to pick up one item. This is especially bad the second you start doing the quests for the Exiled, where they have you walk from the northernmost point of the map all the way down south for some quests. It's just clearly padding, and doesn't fit the style of the franchise whatsoever. On top of this, despite how big the map looks in the in game overlay, you'll soon realize that it's just split four ways into the Mountains/hills side of the South, the West of this games Old Town, the North of an industrial center, and the East of random homes, suburbs, and small forests. The rest of the map is unused, and just there to force you to do side missions, or hunt for specific trophies/mementos. It felt underwhelming, weak, and worst of all, just an excuse to extend the games low 16 hour campaign into more playtime. \n\n[h2] On the Gameplay (and The Beast) [/h2]\nExpect the standard DL formula. Find random weapons from the environment, from dead guys, or from quests, use them till they break, fix em, or find a new shinier weapon to replace that weapon, or a blueprint that becomes your main weapon. Nothing of this was changed. I didn't mind this in DL, and I don't mind it either in TB, but if you were a person that hated that gimmick, then don't expect anything mindblowing here. You still have to hit a zombie a couple times, dash back to regen stamina, use a bandage, and all that, at least until you get legendary weapons, where the zombies mostly become pushovers that you can kill in two or three swings, and the tension of getting swarmed is gone. However, the gore and the actual feeling of getting that hit on the zombies is incredible. The gore is Dead Island 2 tier of good, maybe even better. You can knock off parts of skulls, mandibles, break bones clearly, rip intestines, etc. It is fantastically done, very satisfying to fight enemies. Missions are mostly the same. Talk to a person, said person bosses you around, Crane does it, walk 100km to go get to said item, walk back 100km to give back said item. Still busy work, and still nothing special. As for the elephant in the room, the Beast System is nothing revolutionary, but certainly something that helps the old combat being far more enjoyable. Crane essentially tweaks out, pulls his two guns, and punches zombies/tears them in half, and against some enemies (like the dudes with the rebar hammers, or the Charger guys) you get unique and special executions to finally put the pin cushions down. The main problem is that not enough was done to make unleashing the beast more than anything of an assistance (and against bosses, a crutch). Unleashing the Beast forces you into Melee, which in difficulties like Brutal, means you can easily die in one or two hits (such as fighting some bosses of this game, the Chimeras). While this would be an awesome power fantasy, it dies the second you realize you get nothing more than punching, a ground slam, or jumping up high and slamming back down(You can also charge run, but this doesn't do much, and you can also kick, but the kick is the same generic animation with more damage). You can use the environment against the world, but you can only lift rocks/engine blocks. This was honestly the biggest mood killer for me because it would have been awesome for Crane to be able to lift up zombies, toss them like rag dolls, or even just using said zombie as a weapon, or lifting cars, fridges, desks, etc. Limiting this to two things really kills the power fantasy when Demolishers can break the floor to launch rocks at you, and you can only really throw grandmas porch rocks in response or punch him until you can do the execution. You can also scream, but this does really nothing but force a few generic zombies to stand in place. Greatly missed opportunities.\n\n[h2] On the Skilltree (and movement)[/h2]\nAnother of the games major L's is undeniably in the skill tree. The Level Cap in TB is 15, and while this wouldn't be a bad thing on its own, it is, when we compare what skills we get here versus in DL or even DL2. In TB, Crane kept almost all of his parkour abilities( Except being able to slide kick). The skills you have to unlock the rest of his movement (Vault Kicking, Rolling after dropping, the Dropkick) are all things that have been seen a thousand times already (and you even start with some, like Wall Running). In fact, for some reason, despite being \"The Beast\" Crane is rather slow and sluggish, (especially in Ledge Jumping, where you sometimes snap into a random ledge, or get richocheted up in the sky). The skill tree itself also clearly seems to be half done. Getting a blueprint for a flamethrower? Grenade Launcher? Grenades? Really? This by far has the smallest skill tree in the 3 games, and certainly the least rich one. It is probably unironically faster to just sprint normally than it is to waste your time trying to climb up unto rooftops and trying to lower yourself constantly from there. In terms of the Parkour, I would say this is the weakest of the three. DL2 had Aiden be a motorcycle, gliding, dashing, running everywhere. DL1 had you unable to even run without wasting stamina, forcing you to think where to go, where to run up to, and where to avoid enemies. In TB, you do it to explore, or to get away from volatiles. \n\n[h2] On the Story [/h2]\nTLDR, because I'm running out of characters, The Baron is an TEMU version of Albert Wesker. Betrayals happen out of circumstance, not conviction. The fact that Crane can beat Volatiles with his bare hands and shoes, letting some twink belittle him is just character assassination in the worst form.\n\n[h2] Conclusion [/h2]\n\nI was overall mostly satisfied with the game. A lot changed, a lot could be better. Get it on a sale. 6/10",

      "review": "The game is OK, but I have very important problems with it, mainly:\n\n* There is no incentive to go out at night. In older games, dark zones would be filled with loot, and would be more accessible at night, so I would wait for nights to go looting. In this game, the dark zones are the same day and night, have at most 3-4 screamers guarding it, and extremely easy to deal with. 2x exp at night is good sure, but it is not why players would go out at night. If there is no reward, only incentive would be to play for the scare element, which brings me to my second point: \n\n* Nights are harder but not scarier. The volatile spawn is so dense that it takes away the scary factor and it becomes a nuisiance. \"Oh so the sun is down now, let's spawn 10 volatiles in the near area, so the player will HAVE TO play the game as we want.\" No, I liked the old stealth part of Dying Light at night, navigating through extreme danger while hearing the hisses of volatiles. And if I get caught, and the chase starts, it is the consequence of my failed stealth attempt, not because I am forced to do so. \n\n* The map was not built with parkour in mind. Castor Woods is pretty sure, but when you take Harran as the gold standart, where everywhere you go, you climb, roll, swing, jump or a mix in between, driving place to place in Castor Woods get boring quickly. Parkour only matters when you are in the city center, but Dying Light is parkour, no one plays Dying Light for the captivating story or the memorable characters, you play it because it is the game with parkour and zombies. \n\nI still remember the \"Good night, good luck.\" trailers from the first Dying Light, and looking at The Beast now, the resemblance is there sure, but they are also so much different. Dying Light was a masterpiece, this game is just OK. I am giving a thumbs up because I like this franchise and want to see it get better, but devs, please take a step back and look at what makes this franchise \"Dying Light\".",

      "review": "Dying Light The Beast is the perfect Dying Light game. It combines all the best elements from the first two games and expands upon them, making them even better. It includes plenty of new and unique ideas too, all which are strong in execution. Techland took the feedback from the second game, and used it to truly craft the perfect Dying Light experience. This review will contain zero spoilers for story content. \n\nI will start off with my negatives for the game. These are short and not too inconsequential to the overall experience. I will get into nighttime later in the review, but the game unfortunately does have little incentive to play during night. There aren’t many missions in which you need to be out at night, and even the returning darkzones from DL2 can now be done during the day. There is a singular side quest which forces you out at night, and I wish there were more quests (story or not) which did this. While I did personally choose to venture out at night, you really don’t have to. I also wish the skill tree was bigger. Excluding the beast skills, the base skill tree is quite small and you start the game with a lot of skills preunlocked, and I would’ve preferred if these were unlockable skills instead. The skills you do get to unlock are awesome, but I wish there was more to unlock. Finally, the dialogue can be a little rough, and cheesy at times. It doesn’t drag the story down thankfully, but some lines can be quite goofy at points.\n\nNow for what I love about the game, which is pretty much everything else.\n\nThe night time, one of the most underwhelming parts of the second game, is perfect here in The Beast. It’s a shame only a few activities force you out at night, but besides this, Techland nailed night time horror. Being out at night is a death sentence, and feels terrifying. Volatiles are dangerous and deadly once again, being almost impossible to kill even within Beast mode. They feel like a true threat again, making going out at night dangerous like the first game. Being stealthy is key to avoiding chase, which can easily lead to death if not careful. Chases are also terrifying, having the most haunting and scary music, which builds up to become more tense as the chase progresses. The entire soundtrack is incredible. It has some of the best scores this franchise has seen, and I love nearly every bit of music Dying Light The Beast has.  \n\nThe combat feels satisfying again, especially with the improved gore system. Weapons feel satisfying to use, with heavy weapons feeling but also sounding heavier when you hit zombies or when just swinging them in general. Guns also are the best they have ever been in the franchise. They no longer feel like a get-out-of-jail free card nor do they feel tacked on. They’re well balanced and fun to use, and ammo being scarce forces you to always consider if using your gun is worth it. The physics also helps with making the combat feel enjoyable. Zombies react properly to being hit by different types of weapons, and it helps in making weapons feel unique and like they have distinctive ways they affect the zombies. As well as that, the ragdolls feel improved, making combat moves like the Dropkick feel fun to use again as zombies react more similarly to how they did in Dying Light 1. Combat is at its best in Dying Light The Beast. The added difficulty helps with this too. Zombies are truly dangerous this time, and everything is incredibly powerful. You cannot brute force fights. You have to be strategic in encounters. Whether you use your surroundings, lure zombies out of the pack one by one or use tools like moltovos, you have to always approach every encounter with care. Going in guns blazing will get you killed.\n\nBeast Mode is also a concept introduced, where Kyle Crane enters a volatile state and can rip through enemies like paper. This is an incredibly fun feature, and adds to combat in a positive way. It charges through killing enemies or taking damage, and as you upgrade to give Kyle more combat moves and just make it more powerful overall, it becomes a chaotic and satisfying tool, one which you also have to utilize at the best times, as it can save you in difficult encounters, both outside and inside of combat.\n\nParkour is also amazing, taking the best parts of the first two games, and making them even better while improving on the weaker areas, and adding new interesting layers. The moves Crane can do are from Dying Light 2, but there is weight to everything. It no longer feels like you’re running in zero gravity, and it feels realistic while also keeping the more satisfying and enjoyable free-running from the second game. The game also brings back driving. It varies from The Following, but it’s equally as fun. You no longer have a singular buggy to upgrade, but multiple cars you can find in the open world. The driving is enjoyable and feels great, with fuel being a tricky resource to find, with you always having to keep on top of fuel for the next drive so you don’t end up having to run across open fields. Whether you parkour or drive across Castor Woods, you will have plenty to do and explore, as the map is incredibly rich in details, has plenty of content within it and looks gorgeous.\n\nWhen it comes to the story, this is definitely the best story, being the most ambitious Techland has produced. While I won’t give spoilers, some of the characters you meet, the twists and reveals the game pulls as well as just some cool ideas they integrate, this story feels amazingly written, and was incredibly engaging. The side content was also surprising, being just as good as the main story, sometimes surpassing it at points. Certain side missions have great character development and emotional moments. They all feel unique and have purpose, containing amazing characters and moments which makes them incredibly memorable. The characters are also all amazing, and help elevate moments. Kyle Crane is amazing, and having him back is awesome. His arc and story feel satisfying, and Roger Craig Smith gives an amazing performance. This is Kyle Crane at his best. You can tell the years of experimentation have taken their toll on him, but he also still has the same charm he did back in Dying Light 1. The other characters you meet are also well developed and memorable too. These might be some of the best characters we’ve met in the franchise.\n\nOverall Dying Light: The Beast is without a doubt the best game in the franchise. It has the best parkour and combat in the series, the best and most engaging story, a killer soundtrack and nails the survival horror aspect. While it has certain flaws, they in no way shape or form drag the game down at all. While I am biased, and would personally give this game a 10/10, it is realistically a 9/10. A very strong 9/10 at that, and I would recommend anyone to play this game.",

As far as I was paying attention, the game takes place somewhere in rural France, but, like 80% of the NPCs are black or Arab or whatever lol. I know Paris is a third world dump now, but is even rural France that far gone?\n\nHonestly though, the story and writing of Dying Light has always been superfluous, and I don't really care about France, so I'm willing to overlook the obvious DEI influence for a game that's fun turn your brain off while playing and just parkour around with friends. Also doesn't hurt that it came with the CPU that I was already planning on buying.",

      "review": "Best 70 hours of my life this year.\n\nIt has everything I ever wanted from DL2: a great setting, an amazing story, catchy and likable characters, a variety of weapons and customization, looting, driving through Castor Woods, boss fights, music and sound design (!!), tons of easter eggs, etc.\n\nI could go on and on about how great this game is, but I’d like to point out three things that stand out among everything that’s good here:\n\nFirst, nights are scary af. Again. Even when you’re fully leveled. And that’s a good thing.\nSecond, the game warned me on launch that my potato laptop would fry with its 4GB GeForce 3050. That’s BS. It actually runs pretty well even on my setup.\nAnd last, but definitely not least — Kyle Crane. God, am I glad to be Kyle Crane again, and not that whiny Aiden with his “save ma sistaaah!” quest. Kyle Crane is one of the best main characters in a video game ever, and he’s back. And he’s angry. VERY angry. Long live Kyle!\n\nNow, of course, it’s not perfect. It has some flaws, one of which is that it’s SO painfully short that even I finished it within 50 hours (while picking through every scrap pile, doing dumb stuff, and just generally being slow). But it has a lot of potential. Story spoilers ahead:\n[spoiler]and they did my boy Spike dirty! That’s outrageous![/spoiler]\n\nSo if you’re a fan of Dying Light 1 and were disappointed in DL2 (like me), definitely pick up The Beast. Techland’s redemption arc with this game is so satisfying. I have high hopes we’re in for a good ride.\n\nP.S. More spoilers!\n[spoiler]They even managed to make Aiden likable! And that’s something.[/spoiler]\nP.P.S. Product received for free because being a fan of the franchise I've bought the ultimate version of DL2 and got The Beast for free as promised by Techland",

      "review": "I launched Dying Light: Beasts expecting a light zombie jogging session — maybe a few roof jumps, a sprinkle of adrenaline. Twenty minutes later, I was screaming like a cat locked in a wardrobe and begging the game for mercy, while a mutant behind me sounded like a washing machine filled with silverware. Excellent start.\n\nThe game adopted me like a newborn — threw me into a city full of the undead and said, “go on then.” And so I ran. I ran so much that my character must have the cardio of a marathon runner who also bikes to work and spends weekends sprinting up staircases for fun. Parkour feels fantastic once again: you jump, climb, dash across rooftops like Spider-Man without licensing rights — just with a higher chance of becoming someone’s afternoon snack.\n\nCombat? Pure poetry. The game let me craft a weapon out of a pipe, a battery, and sheer imagination — and it worked! I’ve never felt more like handyman Tim, except instead of building shelves I was crafting instruments of zombie reduction. And the best moment? When you kick a monster so spectacularly it cartwheels over a railing and disappears two blocks below. Yes, I laughed. Yes, I might be a terrible person.\n\nThe story acts like a friendly voice in your ear saying, “Maybe stop killing things for a second and talk to people.” The world is engaging, the characters have personality, and the humor stings like a cold shower — in a good way. Especially when an NPC insists “You’ve got this under control” at the exact moment half the city is chasing you.\n\n[b]  Final verdict: Dying Light: Beasts is a game where you laugh, panic, scream… and then immediately hit “play” again. Chaotic, gory, but irresistibly fun — perfect for anyone who wants to burn calories, build improvised weapons, and come away with stories you’ll never forget. [/b]",

My a**, this is just a cheap way of dragging out the game length with very little gain. Using the cars is not recommenden because driving feels clunky and the GPS is a disaster for some timed missions. Sometimes you have to got across the hole map just to hand in some item. That combined with the night cycles and the partly confusing building layouts kills the flow completely.\n \nNew skill tree \"offers new gameplay styles\". My a**, it's super boring and you can only beast up every few minutes anyways. Sometime I forgot about that feature completely. On the other hand, some good skills from the other games were trimmed for whatever reasons.\n\nThe rest is solid but only cecause it is build on a very strong foundation and the modding scene is very active.",

      "review": "⭐ Recommended\n\nOne of the few zombie apocalypse games I’ve genuinely enjoyed in recent times. Easily the best Dying Light experience to date. Unlike most players, I’ve always preferred Dying Light 2 over the first game — mainly because of its parkour system. The movement in the sequel has always felt smoother and more powerful to me.\n\nWhen I first started The Beast, I was a bit disappointed to see how limited the parkour felt. But as I progressed, I realized this was a deliberate design choice — and that the game more than made up for it in other ways. The tension, atmosphere, and enemy design are so well-balanced that it delivers a much stronger sense of fear and unease than the previous games.\n\nHaving played both titles, I can confidently say that The Beast is the most terrifying Dying Light experience yet. Even fully geared at the end of the game, the sight of a Volatile still made my heart race. Story-wise, playing as a vengeance-driven Kyle Crane and feeling that rage through a first-person perspective was incredibly satisfying.\n\nThe final plot twists and unexpected guests took the whole experience to another level. This is absolutely a must-play — and one of those games where reading every note and journal entry truly enhances the immersion",

      "review": "First up: This should be a neutral review, but just straight out of respect for the work I give it a thumbs up. \r\n\r\nThis is obviously a game in the Dying Light Franchise and you can feel it while playing the game, which is nice! The setting, atmosphere, enviroment nails the feeling you want to get from a post apocalyptic game. As a result from a artistic/creative view this game is very good and can be recommended. \r\n\r\nBUT there are some (for me) gameplay decisions which are just meh/not fun/suboptimal.  \r\n\r\n1. Weapon durability is a joke. The first thing I got was a mod which removed this as a whole, otherwise you are just spending hours gathering the same basic resources to repair your shit. And even while using such a mod you are spending a good chunk of gameplay gathering, which is to be expected tho.\r\n2. Stamina - yes stamina is a resource so just cant face roll the enemies. But the scaling is brutal. In the first hours of gameplay you can do like 2-3 melee hits and a dodge and you are out of stamina and get fucked. Yeah survival is hard but you play as kyle fucking crane ?? Second mod choice for me. Yes you can spam dodge/attack but for me this was the right decision for having fun in this game. \r\n3. No fast travel. This is the deal breaker for me otherwise I would really liked to 100% this game. But the sheer amount of just running across the map to get to another quest is just straight up boring. You get safe zones all across the map, why not use them as fast travel option? If the player wants to run, so do it, but give us the option. And no the cars in this game are by far no solution. \r\n(4) Loosing XP on death is just ???? I dont know why this is needed. I died in the early game 3-4 times because of adjusting to the game and i was underleveled for the main quest even after completing all side content until then.",

Fans have been asking for this, and Techland absolutely nailed the execution, respecting the legacy of the character.\n\nWhat truly shines is the [b]return to a simpler, more personal story.[/b] Forget complex faction politics and sprawling city-spanning ethical dilemmas. The Beast strips the narrative down to a high-stakes survival mission with clear objectives and immediate threats. It's focused, fast-paced, and deeply atmospheric. It reminds you of the best parts of the original game: just a few survivors, a few volatile secrets, and the terrifying knowledge that the sun is going down.\n\nThe core gameplay loop is as addictive as ever.

I am a casual player and always look for a good story line. So far I have put in about 60-ish hours of game time.  One of the few cons about the game itself is there is no teleportation train stations like dying light 2 does.  I'm hoping they add these later on.  I do think this game so far could have been a DLC.  So far, although I am enjoying it, I don't think it's worth the full price.  If you're willing to wait, I would say wait until the price drops.",

I had faith that Techland would learn from their mistakes, and they definitely didn’t disappoint. There are still a few bugs and gameplay issues, but none are significant enough to impact overall gameplay. I also think they could’ve done more with the car mechanics, but it’s still similar to The Following DLC, which is nice enough. I’m not a huge fan of the map, but maybe that’s just because it’s more difficult to maintain momentum with parkour. Overall, the map is great, and it doesn’t feel as repetitive as it did in Dying Light 2. Honestly, this game has the hardest nights of the entire series. Some people might not like that, but I think it’s perfect. Nights should make you feel dread. I really enjoyed the collectibles. They found a good balance, not too hard but not too easy to find them. I’ve spotted some easter eggs and references to previous games, but knowing Techland, there are probably more that I haven’t found yet. Boss fights aren’t my favorite, and there are quite a few of them, but aside from 2-3, most aren’t too hard if you use the right weapons and tactics. There are new zombie variants and they are cool but I expected some unique ones with unique mechanics which is a bit disappointment. Combat is smoother and more satisfying, and the variety of weapons and gadgets gives you more freedom for your gamestyle. The side quests are fine, some are a bit boring, but none are terrible. I won’t spoil anything, but yes, the story does start a little clunky. Just give it time, and it’ll definitely age like fine wine.",

      "review": "Dying Light: The Beast is an exhilarating return to the fast-paced, parkour-driven world that fans of the series have loved from the very beginning. From the moment the game starts, it becomes clear that Techland has pushed its formula to new heights, blending intense action, fluid movement, and a darker, more atmospheric narrative into a cohesive and deeply engaging experience. What stands out immediately is how confidently the game builds on the strengths of its predecessors while introducing fresh ideas that enhance every moment of gameplay.\n\nThe parkour system, long considered one of the series’ defining features, reaches a new level of refinement in The Beast. Movement feels sharper, more intuitive, and more dynamic than ever before. Whether you’re sprinting across rooftops, vaulting over obstacles, or throwing yourself into daring leaps between crumbling structures, the game makes traversal feel like an essential part of the adventure rather than just a means of getting from one objective to another. The new animations and fluid transitions contribute to a sense of momentum that encourages experimentation and rewards skillful play. It’s easy to lose yourself for hours just exploring the world and pushing the limits of what you can do.\n\nCombat is another area where the game truly shines. The melee system feels visceral and weighty without sacrificing responsiveness. Enemies react convincingly to your strikes, and the game’s physics contribute to a feeling of authenticity that makes each encounter memorable. The addition of new enemy types, including menacing mutated variants, adds depth and variety that keep the action feeling fresh even many hours into the campaign. The Beast Mode mechanics—one of the game’s standout features—introduce a thrilling power fantasy element. Being able to tap into your character’s monstrous strength adds a strategic layer to combat that elevates the gameplay without overpowering it.\n\nThe world itself is beautifully crafted, with a level of detail that encourages exploration and immersion. From sunlit streets overrun with vegetation to eerie, fog-shrouded industrial zones, every location feels alive and thoughtfully designed. The ambient soundscape and atmospheric lighting work together to create a sense of tension even when nothing is happening, ensuring that the world itself becomes a constant source of both wonder and danger. The day-night cycle remains integral to the experience, and nighttime sequences are as nerve-racking and adrenaline-fueled as ever.\n\nNarratively, Dying Light: The Beast takes a more emotional and morally nuanced approach. The game explores themes of identity, survival, and the blurry line between humanity and monstrosity. The writing is stronger this time around, with character interactions that feel meaningful and choices that carry real weight. While the story is darker, it never feels oppressive—there is always a glimmer of hope or a reminder of what the characters are fighting for.\n\nPerhaps most impressive is how polished the game feels overall. Technical performance is smooth, load times are fast, and the world is dense without feeling cluttered. It’s clear that a lot of passion and care went into the game’s development.\n\nIn the end, Dying Light: The Beast is not just a worthy successor to the franchise—it’s one of its highest points. It blends heart-pounding action, a gripping atmosphere, and a surprisingly heartfelt story into an unforgettable experience. Fans of the series and newcomers alike will find plenty to love. If you’re looking for a game that delivers intensity, emotion, and endless replayability, The Beast is a must-play.",

      "review": "This game is very short compared to the other two games. In co-op with one other person it took us 26 hours to beat the main story, do most of the sidequests, and loot most of the darkzones/safehouses/etc on the map (all the ones with meaningful rewards). So honestly I can't recommend buying this game at full price, but if it's on sale for $30 or less and you like the franchise then it's just more of the same.\n\nIt's exactly the same as the other games where it's brutally hard at the start and then it gets easier as you play and level up, and it doesn't take very long at all to reach max level and max beast level (or at least get all of the perks that you want). There is quite a grind for materials but it's made easier by a certain armor set and weapon trinket that boost the amount of loot you get.\n\nAt least compared to the second game I felt like the looting in this one was less fun and much more one note. In the second game I enjoyed needing to parkour occasionally to find the high up crates, and I was actually excited to loot convoys because they gave things you needed. Dark zones were diverse and challenging and even just looting random houses was still rewarding (absolutely loved the rooftops with the honey and chamomile and whatnot too). \nIn this game, all necessary loot can be obtained from dark zones, and all dark zones are more or less the exact same. There's only 2 enemy types that ever show up (one of them being the basic zombies) and they even reuse the same buildings for some of them. \n\nI feel the same way about the parkour as well. The second game had ledge grab sections, wall run sections, pole grab sections, rope sections, and sections where you needed to use your grappling hook and/or glider. This game has ledge grab sections... and that's pretty much it. There's no glider, and you do get a grappling hook but you can't climb up or down it like a rope and it's never necessary for the parkour. Not sure why they simplified the parkour to such an extreme, but 9 times out of 10 the hardest part is just finding where you need to start climbing because it's almost never marked (same if you're looking for a way to get into a building, we spent a lot of time just lost on where exactly to go just because there was always only a general area quest marker).\n\nThe combat is more or less the same as the other games, though they nerfed dropkicks quite a bit just by dramatically decreasing the amount of spike walls that are in the game (they still exist but are much less frequent). Outside of propane tanks they also reduced the amount of environmental weapons a lot, there's only one of them in this game (throwable only rebar spear) and it's rarely used. \n\nThere are even less of the challenges in this game. The other games have ones for parkour, combat, and driving, but this game only has the driving ones (and at a certain point we could no longer do them because they would softlock our game every time we tried). \n\nAs for the co-op, it was definitely one of the more annoying games that I've played co-op. Every player has to be Kyle Crane, and virtually every single action that's even remotely tied to a quest, no matter how small, requires that all players are standing within 5 feet of it. Doesn't matter if all you're doing is pressing a button, or opening one door, or picking up one item, all players have to be there to watch it happen. There are dozens and dozens of 1-2 second cutscenes where you just do one thing and then the cutscene ends, so many that my friend and I came up with a headcanon that we were two twin brothers who were pretending to be the same person so we could only do anything if we were both standing there one behind the other so it looked like we were just one guy. This means that if you ever want to split up for any reason, there's very few things that either of you are able to do by yourselves to actually progress your game in any way that won't just teleport the other player to you at one point or another. \n\nProbably my biggest complaint about the game (besides getting softlocked by the driving quest, map markers disappearing every session and occasionally getting stuck inside the map geometry) is that there's no fast travel. I guess the reason for this is that there are drivable cars you can use, and you get a grappling hook halfway through which helps as well. The cars are stupidly realistic, with the proper dashboard symbols popping up when you're low on gas / vehicle damaged / etc, a short pause whenever you use the horn because you have to move your hand over to it, and windshield wipers that turn on when the windshield is wet or dirty. However despite all this attention to detail, and cars being the main method of transportation, they lack any radio or boost functionality (not even in the driving challenges). No idea why as those seem like obvious things to have, ESPECIALLY if it's the main method of transportation since there's no fast travel. My honest opinion is that they didn't include fast travel in order to make the game take longer to complete, because it would have been ridiculously short if there was fast travel.",

Not many blueprints in the game you need to do EE's or secrets to find some weapons to get the blueprints shame you cant buy any in the shop (thats just my opinion i don't mind EE blueprints but better to buy blueprints from the shop as well) Looting is fine i enjoyed grinding loot from darkzones or from the trade or killing humans/zombies maxing out all my stuff. All in all a really fun game to play with friends hopefully they do further updates to this game. I prefer this one over dying light 2 wasn't a fan of the 2nd game hopefully my review helps",

So when I heard that Dying Light: The Beast was a return to form and featured Kyle Crane again, I was excited to check it out, and I had a great time.\r\n\r\nThe parkour and combat remain the best part about these games, it's really fun to be hopping, skipping, and jumping around everywhere and then bashing some infected skulls in. Beast mode is a great addition that came with some really cool abilities.\r\n\r\nLike the previous games, the story is nothing to write home about, it still plays out like a standard, tropey action movie. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it means that the story is fairly predictable. One thing I didn't like about the story is that the [spoiler]Baron, the Big Bad Evil Guy of the game, and the Beast, only really appear at the very beginning and the very end, and with the way I played the game, I almost totally forgot about the Beast because it had been so long since his first appearance in the game.[/spoiler] The rest of the story is formulaic, help out the other survivors, hunt a Chimera, rinse and repeat until you get them all.\r\n\r\nI didn't really run into any technical issues, the game ran pretty well on my Ryzen 7 5700X3D/RTX 3080. A few areas had some lower framerates, but not enough to bother me.\r\n\r\nSeems like Techland wants to keep working on these games, and I'm all for it, they're really fun to play.",

The problem because the volitile spawn seems to be way to high and it creates a situation where when the sun sets its not longer a fun or intersting thing, it becomes a chore and completely breaks the flow of the game. \n\nFor example, im literally writting this review as i sit in a corner alt tabbed while i wait for day because i dont wanna run half way across the map to sleep, just to run back to the exact same spot and do what i need to do, and I cant go out because they have like 4 or 5 of the volitiles all patrolling around me. So rather then having an intersting game play mechainc, they created a flow interrupting chore. \n\nDL1 had a lot better night feeling because yes it was deadly at times, but you could at least get around it and work around it, This just feels like busy work. \n\nPick it up on a sale.",

      "review": "Whilst the story has a pretty strong opening, I can't say I can really recommend it. As someone who loved the first game when it came out, sank hundreds of hours and has done multiple 100% playthroughs on different platforms, it's a bit painful to say this game was quite underwhelming after the first session. I didn't properly play Dying Light 2 as the changes to the engine and combat etc. felt awful and underwhelming. I wanted to like this game, finished it and tried taking a couple breaks etc. but I just couldn't, so fair warning, I'm going to be quite negative.\r\n\r\nI played this game co-op with a friend the whole way, and it was probably the only reason I was able to finish it. The story opens up years after the events of the expansion of the first game, The Following, which in the canon ending, had Kyle infected and turned into a volatile. It picks up during his capture and experimentation which turns him half-human, and half-volatile which is an interesting concept and allows for a lot of brutality when you first active Beast Mode, which essentially fills up like a Rage meter in God of War by doing a bunch of damage.\r\n\r\nWhilst Beast Mode is cool, it becomes really underwhelming and by the half way point, basically worse than any of the weapons you find, which is a shame because it's one of the main selling points. That and the damage resistance to a point also isn't worth it and your hands become sponges whilst an enemy can backhand you and knock you flat. Also the volatiles were hyped up to be coming back (at launch this time), and they are just way too powerful even in the endgame, and in Patrol Level 1, they spawn too many and seem to be able to just spot you through walls when they shouldn't be able to, making it more of a chore, and they also can spit essentially sniper rounds at you now as an excuse to hit you underwater or whilst you're climbing.\r\n\r\nThe quests whilst the opening is strong, rapidly degrade having Kyle essentially do chores that he doesn't even want to do, which was a point in the first game, but he did it to help and also maintain his cover as he cared about everyone he met, whereas in this game, he openly says he doesn't care and it's not his problem but does it anyway. The objectives have you running like an insane person from one side of the map to the other, like a GTA Online mission which just adds a bunch of filler and wastes your time. Another part of this is the part zombie people who can talk telepathically to you and need to tell you something in person for some reason, which instead, could've just been an email, again wasting your time. Killing the Chimera's or the Bosses for Kyle to get extra powers is really cool the first few times, but it ends up becoming the same fights with there not really being any weaknesses to them other than just 'hit it till it dies', and watching the same finishing animation you've seen three times, and then you can get a new skill you're unlikely to use more than once.\r\n\r\nThe Baron, the main villain is just the typical, evil British dude who wears turtlenecks and kills people because it's shocking, which is what a lot of the last bit of the game is. The characters you meet are extremely stupid and only really exist to move the plot, for example, The Sheriff is there just to betray you which is very obvious and then shows up at the end to be helpful, and then when it's revealed who The Beast is, Aiden decides to not listen and basically make half of the game meaningless after agreeing he would listen, just to move the plot and extend the game further.\r\n\r\nThe last two boss fights, being The Beast on normal difficulty has you get two shot whilst you're not allowed to hit him, and for some reason you aren't allowed to bring your own healing items or own weapons which is just difficulty balancing because the devs knew you'd be too powerful by this point so you need to be nerfed. The Baron has two phases for a boss fight which is him dropping grenades so you can't kill him too fast, or in his second, has him have an insta-kill attack with a shockwave. Both of these fights are not designed with co-op in mind and essentially makes it near impossible to get revives as The Beast and the second Baron fight artificially speed the bosses up to catch you to prevent you from reviving, make it a boring experience if somebody is knocked down.\r\n\r\nFinally, the gear score system is just a chore and means you need to look for a shirt that does 11 armour for some reason, instead of just being able to level up the stat like before. It's cool that you can still change the cosmetic, but it's just another chore instead of wanting to reward players for killing zombies in a zombie game to level them up, to make them more powerful at killing zombies. They had it basically all correct in the first game, but like the second game, made so many meaningless changes that ruin and take away from the experience, to the point they had to market how much this game was a return to form, which whilst in some elements is, also isn't and it's quite pitiful it's what a lot of the marketing was about. But hey, they sequel bait at the end so maybe there's another chance they can do the same again...\r\n\r\nMight've missed a couple things, and again, sorry for being so negative, but this game just further shows where the second one went so wrong with the gameplay, whilst being an improvement in some areas, killing it others completely.",

But this feels more dumbed down than the DL2.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere - barely there.\r\nCombat - after Dead Island 2 - boring.\r\nSkill tree - a joke.\r\nZombie grabs - had to mod it for it to go away.\r\nStory - possibly the worst straight to DVD crap I've played.\r\nSide quests - for now they are ok.\r\nStore - not necessary to exist.\r\nCharacter motivations, both Crane and Antagonist - just what.\r\n\r\nLocations feel like a theme ride. Never been to one, mind you, but the castles, medieval streets, big castle gates and fences - they all feel like a theme park. Fake, bland. I love the small apartments with curtains hanging in front of windows, there is an amazing mood there, but when you've seen the same apartment or attic layout for the 10th time, it feels boring.\r\nSame goes for the dead zones, which all, in the city, feel same.\r\n\r\nCombat is meh. After Dead Island 2 I feel that it's so boring, so barebones. Barely any gore/impact. Just smash and bash same two moves over and over again. Not a single addition to the combat since the first game. It just isn't fun.\r\nStamina is so little that it doesn't sit right with roided up Crane.\r\n\r\nIn skill tree it's just the same stuff from DL1, just locked now. Except for the Beast skill tree.\r\nBut the regular skill tree is just basic stuff like dropkick etc. And the skill tree is sooo small.\r\n\r\nThe ways that zombies grab you every 3 seconds is a joke. I had to mod it out because it wasn't playable.\r\n\r\nThe story I thought will hook me up. Crane was experimented on for years and he finally breaks free.\r\nAntagonist is a cookie cutter basic evil guy who just wants to experiment on stuff and make dangerous zombies more dangerous. Why? What for? Why people are working for him? Do they have no choice? How he is taking care for them? Why he is in charge of it?\r\nIt would be so damn refreshing to see a story behind that. Crane breaks free, gets to the barracks, or apartments or wherever these hundreds of scientists are living in, seeing that they are just desperate people who try to survive the apocalypse. But no, just a generic underground lab until you are free.\r\nThe first dialogue he had with the female lead whose name I forgot because she was such a basic character - it was laughably bad. I thought that they are just joking around with that. All those angry Crane responses and generic explanations the female lead gave him, just wow.\r\nAnd now Crane wants to stop the Baron, the antagonist, and that's just it. Just kill him. Because he was experimented on. Crane is sane, a good guy, even after so many years of being a hostage being and experimented on.\r\n\r\nSide quests felt ok, because they were with some story behind them. That I love in games that came after Witcher 3, because there almost every quest was with some backstory or development. Here it feels similar, just on a much smaller scale. There are fetch quests, but they are not that painful.\r\n\r\nI don't understand why you need the store for. Just craft everything and find everything. In store you sell stuff and you don't need to buy anything. At least I felt that I get everything from looting and crafting.\r\nNo big thing that you are saving money for, no permanent upgrades, nothing.\r\n\r\nEvil guy is evil, good guy is good. Good guy wants to stop the evil guy from doing random, pointless evil things. No emotions, no motivations, just something a child watching 90s movies would come up with.\r\nIt feels like an unfinished DLC. Which I heard that it was?\r\nNo new mechanics, bullshyt story, average gameplay, no sense of progression. Just a chore to play.\r\n\r\nAfter writing this review I understood that I hate this game.\r\nMight try to finish it though.",

I liked the story especially since it's about Kyle Crane's comeback and the plot twist at the end. First half was really interesting and motivating to play, second half was a dissapointment. It immensely lacked that uniqueness that the first two games had. Game is too short, wish there was more content to the story. like how DL1 had bounty challenges and PvP, and how DL2 was extremely story rich and had choices that changed the storyline. \nBoth DL1 and DL2 had two big worlds, many different challenges, lots of parkour, more achievements and collectibles, lots of side quests, the list goes on. This game has half of all that.\n\nDL1 left me speechless for days after I finished it, it had the best graphics, combat, HUD, mechanics. DL2 I played through at least 4 times to get try out the different endings, picking the \"wrong\" choices that led to consequences broke me. It was so story rich that I felt hooked and it opened up my eyes for story rich games in general. Dying Light The Beast gave me nothing. Map is so small and too open, wished there would be more buildings that were also tall to actually climb and do some parkour. That quest where you get warned to \"climb a tall tower\" to install a radio transmitter on was very anti-climcatic... I thought it was going to be like VNC tower but instead it was a little radio tower...... The story at the end could have been improved together with the final boss fight.\n\nThis game felt rushed, and it should have stayed as a DLC for DL2 as it was originally intended. Not worth the price I paid in terms of Dying Light series. Finished it in 50 hours and that was me trying to stretch it as much as possible.",

For example, what I mean is that the map is 80% forest (I have no problem with that), but the core gameplay relies on parkour to escape the volatile, so it's impossible to escape them at night in the forest if a chase occurs. The night is terrifying and dark, just like in the first game, which is a good point. Another negative is that the Collecting materials from military convoy vehicles as well as abandoned locations are a copy-paste of the DL2. Damn, I hated the game because of this. Couldn't they have added something new at least? The side quests are great and varied, but there's no point-to-point travel, which is bad. You have to walk or use the damn car that goes at 30 miles per hour, and its physics aren't great. My bicycle is faster than it, As for the story, it didn't appeal to me at first. The beginning was cold and discouraging, but as time passed and we went deeper, especially the ending, it was shocking. I didn't expect new characters to appear in this way.

So... that's what this is.\n\n1 hours — NEGATIVE — That was the most rushed, throw all the story beats at the wall and see what sticks, make as many narrative leaps as possible to get to the cool stuff we made, weak as water opening I've ever seen in my life. I know Crane is a big strong demi-zombie boy now but come on... you can't just say \"I've been tortured for 13 years and I want to die\" and then have him take down one of the few world bosses you put in the game, in the same breath.

Areas are level gated (not sure if that's the term), but can be explored to major frustration, filled with bullet sponge enemies.

Hell, some side quests even have some of the best writing I've seen in the franchise, which admittedly is a low bar, but I want to mention it anyway.\r\n\r\nBut that's about where the improvement ends.\r\n\r\nIt's actually crazy how I find so many aspects of DL2 better than The Beast.

It's only really worthwhile if you're a diehard fan and you get it on sale I guess.\r\n\r\nIf I didn't stream it on my YouTube channel, I probably would've never finished the game in the first place.",

      "review": "The game was not what I was expecting after DL 1 & 2. I don't think its a bad game overall but it was a frustrating playthrough and the game felt clunky compared to previous titles. I just finished the game and wanted to unload my thoughts. It will seem like a little bit of a ramble but will cover all/most areas of the game. I played on Brutal, and it took me 36 hour\n\nThe combat was slowed down quite a bit and the physics of the melee combat did feel pretty good. Although zombies did nothing but simply grab you and cause the HOLD F or Press E animation and it really got annoying throughout the play through. You can shove them left or right but then another one grabs you...it was really silly.\nI remember spending hours fighting zombies with no clear objective except gaining EXP in previous titles because there were so many traps, abilities, items and locations to fight in, and there was a reason to actually perform combat since you had multiple skill trees. In the Beast i just ran past everything. The world is completely boring and dead and there is nothing to do except spend 5-10 minutes running to each quest objective. The \"loot zones\" are exactly the same across the entire map. You have convoys and stores/buildings you go into. It wasn't good in dying light 2 and its not good here. You crouch into a store. Kill the screamer, grab the loot and walk out. Its just slapped together and there is absolutely no reason to really do them since gear does nothing in the game. I equipped all gear score 7-9 with stats and then fought with no gear on, there was no difference and felt like it was just something to keep you busy with no real benefit. \nThere are power stations, safe towers and silos to \"clear\" but they are all exactly the same. I just dont get why it was copy pasted, except for one that had a small climb session to it which was fun for 2 minutes. These areas all have 1 big baddie, 1 range guy on a roof, and a couple small zombies to kill, then just flip a switch. The gameplay was just mind numbing at that point and clearing them all for the achievement was really the only reason to do them. They offered nothing in return except some radio chatter back and forth between the person who assigned you the quest. Driving in the game seems pointless. You simply just run over every zombie you see and go about 25mph. It was faster to just run in a straight line jumping over everything then to drive to an objective, most the time. Night time was really boring. I have read other reviews stating the night time was so much fun....im not sure what they find fun about it. Myself, I noticed they just constantly spawned volatiles in your path no matter what you did. You can outrun them to a safe house but the chase felt so bland. No tools to fight them, no look back, no traps and the EXP you get for surviving a chase is exactly the same no matter how long the chase is or what you accomplished. And its about +215 exp. And when you need 40-60k to level, it just didnt feel fun or worth it. The buildings are also set up so strange and the pathing for fun parkour runs just really didnt exist. I had so much fun in previous titles getting to a highpoint, finding a path and then running it....this just didnt have it. It was so clunky running around building to building which just looked all the same and the only thing connecting them is some simple power lines. I dont know how they got this wrong this time but it just felt off. Thats about all for the world...it really had nothing to impress and offered no exploration of any kind. The collectibles and notes were poorly placed and offered no good back story to anything unfortunately. \n\nThe story was extremely predictable. Every double cross, every plot point, every \"twist\" was just so obvious. The ending was really the only good part of the story because something ACTUALLY happen. (Poor Spike). \nThe side quests were better than the main story in this one for me. Two really good quests where you help a hippie telepath with a few things really stood out. The voice acting was on point and the emotion you felt from the side quest story was genuine. (the night around the campfire)\nThe story of The Beast was non existent up until the end. The main story just felt like you were a simple errand boy literally running for 10 minutes of real time from one base to another base. \"Kyle, go run to the power substation and flip the power on, then run all the way back here...oh yea now that you're back can you run back to the power substation again\". It just felt like the quests did not flow right. It always had you backtracking SO much. I know thats how other Dying Light games were, but the worlds were so much more interesting with challenges, side quests and survivors and random loot spots, that running through the world felt worth it rather than a simple chore. In the Beast, (the blue exclamation points) AKA the save the survivor and loot the box spawns were all exactly the same. Half the time the survivor would die within about 5 seconds or you would save them and get $45 currency or some rags. It felt so pointless and i ended up skipping them after doing about a dozen of them. \nThe military convoy was a chore as well. Kill a couple zombies, loot a key card and open up the door for the same loot over and over. Ammo was so easy to get it never really felt required to do them. \nThe bosses if you can call them that were probably the worst in the series. Juiced up spongy health bars with each enemy doing the same 2 attacks. I was expecting more environmental/traps/creative use of items to kill them but there was nothing in the arena for each boss. You could simply sit and throw exploding knives until they are dead or just dodge and swing away. It was the same as fighting zombies on the streets. The only times i died in the boss fights were to the random zombies that spawned during the fight. I thought it was just lazy. The chimeras were a huge let down in design and execution. To button up my feelings on the story, it had some decent cinematics and was fun to see everyone in 3rd person. The models were good, the voice acting was decent in most parts and the writing was as good as it could be with the story it had to tell. Nothing really wrong with that area of the game. \n\nBeast Mode. I have 0 good things to say about beast mode. It feels like a pointless mechanic in the game. The skills are useless in almost all situations. The fact you have to build it up randomly just to be able to use it sucks. It does not feel good and is never available when you truly could have used it. You just have to take damage or get melee hits over and over to use it. It just does not fit in the game at all. I tried being creative and using the skills in unique ways but there was never a time to do so. Using it in boss fights was useless as well. Since hitting bosses in beast mode reduces the time you have left in beast mode way more than just hitting normal zombies. A full bar would last under 10 seconds and do about 15% of the boss health bar. (played on brutal)\nHalf the time I would forget it was there because it wouldn't help at all in fights.\n\nPerformance was really good right out of the gate. I have a MSI 4090, i9-14900k and DDR5 64gb of ram. The game ran a smooth 144fps with DLSS set to DLAA (native 4k). I had 0 crashes during the 36 hours and not even one drop that I can remember. Techland really knows how to make a great game in terms of optimization. 0 complaints there. \n\nAll in all i give the game a 6/10. I think its very obvious that this was a planned DLC for Dying Light 2 and I think more time could have been pumped into it to simply make it a real sequel to Dying Light 1. I think the game needed another zone, more interesting world activities, more characters, better gear progression, and it should have kept the 3 skill trees like the previous titles. Leveling just felt pointless since you know you were going to get all the skills anyway.",

There are no small outposts with merchants on the level so if you want to stock up on resources you have to run or drive from 1 corner to another.\n\nThe map is a huge downgrade from DL1. The only major city has tall buildings which is not as fun to navigate as the 1 story Haran favellas. A good third of the map is an open field than you have to run through or drive if you are lucky to have a car nearby. The map is much smaller than DL1.\n\nFar less zombies than in DL1 and there are far fewer agressive runner zombies. The campaign is ok. Cringey James Bond-style villain and a few cool moments that set you the player on the road of revenge. But it felt like an extended tutorial that tries to slowly sell mechanics over each mission, rather than a story than integrates you into the world of the game.

Also parkouring is the glitchiest yet, with you getting magnetized and stuck on the clutter of the map, mainly when scaling the side of buildings or trying to climb up overhangs. I have gotten stuck on the corner of a trash bin and get in a climbing loop to nowhere multiple times now. That was not an issue in the first two games. There is no fast travel either which is actually really annoying. I know they were trying to add to the realism and immersion, but all it does is piss me off when the game inevitably crashes and I have to run across the map again to a mission or location, which it doesn't save, just for it to crash AGAIN and do it all over again because they can't bother to throw in a time/location based autosave system. Instead it is based on completion of missions. Just spent an hour having fun roaming around killing zombos and collecting tons of XP and loot? Well too bad, your game just crashed for the fourth time in an hour and a half and its gone. I give up and am going to go play something that actually works while I wait the several months it will take to fix the crashing issue. What a disappointment.

      "review": "The only reason this is getting positive reviews is because the bar was set so incredibly low with the second game. To be fair, they fixed many issues from the second, but not enough.\n\nIts a decent game held back by a lack of QA and downright bad design. Why would you give the player all these fun tools, and then punish them when they use them? Cars, guns, grenades, even the new rage mode, the primary selling point of the game, everything you do just spawns virals all around you. The most iconic feature of Dying Light is the parkour, and the game even says to stay on the rooftops because zombies cant climb, and then it spawns zombies on every single roof. How exactly did they get there? \n\nZombies are still incredibly grabby. Why are they able to grab someone from outside the range of a two handed axe? The special zombies are terrible. Spitters have perfect tracking and a flat trajectory. Why is there a zombie whos special attack is to jump on another zombies shoulders and then defy physics as they slowly drift toward you? It flies at you so slow that you dodge early, but then it homes in on you mid air. \n\nThe non zombies are the biggest problem though, because they are all still martial arts masters. You swing, they dodge, you run out of stamina, they kill you. Your stamina bar is so pathetically small despite being a genetically modified super human. And thats assuming you can even get close to them, because apparently regular humans are able to spit fire in this world.\n\nUltimately its just more of the same. The beast mode is the only new feature here, and its pretty underwhelming. Definitely not enough to make up for the constant cable puzzles and repairing your weapons every ten seconds.",

Unlike the first two games' story, in DLTB I was just doing things to get to the end goal of getting your revenge on The Baron, not like I was actually a part of it. I really wanted to see character development with The Baron, but we never even saw him until the end of the game. The story of the first two DLs was very immersive to me, I was actually invested. But for this game, I just felt nothing the entire time while playing it. Kyle has become a complete pushover; even Aiden, the guy who just loves getting punched in the face, had more backbone compared to him. Every time Crane gets betrayed goes like this:\n- \"You betrayed me!\"\n- \"But Kyle, I had no choice!\"\n- \"Ah, okay\".\nThe majority of side quests are just kill- or fetch-quests, and sometimes objectives are located at the opposite sides of the map, forcing you to either use a car which breaks down from a couple of hits or get there on your own feet, which can hardly be called enjoyable, since the locations where you can actually take advantage of your parkour skills are incredibly scarce. I find nothing unique about this game except for the map, I do love the map, but everything else is dissapointing, even vehicles just felt so empty. Somehow, human combat became even more unfair, with them getting mandatory i-frames no matter what you do in cq-combat. The player menu is just snatched from DL2, which sure, I do like the DL2 player menu, but when I pay $60 for a game and wait two months for it to come out, it just felt stale and old. I did get excited when we figured out near the end that THE Beast was , but he got little to no time on screen, and he was basically useless. The Baron was such an interesting character when I first saw the trailers, I wanted to see more. But all we got was, once again, pure dissapointment - just a generic villain who is evil just for the sake of being evil. Crane's famous \"Beast Mode\" is literally just Aiden's occasional Volatile powers from DL2. The Chimeras were really lackluster to fight the whole time, each of them having just one single gimmick, and once you figure it out, it's just smashing lmb 'till you win. When I saw that  came back very late into the game, I was excited, an old character we, Kyle Crane, haven't seen in years. But guess what, , yet another useless character along with  in DLTB. Dark Zones aren't worth going in anymore, the map is so open it can be hardly be called a \"parkour game\" anymore, just call it a \"walking and fighting game\" instead. Nights are no longer entertaining/challenging compared to DL1 and DL2 - they are just frustrating - there is no incentive to go outside at night and both the strength and durability of volatiles have been cranked to 11, so they are able to easily swarm and dispatch you even in beast mode, while not dropping anything useful if you do manage to kill one. The amount of content available to a player is really dissapointing as well. The entire game can be cleared in under 20 hours without taking any side-quests into account. I cleared the entire game without any rush whatsoever along with all the available content (side-quests, safe zones, blueprints) in under 40 hours and found myself with nothing else to do in the game. Genuinenly have no idea what people with 80+ hours played are doing to entertain themselves at that point, just looting the same areas over and over and running around in circles, i guess. If this game did end up being a fairly priced DL2 DLC, I would have been happy with it. But no, Techland just had to make a whole new $60 game just because people whined enough. Now I almost feel ashamed purchasing this, everything I got was not worth it. Seeing the endless glaze just feels so hilarious, it's like people are completely blind or just choose to ignore any downsides this game has just because they get to see their favorite Crane once again. Comparisons to DL2 became even more absurd, especially since this game is just DL2 in a shiny new wrapping, like someone saying DLTB has a much better grappling hook compared to DL2 when it's literally the same hook, no changes whatsoever. \"Love letter to the community\"? \"Sequel we have all been waiting for\"? What an absolute joke.\nOverall, the story is short, bland and predictable, gameplay feels clunky, barely any \"parkour\" to speak of, unreasonably high game price and useless, boring vehicles. Finished it once, did all there's to do in the game, have no desire to keep on playing. Not a bad game, for sure, but definitely not the \"10/10\" people are raving it to be. A 5/10 game at best. But, in the end of the day, that's just my take on this game. If you really enjoyed it - good for you! Your opinion is just as valid as of those who didn't.\nEdit: Now that the roadmap is out, I guess it's safe to say that any remaining support for DL2 has also been effectively axed - a good number of promised features are yet to be implemented, and, unlike before, this roadmap doesn't even mention DL2. Only cosmetics up ahead, I suppose, right until the end of this joke of a \"support\". Way to go, Techland. Also, all of those brand new future additions should've been here at launch. Especially since this game's development started as a part of DL2, I can't possibly imagine it to be that difficult to add. Ah, and FOMO makes its grand entrance once again, just what I needed.\n\nCREDITS TO https://steamcommunity.com/id/FlappyBrecken/",

I have asked lots of people and they have told me that they enjoyed the game, so don't let my review (or other negative reviews) dissuade you from giving the game a try.\n\nI am so disappointed. I was never really big into the Dying Light franchise, but I enjoyed the first game, and was interested in the second one (Haven't gotten around to finishing it, though). The hype around this game and the way my friends were talking about it made it sound like an amazing entry in the Dying Light franchise.\n\nThe tutorial for this game hyped me up to play it. Parkour didn't interest me much, but it's an improvement over the previous two games. Story was interesting enough to keep me engaged, rather than switching off dialogue and playing the game on mute. Combat on the other hand? Weapons feel like paper mache, and zombies take 10 hits to kill, not to mention your stamina drains after 2-3 hits, so you need to back off for a good few seconds for it to regenerate. I didn't want to drop the game immediately, because I was holding out hope that later weapons and skills would rectify me feeling weak. After all, there is a similar feeling in DL1 and 2 where your best options in the beginning are to use environmental traps or stealth to clear zombies.\n\nBut then you are forced into a boss fight. The boss itself was 3 attack patterns, repeated over and over, then a \"fourth\" one added in during the second phase. Also, the boss has a stupidly high amount of health, and can only be attacked briefly. The entire fight felt so tedious and frustrating. The whole fight involved me kiting the boss around the arena to avoid damage (Or take some, because the boss floats over to your location in the middle of attack patterns that I clearly dodged out of the way of?), then attack it in the brief window of time that it is staggered. I died twice before defeating it, and I'm willing to admit that I'm not the greatest at games, but even on my first attempt, I could tell the boss was going to be annoying.\n\nAfter I cleared that boss, I was hoping those types of bosses would be uncommon, possible reserved to key story events, or that it would be a minute until I fight another boss that is similar. Nope, the story mission right after is another boss fight that involves you kiting a similar zombie around the arena, with slightly different attacks.\n\nI didn't buy Dying Light: The Beast to play first person open world zombie souls-like, I bought it to play the parkour FPS survival game that I was familiar with in DL1 and 2.",

Small, disconnected, few things of interest, too much fucking water, and barely any cool spots to parkour.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of: You like parkour? Here, have long stretches of woods/open fields with frequant rivers you have to slowly swim across. Want to drive a buggy then? Here's a generic ass truck with no possible upgrades or real customization or effort unless you get two perks that make you use less gas and not destroy them as easy. \r\n\r\nStory is predictable as hell tbh, and contradicts itself more than once. The infected lore was alright, and semi-interesting but goes nowhere and is contradicted within the game. Blatantly so. Kyle rambles on about revenge again and again, then doesn't take it.\r\n\r\nParkour fucking sucks, did I mention that?\r\n\r\nBeast mode is okay, and loses it's luster quick when it takes five hits at max level to kill a single biter sometimes. The plot point around it is....nonexistent to be honest.\r\n\r\nBosses and common enemies lean heavily towards bullet sponges on normal difficulty. The biters are more grabby than a hentai protagonist, so have fun sometimes getting chaingrabbed 3-4 times in a row if you get surrounded.\r\n\r\nHuman AI can duck and weave like a professional boxer with precognitive abilities. Using 2handed weapons in this game often sucks doodoo so I just used the fist weapons (which can barely be modded) because they were the most fun.\r\n\r\nI'm gonna go back to DL2, the story was dogwater but atleast I could parkour more than 40ft before running out of buildings",

      "review": "I liked the game for what it is as a mindless zombie killer game (more of an expansion pack than a full game experience) but the other aspects of it requires you to suspend disbelief with one huge oversight: the game takes place in what is Switzerland (while they claim it's just a fictional town) and yet half of the NPCs you see are people of color. This is not at all congruent with actual racial demographics of this area of Europe which show that the largest minority groups who are apart of the Swiss area are actually Germans at 8% and then Italians at just 3%. In fact, I don't really think you meet a single Swiss NPC in this game, and most of the white characters, aside from the return of Kyle Crane and the antagonist that fuels the story (unsurprisingly another white guy), are just generic NPCs to fill out space in sanctuary areas. Because the game wanted to invoke that wokeness of making sure that at least 50% of its cast were people of color and also women in power where both major alliable factions are run by a woman, I have to give it a 'not recommended' despite actually receiving the game for free because I made the mistake of purchasing [i]Dying Light 2[/i]'s ultimate edition where The Beast was originally supposed to be a planned DLC that got canceled. \n\nTechland, being founded in the based country of Poland, should be ashamed for this decision and should perhaps be deported to France or something. Creating a fictional town within a non-fictional country doesn't actually allow you to loophole racial demographics and not even bother to properly represent the native people in their own homeland. That's despicable.\n\nThat isn't the only issue with the game, though, as much as it being the most glaring. Techland has also given Kyle Crane the same treatment in his development as protagonist, Aiden, did in DL2. Crane is naive, gullible, and often appears unintelligent and very rash in this expansion pack that continues his story after DL1 where he has apparently been abducted and was the guinea pig to a mad/evil scientist trope character whose team was experimenting on him for apparently thirteen years before he managed to escape. This is also what drives the revenge plot storyline, and so it's another revenge story with a lot of silly, clumsy mistakes in between that just make you groan and roll your eyes as they do their best to make Kyle Crane appear as an absolute buffoon. He seemingly hasn't learned anything from the first game that would make him more of an experienced survivor. He's still getting knocked around, bossed around, made a fool out of as his enemies are always one step ahead of him, betrayed where his response is to essentially just shrug it off instead of recognizing how often he gets betrayed, and just seems very dull and unobservant where his strategy is to just survive on blind luck and keep trying the same thing over and over again until it works. Realistically, he'd have died long ago if not for the plot armor device that he benefits from that the writers continually rely on to tell their story.\n\nTo justify this game's existence, they brought back Kyle Crane and allowed him to transform into a \"beast\" where he can 'hulk' out after accumulating enough damage, receiving enough damage, and dodging incoming attacks. The introductive tutorial to this mechanic was perhaps predictable but still cool nonetheless, but may have simultaneously defanged the power and innate danger of a zombie horde. Of course, to stop you from being too overpowered in the beginning of the game, Crane must first learn how to master and control his new abilities, while wrestling with inner turmoil that he is no longer purely human and is a monster himself. I was very surprised that the first woman you meet, given the rest of the wokeness that exists in this game, is beautifully designed, who no doubt gets the tingles at how strong and masculine Crane is as he stomps around this new area of Europe, making allies and killing these grotesque, mutated abominations now that act as boss fights. She is clearly encouraging his growth as a sort of damsel in distress fantasy where she needs his help to escape to sanctuary. You have to hunt down these creatures, named Chimeras, to inject yourself with their bodily fluids to further empower yourself in your goal for revenge. \n\nMostly, I was pleasantly surprised to see that [i]Dying Light: The Beast[/i] was a game that was freely added to my Steam library after not having heard anything about this game's release until a few weeks before. I had thought I was going to have to spend another $70 USD (although this game released for $60 and that price is debatable) to play another game after just spending $70 to be scammed by [i]Borderlands 4[/i]. But there are some bugs, and the parkour, free running and climbing, which is perhaps an integral part of [i]Dying Light[/i]'s identity, is a bit rocky at times. There was a time where I jumped into a body of water and immediately appeared at the very bottom of it and nearly drowned trying to swim to the top, the camera often glitches into surfaces like cliff walls or buildings if you are jumping towards it to grab a ledge, and sometimes the game has trouble figuring out where you want to grab and how to correspond to your movement inputs. The parkour, when it works, is great and you can chain it with wall running to outmaneuver volatiles or any other special infected should you find yourself in a chase.\n\nBut, other than receiving it as part of Techland's obligation to the community for both canceling the original DLC but also creating the disappointing sequel that was DL2, I probably wouldn't have purchased this expansion for more than $20 USD, if I decided to purchase it at all given the wokeness apparent. The game is considerably shorter than previous titles and so the $60 price tag cannot be justified. I obtained all of the achievements in around 30 hours of playtime and they are selling this game as though it is a fully fledged AAA experience, which it is far from being considered. People who don't hunt for achievements can probably beat this game in around 15 to 20 hours.\n\nTechland has done well to stick to their zombie killing formula and improve on it since [i]Dead Island[/i], but I don't know if they are any good at telling a compelling story, writing interesting male characters who are not completely flawed and incompetent while they turn female characters into Mary Sue's who the men have to rely upon, etc. It's always really fun to just run around and slice up zombies but that's all there is to the greatness, or lack thereof, that is The Beast. Unfortunately, [i]Dying Light[/i] is probably a gaming franchise that should just conclude with the second game, as I don't trust that Techland can truly resist adhering to pressures to conform to woke ideologues.\n\nThe new setting is very woodlandsy with a lot of trees while the settlements and towns are separated throughout. Sadly, there's a big focus in this game on driving country roads around the map rather than parkouring through a large city, with character abilities that you can invest in to make driving more effective. Aside from the new skill tree associated with Crane's \"beast mode,\" I feel like the other skill trees are more lacking than they have ever been. There's still the classic skills like the drop kick, but why do we have to invest a point into learning how to craft a flamethrower when we should just be able to stumble upon it as a blueprint or as a quest reward? It seems like they have mostly run out of ideas for how to diversify the skill trees between the games.\n\nWhile I enjoyed running around and chopping heads, I'd suggest waiting for a sale on this product. The only reason why I even played it as early as I did was because it appeared in my library for free, otherwise I also would have waited for a sale.",

By the end, I had to force myself to finish it.\n\nThe Positives:\nI really like Kyle Crane, and the voice actor did an excellent job. The parkour and combat — especially the dismemberment system — are solid. I love the power fantasy of “beast mode.” The music is great, and the game runs very well while still looking decent. They have not implemented raytracing at the time of this review yet. \n\nThe Negatives:\nThe story is terrible, even though it starts off decently. The main villain is a generic, uninspired bad guy, and the side characters are all forgettable and bland. Buildings have randomized loot that resets after each night, which removes the survival feel — you just end up grinding for items, making it feel more like an online PVE world. The location looks great, but it doesn’t work well with the parkour system since most of the map is covered in forest, which breaks the flow. While night-time initially feels scary, the volatiles spawn almost on top of you, breaking immersion. They quickly become more of an annoyance than a threat which was my biggest dissapointment of the game. I still have memories of how intense Dying Light 1's night times were.

But it was really frustrating to play both. Human enemy frequently dodge your attack, no matter what weapon you use or what level you are at. The zombie attack are more decent, but they are too sticky. You are so easy to get stick to them and have to press F to get off, like how the hell is that a fun way to play? The developer clearly does not want the player to closely interact with zombie in a zombie action game.\n\nParkour part was mostly entertain in the old town, except the climbing is a bit slow. But why so many forest and river in a parkour game? The game make you run a lot between town for no good reason, and you constantly running in bushes and tress and mountain. Don't get me to start off the stamina. Running will not spend stamina which is good decision, but the attack does and it DOES A LOT. You will constantly deplete your stamina if you attack too much then you stumble on ground when fighting 2-3 zombies, while the sticky zombie will eventually get on your face again. The weapon system should be where the game shine with all the fire/freeze/toxin affect, but I always cannot get all the required components to build any shit. Like almost all the things you collect along the gameplay are pure garbage. Then you get all these cool blueprint but they just sit in your inventory without getting crafting ever. The quest is so annoying to play. You get tasks that basically doing electrician, plumber and logistics. There is no character development in anyway, not even for the main character.

I played with a friend that had never played DL and he said it was in his words \"alright\".\n\nThe gameplay is okay but you don't get rewarded for reaching the higher levels at all. Many of the skill tree points are absolutely useless. I was max level and had many points i didn't even bother to activate cuz it was pointless. Cars are absolutely useless btw no point in using them whatsoever. Very slow, bad turn radius and weak. You can upgrade them to be more resiliant but what a waste of skill point. Still slow. Vendors sell terrible gear never bought from em. Always selling gear like 2-3 tiers lower than what we had.\n\nThe story quests can be very predictable at times and you honestly feel just like an errand boy running around getting people their trinkets. Compared to the first DL where the reason you were running for mattered (getting antizine for the tower before dark, etc) and characters would also go out and help accomplish something. In this one i spend my time running through forests 90% of the time. The bots in safezones absolutely suck. No immersion whatsoever they dont walk around or do anything it feels like you're in a 2003 game with very basic coding. Is this what 2025 is?\n\nDon't even get me started on the volatiles. I love that now it's pitch black outside that i'll give it to the game the night time is terrifying in this DL very well done. BUT the volatiles are litterally as strong as the final boss. Very scary in a pursuit but imagine being stuck in a hallway with them. Me and my friend had about 30 explosives and every gun in the game armed to the teeth and couldn't get past 4 volatiles in a hospital mission. You might say skill issue maybe you're right but i was on normal mode and had the highest level of damage possibles (expert upgrade) on all explosives and weapons since it's one of the last 3 missions of the game and could only take down 1-2 before getting absolutely destroyed. Oh and when you die every bullet, grenade and medkit you used is gone so your chances the more you die get thinner and thinner. I get that it's purposely done to make em scary but even in fully upgraded beast mode i can't fight more than 1 at a time lmao i mean come on. Imagine having to hold your ground at night in the dark where they keep spawning.\n\nBugs ruined the game for us. About 40% through we just wanted to rush and finish the story so we could uninstall and never play it again. Ironically they did their \"biggest update\" when we started encountering big bugs where you have to clear zombies in a quest and even tho they're all dead you're just stuck there and can't progress. Biggest bug we had was me and my friend couldnt see each other at times and if he died i couldn't revive him cuz he was invisible. I've also encountered the same issue in DL2 so idk what the devs are missing but this shouldnt be a problem AGAIN but here we are. We went up a tall tower once and looked at a field and every zombie around us except the close ones was like a poster animation frozen in place not rendered in. Just despawn them it would've been better lol.\n\nGot about 30h on the game, reached max level did many side quests cleared safezones etc. I do want to say that the game is fun with a friend still and the guns feel very good too well done with those. I do wish they did more damage to bosses but melee weapons do so i guess it's fine. The parcour is good but good luck climbing a building/wall while being chased. Slower then a turtle most of the time the volatiles/runners will just climb in a sec and wait for you at the top lol. Doesn't feel like your character is in a rush at all. Remember when they had actual parkour professionals simulating the movements in the first game to add realism??? Where did that go?? \n\nAnyways overall i give this game 5.7/10\nCould've been better but still okay to play once.",

      "review": "[h1] disappointment [/h1]\nI wish i liked this game i really do, but you will find a bad thing in every aspect of this game.\n And ofc the first thing i wanna talk about is the main idea of the game which is becoming a beast. becoming a beast is supposed to be ur ult that makes u invincible and unbeatable but sometimes it's not just weak but also irritating and annoying, u can't heal while being in the beast mode and the healing upgrade is very useless, and the whole beast mode doesn't serve the main idea of dying light (for me) which is the parkour, i realllyy hate the parkour in this game and i hate that they removed a lot of skills and didn't really focus on the remaining ones, instead of parkouring and jumping around they added a car to the game to make the transportation faster but it's not a fun thing to do it's just... a car u k, and they added racing challenges for the car i don't know why are they so proud of it ,even the challenges are very boring tbh.\n they also removed a lot of good side missions like the parkour and fighting challenges. also the whole game is just a punch of assets from the previous games, literally nothing is original about this game.\nand if i have to talk about the story it's a piece of trash, the plot twists is just betraying and u can easily predict them hours before happening, maybe just the last mission was good but all of the rest is very mid and probably happened in the previous games. \n\n[h2] the bosses [/h2]\nthe bosses in this game called chimeras and u kill them to get blood samples from them to get ur beast mode to it's full potential, the problem is that the bosses are just the same, they're doing the same moves most of them even look alike, and they're also silly because a single normal volatile might slime u multiple times but the main bosses wouldn't even kill u once, i know i played the game on survivor difficulty but still the volatile will be more challenge than the normal bosses, also the laziness behind making them didn't encourage me to raise the difficulty.\n\n[h3] i might recommend it for sum people tho [/h3]\nif u were a new person to the dying light series i guarantee u will enjoy it but if u were an old fan like me u will also get disappointed too, also i would recommend u to play the first game, it's better in everything except the graphics. \nalso i wouldn't recommend u to buy it at full price, the main story is too short for this price.",

It follows the same formula of RPG elements that DL2 introduced such as leveled weapons and armor, as well as zombies with levels above their head that tank damage like nobodies business. There is really only one city you can actually \"parkour\" in and it's about the size of someone's backyard. You have to drive to pretty much every location outside of the city and the whole time I am thinking, \"Why don't I just play DL1 + The Following again\".\r\nBest weapon in the game is the throwing knife, why smack a guy in the head with a level 10 hammer 20 times when one throwing knife to the head one-shots.\r\nAlso, goodluck running this game with no DLSS because, just like DL2 or any modern game, it relies entirely on DLSS for optimization to try and get above 60fps on mid-range graphics cards.\r\nWhile it is a step in the right direction compared to DL2, the price point (Especially considering this was originally supposed to be DLC for DL2) is a bit high to me. I just expected more, and I can not understand why the need to implement all these additional gameplay mechanics when DL1 was such a cult classic.

The visuals are beautiful and the amazing music really contributes to the atmosphere in a way that makes me feel nostalgic over the times back when i first played DL1 but the DL2 mechanics are extremely frustrating and tiresome.\nI wish they went back to DL1 because it worked much better and i feel like the flow and immersion really gets ruined sometimes because of the DL2 system limitations and restrictions such as max amount for item stacks and making different menus so compact and split making it disorienting and confusing to navigate. DL1 for example had an amazing inventory menu and all the tabs with items and crafting and skills felt connected near flawlessly, but now everything has to have it's own space and it sucks. There's also quite a lot of bugs and glitches that makes the game unplayable at times but hopefully that's something that'll get fixed with time.\nAnyways interesting game so far, i guess maybe i'll update the review later if something changes lol, peace",

      "review": "Sadly I can not recommend this game, this is just a generic zombie game. I got my rush of “Dying Light is back” in the first 20 minutes of gameplay but that diminished fast. It feels like a dlc too, which is what it was intended to be. Almost like “The following”, big open map, cars, not as much parkour. I loved The Following which was a dlc on top of a game, not a standalone game for 90AUD (60USD).\n\nAs a fan of the first game this one fails to capture that. Which could be fine. It doesn't need to be the same but it does not improve on any of the features in the first game. \n\nParkour. Where you can parkour it feels off. Trying to climb rock faces sucks, doing chases at night sucks and being unable to turn toggle sprint off is weird and you cant because of one skill you get later on. Later on in the game when you level up you get a skilled called dash, it lets you use up your stamina bar while you're sprinting which lets you run even faster. While sprinting you need to press and hold the sprint key again which activates it. Now if you look behind you while doing this it disables it and you need to enable it again. There is little prompt to show this and it is also confusing whether or not sprint is toggled. It feels like I start walking during a chase and then the volatiles start catching up,I spam sprint and get confused as to why I'm not sprinting. Now when you parkour you lose momentum alot, end up grabbing bad ledges or none, which are slow to climb up and after every ledge climb or action almost you have to re-enable the dash ability or because you lose momentum it feels like its not enabled but it is and then you toggle it off. If you do it wrong then you end up walking and can die. Aswell in order to activate a lot of abilities such as jumping off zombies and chargin through zombies you need to be in dash mode. Yes you can say skills later on help you parkour better but if you have to slug through all the bad mechanics for hours to then enjoy the main gameplay mechanic and selling point of this franchise then thats a sorry excuse. \n\nCombat feels like I'm running out of stamina alot then I can't dodge which drains stamina aswell so im just a sitting duck. Maybe I just spam too much at times but then it also feels like the zombies can be tanky. It's better now that I have mods and better weapons but it still feels lack luster. \n\nThe map works against you in a chase. I'm running from volatiles and I see where I want to go but the path is cluttered or has one wire bridge you can use to get across, they pop up in front of you and then if you grab a bad ledge or a ledge in general almost, you have to slowly climb up. It feels frustrating to the point where I'm just gonna stop doing night runs and I haven't done many which could prove that im wrong or that they are just that bad that it is not worth doing. The parkour is not smooth and is a downgrade from one and even two. \n\nDriving. Its just a chore and having to find fuel is annoying. You stack up more as you play but don't want to put too much fuel in a car because I don't want to waste my resources and end up ditching the car which you will do anyway. I don't  know if fuel carries over to all cars when you put it in one but I haven't noticed that it does. \n\nHuman enemies can also spawn next to a group of zombies. They're not friends! They dont attack each other until you get near them or provoke them, and still the zombies prioritize you at first. \n\nEverything mentioned doesn't happen all the time, but it all adds up and impacts the player's experience. \n\nStory-wise, I'm not following too much anymore. Boring generic killed big bad boss guy.\n\nProps to the developers for not using Unreal Engine 5, which was one of the reasons I bought this game again after refunding. I just wanted to play something that ran and looked it. Sadly, though, they did my boy Kyle Crane wrong and made him some generic protagonist who is out for revenge.",

      "review": "Spoilers for the game and its story.\n\nI got this for free, even then I do wish I didn't receive this at all. This game on release, and still is as im writing this now, awfully optimized. No way to play this game without upscaling to get any FPS above 60 on LOW? I thought DL2 on release with Denuvo was bad but good lord it is horrendous. Aside from the performance, the gameplay; Parkour, combat, beast mode was actually good. Here are some of my feedbacks in regards to Dying Light: The Beast;\n\nI want more dialogue between Crane and [spoiler] Aiden [/spoiler], rather than having Crane say to [spoiler] Aiden [/spoiler] \"I have a few questions for you\" have him say he needs time alone with [spoiler] Aiden [/spoiler] and have them two talk to each other about their times during DL1 and DL2. Have Crane talk about Harran, his ignorance to the GRE and his attempts at stopping them during DL1. Have him talk about the people he's lost; Jade, Rahim, Brecken, Spike etc. Have him talk about his uncertainty towards the other survivors not knowing that Crane is alive, Spike, Lena, Jasir/Ezgi and everyone else. Have Crane talk about being a test subject for The Baron and losing his will to live and finding some motivation to carry on from Olivia and The Exiles. Have Aiden talk about losing Mia (someone he loved). Have Aiden talk to Crane about what he did in Villedor to help find his sister, being experimented on as a child in X13; Lawan, Frank, Jack Matt, Barney, Sophie, Hakon, Waltz. The monumental struggle of getting to find his sister only to find she's not his sister and losing her after their encounter at X13 and how X13 keeps her alive. Leaving villedor after taking inhibitors, spike mentoring him. Both helping each other on their losses, they're not so different from eachother.\n\nRather than nerfing Aiden into human mode, have a few missions where you help him to gain control of his beast like powers, the same as Crane did. Have it so that he learns to control it, he becomes more powerful as a result. It feels like after Aiden turns back to human again, he's just nerfed. He is THE BEAST, Crane is a beast but Aiden is THE BEAST, he is the tagline of the game. I understand it is Cranes story, but why include Aiden at that rate.\n\nThe sidequests are such a chore, they are to me a 9-5 fetch quest job; Go here, interact with item, kill infected, go back, done. There are two, arguably three sidequests that pose actually interesting questions. The quest A Sign of Love asks the question of; can the people who were infected like the exlies and by extension Crane and Aiden, have children? Don't Look Back in Anger is a quest given to you by Starchild, in which you produce a serum to help the exiles have more motivation to go about their day to day life. Kyle throughout hears an inner voice of his muttering things like \"Murderer\" and \"monster\". Towards the end of the quest you enter a trance like state in which Crane is back in the lab but its horrificly set. Blood everywhere, versions of Crane in a cell corner, pacing around in circles, further up Crane can find him strangling people he's met along the way in game and further up still you can see Olivia, as a Viral in the same hallway that Crane saw Jade in, in Dying Light 1. Mentioning Jade if you turn to face behind you, you can see Jade, and next to her you can see Rahim's dead body in the train cart from DL1. At the end of the hallway you find yourself in an arena with your \"alters\", learning to control the anger and pain to finally use it for good. It asks the question \"How do you deal with something this monumental?\" Crane took the virus outside the quarantine zone (We know this from DLTB's existence) and by extension, help the GRE end humanity. \"Everyones dead because of you\" \"Animal\" \"Murderer\". It also asks the question of Optimisim vs Desperation. How far is Starchild willing to go to keep people optimistic. These quests alone are the most interesting quests of the entire game.\n\nFor the love of god, the zombies need to stop combo'ing the player like its Tekken, it is so frustrating to play against. It is also frustrating to have my windmill attack not work in the middle of a group because I got hit once and I can't activate it again until I stop taking damage from them. It is unrewarding and frustrating.\n\nBeast mode NEEDS to feel like a beast mode. Sure, we get more damage and more executions but even so all it takes is a pack of virals to just overwhelm you and take you down from 100 to 0 in a few hits. I believe beast mode should give you more damage resistance scaled to the players current level irregardless of gear perhaps, or have beast mode include some defensive powers such as a block attack.\n\nDon't get me started on Legendary collectable weapons, what an absolute waste of time. They're not worth collecting (apart from the achievement). The EXPcalibur 2.0 and the Spectral Baseball Bat are perhaps the most horrendous of them all. In the first game, both had the ability to fling zombies comically far. Now, you get WEAPON THROW POWER as in, you throw the weapon with more power. Why? No one asked for that. The only legendary weapons worth getting are the guns; Statement Shotgun, Elite Pistol, Sunray Revolver and the Eraser Rifle. There needs to be more incentive to get these weapons and they must be buffed and less gimicky.\n\nDear lord, the loot pools. I spent more time getting loot for my blueprints than I did actually using them half the time. Mods and blueprints require lots of wiring and oxidizers and they are so abundent in the recipes that I would need to equip the scavenger gear and run through every dark zone several times just to get all the materials I need. I would end up finding more old world wine than any items I actually needed.\n\nThe pacing of the story, honestly what the fuck? It is so jarring and so strange. The first half of the game is very sluggish and very slow to mirror Cranes adjustment to the world. It stays like that until the halfway point in which we meet the exiles. The pace quickens up until the last quarter where it skyrockets exponentially, I still feel the whiplash to this day from it, metaphorically speaking. I would rather us have a few more main missions in between the two halves of the game, perhaps one are two more in each half to not have the pacing be so jarring.\n\nAchievements need to be done PROPERLY. In Dying Light 1 you can track individual amounts of kills or sidequests needed to complete respective achievements but in this game you can't. How do I know that I've killed enough people with the flamethrower, or the car or beast mode? Why are some of the achievements hidden but are infact to do with collectables, main story missions make sense as they might spoil the story but collectables make no sense as you can see what the collectables are from the collectables menu.\n\nThe story itself, is flipt from the leaked version of the DLC. Rather than playing as Aiden with Spike looking for Crane, we're doing the opposite. Anyone who's played Dying Light 2 will recognise Aiden right at the start of the game with Crane and Spike, and will also recognise him from being tested on otherwise they wouldn't obscure his face with the monitor at the start of the game. I would much rather there be a blend of the leaked version and the current version compared to what we have now. \n\nCrane needs to. STOP. FUCKING. MOANING, in my bloody ear EVERY GOD DAMN TIME I go to the inventory screen. Crane definitely is an aggressive nutter and it shows, it's also really off putting.\n\n\nTo conclude; I like that they still have core Dying Light DNA in the game; Parkour is better than DL2 but not as good as DL1, combat (despite its flaws) is still good and beast mode is fun to use. But I can't recommend it in its current state. No end game content really, and nothing being done about the god awful performance is putting me off playing this game more. I'll stick to playing the first one more.",
