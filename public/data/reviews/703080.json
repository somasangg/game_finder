Not just one type of zoo, so many different types of zoo, even without DLCs, but DLCs open so much more up. I don't regret any of the money I've spent on this game. \r\n\r\nBeing able to have realistic ways of running a zoo, career paths that teach you everything, sandbox, and challenges just adds to the urge of wanting to play more. The animals are cute and realistic, and the people and style of the game brings the nostalgic feel of the SIMS. The over all game play is fun and addicting.\r\n\r\nIn sandbox I love all the customizable settings, Along in the whole game it's self, being able to make the same animal a different exhibit each time.\r\n\r\nOnly thing I wish it had more of would be Multiplayer, and maybe some more free content, as the DLCs can rank up and get expensive. I honestly only bought what i have because they were on sale.",

The animals are unbelievably detailed, the environments feel alive, and the level of creativity the game allows is ridiculous. If you can dream it, you can build it — from realistic enclosures to full-on fantasy zoos. Watching your habitats come to life with animals behaving naturally never gets old.\n\nYes, the game has a learning curve and the building tools take time to master, but that’s part of what makes it so rewarding. Once it “clicks,” Planet Zoo becomes one of the most satisfying and immersive building/management games out there. Every new animal, every new habitat, every little design detail feels exciting.\n\nThe community is great, the Workshop content is endless, and the game keeps getting better with updates and DLC. If you love animals, building, or simulation games, this is basically a dream come true.\n\nA masterpiece of creativity and animal care.",

      "review": "A fun game overall but there are a few nitpicks I have. \n\nTLDR\nThe game is fun overall with a bit of a learning curve to get the hang of. There are a few things that should be improved like custom building and landscaping. DLC isn't necessary to enjoy, if you do buy make sure to read reviews. \n\nIssues\nThe game has a lot of DLC that frankly doesn't add much for the most part. Some of the landscaping tools and how they work are frankly frustrating. I also wish it would allow for custom waterfalls. The custom building is also a pain and takes forever to get something half decent. I love the way the live animal market works however it also means that getting some animals is borderline impossible due to price or that no one is selling them. Animal enclosure designs can be quite frustrating especially shelter because the premade ones are ugly and when you make your own it can be finicky in counting it as shelter. Water for enclosures can also be difficult however once you get the hang of it it's better and not that hard. Another issue is that some animals behave inaccurately or very similarly to other animals making them feel like a reskin. Also most reptiles and snakes are in boxes and don't do much so if you are here for snakes, not for you. Also there are no birds besides the ones that don't fly. \n\nPositives \nThe money making and managing in general is quite balanced I would say not to hard or easy at least in franchise mode. The animals are fun to breed and watch for the most part. There are plenty of morphs to get into. The game is fun and customizable with many things to do. The graphics are pretty good as well. The animal market does make the game feel alive with an economy of players. So if you want to play to make as much as possible then that is possible, the market behaves somewhat unpredictably so there is plenty to loose or gain. The DLC does add more buildings and animals but it doesn't add gameplay mechanics. There is a lot of decoration and detailing capabilities, with a few caveats I mentioned earlier.",

The potential for customization is vast, and has really kept me from losing interest thus far. \r\n\r\nThere are still some aspects of building that are a bit tricky and annoying, like placing paths, or placing picnic benches (it doesn't matter how much I flatten my terrain, it still says it's uneven). But it hasn't been enough to deter me. \r\n\r\nOnly other thing I would gripe about at this time is that there are a lot of issues with my animals that I had to look into because the game didn't adequately tell me what was going on. I think it expects you to infer certain things based on the species in question, but that isn't super helpful to a beginner. Other than that, I've really enjoyed myself.

Planet Zoo, it's been in my library a while and I kind of just... overlooked it, I guess you could say. But, until probably Planet Zoo 2, this game my favourite Frontier game AND tycoon game. Is it addicting? Well... maybe a little bit. Just... just a little bit. Will this game ever get boring? Yeah, not a chance. This game will become one of those classics a in 2050 something. Kinda like Mario now. What I am trying to say, is the prospect of building a zoo won't ever get boring. The only thing that sucks in this game is that the guests wellfare is just as important as the animals. Well, that is not my official complaint, that would go to the build function. It can be very... difficult sometimes. But, that could also be a skill issue on my part. In fact, yeah, it is a skill issue on my part. So that only means one thing... this game isn't bad anywhere!

The level of customization is amazing--you can decide the height and type of wall used, you can sculpt terrain, you can paint different substances onto the ground (long grass, short grass, smooth sand, rough sand, snow, etc.), fill dips in the ground with water, and so much more. \r\nThe animals are gorgeously animated and really fun to just watch run around and play with the enrichment items and each other. Each animal has a preferred strength of barrier (a must-have if you can place the animal in the habitat), size of habitat (land area, water area, and climbing area) and an amount of each biome on the ground. They also have a specific group size (for example, Tortoises are mostly solitary, while flamingos can be in massive groups and require others to be happy) and amount/type of enrichment items (a box to play with, a sprinkler, a blood pumpkin, etc.).\r\nYou can also place your paths for your visitors to walk on (customize the height off the ground and width of the path), place items for them to interact with (food/drink/merchandise stands, donation boxes, trash cans, benches, etc.), and information panels about your animals.\r\nYou need Keepers (and probably vets, caretakers, mechanics, and security) in your zoo to take care of your animals! You can place keeper huts for them to live in, special paths for them to walk on, and even change the color of their clothing.\r\nThere are several game modes, among them Sandbox, Franchise, Career, and Challenge modes. Usually, each item in the game costs a specific amount (in-game money, how much money your zoo has from guests paying through admission, donation boxes, food stands, etc.), so you are limited in the detail of your habitats, at least in the beginning. For Sandbox mode, everything is free, so you can experiment to get a feel for the controls, then make your dream zoo. I would recommend starting with Sandbox, but it's up to you. There is also a very helpful tutorial (Goodwin House) to help you with the basic functions of the game. \r\n\r\nAnother point: there are about a dozen DLCs available to buy, which give you extra animals and building material. They are not mandatory to enjoy the game, and you can totally play without them! However, they include animals that are super cool, including the clouded leopard, coyote, kiwi, and more! \r\n\r\nSo yes, I would very much recommend this game for people who want to create their dream zoo with their dream animals!

They're delightful.\n- A massive number of animals and exhibit animals.\n- In depth building mechanics with easy to grasp controls. If you've played Planet Coaster, it's very similar. It's so nice to be able to merge items together without the usual clipping being disallowed, and with the modular nature of the items meaning you can mix and match allowing you to build some amazing things.\n- Several different modes, including challenge modes. I personally find sandbox modes boring so having goals to complete is very welcome. The main campaign alone took me literal years to complete.\n\nCons:\n- The crowds are awful. I don't understand how in 6 years, the terrible AI mechanics for crowds has never been improved. Glitching into each other and getting stuck, trying to view animals through solid walls, they are genuinely an embarassment. You're not playing for the people, you're playing for the animals so it doesn't really matter but it is distracting.\n- The DLC is extremely overpriced for the whopping 5 or occasionally 7 animals you get, with some scenery and a scenario. Buy those on sale, this is one of those games where the DLC will cost significantly more than the game itself.\n- No achievements.\n\nAside from the two issues above, it's a great game and the animals are a joy, and the building is very satisfying. It's complex, interesting, and I've been playing it on and off for years. Definitely recommended.",

For those that don't enjoy that aspect, there's a surplus of absolutely amazing community builds to enjoy. The animal models are beautiful, though a close observer can tell the difference between the older models and the new ones. I do wish they'd spruce up some of the older models to match, but it is what it is. This game is highly customizable, so it can be as challenging or as chill as you want. The market does get a little outrageous in franchise mode, especially with some of the trending animals and morphs, but that's always the case with open markets. You can find some cool stuff on there, and besides the pretty chunk of change you pay for the complete game, there are no micro transactions or in game purchases within the game. You can easily (ish) get conservation points in game, and they transfer between franchise zoos (though not in challenge mode). \n\nI love this game! I've been playing on and off for years and I can see how frontier has taken the fans into consideration when releasing the dlcs (although still no birds or fully aquatic species, keeping an eye out for it in PZ2).  That said, I truly hope Planet Zoo 2 brings some much needed innovation. Although it's separate game, JWE3 felt like a clone of JWE2 with babies and building. Now I don't want to denigrate the work it took to incorporate those things into the game, and there's no doubt it was done well, but it seems like Frontier focused on these 2 new features to the exclusion of the rest of the game. I'm hoping PZ2 doesn't just focus on birds and aquatics (for example) and call it day.",
