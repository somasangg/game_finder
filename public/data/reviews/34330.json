      "review": "Total War: Shogun 2 is what happens when you mix tactical genius, samurai honor, and the constant urge to betray every alliance you’ve ever made because Kyoto looks too damn conquerable.\n\nYou play as the leader of a Japanese clan during the Sengoku period—an era where everyone was polite, poetic, and absolutely ready to stab you for rice and glory. It’s the perfect blend of grand strategy and real-time warfare: one minute you’re managing taxes and trade, the next you’re watching thousands of soldiers clash in misty valleys while you whisper, “Banzai.”\n\nThe battles? Stunning. Archers rain death, cavalry crash like thunder, and samurai carve through enemies with terrifying discipline. The sound of war drums, the clash of katanas, and that brief moment before the charge—it’s pure cinematic bliss. And if you mess up your flank? Congratulations, you just doomed your dynasty in 30 seconds flat.\n\nCampaign mode is chef’s kiss: political marriages, ninja assassins, religious turmoil, and the classic Total War experience of accidentally angering every single neighbor because you “just took one more province.” The Realm Divide mechanic ensures your rise to power always ends in a beautiful storm of betrayal and blood.\n\nVisually and mechanically, it’s aged like fine sake. It’s still one of the most balanced, atmospheric, and tactically satisfying entries in the series—proof that sometimes, less really is more.\n\n9.2/10 honorable betrayals. Would send 1,000 ashigaru to die for one hill again",

Set during Japan’s Sengoku Jidai era, the game captures the intensity, honor, and chaos of samurai warfare like no other.\r\n\r\nThe campaign map is beautifully crafted, every province feels meaningful, and decisions carry real weight. Diplomacy, economy, and military strategy are all balanced brilliantly, forcing players to think carefully instead of relying on brute force. When armies finally meet on the battlefield, the real-time combat is stunning—formations clash, arrows fly, and samurai warriors fight with cinematic intensity.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere is unmatched: traditional Japanese music, gorgeous artwork, and immersive narration by Sun Tzu bring the world to life. Even more than a decade later, it remains visually impressive and technically smooth.\r\n\r\nWhether you’re a Total War veteran or a newcomer, Shogun 2 delivers incredible depth, replayability, and emotional intensity. It’s a game where every victory feels earned and every defeat teaches a lesson.\r\n\r\nA timeless classic and one of the finest strategy games ever made.",

It’s a strategy game where the start of the battle is more important than the battle itself. Terrain is everything, and having good units doesn’t automatically guarantee victory if you just charge into the enemy. Fast battles, difficult to micromanage the opposite of other games like Rome II, Attila, or even the newer ones like Warhammer 1, 2, and 3. CA is probably never going to achieve a remarkable game like this again. Fun, difficult, and sometimes unfair but not like Attila. It has the best multiplayer mode of all time, and sadly it was never reintroduced in another Total War, where you could create and customize your own faction and faction leader.",

If you haven't played it, and don't mind a somewhat 'fine aged' experience, TW: Shogun 2 is excellent. The Fall of the Samurai expansion that explores the Boshin Wars is where it really shines, but the base game is also very good if you want a more precolonial and feudal Japanese gameworld. The Rise of the Samurai expansion is pretty mid in my opinion but where else are you going to get such a sophisticated strategy set in semi-aprocryphal Japan? I recently played this game until 4.45am by accident, I thought it was around 1.30... So it's that kind of game.",

A bit lacking in variety, but the combination of elements from previous titles, alongside the narrower focus, allows this game to really soar. If you want to play Rome 2, the base game and DLC Rise of the Samuri get the same ideas right, and if you want to play Empire, there's no reason to play Empire anymore, because the Fall of the Samuri DLC does everything that game does and more. I was a bit iffy on my rankings until I played the DLC, but afterwards, this has quickly lept to one of my favorite strategy games of all time. Not to mention that the robust modding community that this game has, alongside steam workshop support, allows for a lot more once you're tired of the base game. Highly suggested from me, 8/10, only wish there was higher unit variety.",

Every clan you can play as has their unique advantages that incentivize the player into strategizing a certain way, so every clan feels different and fresh.\r\n\r\nThere are also plenty of resources available online that teach optimal strategy. MrSmartDonkey is a great channel for this. Just make sure to optimize your buildings, play to your clan's strengths, get the most out of your agents and out of diplomacy (as it's fairly lackluster in this game), encourage Town Growth (by keeping your taxes at Normal and having a healthy Food surplus), and don't trigger Realm Divide prematurely.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are always things to nitpick. The Hattori special units are actually [i]worse[/i] than their vanilla counterparts, for example, but nothing game-breaking-ly bad.\r\n\r\nNo AI was used in the making of this review. Cheers.",

They are really smart. Not only can they coldly calculate your movements and build up forces, but they can also surprise you with the huge army they have hidden away. \n\nIn Fall of the Samurai, when I captured a Choshu coastal town, they counterattacked me with a force of 1,500, and I had no choice but to flee and retreat to nearby province. When they finally attacked, I was left with only 800 garrison troops and a wooden cannon unit for one final stand. I had to use all my brain power to defend and managed to destroy almost 1,500 of them and buy time for new reinforcements to arrive. \n\nNot only is it satisfying to win impossible battles against tough AI, but it also makes you feel proud of yourself to keep playing. This game doesn't give you free rewards you have to earn them with hard work and dedication. A masterpiece of all time.",

An area they could greatly improve is the battlefield options, Napoleon had lots of neat towns and cities that really added a lot of depth to the strategy, Shogun seems to have 2 main options, field battles (which I admit I love the variety of the maps), and Fort/Castle sieges, which only offer a few different styles and have limited destruction. The battlefield should match whatever area the armies confront one another on the campaign map, Castles should all be accurate to the actual real ones that existed, and sea battles should be improved. Maybe even turn the whole thing into a giant real time strategy with a massive living, active Japan, that would make ninjas so much more important and useful and make the game so much deeper and more dynamic.   Theres a lot of improvements they could easily do for a new game, it would be nice to see but I will not hold my breath, gaming isnt what it used to be. Even if they do release a Shogun 3, theres a good chance it will be ruined somehow just like most of the good franchises in the past 10 years, I am deeply concerned about gta6",

This game could've been soooooo good but they f ed up some really crucial gameplay elements. First of all, naval warfare is so boring and there's so much of it and the AI has so many ships. It's impossible to maintain a navy that large and also an army that large. It makes no sense. If I maintain an army almost as big as the ai, I would be in the negative, never mind having a navy. The naval battle ai is also bugged so badly. In the two battles I fought, the ships just either ran away or didn't even move. There should've been some setting to disable it. \n\nSecondly, the campaign ai is so annoying. They almost never let me trade with them and they always work against me. This makes diplomacy so boring because there is virtually none. My neighbors will always attack me so all I do is attack them. I don't think I've ever been able to reach the end of the upgrade cycle. What's the point of all the mechanics like marriages and hostages? I had a lord give me his kid to maintain a trade agreement and literally next turn he rescinded and it said I executed his kid. Haha. He gave up his kids life for 260 koku I paid for the agreement. Come on.  \n\nLastly, realm divided is shit. It ruins the game. They expect me to invade a map that long just to have enemies from the other side sail over and land an army all the way behind me. Umm, it's economically impossible to maintain an army large enough to both invade forward and defend backwards. It takes like 3 turns to reach adjacent castles. On hard mode they would land an army with a full stack to invade. Even if I could win on a half stack against full stack, I can't keep 2-3 half stacks behind, that's too expensive. Especially because they nerf all the fun over powered tricks from shogun 1. Yea it was overpowered but that shit is fun as hell. In shogun 1, sometimes you can win a 1 vs 10 battle just because you cheese the terrain so hard. That was so satisfying. In shogun 2, terrain barely matters. Cavalry charge is weak.
