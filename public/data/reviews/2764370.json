Starward does a better job at explaining mechanics and character specific tools. There are even interactive move explainers. Although it could do better in that regard since it's been a while since newer characters got any. I like how cancel routes are highlighted in real time. This makes using a new character easier if you haven't had a chance to look at their move list. At least 1 new character release every few weeks. There are seasons that last about 60 days. 6 characters were added last season. Also, there are events pretty regularly and the characters are pretty cool. I've been playing for about a year and haven't seen a disappointing one yet.\r\n\r\nI almost forgot. Some may may be put off by some of the fan service-y character designs. I don't even think about.

Starward does a better job at explaining mechanics and character specific tools. There are even interactive move explainers. Although it could do better in that regard since it's been a while since newer characters got any. I like how cancel routes are highlighted in real time. This makes using a new character easier if you haven't had a chance to look at their move list. At least 1 new character release every few weeks. There are seasons that last about 60 days. 6 characters were added last season. Also, there are events pretty regularly and the characters are pretty cool. I've been playing for about a year and haven't seen a disappointing one yet.\r\n\r\nI almost forgot. Some may may be put off by some of the fan service-y character designs. I don't even think about.

So really, the mobile app \"game\" is just a veneer, a thin skin wrapped around a nasty, predatory mobile app cash shop.\n\nPutting that toxic mobile app monetisation aside... this is a mobile app.  I didn't spend thousands on a gaming PC so I could pretend it's an iPhone, and I don't think you did either... this kind of mobile app has no place in your Steam library.\n\nAs with all mobile scams, you're forced to sign a highly questionable yet legally unenforceable End User License Agreement... for such a relatively low effort, low quality mobile app, this is specifically designed to invalidate your consumer rights and destroy your right to privacy.  This agreement includes questionable requirements that may attempt to revoke consumer law protections that gamers expect to have, which is also highly problematic.  Developers must learn they are here to serve gamers, not control them.  I had my cat walk over the keyboard while the EULA was displaying, which fixed that problem for me.\n\nThis is a mobile app... it doesn't matter if this was ported to PC before or after the app store release, or even if this didn't even make it to the app stores.  This is built for the absolutely lowest of all gaming platforms and must be judged as such... it's not going to give you a cutting edge PC gaming experience.  That alone is enough to disqualify this from any recommendation.  We don't spend thousands building gaming rigs so that we can pretend they're iPhones and play iPhone games and mobile apps.\n\nNow on to pricing and value for gamers.\n\nGiven that this free title won't increase your game collector count, is it worth your time to add it to your library?\n\nNot on a bet.

It's a \"gacha\" PvP crapfest where the winner in each round is decided by how much money they spent.\n\nThere's only a superficial game here.   The game visuals and the game itself are incredibly shallow... think of them as the too-bright, colourful, thin plastic cabinet dress theme on a poker machine at the casino. That's basically what this is.  So really, the mobile app \"game\" is just a veneer, a thin skin wrapped around a nasty, predatory mobile app cash shop.\n\nPutting that toxic mobile app monetisation aside... this is a mobile app.  I didn't spend thousands on a gaming PC so I could pretend it's an iPhone, and I don't think you did either... this kind of mobile app has no place in your Steam library.\n\nAs with all mobile scams, you're forced to sign a highly questionable yet legally unenforceable End User License Agreement... for such a relatively low effort, low quality mobile app, this is specifically designed to invalidate your consumer rights and destroy your right to privacy.  This agreement includes questionable requirements that may attempt to revoke consumer law protections that gamers expect to have, which is also highly problematic.  Developers must learn they are here to serve gamers, not control them.  I had my cat walk over the keyboard while the EULA was displaying, which fixed that problem for me.\n\nThis is a mobile app... it doesn't matter if this was ported to PC before or after the app store release, or even if this didn't even make it to the app stores.  This is built for the absolutely lowest of all gaming platforms and must be judged as such... it's not going to give you a cutting edge PC gaming experience.  That alone is enough to disqualify this from any recommendation.  We don't spend thousands building gaming rigs so that we can pretend they're iPhones and play iPhone games and mobile apps.\n\nNow on to pricing and value for gamers.\n\nGiven that this free title won't increase your game collector count, is it worth your time to add it to your library?\n\nNot on a bet.
