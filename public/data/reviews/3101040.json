You can barely tell the motive for almost any murder, which means you can't use it as a guide for your reasoning. It just leaves you going \"WTH\" when you find out the killer. However, this does mean the game is full of \"shock\".\n\nCharacter portrayal is great though, I can really feel the struggles in their personalities. \nEma and Hiro are nice girls, I really hope they can live a better life ;3.\n\nAnyway, good game, love it.",

      "review": "みんな死ねばいい\r\n\r\nHonestly, a very solid game all around.\r\n\r\nTo echo all the other reviews, the game is basically a mix of Danganronpa with magical girls and Ace Attorney. In the present times of Capcom forgetting AA exists at all and Kodaka having moved on from Danganronpa after V3 (cough cough danganronpa 2x2), one would be hard pressed to find a game that would have an investigation-trial sort of gameplay loop, not even mentioning death game element. And this game in my opinion managed to fill the niche quite nicely.\r\n\r\nThe trial gameplay is rather simplistic: you basically only ever get to listen to the discussion of everyone present in the court and need to either dispute or support the \"correct\" opinion to influence the flow of the trial towards the correct outcome. Gameplaywise I definitely think the trials are really fun and it's been rather entertaining trying to guess 2 or 3 steps ahead about how the murder actually took place. Magic element definitely adds some unexpected twists here and there, but ultimately I would say trials are rather simplistic, if one were to compare it to Danganronpa, where sometimes the entire way you went about to solving the case would get turned upside down. Here the flow is very much straight: outside of maybe 1 particular case, all cases have not had anything mindblowing happening. And the worst part is that when you indict someone, you already know at that point it was 100% that character who did it, which makes finishing up the trial a bit of a chore, as you know the character is basically just gasping at straws, which I think takes away some of the enjoyment from the trial, as \"YOU INDICTED X, BUT IT WAS Y ALL ALONG\" type of twist never happens. One other smaller criticism towards the gameplay would be evidence presentation, as sometimes you have similar types of evidence connected logically with each other, and yet the game expects you to pick the \"correct\" one--I feel like AA handled it better when at these points you would be allowed to submit ideologically similar evidences.\r\n\r\nHowever, for trials being a weaker element story-wise, I would say the overall story of the game is definitely good. While Danganronpa goes into some very edgy nonsense shit, this game tries to establish the setting and follows it to a T, which makes following the story a lot more enjoyable, and I think that's where the game shines. It starts a bit slow, but after that I was finding it hard to stop, as I kept wanting to see more and more.\r\n\r\nCharacters are also a highlight of the game, as many other reviews mention, with unique personalities and circumstances. However, I personally found it really hard to actually sympathize with most of them--be it as a culprit or as a victim. I think their backgrounds are served in a rather not fleshed out manner instead of some sort of gradual reveal of how their lives were and what led to their traumas. Instead you get something like (not an actual example from the game, just a 'inspired by' situation)\r\n\r\n\"Lolla used to live a lavish life, but one day her entire family died in an accident and she ended up being homeless. She found a place to live with the other homeless, but most of them have been vile towards her. Some hitting her, some stealing her food. The beatings never stopped, until one day, she awoke to her power.. Her power allowed her to take revenge on all those evil homeless people, and yet, her wound has never healed\"\r\nVictim: a homeless magical girl\r\n\r\nI am somewhat overblowing it out of proportion, but this was how I saw some of the explanations being like. The other weak point for the murders was motivation behind them--unfortunately the writers either couldn't come up with anything better or just settled on that option--, which in most cases is magical strengthening (魔法化). It felt really lazy and quite a literal Deus Ex Machina to me, because why bother to come up with a proper explanation when you can just say it was magic and you ain't gotta explain shit?\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere and music in the game is really good, and I also want to praise some of the VO work here as well, as some characters are able to establish themselves especially due to their VO (Yuki, Gokuchou, Hiro come to mind, but there are others as well). \r\n\r\nThe above criticism being as it is, I still believe this is a very solid game, and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who likes mystery and/or trial-like ADV games. And I say that as a person who if not outright hates mahou shoujo genre, definitely has nothing to do with it. I was very apprehensive of the game because of it at first too, but the more you play, the more you realize it's a not-so-typical representative of the genre, standing on its own, rather than being outshadowed by the games it tries to take inspiration from.\r\n\r\nThis being the first game this studio has made, I think they managed to set a bar really high and I'm looking forward to the sequel they have already announced (as well as quite openly hinted to within the game's context as well), and recommend it to anyone reading this, if your Mandarin/Japanese allows you to, or to the English audience for whenever the translation does come out.",

      "review": "TL;DR Sherry/10. This game is a real masterpiece, but it may have a downside for you as the game is only in japanese and simplified chinese for now. (this may change with the switch release as there is already a translated game title in the gamefiles and a reference to korean and english as a pickable language in the locales file)\n\nGameplay:\nWhat can I tell you outside of what has already been told by other reviews? The game obviously takes inspiration from Dangaronpa and really makes it shine, resolving a case is not too simple and you may miss clues but you still have time during interrogations to fully make a clear image of the crime, its perpetrator and how they did it; Outside of that you have slice of life moments with the characters and the mc, and you exploring the prison in search of clues to solve the current case.\n\nStory:\nReally good, if possible DO NOT search about it, go fully blind and be surprised of what the game is capable as it will not pull any punches and is a ride that you will enjoy from start to finish.\n\nMusic:\nTo me by far the music is what elevates this game to a masterpiece, from ambient sounds to high tension pursuit themes that really convey the emotions of the moment; Just a small tip, like with the story, try not to search too much about it as they make an even big impact in the heat of the moment.\n\nArt/CGs:\nFantastic, that's the only word I have to express how good it is. It conveys emotions in a very consistent way, you will never think that a sprite doesn't correlate with what happens on screen or how a character acts, the display of emotions is actually really broad with how well they are used.",

Fortunately, Manosaba/まのさば managed to feel like Re:Zero S1 & S2 in VN form. Like Re:Zero, sometimes it's fun and games, sometimes it's total hell. In まのさば, sometimes it's very relaxing CGDCT, and sometimes you're forced to accuse your favorite character and execute them, f*ck. \n\nEven though my JP is still terrible, I didn't encounter any issue on the gameplay difficulty side while playing it (it's trivial to solve via exhaustive brute force, regardless of your JP skill). Can't say much without spoiling, but if you like depression rollercoasters or you're interested in the art style / voice actor (柊優花 voiced one of the main cast), just give it a shot. Also, I love the soundtracks.  \n\nCan't wait for まのむら and whatever Acacia cooks next.",

This game, however, is not like that at all; it takes the orthodox approach and accurately delivers what players want; a deep but not overdone story-line and the great character developments.\n\nFurthermore, the beautiful illustrations and music, and above all, the excellent full voice-over significantly enhance the game's immersion.\n\nIt is a masterpiece highly recommended to anyone who enjoys Visual Novels or light mystery games.",

      "review": "A fantastic mystery/fantasy hybrid which takes inspirations from Dangan Ronpa but features enough unique aspects to stand on its own. Plot, characters, graphics and soundtrack are all superb.\r\n\r\nThe premise is simple: 13 girls are abducted and imprisoned on a remote solitary island because they pose a potential danger to the outside world - as witches. At the age of 15. girls who are compatible with the \"witch factor\" risk turning into witches - wicked, immortal creatures who purely act on murderous instinct and start killing everyone indiscriminately. Therefore, the 13 girls are confined in the witch's mansion and monitored by a mechanical owl called Gokuchou 24/7. However, once the girls fully awaken their witch powers, their minds become corrupted and overcome with uncontrollable murderous intent, inevitably resulting in them killing each other. Your only way to survive is to find the \"witch\" who committed the murder and execute her, as failing to do so will get EVERYONE executed... and so the nightmare begins.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay consists of investigating various places in and around the witch's mansion prior and after a murder and solving these murders during the trial. You can object/agree to arguments, but also inquire further information and even outright lie to corner and expose the culprit. Some cases are weaker than others but overall, they are well written and very fun to solve.\r\n\r\nIf ypu are a fan of puzzle/detective games (and can endure young girls experiencing extreme trauma and suffering), this game is highly recommended... provided you are proficient in Japanese or Chinese. Hopefully, an English localization is on the way - this game deserves to be enjoyed by a global audience.",

      "review": "Masterpiece.\nIn fact this game is so good I felt compelled to write my first Steam review ever.\n\nDanganronpa + magical girls with the Monokuma equivalent being voiced by Frieza would be the quickest way to describe it. If you're a fan of murder mysteries, particularly ones involving locked rooms there's no way you'll dislike this game. All the murder cases are well thought out and despite the setting involving magic, there's no cheap tricks like hidden secondary talents or magical hidden doorways. I never really felt like I was guessing blindly during the cross-examination sections and every case felt deducible using your own logic if you thought things thoroughly enough.\n\nOn the emotional front, this is an incredibly cruel and sadistic game that gets you attached to attached to all the characters only to kill them off one-by-one and turn your favorites into murderers. Everyone has unique, likeable personalities and while there were a few characters I wasn't too fond of at first, in the end there's no one I really disliked. Every death was gut-wrenching and even every execution leaves you with lingering regrets in wishing there could have been a better outcome. The story manages to fully show off how good of a girl everyone is (when they aren't trying to kill each other) and you can't help but wish for everyone's happiness.\n\nFor Japanese learners, the game is on the easier side to read in my opinion due to all the characters being fully voiced and there being tons of furigana so it's easy to look up words. The unvoiced narration isn't that complex either I feel. If you have experience with reading other VNs in JP there shouldn't be any problems though I wouldn't recommend this as a first read to someone just starting out due to the cross-examination sections being on auto-read with there being no way to pause for every single line, meaning you do need enough base knowledge to be able to keep up with the dialogue.\n\nIf there's any complaints that I have about the story, it's that the climax felt a bit cheesy and one of the character's motives for killing felt a bit weaker compared to the others (the case right after the midpoint of the story). But by no means does that overturn how well-written the rest of the game is. I'm writing this having just finished the game feeling a duty to convey just how good it is to others despite not being used to writing these kinds of things, and I really hope this eventually gets an English translation so that the rest of the world can appreciate what an amazing VN this is.\n\nAlso as a tip, if you aren't a completionist turn off bad end hints in the options before you start. The game shows off which choices lead to you getting killed by default.",

      "review": "みんな死ねばいい\r\n\r\nHonestly, a very solid game all around.\r\n\r\nTo echo all the other reviews, the game is basically a mix of Danganronpa with magical girls and Ace Attorney. In the present times of Capcom forgetting AA exists at all and Kodaka having moved on from Danganronpa after V3 (cough cough danganronpa 2x2), one would be hard pressed to find a game that would have an investigation-trial sort of gameplay loop, not even mentioning death game element. And this game in my opinion managed to fill the niche quite nicely.\r\n\r\nThe trial gameplay is rather simplistic: you basically only ever get to listen to the discussion of everyone present in the court and need to either dispute or support the \"correct\" opinion to influence the flow of the trial towards the correct outcome. Gameplaywise I definitely think the trials are really fun and it's been rather entertaining trying to guess 2 or 3 steps ahead about how the murder actually took place. Magic element definitely adds some unexpected twists here and there, but ultimately I would say trials are rather simplistic, if one were to compare it to Danganronpa, where sometimes the entire way you went about to solving the case would get turned upside down. Here the flow is very much straight: outside of maybe 1 particular case, all cases have not had anything mindblowing happening. And the worst part is that when you indict someone, you already know at that point it was 100% that character who did it, which makes finishing up the trial a bit of a chore, as you know the character is basically just gasping at straws, which I think takes away some of the enjoyment from the trial, as \"YOU INDICTED X, BUT IT WAS Y ALL ALONG\" type of twist never happens. One other smaller criticism towards the gameplay would be evidence presentation, as sometimes you have similar types of evidence connected logically with each other, and yet the game expects you to pick the \"correct\" one--I feel like AA handled it better when at these points you would be allowed to submit ideologically similar evidences.\r\n\r\nHowever, for trials being a weaker element story-wise, I would say the overall story of the game is definitely good. While Danganronpa goes into some very edgy nonsense shit, this game tries to establish the setting and follows it to a T, which makes following the story a lot more enjoyable, and I think that's where the game shines. It starts a bit slow, but after that I was finding it hard to stop, as I kept wanting to see more and more.\r\n\r\nCharacters are also a highlight of the game, as many other reviews mention, with unique personalities and circumstances. However, I personally found it really hard to actually sympathize with most of them--be it as a culprit or as a victim. I think their backgrounds are served in a rather not fleshed out manner instead of some sort of gradual reveal of how their lives were and what led to their traumas. Instead you get something like (not an actual example from the game, just a 'inspired by' situation)\r\n\r\n\"Lolla used to live a lavish life, but one day her entire family died in an accident and she ended up being homeless. She found a place to live with the other homeless, but most of them have been vile towards her. Some hitting her, some stealing her food. The beatings never stopped, until one day, she awoke to her power.. Her power allowed her to take revenge on all those evil homeless people, and yet, her wound has never healed\"\r\nVictim: a homeless magical girl\r\n\r\nI am somewhat overblowing it out of proportion, but this was how I saw some of the explanations being like. The other weak point for the murders was motivation behind them--unfortunately the writers either couldn't come up with anything better or just settled on that option--, which in most cases is magical strengthening (魔法化). It felt really lazy and quite a literal Deus Ex Machina to me, because why bother to come up with a proper explanation when you can just say it was magic and you ain't gotta explain shit?\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere and music in the game is really good, and I also want to praise some of the VO work here as well, as some characters are able to establish themselves especially due to their VO (Yuki, Gokuchou, Hiro come to mind, but there are others as well). \r\n\r\nThe above criticism being as it is, I still believe this is a very solid game, and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who likes mystery and/or trial-like ADV games. And I say that as a person who if not outright hates mahou shoujo genre, definitely has nothing to do with it. I was very apprehensive of the game because of it at first too, but the more you play, the more you realize it's a not-so-typical representative of the genre, standing on its own, rather than being outshadowed by the games it tries to take inspiration from.\r\n\r\nThis being the first game this studio has made, I think they managed to set a bar really high and I'm looking forward to the sequel they have already announced (as well as quite openly hinted to within the game's context as well), and recommend it to anyone reading this, if your Mandarin/Japanese allows you to, or to the English audience for whenever the translation does come out.",

(this may change with the switch release as there is already a translated game title in the gamefiles and a reference to korean and english as a pickable language in the locales file)\n\nGameplay:\nWhat can I tell you outside of what has already been told by other reviews? The game obviously takes inspiration from Dangaronpa and really makes it shine, resolving a case is not too simple and you may miss clues but you still have time during interrogations to fully make a clear image of the crime, its perpetrator and how they did it; Outside of that you have slice of life moments with the characters and the mc, and you exploring the prison in search of clues to solve the current case.\n\nStory:\nReally good, if possible DO NOT search about it, go fully blind and be surprised of what the game is capable as it will not pull any punches and is a ride that you will enjoy from start to finish.\n\nMusic:\nTo me by far the music is what elevates this game to a masterpiece, from ambient sounds to high tension pursuit themes that really convey the emotions of the moment; Just a small tip, like with the story, try not to search too much about it as they make an even big impact in the heat of the moment.\n\nArt/CGs:\nFantastic, that's the only word I have to express how good it is. It conveys emotions in a very consistent way, you will never think that a sprite doesn't correlate with what happens on screen or how a character acts, the display of emotions is actually really broad with how well they are used.",

In まのさば, sometimes it's very relaxing CGDCT, and sometimes you're forced to accuse your favorite character and execute them, f*ck. \n\nEven though my JP is still terrible, I didn't encounter any issue on the gameplay difficulty side while playing it (it's trivial to solve via exhaustive brute force, regardless of your JP skill). Can't say much without spoiling, but if you like depression rollercoasters or you're interested in the art style / voice actor (柊優花 voiced one of the main cast), just give it a shot.
