Thankfully, I never spoiled myself!\r\n\r\nSkyrim is one of those games that suffers from being the latest installment in a long running series, and stood as the latest installment for too long. Much like Fallout 4 and GTA V, criticism will emerge out of spite. However, the game ran magnificently and in my near 150 hrs of this playthrough, I only crashed ONCE. Then again, all I did was use the Skyrim Script Extender mod via the Steam Workshop. The game itself plays very well, but I think they made it easier than the previous games in the Elder Scrolls. Without any sort of repair mechanic and very good weapon, armor and enemy scaling, you can literally use the same unique items you found in your first few hours throughout the rest of your journey. I can't say it was bad as I LOVED the Mace of Molag-Bol. Just drain stamina on hit, soul trap them with Azura's Star, recharge, and repeat!\r\n\r\nIn lieu of the difficulty drop, the kinds of builds you can do have increased, with the ability to dual wield weapons and spells being insanely OP if properly spec'd. Speaking of spells, I miss the old Oblivion-style spellcrafting and enchanting. I hated the enchantment system so much that all I did was eventually find the things I wanted via vendor or random drop.\r\n\r\nThe story was interesting, more so for the lore than the action. This along with Fallout are the few games that I enjoy reading the lore in and out of the game world. Plus Lusty Argonian Maid comes back, and dare I say better than ever.\r\n\r\nThe Dawnguard and Solsteim DLCs had better stories than the base game, it was nice to see Morrowind in this game engine! As for Dawnguard, that final battle made me feel like Simon Belmont rushing into the castle to destroy Dracula. It was great.\r\n\r\nI want to recommend this game and ONLY this game, but it is no longer on the Steam Store. If you waited this long to play Skyrim like I did, definitely pick up the Special Edition or whichever one Todd Howard wants to milk. I definitely had a lot of fun with this game, though I got to say that I love Oblivion more.\r\n\r\nNow, I am currently waiting on whether Fallout 5, GTA VI, Elder Scrolls VI, or Half Life 3 is going to drop first.......",

      "review": "[b]Skyrim[/b] is a game many people love, and I respect that, but coming from [b]Oblivion[/b], it just didn’t resonate with me in the same way. Compared to the dense, lived-in cities of Cyrodiil, most of Skyrim’s settlements feel empty and unfinished. Outside of Solitude, Riften, and maybe Whiterun, the towns barely resemble cities at all; they feel more like a handful of NPCs standing around a themed backdrop than actual communities. That same sense of desolation runs through the major factions as well: the Mages Guild is reduced to a lonely tower in the tundra, the Thieves Guild hides in a sewer, the Dark Brotherhood lives in a cave, and even the Fighters Guild stand-in (the Companions) is wrapped up in shady werewolf drama. The dragons are genuinely well-executed - fun to fight, satisfying to absorb, and cool for collecting powers - but the main story around them fell flat for me.\n\nExploration has its moments, but dungeon crawling often blends together, and somehow every interesting ruin eventually led me back to Blackreach. The game also becomes incredibly janky above 60fps. Most games cap themselves, but Skyrim happily breaks unless you manually force a framerate limit through your GPU software. Even the Hearthfire DLC, something I always wanted as a kid, never landed for me in its item requirements or overall execution. Dawnguard and Dragonborn are at least on par with the rest of the experience, but neither elevated the game enough to change my overall impression.\n\nThe only mods I used were simple quality-of-life fixes: SKSE for a better inventory and magic UI, quest markers for the Stones of Barenziah, some color and vibrancy tweaks, colored map markers, and more map controls. Even with those improvements, Skyrim still felt like a waypoint simulator - a game full of potential that I could never fully connect with.

So you need the mule hire but you have to babysit and work your chainmail off to keep it following instead of just disappearing. WRONG. Nothing more to be said.

      "review": "[b]Skyrim[/b] is a game many people love, and I respect that, but coming from [b]Oblivion[/b], it just didn’t resonate with me in the same way. Compared to the dense, lived-in cities of Cyrodiil, most of Skyrim’s settlements feel empty and unfinished. Outside of Solitude, Riften, and maybe Whiterun, the towns barely resemble cities at all; they feel more like a handful of NPCs standing around a themed backdrop than actual communities. That same sense of desolation runs through the major factions as well: the Mages Guild is reduced to a lonely tower in the tundra, the Thieves Guild hides in a sewer, the Dark Brotherhood lives in a cave, and even the Fighters Guild stand-in (the Companions) is wrapped up in shady werewolf drama. The dragons are genuinely well-executed - fun to fight, satisfying to absorb, and cool for collecting powers - but the main story around them fell flat for me.\n\nExploration has its moments, but dungeon crawling often blends together, and somehow every interesting ruin eventually led me back to Blackreach. The game also becomes incredibly janky above 60fps. Most games cap themselves, but Skyrim happily breaks unless you manually force a framerate limit through your GPU software. Even the Hearthfire DLC, something I always wanted as a kid, never landed for me in its item requirements or overall execution. Dawnguard and Dragonborn are at least on par with the rest of the experience, but neither elevated the game enough to change my overall impression.\n\nThe only mods I used were simple quality-of-life fixes: SKSE for a better inventory and magic UI, quest markers for the Stones of Barenziah, some color and vibrancy tweaks, colored map markers, and more map controls. Even with those improvements, Skyrim still felt like a waypoint simulator - a game full of potential that I could never fully connect with.  From my impressions, this review could be copied and pasted to [b]Skyrim Special Edition[/b] as well.",

      "review": "Worst Mechanics EVER\r\nStory, fine. Graphics, fine...but whoever decided to go for colorless arctic gloomscape wasn't thinking clearly. None of that matters. The game's basic mechanics are ridiculous. Hires have shoved me off cliffs or into combat while I was getting position & blocked off doorways more times than I can count, but I can't move them without a command, which they generally ignore. Doing spell damage to your allies and killing them is so dumb I can't even find words. They give you a dog so it will run in front of you and you kill it. The endless stupid seems to be validated by saving and replaying the same thing over and over and over and over until it quits being stupid. Game is better after dumping all your hires since they actively work against you in battle, but then a pinch of salt weighs 0.2 pounds and they saddle you with a 20 pound elder scroll so they can force you to constantly manage inventory, or 'you can't run in combat'. So you need the mule hire but you have to babysit and work your chainmail off to keep it following instead of just disappearing. WRONG. Nothing more to be said. I'm trying to see the end of the story but this is a miserable drawn out tortuous grind of stupid upon stupid after more stupid. D+ just for the story details and some funny dialogue here and there, but the idiots keep saying the same thing about their dead daughter oh how will we ever go on etc etc etc. UGGGH if only I could shut them off or kill them all - but it'd mean killing everyone in Skyrim. No thanks - I'd just have to play more",

      "review": "First of all: the graphics, openness, and sheer size of the game world are impressive for a game from 2011. Jeremy Soule's music is also excellent.  The fact that it is still being played today in 2025 is proof of that. I myself have played it for a good 50 hours, but somehow I couldn't get into it. I used to play countless hours of Dungeons and Dragons (Edition 3.5) with friends and am a big fan of Baldur's Gate I and II as well as Ultima VIII (my first RPG ever). So you could definitely consider me an RPG veteran. Compared to the games mentioned above, however, this game seems incredibly superficial and bland, mainly due to the emptiness of the world and the banality of the dialogues. I had the same problem with Morrowind and Oblivion. I could only play both games for a few hours before I lost all interest. The Elder Scrolls simply lacks depth and immersion. In any case, I didn't have much fun with this game and wouldn't recommend it to an old-school RPG fan like me.",
