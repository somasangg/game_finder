The game can be played singleplayer, but it is best enjoyed with friends, both locally as well as online. Levels feel unique and inspired, with absurd location and kitchen configurations that will make chefs lose their minds. Cooperation is crucial, even if it always a challenge to find a winning plan. Team 17 is known to publish couch games like these, and Overcooked 2 does not disappoint!",

      "review": "[b] Amazing with friends (but not online), and unplayable alone [/b]\n\nOvercooked is an incredibly fun and charming game, full of chaos, laughter, and great moments - as long as you’re not playing alone. The single-player mode is practically unusable. There’s no real adjustment for solo gameplay, no reduced star requirements, no alternative modes - nothing that makes it feel actually playable. \n\nPlaying with friends is a completely different story - that’s when the real magic of Overcooked shines. But even here, there’s a huge issue that’s hard to ignore: it’s 2025, and cross-platform play is still labeled as a “beta feature.” And honestly, it feels like it.\n\nEven if you ignore that part, online play is almost impossible. No matter how good your internet connection is, the non-host players will constantly experience heavy lag, making the game borderline unplayable. As many others already said, and I fully agree: only play this game if everyone is on the same device. Playing online will just ruin your nerves.\n\nOverall, Overcooked! 2 is a fantastic game at its core, and I genuinely love it - which makes it even more disappointing that the developers never bothered to properly optimize online play or finish cross-platform functionality. The whole point of this game is to enjoy it with friends, and not all friends are always in the same room or even the same country.",

      "review": "Fun in co-op, but fully finishing the game requires a mind-numbing amount of repeating the same levels over and over again doing the same three actions in circles. For example, there's an achievement that requires you to use ketchup or mustard 300 times on a hotdog, where you'll do this only 60-70 times naturally while playing the game and clearing all levels for all stars. Then there's 10 more like this. Burn this many wood, put coal this many times in the furnace. An order of magnitude more than you'll do naturally. Waste of time.",

Be careful with your saves, and I think the developers should remake their save system like other games that use world-based saves instead of slots - no one wants to go back to older saves, it is not Minecraft.",

This game looks pretty cool, but don't believe everything on the internet, as my great-granny once said. This game will make you want to sleep with your friends just to get away from the fact that you even tried to touch Kevin with your onion fingers. Recommend? I think not.",
