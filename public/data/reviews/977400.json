      "review": "Having played this game since 2022, after the recent Reality Reboot update I feel it's finally time for me to quit. With that, I'm not saying the game is bad (I did, after all, get over 10,000 hours on it, most of it idle, though), nor that the new update itself is bad. However, it made me realize I wasn't truly enjoying the game anymore, rather just going through the motions, having reached the endgame before the update. With the prospect of having to \"restart\", and I put that in quotation marks because I didn't actually lose progress, I came to the conclusion that the game was no longer for me. At any rate, let's get to a proper review now.\n\nCell to Singularity is an idle game. If you're unfamiliar with the term, it's a genre of games in which you basically watch numbers grow, like Cookie Clicker, to mention one of the most famous examples. The main gameplay loop is that you start by clicking and earning resources that way, which you then use to buy generators, which generate resources on their own. As you unlock better generators and upgrades, you generate more and more resources, and the \"objective\" of the game is basically to unlock everything.\n\nThis game's \"flavor\", to give it a name, is that of evolution, as you start with Earth, early life, and work your way up through all of evolution, including the human species, and even further than that. On top of that, there's three extra modes: the Mesozoic Valley, which is all about the dinosaurs; Beyond, in which you deal with celestial bodies; and finally, Explore, which is a rotation of different themed events. At the end of the day, it's all just flavor text for the same basic gameplay loop, but I'll give this game props for being semi-educational, as each generator, upgrade and achievement includes a brief description with some interesting fact or trivia about it.\n\nI don't think there's much more for me to say about this game, even given my extended playtime. Graphics are pretty simple, and it makes sense, since it's also a mobile game (there's microtransactions, too, but they aren't really needed to progress), but it looks good and stylized. The soundtrack is also nice, although given its idle nature, you'll eventually end up turning it off.\n\nDo I recommend it? Maybe, if you want some background game to check between proper gaming sessions.",

      "review": "Fun game and I wish there were more of its kind. We need more educational games.\n\nI do wish it was a bit more educational for those that want it, it has nice short descriptions of things, but could offer more for those that want it. \n\nSecondly I don't agree with the philosophy of the primary simulation, first off it leaves out plant life completely (maybe they'll make a separate one?), and explains advances such as agriculture away as human ingenuity when in reality we owe much of it to other factors (a settling, steady climate in the case of agriculture). I just thinks it lacks nuance in that sense. Have not made it to the Singularity bit yet but obviously that's also questionable.\n\nFinally, the actual game aspect feels a bit poorly balanced. The engine building doesn't really work all too well when some upgrades cost way more than they'll ever produce and also no, I don't want to click my screen until I get a muscle injury.\n\nWith all that said, the game is a nice and relaxing/satisfying way to learn new things and that will always be good in my book.",

      "review": "Many cell to singularity fans have been long anticipating this update, as have I. I've only played for about 6 months, but within that timeframe i managed to get all steam achievements, get almost every single in game achievement, fully max out primary simulation, beyond simulation, and mesozoic simulation. I love this game to death. So when you fully learn what the game has to offer, get used to every menu, simple color schemes, icons, models, you grow attached and accustomed to it. But this update which revamped the entire primary simulation changes everything.\n\nIf you read the logs, you'll find out the basic stuff about this update, but the truth is, they didn't tell you everything that this update has to offer. So many things have new icons and colors, they added so many new life form evolutions which speed up your primary simulation in unique ways. Theres just so many new things that I'm surprised at every corner of the game I look. I currently am sick with covid-19, but even that won't stop me from enjoying this update. From the desktop icon from the game, to new branches, to the nanobot icons, everything new and revamped is just so lovely.\n\n I look forward to the promising future of cell to singularity. Thank you computer lunch, for making this game. It's helped me during a really rough patch in my life. luv u <3",

Main covering organic life and human tech\r\n2. Prehistoric times with dinosaurs\r\n3. Planetary system\r\n4. Competitive clicking for 2-3 days\r\n\r\nThe main one is meant to be done relatively quickly and by done I mean getting most of the idles and boosters unlocked and the only thing after that makes it long is just how many times you have to repeat it to achieve the over all run boosters. That's to be expected in a idle game\r\n\r\nThe second and third share similar traits in that their boosters can only be improved by getting ranks of them from lil loot box equivalents. So whichever dinosaur or planet you want to expedite isn't really guaranteed because of needing to get the luck to get the ranks and THEN you need a resource to buy the rank up after having enough ranks added to the overall level of the booster. Sure, that's fine. That's not usual from what I know about idle games but it's still a nice bonus since you're still getting boosters.\r\n\r\nThen there's the fourth singularity. I'd call it the 'competition of the week' but it's actually 2-3 days. In order to get anything meaningful from these you pretty much need to work on this one (or run the PC on with an autoclicker) very often. The only real rewards come from getting a higher position in the competitive ranking and most of the top 100 if not more tend to just use their currency to boost or, even better, buy their way into the top ranks. \r\n\r\nAnd then there's the mechanic where there are golden objects flying around the screen. They seem harmless and even beneficial at first. Up until you get one that tells you to spend your currency to get the bonus instead or just skip it. There's even a third option saying you can get the 30 day pass to make these purchases easy by spending some money to make small purchases of in game currency like this free for those 30 days.  They even have a daily sign in bonus where you get that for 15 minutes so for people who weren't wanting to spend money get that taste of fully boosting their singularities to a full 24 hour and X4 productivity. This creates so much more incentive to buy into their artificial difficulty in an idle game. It's free only for the fact that you can watch numbers go up to a small enough degree that it tantalizes the idea of spending money to make the numbers go faster. \r\n\r\nOnce I had physically told about these mechanics to someone the other night I had only realized that I had less fun with this game because of these mechanics and decided to give up on it then and there.",

So why negative? Everything I said is true only for primary simulation. For rest game is on mobile and it shows. You have a dino and space simulations, both have lootbox cards that slow your progression to a crawl, with space its even worse due to clicking providing miniscule gains. Events are pain to complete and you'll have to do it cos you will need augmentations they award for permanent upgrades in dino and space. Oh, and there is only 1 for dino, but at least its decent, for space its 10 separate expensive upgrades that work only on specific planets. Also link your acc to phone to view ads(ofc each ad requires to be closed 3 to 5 times) to gain to get an extra boost, you wont be given enough darvinium(go look up the codes online for those). I decided to not write reviews till I 100% a game(I know Im mentally ill, no need to point that out), but things are crystal clear for me already. If you want to play for like a day and dont care about game screwing your achievements stats go ahead. If you do care though, avoid like fire, otherwise you'll be on a tedious and lengthy quest of completing game, with one achievement requiring you to log for 84 days to get all sharks.

Main covering organic life and human tech\r\n2. Prehistoric times with dinosaurs\r\n3. Planetary system\r\n4. Competitive clicking for 2-3 days\r\n\r\nThe main one is meant to be done relatively quickly and by done I mean getting most of the idles and boosters unlocked and the only thing after that makes it long is just how many times you have to repeat it to achieve the over all run boosters. That's to be expected in a idle game\r\n\r\nThe second and third share similar traits in that their boosters can only be improved by getting ranks of them from lil loot box equivalents. So whichever dinosaur or planet you want to expedite isn't really guaranteed because of needing to get the luck to get the ranks and THEN you need a resource to buy the rank up after having enough ranks added to the overall level of the booster. Sure, that's fine. That's not usual from what I know about idle games but it's still a nice bonus since you're still getting boosters.\r\n\r\nThen there's the fourth singularity. I'd call it the 'competition of the week' but it's actually 2-3 days. In order to get anything meaningful from these you pretty much need to work on this one (or run the PC on with an autoclicker) very often. The only real rewards come from getting a higher position in the competitive ranking and most of the top 100 if not more tend to just use their currency to boost or, even better, buy their way into the top ranks. \r\n\r\nAnd then there's the mechanic where there are golden objects flying around the screen.
