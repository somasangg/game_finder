This game does that. The random encounter with each run also adds a new experience each time. \n\nYou'll go through the same level and some random event may occur, which adds to the experience as you gain new perks to beast out your character in a run. \nVery satisfying game vs the other beat em up out there. Best beat em up roguelike out now, that's for sure. Game is so good I'm waiting for updates and new dlc..",

      "review": "[h2]Absolum [/h2]\r\n\r\nIn my humble opinion, this is one of the best indie debuts of the year.\r\nAbsolum is a beat em up roguelike, not the most mind-blowing genre combination, but the game turned out excellent in the end.\r\n\r\nThe cartoonish art style does a lot to enhance the storytelling. The story itself may seem simple (and it is simple), but the game draws you in not with its plot, but with the way it presents it through the environment and gameplay situations.\r\n\r\nAside from the main mission, the game offers a solid number of side quests that are important for metaprogression, as is the case with nearly every roguelike these days. There are also branching paths, and unfortunately, you can’t complete every side quest in a single run, even with perfect play.\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3600825326\r\nThere are four playable characters with different playstyles, each having six unique arcana (abilities). Before each run you get to choose one of them, and of course, building fun and crazy builds, as every good roguelike allows, is also part of the experience. One of the strongest builds I had was based on throwable items, coins. Enemies had absolutely no chance, especially since there is a cheat code for infinite money.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed almost everything, though I do have questions about the endgame content. To unlock the true ending, the developers in my opinion went a bit overboard with stretching out the process. You will need quite a few runs even with fully maxed out metaprogression. At that point the game becomes significantly harder, but I suppose that is perfect for players who felt the main part of the game was too easy, because it really is not very difficult.",

Really snappy, responsive controls, excellent pacing, and it strikes a fun balance with the difficulty curve, where it's quite tough at the start of a run but you can make some really broken builds and just freestyle on enemies by the end.\r\n\r\nThe production values are really great - the visual variety and character of all the different areas is great, the voice acting is (mostly) great, the animations are really fluid and satisfying, and the music is a joy - get the soundtrack edition, if you do that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nOne thing I actually really appreciate about the game is the theming, story, and tone. It actually reminds me a lot of Dark Souls in how information about the world is conveyed to you, and it has a proper dark fantasy story and setting. More balanced in its presentation of good & evil than I was expecting from a punch game with a blue skin girl where you play in \"the resistance\", but it never gets too navel-gazey or edgy.\r\n\r\nI feel like I could recommend this to basically anyone who wants to play a fun, satisfying video game.

      "review": "Absolum is one of my personal picks for GOTY\r\n\r\nAdmittedly I'm not a huge Beat 'em up player nor was I ever good at fighting games but this game really stuck out, in an amazing way. I came across Absolum by accident on a random YT video. The moment I saw the trailer I immediately added it to my wishlist and waited for the demo to drop. Roguelite and a striking art style is all that it needed to convince me.\r\n\r\nThe demo was even better than I had expected and made me wait even more anxiously for the actual release. Now as stated, I'm not an avid fighting game fan but I have surface level knowledge about the FGC in general but this game's control is tight and extremely satisfying. Worry not If you, like me, have zero experience with Beat 'em up and mostly just button smash, combos in Absolum is pretty easy to pull off and even cooler to watch. It allows you to make absurdly overpowered builds by combining character-unique moves and trinkets that drop or you can buy along the way. One game, I had a build where I could spam an army of cosmic horror summons just with two buttons.\r\n\r\nThe story is your average chosen ones going up against the big bad, nothing to write home about but it serves the roguelite elements well enough. The secrets are where the game shines, though, but that is for  you players to find out. As you progress through the game, winning or losing, you'll unlock more stuffs meta progression-style, typical roguelite gameplay loop. \r\n\r\nThe character design reminds me of old-school DnD character and you'll also unlock two more characters (fingers crossed for more DLC characters) and their questlines, which will reward you with even more goodies.\r\n\r\nLovely hand-drawn art and banger music (featuring the Mick Gordon) really tie the whole package together neatly. The game is worth it full price and hopefully more people buy it to fund the devs' future DLC plans.",

You save these for a powerful boss, and then it tickles them.\n-  Your magic power, which is meant to be your main strength also seems to tickle most enemies and you are limited to two uses with minor upgrades, and then you have to recharge.\n- You only get to choose one magic power before runs, and you can't even swap them after a level has finished.\n- After the first main boss the difficulty starts to spike, and the later bosses become OP.\n- Runs take 45 mins plus, so I have players leave before the end in some cases.\nI think these weaknesses have become more apparent as most of the people I play with are competent gamers with more upgrades, and I can see them struggling in the later levels same as me.\nI would love to see more games like this, but I would just like to see some difficulty options or better balancing for online co-op via matchmaking.",

Added into that is a sprinkle of fighting game DNA,  where you get the best parts of blocking/parrying and air juggling opponents.  The characters are pretty different,  and there are plenty of alternate paths, special events, etc.  A bonus is that the presentation is top-tier - it has detailed cartoon-level animation,  meaty sound effects and a great soundtrack (with a shout out to Mick Gordon for his cameo on the Underking's theme).

      "review": "Majority of review done after 18hrs, edited along with added criticisms after 28hrs and 100% achivements.\n\n I've 100% Hades 1 on two platforms and this is more fun. The best side scrolling beat-em up I've played and one of the best rogue-lites which doesn't feel like a rogue-lite.\n\nThere's so much to like about Absolum, fantastic artistic style throughout, the nods and winks to other combat games, good voicework and some great soundtracks, really well implemented rogue-lite systems but the big appeal here is the gameplay. There are some issues which I feel more comfortable discussing after 28 hours of gameplay and getting all the achievements.\n\nIt's a super smooth, simple yet technical combat system which has tons of depth and when the rogue-lite elements of each run are mixed in you have combat system that is fun, rewarding and feels fresh with each run. One of my favourite things about Absolum is the great feeling of progression in your own skill and mastery of the combat. When I first started the game I would struggle to beat the bosses on the first island, at 5 hours in I was getting through them easier and at 7 hours in I was depleting half the boss' health with one combo and it such a rewarding feeling.\n\nThe rogue-lite systems here come in two forms. You have the meta progression earned from 3 different currencies. One to buy permanent stat boosts, more health, loot drop chances etc, the second is to buy character specific abilities, Arcanes, and the third is to upgrade the in run combat buffs. Progression through these is really well paced and no matter how good or bad you are at the game you will earn them at some point.\n\nThe second form of the rogue-lite systems are the buffs you get in each run. The base combat system is made of strikes (light attack), skills (heavy attacks), Arcanes (character specific specials), dodge, deflect (block) and clash (parry). \nEveryone one of these can be buffed in someway by magic crystals you find in your runs. For example one crystal might add burn damage to your strikes, one might give you armour when use a skill, one might give you an electric explosion with each successful clash. \nThere's essentially 7 different elements each of which have some kind of buff for every aspect of combat, these buffs can be levelled up during a run and there's ton of synergy between them. At 15hr I was still finding new buffs and new synergies, it really makes every run feel different.\n\nWhere Absolum differs from many rogue-lites is that THE LEVELS ARE NOT PROCEDURALLY GENERATED. There is a map that contains multiple routes and various stages but each stage 1 or 2 variations but they are always the same. Enemies you can encounter can differ especially once you've completed your first run but the levels/ stages will always be one of the variants. I really appreciate this approach because it doesn't feel like I'm playing a rogue-lite, I feel like I'm playing SNES game where I'm just trying to finish the game before I lose all my lives.\n\nThe map itself is simple but again really well implemented, there's 4 islands total and each run you will visit 3. The 3 islands that make up the first two levels have multiple routes, secrets and quests. Some of these quests trigger on arrival or discovery and some are character specific, at 17hr in I was still finding new quests and had ones still to finish.\n\nLet's compare it to HADES. Hades 1 is my most played rouge-lite game (barring Balatro) and it's been my standard for combat based rogue-lites, so how does Absolum stack up to Hades?\nI can easily say I've had more fun with Absolum than Hades simply because of how good the combat feels. Hades has good combat but it doesn't feel as good as it does in Absolum, there's a real sense of control and mastery over the basics here along with a feeling of skill improvement that very few games have never mind Hades.\nThe only aspect where I would put Hades above Absolum is that Hades story, lore and interactions with characters are very integral to the Hades experience. Absolum has these things but not to the level Hades does. \nHowever I don't think Absolum needs it whereas Hades does. In Hades the interactions and progression you have with the characters can be a driving force for you to do more runs whereas in Absolum that driving force is mainly the fun of just playing the game.\n\nNow the game does have issues, the first one I encountered was during online co-op. It's fantastic the game has local and online co-op and I enjoyed playing it but the problem with it is once you get to mid game there are so many enemies on screen, many of them large, you will often not be able to see your character. I did one run where near the end of the game every 30 seconds I would completely lose my character on screen and I have no idea where it was. I think the best way to remedy this would be reduce the enemy count and up the enemy health.\n\nThe combat is super smooth and technical and I really enjoyed learning it. But to me, what separates the really good and the excellent is the ability to have full control over your character and own the battles, no matter what happens if you have the skill and knowledge you can deal with anything without getting touched, think Bayonetta, DmC etc. Sometimes this is Absolum especially in the first island but as you progress through the game and enemies become more difficult and their numbers go up there are so many times were being hit just seemed unavoidable, whether it be too many enemies on screen and not being able to see clearly, too many attacks coming at once or enemy attacks that sync perfectly so taking some damage is unavoidable. \n\nBosses are a weak point, the bosses are in the first island are actually really good they serve as tests of your fundamental skills but after that I never felt like I was able to really react to what the bosses where doing. Their attacks and hit boxes became ambiguous to the point I wouldn't be bothered about getting hit by them and I beat not by learning them but just putting out a ton of damage. \nThe last two bosses also suffer from this but they're also a big jump in difficulty. I only ever beat the final boss once and the boss before it about 6 times simply because I had no clue what was going on in those fights. In hindsight I would exploit quitting to the main menu to constantly replay these bosses to learn them. \n\nI've mentioned how the stages have set designs but the enemies can vary from run to run, one of the games issues is how much the enemies can vary. There were times when on my second screen I would have 4 armoured champion goblins spawn. Armoured enemies are difficult to do with as they are because they aren't susceptible to combos and launches like regular enemies, so having 4 spawn at once is really difficult to deal with especially at the beginning. The RNG of the enemies can be the difference between leaving an island with all lives and full health and leaving with no lives and half a health bar. \n\nOverall I've really enjoyed my time with Absolum. Really excited to see what come next either for this game or from the devs.",

      "review": "Gameplay and Premise:\nAbsolum is beat 'em up with roguelite elements and a progression system based on unlocking new abilities and stat boosts by completing quests, progressing through the story and just playing long enough.\n\nCombat is easily the highlight of the game: you can sidestep, sprint, clash your attacks with your enemies and many other things (some are character specific), every move you make can lead to different attacks, allowing for aggressive juggles and combo-styled play, as well as more methodical approaches involving ranged attacks, deflects, clashing and dodging to punish your enemies (and the games rewards you highly for pulling any of these off but it won't be easy most of the time)\n\nYou can play as one of four characters (two at the beginning), each with a decently sized move list and a very distinct playstyle that can be further customized through unlocks or during your runs.\n\nThe level layouts and the multiple branching paths you play in are fixed and not procedurally generated, but the enemies you encounter, the loot they drop and some events have a random chance of appearing. This helps making each run feel different enough to grant some replay value without the obnoxiousness of taking away control of the run from the player or having to rely on luck to clear many of the game's quests.\n\nEach complete run lasts for 1 hour on average, but it will take a lot of tries and learning before your first win. This is a challenging game but it is done in a tasteful, not frustrating way that feels more rewarding the better you get at it.\n\nI only wish there was more to do after completing every quest and getting the first few wins with every character, like additional difficulty settings or a scaling NG+ system similar to Hades' Heat system or StS's Ascensions... or maybe something else entirely\n\n\nVisuals & Sound:\nThe game fully commits to a 2D artstyle, with professioanlly drawn sprites and a very colorful look. The levels are full of intricate details and spotting them is part of the fun. \n\nThe characters are also very nice to look at in motion, though the chaotic nature of the fights can sometimes make it hard for the player to focus on the parts that involve not losing.\n\nThe game features a magnificent soundtrack that perfectly suits the atmosphere of the game, spanning many different genres and featuring several recognizable names in the industry.\n\n\nConclusion:\nOverall I highly recommend this game to any fan of action games in general, as well as roguelite enjoyers: it feels very nice to play, look and listen to and it even features co-op if you want to play with a friend and runs at locked 60 FPS on Steam Deck with relatively low battery cost",

It has a deep story with characters you care about. The story isnt noble and cheesy, its dark and real. Finding out where someone came from in this game makes you understand why they are fighting. \nThe cast of playable characters are all very fun. With their own unique abilities, synergies, builds, storys, and play-styles.  no one character is the best and they are all fun in their own way.\nthe world is beautifully designed, with a fantastic art style. a lot of love went into making sure everything looked fluid for sure. the runs seem random but they might be seeded i do not know for sure. the encounters are fun and unique. completing something difficult in this game really gives you the sense of accomplishment. \nthe games combat is very fluid and rewarding. its easy to tell that you are getting better at the game when you are playing. and your runs will go farther faster and easier as you do.\n\nThough this game isnt all good, here are some criticisms and nitpicks i have after 100% clearing the game. \nLittle replay value once you have done everything. since you can choose what bosses you face and the order you do thing as well as since the run does have a finite amount of stages, for me it becomes hard to want to replay the game without an objective. the runs arent as exciting given i know what im going to do and when it will end before ive started. making a random mode, an endless mode or some sort of boss rush mode could do this game wonders though balancing for that may be difficult.\nsome very annoying rooms, enemys, and bosses. i will take full credit for a potential skill issue here but sheilded enemys, oathkeepers, and asra were not fun for me. they are well designed but i think they miss the mark and slow down combat in a less enjoyable way.\nnow i know that the story requires a mothers grace to fight absolum, i get it. but why do i need one to fight him everytime? this also ties into the replay value as its not enjoyable for me to have to play my life so hard through a whole run just to fight the real final boss.\nMake this game 4 player co op please, theres 4 playable characters just do it itd be so much fun to play this game with 3 other friends. the 2 player co op is super good already.\n\nso if youre thinking about getting this game absolutely do! its one of the best games ive played in recent years and i cannot reccomend it enough. if new content comes out and or they fix some of my gripes i will have to come back and edit this comment.",

I can't say enough how much I like the backgrounds.\r\n+ Gameplay loop\r\n+ Some bangers in the OST\r\n+ Duration\r\n+ There is room for a promising DLC\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- There is wokeness here and it is not subtle about it. Most men are evil and white. One of the characters is unsure of her gender, another was a female before but now is male (the frog) and it took me a lot to realize the starting character was female. There is a difference between not sexualizing a woman and making her look like a man. The list marches forth with an african-woman-pregnant-mother-earth in an european medieval fantasy world (which is nuts) leading your team... but you can skip these very optional dialogues and don't even notice. Although all this is intentional and almost a speech you are being fed. If this is a gripe for you... run. I'm too old to care or change my evil fashioned ways.\r\n\r\nBut here's the thing. A quote from the devs: \"but we wanted to have something that fits more with our modern culture. As a result, the warrior is a woman, non-sexualized.\"\r\nAnd here is where I have an opinion on all this. Between a sexualized female character like Red Sonja and Galandra from this game there is such a huge room for non sexualized female desings that STILL LOOK LIKE A WOMAN. This is not \"non-sexualized\", this is political speech. Specially when in the last decades, for a man to be featured on a film he has to have the torso of a greek god. I went to an art school, I often drew naked people that were posing live for the class. Why is everybody so obsessed with genitalia nowadays? And telling the others how the rest of body should look like? It is tiring. Relax, I don't know how big are your echo chambers, but real life is not like this.",

Not being able to stagger them in any way until you focus them hard enough is really stupid and while you're doing that, you're getting smacked by the 5 other enemies around you. \nArmored enemies and enemies with shields are just as annoying\nThe final boss is also complete horsecockey. It being easy isnt the only issue, the other issue comes from the fact that the boss punishes you for doing well by doing an unblockable, unavoidable attack that will kill you. \nLastly the game's online could use some work. Playing co-op with certain characters makes the action almost impossible to follow which doesn't help with the lag. Being on Discord or Teams while playing makes the game run like Borderlands 4\nWith that being said however, the game is still fantastic.

I was hesitant on Absolum but I watched a single video on youtube and don't regret it at all. The combat is really fun and addicted if you really try to immerse yourself in the game. All the playable characters are fun to use and each have their own unique aspects that makes them different. Although it is easy to just stick to one character because there are so many different upgrades and abilities that you can unlock during runs that it makes you want to explore every ability. My favorite part of the game is the story. The story is a little spaced out and is a difficult to understand, but it is enjoyable and there are some good moments. The story is spaced out because you really do have to look in every area. It helps this game because my favorite thing was that every run I saw or did something different, there was always something new to find. The difficulty does go up with the amount of runs you play and there is an option after you beat the final boss that allows you to make it harder on top of the scaling. My biggest peeve is the bosses. It probably is a skill issue but the bosses in the two second areas that you could explore are really annoying. They are beatable but make sure to learn their move set because they are challenging. I also wish, while not a huge issue, that there was more meta progression. You can completely max out everything in about 15-ish hours. I was able to 100% in about 25 hours so I kinda hoped that the meta-progression lasted longer. I think the game is worth it just because of Brome's babies. They are easily the best thing in the entire game.",

Some abilities however are outright bonkers broken, and there is not much middle ground. It would be nice to focus on the characters movesets, but they are tediously basic out of the box, with more interesting moves locked behind roguelite per-run progression - and again you might not even see the good options during play. Some moves are actually traps to pick as they make existing moves behave in a less useful or predictable way, whereas others, when unlocked completely break a run.\r\n\r\nAbsolum would be an incredible beat 'em up if the roguelite elements were completely stripped out.

I found this problematic with solo play and even worse with multiplayer.\r\n\r\nTheres several enemies in this game too that just feel downright unfair, then, youll have to deal with those same enemies with super armor. This leads to being put in some almost unavoidable situations. For example the white demon with 4 claws. These guys like to spawn clouds that rain a huge laser down on top of you. These enemies are allowed to spam this attack should they get the opportunity. The only way to prevent this is by flinching them with an attack. Later on, these enemies will sometimes appear super armored and cannot be flinched. You see what im getting at here. Enemies like this can be the end of an otherwise perfect run. You'll feel robbed and like the time you just spent was wasted entirely. Just one example i can think of off the top of my head of poor design choices.\r\n\r\nShould this stuff be fixed, ill gladly reverse my review.

      "review": "The game is basically split into two: the beat em' up portion and the rogue-lite portion.\r\n\r\nThe beat em' up part of the game is generally quite well done. The attacks are satisfying and very \"punchy\", deflects and punishments work well, the skills feel quite good, the art, animations and music are just wonderful and the game simply feels good to play. I also enjoyed all 4 playable characters, they all play quite differently form each other and add a lot of variety. \r\nIt does have it's issues like how the dodge is utter trash or sometimes it's a bit hard to align your self with an enemy properly, but you get used to it eventually. \r\n\r\nThe issues lie almost entirely in the rogue-lite portion of the game.\r\nFirst of all it doesn't have a good loop and it's very short. Without spoilers it does a poor job at excusing your ability to basically beat the game forever, and for a story based game you'd expect significantly better. \r\nThe game has an issue many bad rogue-lites have which I call \"micro-upgrades\". Many upgrades the game offer you - both permanent and temporary - are minuscule, often 1-10% increases. To me this is inexcusable and a very clear attempt to either pad out upgrades, avoid balancing higher numbers, or both. In addition to this for what ever reason the devs decided that as you get more permanent upgrades the entire game should get harder, including the earliest parts of the run, instead of giving you a system to increase difficulty to your liking for each run. This means that any upgrade you get doesn't matter in the least because the game will always be harder to counteract what ever tiny amount of increased stats you've gained. The rituals them selves are quite poorly balanced and some are CLEARLY better then others with damage numbers so low you'll never even bother, and many of their effects tied to things like dodges which you'll never do because they're trash. \r\n\r\nTLDR it should have been a linear beat em' up, everything \"rogue-litey\" about this game is poorly done and takes away from an otherwise 8/10 experience.",

      "review": "I appreciate what Absolum is trying to do, as I've really not seen a game try to be a brawler, a roguelite, and still maintain a relatively story-driven feel to most of it. Unfortunately, it's not a flawless relationship, and there are pieces of each that really drag down on the others.\r\n\r\nThe brawler-bit is pretty good. I definitely don't enjoy the later stages very much and outright dislike the final boss(es) but I'm willing to take the L on that and say that's a player skill issue. However, I'm not willing to blame myself when the buffered input means I can dodge right, hold left, hit the dodge key, and my character dodges right again. In a game where the dodge system is designed so each direction is pivotal to avoiding or interrupting an enemy's attack (and yet they've somehow made it so dodging backwards is worthless, and also many clashes pushes you/the enemy so far back you can't take advantage of it) the controls not being extremely tight to inputs is tough to stomach. Enemy designs are fine, I dislike that many of them have the same skill effects that the player's rituals do because it becomes difficult to discern what is/isn't yours, and I had a fight against one the final boss where he got stuck in a loop of doing one move (where he jumps to the left, charges across the arena, and a shockwave of water comes out) no less than seven consecutive times. Oh yeah, also he just kills you at the start of the fight. Like, his intro cutscene he just kills you and any companions you have. Hope you have a spare revive!\r\n\r\nThe roguelite aspect is again, fine. It has all the staples - metaprogression, random ritual/item drops, etc etc. I'm not a huge roguelite connoisseur but I feel like many of the items/rituals are very playstyle-specific and it's pretty common to get something that you really won't ever make use of during that run. I do at least appreciate that nothing seems to have depreciating values - the shield will always give you -10% damage taken, even if it's the fourth one you've picked up.\r\n\r\nThe story is... say it with me, it's fine. The story's fine. Unfortunately, this is where I think the other two elements of the game really become frustrating, and the only reason I've not put the game down after like 6 hours is because I'm a little completion freak who feels obligated to 100% my entire steam library. There are so many little pauses and stops during the game that you can speed up, but not skip, nor is there a setting to just turbo skip through them. You enter the boss arena, the boss has to do a little animation, be like \"ah yes this is your 14th run let's fight again\" and your character has to be like \"CHILIDOGS\" and THEN you can fight. At the end of a run you have to wait for like 30 seconds for the map to slowly tally up your total and then think about it for however long before you return to the game - it's a roguelite my brother in christ just let me start another run. Another specific annoyance is that each character has a quest, which means you MUST play that character, the next step could activate and require something you don't have and can't get, and the final nail in the coffin is that you're STILL at the mercy of RNG. I was doing Karl's, went to the specific node I needed to go to, and it just didn't give me the right map to actually do what I needed to do. Well, I don't need anything else from this, so it's a dead run. Try again, go to the same node, oh look the game actually gave me the right screen, I now have to go to a door in literally the same map, cool. I go there, it's like 'Hey idiot you don't have the right thing.' Awesome, dead run. Do it all over again, the game doesn't spawn the thing I need to open the door by the time I get to it, great, dead run. And every time I do end the run, I have to sit for like 30 seconds while it thinks about my score. It fuckin' sucks, dude.\r\n\r\nI really try to be positive about indie games that are trying other stuff, because I know no one's going to knock it out of the park on their first attempt, and I want to celebrate people trying to innovate but this game very much overstayed its welcome after like 4 hours and now playing it any further just feels like hooks in the skin with weights I have to drag and hope to whatever higher power there is that RNG will give me the thing I need so I can play the game and not just coin flip me into another DEAD RUN.",

      "review": "I have no idea how this is so insanely well reviewed (not true, I know it's because the art is incredible), but I take solace in the few negative reviews mirroring almost all of my complaints about the game and then some. \n\nFor starters, the entire roguelite upgrade system here is hot diggidy dogwater. Completely unsatisfying, RNG, non-impactful generic boons that BARELY affect gameplay, coupled with completely random Daedalus hammers that range from usable to unacceptably awful. Further, there is such an insane amount of (unsatisfying) boons that affect your dodge/block/clash/sprint. All four of those abilities are on the same button btw. If you are confused, that is because it IS confusing. I'd be willing to bet that the metrics on how often people choose boons that affect deflect/dodge/sprint when attack/special boons are ALSO choices, look absolutely hilarious. It literally never feels good to pick any of these soggyass defense boons because they are innately uninteresting and will always feel less efficient than directly buffing any of your MAIN damage sources. If there was more agency and you could get a true dash build, like a hades 2 jetpack build, then sure, I could see it. It would still be niche, but at least it would be controllable and deliberate. As it stands, the system is so random that you CAN end up with a completely homeless Frankenstein build that excels at absolutely nothing, provides 0 impact on your playstyle and does 0 damage. As soon as you're done upgrading the completely one-dimensional \"skill tree\", you can use that currency to re-roll your in-game choices. Before that though, it feels awful to use said currency only to re-roll your dodge boons into some clash boons, or impact boons or any of these other stupid names for random combat interactions that exist in this game. Just for reference, clash is when your attack actively collides with an active enemy attack. That's an entire class of upgrades. A buff that ONLY happens when you and the enemy attach each other at the SAME time. Remove from pool. \n\nAnyways, I would actually forgive the whole boon system fiasco if the combat was at least fluid and snappy (see: Entropy Effect, Hades, Dead Cells etc), but it's not. It's visually and sonically satisfying, so I think that's why I was able to finish the game, but regardless it's clunky and non-responsive with inherently conflicting design choices. Why do you want me to mash buttons but then also want me to completely stop pressing buttons, so I am not locked into an animation when I need to dodge? Why is there NO animation canceling whatsoever? Why are the incoming attack indicators completely inconsistent? Why is there only 1 button for dash, sprint, block, deflect w/e the fuck else this game wants to call parry. Why is the Z-axis so inconsistent? Why can enemies hit me from ANYWHERE on the Z-axis but I can't hit them unless I am literally IN their ass? Why is throwing an item and picking it up the same button? Why are there so few base combos or abilities? Why are there no starting loadouts to establish at least some form of usable foundation? It feels like they made a 2-hour long game and then minced the characters and the content up into little bits and pieces and sprinkled it out to instead last ~10 hours or so. Which is still robbery at 25$ IMO. Bosses are also abominations. Tons of non-reactable, non-readable, non-telegraphed baloney attacks that you gotta just hold the L on. Enemies have this too, but most normal enemies are weak enough that it doesn't really matter, though for some elites it's still pretty annoying. \n\nLast boss is especially hog so he gets his own section. To preface, the runs in this game are long, I'd say anywhere between 40-60 minutes on average. The last biome is usually the shortest and can be done very quickly, like 5 or so minutes if you really wanted to. There is also a fake last boss that you have to fight in order to get to the true last boss, which is annoying enough. The TRUE TRUE last boss though, will ALWAYS kill you once, no matter what, when you arrive at the fight, before the fight even begins. Death by cutscene. 0 counterplay. The only option is to reach the last boss with at least 1 death defiance. If you have no death defiances, and you've reached the last biome after a nice girthy 48 minute run, you simply can not do anything other than fail. If beating the game was your goal, you are better off quitting the run as soon as you realize you will not have a death defiance for the last boss. This is unacceptable. Baffling how no one on the dev team thought it was a bad idea to waste possibly an HOUR of the players time? Beyond that, the fight is ALSO garbaggio. 3 long phases of waiting for full screen whirlwinds or full screen laser matrices before you can actually do damage. Lots and lots and lots of waiting.\n\nLastly, the story progression is obnoxious. You have to play as different characters and then talk to the characters in camp that you are not currently playing as and THEN play those characters and do specific quests during the run. If you don't do this, you will not progress most of the game's stories and you will not see some of the (few) different biomes. \n\nI think if this game was pixel art or some other over saturated/generic artstyle, it would NOT be getting glazed like this.

After (((trying))) for 20 hours before actually buying the game, I safely say that it's a pretty good beat 'em up, one of the best recent entry actually, that's ABSOLUTELY MARRED by the rougelite element. \r\nThe crux of this game is to beat the enemies (duh) using the various mechanics present: the type of Ritual, the synergy between said Rituals, counter, Clash (hitting enemies flashes with red with your Y skill), dodge to Punish, Tech (when enemies are hit to the corner of the screen), thrown projectiles, and the variety of items. \r\nThe game encourage you to continue your combo by dodging, clashing and air juggling, which I do love. What I don't love is the random elements introduced: you are beholden by the RNG to give you the Rituals and items you want for a run. The only thing you can control is your chosen character and one Ultimate skill at the start. If you get a slew of trash Ritual you lose. If you're thrown to the arena with annoying buffed enemies that can counter your jumping attack, you'll lose your health and then lose your run. Basically, the draw of being a roguelite and the desire of having a 'perfect run' ruins the experience for me, since that'll never happens. A varied set pieces would help, but the game is actually quite sparce in content at the moment with only 2 available path after defeating the Underking, and you'll get to the final boss area with recycled enemies. \r\nSo yea: The game is polished-ish (the bugs I encounter are mostly graphical), the gameplay system is shaped to give a lot of satisfaction that's hampered greatly by rougelite. I don't care about the story either, it's very generic and yet being force fed to you a lot at the start. Luckily they are able to be fast forwarded, but I prefer having none to preserve the flow of play. Mick Gordon is truly a master of his craft and too bad he only made one track for this game.",

      "review": "While this game has interesting gameplay, the entire context and story are focused on a political agenda.\n\nAll the characters in the game have a woke and LGBT agenda behind them, which you discover through the game's dialogues.\n\nMain Playable Characters:\n\nGalandra is a female character with an androgynous design (trans woman). Story: A courtesan (prostitute) who becomes a warrior (Mary Sue/Feminist), and she is ugly, which is part of the agenda that women cannot be beautiful so as not to offend the trans community.\n\nCider is a female character who lost an arm and a leg (disabled person), uses prosthetics, has mental health issues, and does not consider herself male or female (non-binary). She wears a mask and has horrible hair, which is part of the agenda that women cannot be beautiful so as not to offend the trans community.\n\nBrome is a mage who is male, but in the game it is revealed that he was initially female and changed sex (gender fluid) to have his own offspring. Message that sex change is possible and that men can get pregnant or that women can inseminate.\n\nCarl or \"Karl\" (own theory) is a dwarf who, in many dialogues, tries to be the wise mentor. I think his name is a reference to Karl Marx, creator of leftist and communist lines of thought.\n\nSecondary Characters\n\nThe Goddess or Spiritual Guide is a pregnant Black woman because it's fashionable in woke pop culture to have a pregnant Black woman in charge of other people.\n\nA lesbian pirate captain, with a masculinized design and overly muscular shoulders, is part of the agenda that women can't be beautiful...\n\nA big fat lizard-man boss with pierced nipples; the design is inspired by furry/gay hentai.\n\nGoblins are beings in tune with nature, born from sacred trees, and they want to live in peace, the opposite of how goblins were portrayed before the woke culture (as a Goblin Slayer fan, this annoyed me a lot).\n\nThere are other subliminal messages throughout the game that, if I described them all, would take all day.\n\nI missed some side quests, so I didn't complete 100% of the game's content and therefore didn't get all of the woke agenda in the game.

      "review": "Absolum has so many interesting and unique ideas but the shortcomings in gameplay make it hard to recommend. I just finished beating the last boss and am posting this review.\n\nIt's got a stunning art style and good animation work. Incredible music. Fairly likeable and interesting characters. But the gameplay has some glaring issues that make it feel tedious and frustrating. The animations feel clunky and inconsistent, the dash is basically useless, and the parry/deflect/dodge mechanics are very difficult to implement into a smooth playstyle. The game is very clunky feeling, animations take a long time to come out, which means that its hard to flow into parrying and dodging while still trying to stay on the offense. \n\nThe movement speed is too slow. It's close to impossible to get in on some bosses and get out again without being hit. The clunky animations make it so that you basically have to wait and stand still in order to parry something, which kind of kills the flow of the combat. The game also has issues with keeping track of whats going on, the screen becomes overloaded with characters and effects, most character models look similar and it can be hard to keep track of everything. \n\nThe game feels slightly difficult as well, at least artificially. it's extremely stingy with health drops, some runs it gives you a decent amount, other runs hardly anything. The roguelite aspects are shallow and the builds don't seem to come together very well. It felt like I was just mashing my way to victory rather than having to think and plan my strategies for most fights. I only managed to beat it because I got a ridiculously strong build in the end. But really I was just mashing and spamming arcana and the enemy couldn't do anything. \n\nIt's not a bad game by any means but it's definitely got some huge flaws and I feel it may be a little overrated right now. I got 10 hours out of it and and am unlikely to ever play it again. The music is by far the best thing about the game, some truly brilliant soundtracks in there. \n\n6.5/10.",

      "review": "Could and should be among the best beat-em-ups of all time but has some asinine mechanics that shove it into the middle of the pack or lower. Block and dash are the same button, which is one of the craziest things I've ever seen. Instead of dodging at the last minute, you'll block if you time it correctly. Which is great, unless you are trying to get away from a pack of enemies, in which case they'll just pummel you after your initial block. You can't animation cancel mid attack into a block, so better hope no one attacks during that time because you're going to get hit; which is probably the biggest drawback for me and the reason it gets a solid, solid \"not recommend\". Also, your special attack does not provide invulnerability, nor does it even have any iframes. ??? \n\nBtw I played the \"wizard\" drow looking class. You know how wizards are known throughout every story ever told as being magic users and casting spells? Well not here. You cast ZERO spells as a wizard. Read it again baby. No spells to cast as a wizard. So of course instead you get the typical wizard skills of punching, kicking and using a giant sword. You know, standard magic user faire. Why spend your life pouring over books and tomes to learn ancient magic when you can just call yourself a wizard and not do any wizardy stuff? What in the blue hell is going on here?! A WIZARD WITH NO SPELLS BUT INSTEAD IS SKILLED IN MARTIAL ARTS. I hope these guys never make a football game because I assume everyone will get on the field in ice skates with baseball bats. \n\nAnyway, this is roguelite so you're supposed to be unlocking things as you fail and get progressively stronger. After 6 runs I feel absolutely no positive difference despite unlocking like 10 buffs. Oh, I can now choose between 5 or 6 different \"special attacks\", but who cares? They all do basically the same thing and no invulnerability. Enemies always do a lot of damage to me, actually even MORE damage to me during my subsequent runs, after upgrading my def and hp. Not sure how that's possible. Meanwhile if I hire a bodyguard, every one of them is an unkillable wall, and they take almost zero damage, even when getting full on smashed in the face. I guess the hirelings don't have to play by roguelite difficulty rules like the rest of us. \n\nYou can't backtrack, not even a little bit during the stages. It has that old, NES/SNES/Genesis thing where if you move forward too far you can't go backwards because the game doesn't want you to. Miss a pickup on the ground? Too bad you can't go back and get it even if it's just a couple inches back from where the game decides the next battle is going to be. \n\nYour boons/buffs are maybe ok but there seem to be so few. Are they tied to class? I don't know. I mean i was the \"MARTIAL ARTS WIZARD WITH GIANT SWORD\" class so all I got was water/fire/air. Does the dwarf and high school dropout character get different offerings? IDK maybe? Anyway, I was offered the same ones over and over and over in my 90 minutes with this. This isn't like Hades where you have a lot of different gods giving you tons of different options where you could combine builds and play around. Here you better pray for a certain element (fire/inflict burn) and just run with that because everything else is trash. \n\nQuests give you nothing. No experience, no gems, nothing. Why should I do them? What is the point? \n\n\nAlso, for those who care about technical stuff; there is no way to change resolution. The game is capped at 60fps and looks atrocious on monitors or tvs with higher refresh rates. On a 77in OLED I had to screw around with the nvidia app to force \"smoothing\" on to get it to run at 120 and not make the backgrounds during movement look like stilted. I assume lossless scaling would fix this the same. No reason whatsoever for this to not run at 120fps at minimum. It uses 17% of my GPU. At 4k the lines on the drawn images still look choppy and broken. I can increase resolution scaling to 200% and it does nothing, and puts zero additional strain on my GPU, so I think that it is literally broken over 100%. Looking at something as old, (yet still updated) as Castle Crashers, you can see the difference in the lines at 4k to a remarkable degree.  Castle Crashers is significantly better looking than this and I don't really even like Castle Crashers all that much. \n\nI regret buying this even though I got it for almost 50% off. I'm actually rooting for all the magic to be gone from the land and machines to take over and burn all those trees or whatever because they gave me nonsense buffs that didn't help me and now they can live with the results. \n\nTHE WIZARD CAN'T CAST ANY SPELLS.",

When you want to defend yourself from attacks, you can't because you have to wait for the syrup-y attack animation to finish. Hitting any enemy is a nightmare due to the fact that every object in the game is a flat piece of paper, so in order to not miss your attack you need to perfectly line yourself up with the enemy's 2d model or all you'll be hitting is air.

Making them rougue like sounds like a no brainer due to the nature of replayability.\nThe issue is that this thing here is loaded to the brim with stupid far left ideology in a story written by most likely some misunderstood person, since the villain of the story is actually not the villain and in reality, you are kinda the antagonistic crowd. But this is the least of the problems. Every character has been created to fit the... \"today\" modern times of silliness by some pretentious libs trying to squeeze your hands and force you into a certain way of behaving and thinking. I can see other users struggling to say it in their reviews so I will say it directly - the game is woke. Annoyingly, taking-you-out-of-the-world kind of woke.\nI am sure the \"brave and noble\" white knights will jump to defend them with their evident bravado in their words, but the issue remains that such group of idiots cannot grasp the idea of inclusion and as an European myself I feel disappointed and disgusted at this stupidity and propaganda.\nThis is not the In varietate concordia we strive in Europe. This is yet another case of far leftism which is rancid and annoying as much as the right one is. You will never be free in such terms and you will never feel comfortable speaking your mind.\nIgnore this garbage and try Sengoku 3. Most likely made with way less budget, by more talented people with 0 Euroslop.\nAnd I will finish with:\nMaxime Mary, art director and co-creative lead:\n\"As Dotemu used to reinvent old IPs for contemporary players, we looked at old fantasy games like Golden Axe or Dungeons and Dragons: Shadow Over Mystara as a starting point and looked at how we could modernize them.\nSo the four playable characters had to have this “classic” vibe. We have the dwarf, the warrior, the magician, the rogue, but we wanted to have something that fits more with our modern culture. As a result, the warrior is a woman, non-sexualized. The magician is a frog deeply rooted in his family and community, the dwarf is the last of his kind, more subtle than a usual dwarf, and the rogue is a fantasy version of a ninja\"\nSo basically you look at Golden Axe and saw:\n- half naked man wearing a cloth - calm\n- warrior woman wearing cloth in a bikini style - REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\nsource: https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/absolum-interview-how-the-beat-em-ups-developers-created-four-fabulous-characters/\n\n(I can only wish this was Golden Axe or Dungeons and Dragons: Shadow Over Mystara, actually play them, and not this woke garbage)",

Linear, mandatory upgrades (3 more runs and you could get +10 health or +3% damage forever!). \n\nAs a roguelite there's a half baked upgrade system during runs that just locks away certain moves behind being lucky enough to find them, so the dwarf doesn't get his wrestling skills unless you happen to find it in a store and the bionic arm woman finds a triple air dash which completely changes how she plays and messes with any muscle memory you've built up for the character.\n\nThe story is non-existant. It might as well not be there.\n\nAs a beat em up, there's almost no emphasis on spacing, enemies can't really be stacked very well, there's a built in combo limiter (don't have too much fun!), and, worst of all, there are no wrestling moves. That's right, no suplexes, no power bombs, tombstones. Nothing.\n\nThis is also a parry game, with most bosses seemingly designed around you parrying their massive attacks if you want to do damage. But there's also a ton of random hit slow down and the parry timings themselves are seemingly arbitrary. There's a tool tip that says you should jump over slashes like it's Sekiro, but the one slash attack I tried it on did not work so I don't know if that's actually a mechanic or not.\n\nHades 2 came out this week so you'd be better off with that (or Hades 1 if you haven't played it). Dragon's Crown is a much better fantasy beat em up if you can find a copy and an emulator. If you can't, I think DnD Shadows Over Mystara is probably better than this game too and it supports 4 players.\n\nEDIT:\nOkay, i have now played some more and gotten to the true final boss, and I stand by everything in this review. Also the visual clutter of end game builds is horrendus. I still have no idea when an enemy can or cannot be grabbed. Every NPC you meet seems cooler than any of the characters you can play as. Clash and Deflect seem wildly inconsitent. Huge lack of clarity on what various boons do. The camera wants to be cinematic and it's awful. It's tough to recommend as a co-op game because of the difficulty. Non-beat em up enjoyers are gonna have a tough time.

      "review": "I enjoy this game a lot, but I'm leaving a negative review because there are simply too many small frustrations and issues I have with the game that make it difficult to recommend among its competitors.\n\nMinor spoilers ahead.\n\nI'll start with the positives. \n\nFor starters, the game is beyond gorgeous; one of the best 2D games I've seen in terms of raw visuals. The animation is fluid and snappy, the effects are beautiful, the environments are detailed and loaded with atmosphere.\nAs a roguelike, the game is very competent. Upgrades have synergies that evolve in emergent ways and allow you to build exceptionally strong combinations that are also very creative in how they work together. I'm fond of using tornadoes to fuel damage dealt by sending enemies flying from water rituals. Top notches on this department too.\nFinally, the sound design and general gamefeel is good. Landing hits feels solid and rewarding, blocking and parrying is fittingly satisfying, and attacks feel responsive (mostly, more on this later) and snappy.\n\nBut there are many, many, small problems.\n\nFirstly, the game runs...really poorly, for some reason. I have to lower the settings to near minimum to get it to run at a semi-stable framerate, and it still occasionally tanks frames in some scenes and fights. I'm not really sure why this is, since I've run much more graphically intensive games much more easily. The end-of-run loading screen is also SUPER long, which is frustrating when attempting repeat runs.\n\nThe game is also buggy. Weird boss phase transition issues, overlapping interaction prompts, and other issues constantly impede gameplay. \n\nThere are significant readability issues. Enemies with entirely different, new attacks will be recolors of other enemies that can sometimes appear in the same room, and enemies can initiate attacks with telegraphs obstructed by other enemies. Some projectiles can be very difficult to see and blend in with the background. Enemies have attacks that are unclear in terms of how large they are, both vertically and laterally, and often times can hit you even when you are *definitely not* touching them. The player is capable of creating large volumes of particle effects that obscure enemies and their actions.\n\nBut most importantly, the gameplay has a LOT of small issues. There are more than I can mention, but here's just a few:\n\n- You have a parry, but that parry is tied to an attack that can end early by hitting the wrong target, or have its timing changed awkwardly from time slowing or hitpause effects. On Cider specifically, this move feels really, really unresponsive for some reason.\n- Your button to throw projectiles is the same as your button to pick them up, which can cause you to be unable to throw them when you need to. It's also the same button used to buy from shops, pick up healing items, or read lore prompts.\n- Aforementioned lore prompts do not disappear during combat, and do not pause combat when you read them.\n- The final boss* can parry you. In his third phase, this guarantees him a followup attack that does a significant chunk of damage, as it will stun you for too long to be able to avoid it. This would be fine if the parry had a telegraph, which it doesn't, and/or if he couldn't parry sources of passive damage like turrets, fire pools, flame rings, companions and more that you don't even have control over most of the time. The final boss* can also hit you during cutscene transitions (not the arena changing one, I'm aware that's just spectacle and doesn't deal damage) with certain items he can receive.\n- You have a dodge, but it gains so little distance and is so vulnerable that it's practically useless as a dodge. Instead, it is far more functional as a blocking move, like a weaker parry, and it is simultaneously ridiculously easy to land and extremely annoying to use as it effectively stuns you every time you use it. Once you learn how much of the game is designed around using this mechanic, combat gets extremely boring and stale extremely quickly. Some attacks from enemies can break through it, but this doesn't occur enough to substantially discourage spamming it.\n- Balancing is pretty weird. There's a good chunk of items and rituals that are just...not good, or too situational to be practical. It's not a massive issue, but it contributes.\n- Healing is really awkward. Sometimes the game shovels healing items into you and health is never an issue, and other times the game is painfully stingy and you slowly bleed to death from minor mistakes. If you want health, you're pretty much entirely at the mercy of RNGesus.\n- The game has a throw mechanic where you can walk into enemies to grab them and throw them into other enemies. Because this happens automatically if you walk into an enemy, it will happen on accident. A lot. And while grabbing an enemy, most characters can't move. It is so awkward to use, so impractical in so many situations, and so easy to do on accident that I genuinely believe the game would be substantially improved by removing the mechanic from the game entirely. I do not understand its purpose.\n- The game has a double tap dash/sprint input that cannot be disabled. Hate that. Hate that a lot.\n\nThis is just a few of the things that come to mind, and so there is likely more issues I am either intentionally omitting for brevity (like this wall of text is anything but long-winded, lol) or that I do not remember off the top of my head.\nMany of these issues of course could be addressed with changes. I'm not without faith that the game will improve as bug fixes and other improvements occur, but for now this is where I stand. Update maybe later in the future.",

      "review": "tl;dr - Great visual style, impactful combat feel, interesting genre-mashup\r\nTERRIBLE MULTIPLAYER EXPERIENCE\r\n\r\nMy wife & I really wanted to like this game; on casual inspection, it had everything we could want.  We love Hades I&II, we love beat 'em ups (Streets of Rage franchise, Ninja Turtles, Fight 'N' Rage, classic Capcom stuff like D&D, Captain Commando, etc.), and we're not strangers to difficult, challenging, technical games.  Unfortunately...\r\n\r\nAbsolum's game experience suffers on every axis in multiplayer:\r\n\r\nStarting with bugs/unintended behaviour: dialogue is broken, combat tutorials that explain the game's mechanics are inaccessible multiplayer - (we had to look online to discover that the tutorials even existed), prizes for hidden rooms are not duplicated (only 1 players gets the health refill or money, sorry), money/resources are neither shared nor evenly split, nor are they easily controlled by the players.  That, couple with a lack of any tangible multiplayer element (except the obligatory \"hold to revive\"): no TMNT style high-five, no cool team-up attacks, no boost jumps or other player interactions of any kind, show that the developer didn't prioritize the multiplayer experience at all - a baffling decision in a genre famous for cooperative play.\r\n\r\nBut far more damning is the core gameplay issues, of which there are two HUGE problems:\r\n1) The game scales up difficulty by throwing more enemies at you, which greatly increases the visual noise.  This compounds with a second player also throwing out more explosions, giant energy waves, summons, and further visual noise - almost quadrupling the amount of clutter on screen and reducing visibility of enemies (often) all the way down to 0.  This is horrible for a highly technical beat 'em up that relies on players being able to carefully observe enemies for telegraphs and correctly dodging/deflecting/clashing attacks.  Many times, you'll get hit by an enemy that was totally invisible behind other enemies - with no hope of you being able to see, much less anticipate and react to, their attack.  That's bad enough to warrant a negative review, but even more damning...\r\n\r\n2) The developers made the incomprehensible decision to make players obstruct each others movement.  It's very possible to not only bump into each other with catastrophic results in a genre that strongly emphasizes careful positioning and control, but you can actually wedge yourselves in ways that prevent you from reaching paths, objectives, pick-ups, etc.  Even worse than that, in certain circumstances you can push the other player, like when my wife inadvertently (she couldn't see me on screen - read above re: visual noise) pushed me across the whole screen with a charge attack on a mount, pushing me directly into enemy attacks and causing my (essentially unavoidable death).\r\n\r\nAbsolum is a bafflingly terrible multiplayer experience and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants to play a beat 'em up with a friend/partner.  We're so, so disappointed.",

The initial plot makes it seem that we are the bad guys. Wizards blew up the world? Yeah, maybe they should be locked up.\r\nThe Under Kings plaques are absolute nonsense. The NPCs say random stuff about world events and expect the player to know what's in the writers head about the setting they have created.\r\nThe character just say random meaningless 'deep' things when performing actions. Rest to restore HP? \"Time is our greatest treasure\". Wow, I'm in awe.\r\n\r\nThe playable characters are the least cool character designs in the game. The NPC's you collect in the base are more appealing. I want to play as knight dude, orc trainer and big robe froggo mage.\r\n\r\nOther actionable issues.\r\nSome end of screen rewards require you to press RB to open them and see the options. For item rewards the options appear instantly. This is bad because if you just press RB to open on reflex you might pick an item by accident.

I love both genres, but this blend is awful. A lot of the trinkets and rituals might as well read 'Do nothing 95% of the time, 5% of the time suck'. That's it. Some abilities however are outright bonkers broken, and there is not much middle ground. It would be nice to focus on the characters movesets, but they are tediously basic out of the box, with more interesting moves locked behind roguelite per-run progression - and again you might not even see the good options during play. Some moves are actually traps to pick as they make existing moves behave in a less useful or predictable way, whereas others, when unlocked completely break a run.\r\n\r\nAbsolum would be an incredible beat 'em up if the roguelite elements were completely stripped out.

The only thing pointing to your character on screen is a tiny little \"1p/2p\" above your characters head that does serves almost no purpose due to its size. I found this problematic with solo play and even worse with multiplayer.\r\n\r\nTheres several enemies in this game too that just feel downright unfair, then, youll have to deal with those same enemies with super armor. This leads to being put in some almost unavoidable situations. For example the white demon with 4 claws. These guys like to spawn clouds that rain a huge laser down on top of you. These enemies are allowed to spam this attack should they get the opportunity. The only way to prevent this is by flinching them with an attack. Later on, these enemies will sometimes appear super armored and cannot be flinched. You see what im getting at here. Enemies like this can be the end of an otherwise perfect run. You'll feel robbed and like the time you just spent was wasted entirely. Just one example i can think of off the top of my head of poor design choices.\r\n\r\nShould this stuff be fixed, ill gladly reverse my review.

The attacks are satisfying and very \"punchy\", deflects and punishments work well, the skills feel quite good, the art, animations and music are just wonderful and the game simply feels good to play. I also enjoyed all 4 playable characters, they all play quite differently form each other and add a lot of variety. \r\nIt does have it's issues like how the dodge is utter trash or sometimes it's a bit hard to align your self with an enemy properly, but you get used to it eventually. \r\n\r\nThe issues lie almost entirely in the rogue-lite portion of the game.\r\nFirst of all it doesn't have a good loop and it's very short. Without spoilers it does a poor job at excusing your ability to basically beat the game forever, and for a story based game you'd expect significantly better. \r\nThe game has an issue many bad rogue-lites have which I call \"micro-upgrades\". Many upgrades the game offer you - both permanent and temporary - are minuscule, often 1-10% increases. To me this is inexcusable and a very clear attempt to either pad out upgrades, avoid balancing higher numbers, or both. In addition to this for what ever reason the devs decided that as you get more permanent upgrades the entire game should get harder, including the earliest parts of the run, instead of giving you a system to increase difficulty to your liking for each run. This means that any upgrade you get doesn't matter in the least because the game will always be harder to counteract what ever tiny amount of increased stats you've gained. The rituals them selves are quite poorly balanced and some are CLEARLY better then others with damage numbers so low you'll never even bother, and many of their effects tied to things like dodges which you'll never do because they're trash. \r\n\r\nTLDR it should have been a linear beat em' up, everything \"rogue-litey\" about this game is poorly done and takes away from an otherwise 8/10 experience.",

      "review": "I appreciate what Absolum is trying to do, as I've really not seen a game try to be a brawler, a roguelite, and still maintain a relatively story-driven feel to most of it. Unfortunately, it's not a flawless relationship, and there are pieces of each that really drag down on the others.\r\n\r\nThe brawler-bit is pretty good. I definitely don't enjoy the later stages very much and outright dislike the final boss(es) but I'm willing to take the L on that and say that's a player skill issue. However, I'm not willing to blame myself when the buffered input means I can dodge right, hold left, hit the dodge key, and my character dodges right again. In a game where the dodge system is designed so each direction is pivotal to avoiding or interrupting an enemy's attack (and yet they've somehow made it so dodging backwards is worthless, and also many clashes pushes you/the enemy so far back you can't take advantage of it) the controls not being extremely tight to inputs is tough to stomach. Enemy designs are fine, I dislike that many of them have the same skill effects that the player's rituals do because it becomes difficult to discern what is/isn't yours, and I had a fight against one the final boss where he got stuck in a loop of doing one move (where he jumps to the left, charges across the arena, and a shockwave of water comes out) no less than seven consecutive times. Oh yeah, also he just kills you at the start of the fight. Like, his intro cutscene he just kills you and any companions you have. Hope you have a spare revive!\r\n\r\nThe roguelite aspect is again, fine. It has all the staples - metaprogression, random ritual/item drops, etc etc. I'm not a huge roguelite connoisseur but I feel like many of the items/rituals are very playstyle-specific and it's pretty common to get something that you really won't ever make use of during that run. I do at least appreciate that nothing seems to have depreciating values - the shield will always give you -10% damage taken, even if it's the fourth one you've picked up.\r\n\r\nThe story is... say it with me, it's fine. The story's fine. Unfortunately, this is where I think the other two elements of the game really become frustrating, and the only reason I've not put the game down after like 6 hours is because I'm a little completion freak who feels obligated to 100% my entire steam library. There are so many little pauses and stops during the game that you can speed up, but not skip, nor is there a setting to just turbo skip through them. You enter the boss arena, the boss has to do a little animation, be like \"ah yes this is your 14th run let's fight again\" and your character has to be like \"CHILIDOGS\" and THEN you can fight. At the end of a run you have to wait for like 30 seconds for the map to slowly tally up your total and then think about it for however long before you return to the game - it's a roguelite my brother in christ just let me start another run. Another specific annoyance is that each character has a quest, which means you MUST play that character, the next step could activate and require something you don't have and can't get, and the final nail in the coffin is that you're STILL at the mercy of RNG. I was doing Karl's, went to the specific node I needed to go to, and it just didn't give me the right map to actually do what I needed to do. Well, I don't need anything else from this, so it's a dead run. Try again, go to the same node, oh look the game actually gave me the right screen, I now have to go to a door in literally the same map, cool. I go there, it's like 'Hey idiot you don't have the right thing.' Awesome, dead run. Do it all over again, the game doesn't spawn the thing I need to open the door by the time I get to it, great, dead run. And every time I do end the run, I have to sit for like 30 seconds while it thinks about my score. It fuckin' sucks, dude.\r\n\r\nI really try to be positive about indie games that are trying other stuff, because I know no one's going to knock it out of the park on their first attempt, and I want to celebrate people trying to innovate but this game very much overstayed its welcome after like 4 hours and now playing it any further just feels like hooks in the skin with weights I have to drag and hope to whatever higher power there is that RNG will give me the thing I need so I can play the game and not just coin flip me into another DEAD RUN.",

Completely unsatisfying, RNG, non-impactful generic boons that BARELY affect gameplay, coupled with completely random Daedalus hammers that range from usable to unacceptably awful. Further, there is such an insane amount of (unsatisfying) boons that affect your dodge/block/clash/sprint. All four of those abilities are on the same button btw. If you are confused, that is because it IS confusing. I'd be willing to bet that the metrics on how often people choose boons that affect deflect/dodge/sprint when attack/special boons are ALSO choices, look absolutely hilarious. It literally never feels good to pick any of these soggyass defense boons because they are innately uninteresting and will always feel less efficient than directly buffing any of your MAIN damage sources. If there was more agency and you could get a true dash build, like a hades 2 jetpack build, then sure, I could see it. It would still be niche, but at least it would be controllable and deliberate. As it stands, the system is so random that you CAN end up with a completely homeless Frankenstein build that excels at absolutely nothing, provides 0 impact on your playstyle and does 0 damage. As soon as you're done upgrading the completely one-dimensional \"skill tree\", you can use that currency to re-roll your in-game choices. Before that though, it feels awful to use said currency only to re-roll your dodge boons into some clash boons, or impact boons or any of these other stupid names for random combat interactions that exist in this game. Just for reference, clash is when your attack actively collides with an active enemy attack. That's an entire class of upgrades. A buff that ONLY happens when you and the enemy attach each other at the SAME time. Remove from pool. \n\nAnyways, I would actually forgive the whole boon system fiasco if the combat was at least fluid and snappy (see: Entropy Effect, Hades, Dead Cells etc), but it's not. It's visually and sonically satisfying, so I think that's why I was able to finish the game, but regardless it's clunky and non-responsive with inherently conflicting design choices. Why do you want me to mash buttons but then also want me to completely stop pressing buttons, so I am not locked into an animation when I need to dodge? Why is there NO animation canceling whatsoever? Why are the incoming attack indicators completely inconsistent? Why is there only 1 button for dash, sprint, block, deflect w/e the fuck else this game wants to call parry. Why is the Z-axis so inconsistent? Why can enemies hit me from ANYWHERE on the Z-axis but I can't hit them unless I am literally IN their ass? Why is throwing an item and picking it up the same button? Why are there so few base combos or abilities? Why are there no starting loadouts to establish at least some form of usable foundation? It feels like they made a 2-hour long game and then minced the characters and the content up into little bits and pieces and sprinkled it out to instead last ~10 hours or so. Which is still robbery at 25$ IMO. Bosses are also abominations. Tons of non-reactable, non-readable, non-telegraphed baloney attacks that you gotta just hold the L on. Enemies have this too, but most normal enemies are weak enough that it doesn't really matter, though for some elites it's still pretty annoying. \n\nLast boss is especially hog so he gets his own section. To preface, the runs in this game are long, I'd say anywhere between 40-60 minutes on average. The last biome is usually the shortest and can be done very quickly, like 5 or so minutes if you really wanted to. There is also a fake last boss that you have to fight in order to get to the true last boss, which is annoying enough. The TRUE TRUE last boss though, will ALWAYS kill you once, no matter what, when you arrive at the fight, before the fight even begins. Death by cutscene. 0 counterplay. The only option is to reach the last boss with at least 1 death defiance. If you have no death defiances, and you've reached the last biome after a nice girthy 48 minute run, you simply can not do anything other than fail. If beating the game was your goal, you are better off quitting the run as soon as you realize you will not have a death defiance for the last boss. This is unacceptable. Baffling how no one on the dev team thought it was a bad idea to waste possibly an HOUR of the players time? Beyond that, the fight is ALSO garbaggio. 3 long phases of waiting for full screen whirlwinds or full screen laser matrices before you can actually do damage. Lots and lots and lots of waiting.\n\nLastly, the story progression is obnoxious. You have to play as different characters and then talk to the characters in camp that you are not currently playing as and THEN play those characters and do specific quests during the run. If you don't do this, you will not progress most of the game's stories and you will not see some of the (few) different biomes. \n\nI think if this game was pixel art or some other over saturated/generic artstyle, it would NOT be getting glazed like this. Mid at BEST, ass at worst.",

Do not recommend this on casual gamers who enjoyed other beat em up games. \r\n\r\nIt takes a lot of inspiration from fighting games only to an extent that certain tech and mechanics just feels unbalanced, unrefined or just plain flimsy for certain characters especially when combined with its roguelike nature.\r\n\r\nFall damage in certain maps is more of a nuisance than something that has a real add on to the game given how each character's mobility varies and is further RNGd by what you get through each stage. The last city specifically also surprises you with high coin purchases that you have no way to earn enough for or clutch in that scenario.\r\n\r\nI don't feel as rewarded or powerful even in my best runs compared to other roguelike games. As an avid player of the genre, the power spike in roguelike should feel much more rewarding than usual beatem up games where you have absolute control your build. Otherwise, the intoxication of getting your ideal build is dulled enough to just close it and wait for a balance update.",

      "review": "When I first heard of this game it's because of Mick Gordon's one contribution to the soundtrack. After (((trying))) for 20 hours before actually buying the game, I safely say that it's a pretty good beat 'em up, one of the best recent entry actually, that's ABSOLUTELY MARRED by the rougelite element. \r\nThe crux of this game is to beat the enemies (duh) using the various mechanics present: the type of Ritual, the synergy between said Rituals, counter, Clash (hitting enemies flashes with red with your Y skill), dodge to Punish, Tech (when enemies are hit to the corner of the screen), thrown projectiles, and the variety of items. \r\nThe game encourage you to continue your combo by dodging, clashing and air juggling, which I do love. What I don't love is the random elements introduced: you are beholden by the RNG to give you the Rituals and items you want for a run. The only thing you can control is your chosen character and one Ultimate skill at the start. If you get a slew of trash Ritual you lose. If you're thrown to the arena with annoying buffed enemies that can counter your jumping attack, you'll lose your health and then lose your run. Basically, the draw of being a roguelite and the desire of having a 'perfect run' ruins the experience for me, since that'll never happens. A varied set pieces would help, but the game is actually quite sparce in content at the moment with only 2 available path after defeating the Underking, and you'll get to the final boss area with recycled enemies. \r\nSo yea: The game is polished-ish (the bugs I encounter are mostly graphical), the gameplay system is shaped to give a lot of satisfaction that's hampered greatly by rougelite. I don't care about the story either, it's very generic and yet being force fed to you a lot at the start. Luckily they are able to be fast forwarded, but I prefer having none to preserve the flow of play. Mick Gordon is truly a master of his craft and too bad he only made one track for this game.",

      "review": "While this game has interesting gameplay, the entire context and story are focused on a political agenda.\n\nAll the characters in the game have a woke and LGBT agenda behind them, which you discover through the game's dialogues.\n\nMain Playable Characters:\n\nGalandra is a female character with an androgynous design (trans woman). Story: A courtesan (prostitute) who becomes a warrior (Mary Sue/Feminist), and she is ugly, which is part of the agenda that women cannot be beautiful so as not to offend the trans community.\n\nCider is a female character who lost an arm and a leg (disabled person), uses prosthetics, has mental health issues, and does not consider herself male or female (non-binary). She wears a mask and has horrible hair, which is part of the agenda that women cannot be beautiful so as not to offend the trans community.\n\nBrome is a mage who is male, but in the game it is revealed that he was initially female and changed sex (gender fluid) to have his own offspring. Message that sex change is possible and that men can get pregnant or that women can inseminate.\n\nCarl or \"Karl\" (own theory) is a dwarf who, in many dialogues, tries to be the wise mentor. I think his name is a reference to Karl Marx, creator of leftist and communist lines of thought.\n\nSecondary Characters\n\nThe Goddess or Spiritual Guide is a pregnant Black woman because it's fashionable in woke pop culture to have a pregnant Black woman in charge of other people.\n\nA lesbian pirate captain, with a masculinized design and overly muscular shoulders, is part of the agenda that women can't be beautiful...\n\nA big fat lizard-man boss with pierced nipples; the design is inspired by furry/gay hentai.\n\nGoblins are beings in tune with nature, born from sacred trees, and they want to live in peace, the opposite of how goblins were portrayed before the woke culture (as a Goblin Slayer fan, this annoyed me a lot).\n\nThere are other subliminal messages throughout the game that, if I described them all, would take all day.\n\nI missed some side quests, so I didn't complete 100% of the game's content and therefore didn't get all of the woke agenda in the game.

      "review": "Absolum has so many interesting and unique ideas but the shortcomings in gameplay make it hard to recommend. I just finished beating the last boss and am posting this review.\n\nIt's got a stunning art style and good animation work. Incredible music. Fairly likeable and interesting characters. But the gameplay has some glaring issues that make it feel tedious and frustrating. The animations feel clunky and inconsistent, the dash is basically useless, and the parry/deflect/dodge mechanics are very difficult to implement into a smooth playstyle. The game is very clunky feeling, animations take a long time to come out, which means that its hard to flow into parrying and dodging while still trying to stay on the offense. \n\nThe movement speed is too slow. It's close to impossible to get in on some bosses and get out again without being hit. The clunky animations make it so that you basically have to wait and stand still in order to parry something, which kind of kills the flow of the combat. The game also has issues with keeping track of whats going on, the screen becomes overloaded with characters and effects, most character models look similar and it can be hard to keep track of everything. \n\nThe game feels slightly difficult as well, at least artificially. it's extremely stingy with health drops, some runs it gives you a decent amount, other runs hardly anything. The roguelite aspects are shallow and the builds don't seem to come together very well. It felt like I was just mashing my way to victory rather than having to think and plan my strategies for most fights. I only managed to beat it because I got a ridiculously strong build in the end. But really I was just mashing and spamming arcana and the enemy couldn't do anything. \n\nIt's not a bad game by any means but it's definitely got some huge flaws and I feel it may be a little overrated right now. I got 10 hours out of it and and am unlikely to ever play it again. The music is by far the best thing about the game, some truly brilliant soundtracks in there. \n\n6.5/10.",

      "review": "Could and should be among the best beat-em-ups of all time but has some asinine mechanics that shove it into the middle of the pack or lower. Block and dash are the same button, which is one of the craziest things I've ever seen. Instead of dodging at the last minute, you'll block if you time it correctly. Which is great, unless you are trying to get away from a pack of enemies, in which case they'll just pummel you after your initial block. You can't animation cancel mid attack into a block, so better hope no one attacks during that time because you're going to get hit; which is probably the biggest drawback for me and the reason it gets a solid, solid \"not recommend\". Also, your special attack does not provide invulnerability, nor does it even have any iframes. ??? \n\nBtw I played the \"wizard\" drow looking class. You know how wizards are known throughout every story ever told as being magic users and casting spells? Well not here. You cast ZERO spells as a wizard. Read it again baby. No spells to cast as a wizard. So of course instead you get the typical wizard skills of punching, kicking and using a giant sword. You know, standard magic user faire. Why spend your life pouring over books and tomes to learn ancient magic when you can just call yourself a wizard and not do any wizardy stuff? What in the blue hell is going on here?! A WIZARD WITH NO SPELLS BUT INSTEAD IS SKILLED IN MARTIAL ARTS. I hope these guys never make a football game because I assume everyone will get on the field in ice skates with baseball bats. \n\nAnyway, this is roguelite so you're supposed to be unlocking things as you fail and get progressively stronger. After 6 runs I feel absolutely no positive difference despite unlocking like 10 buffs. Oh, I can now choose between 5 or 6 different \"special attacks\", but who cares? They all do basically the same thing and no invulnerability. Enemies always do a lot of damage to me, actually even MORE damage to me during my subsequent runs, after upgrading my def and hp. Not sure how that's possible. Meanwhile if I hire a bodyguard, every one of them is an unkillable wall, and they take almost zero damage, even when getting full on smashed in the face. I guess the hirelings don't have to play by roguelite difficulty rules like the rest of us. \n\nYou can't backtrack, not even a little bit during the stages. It has that old, NES/SNES/Genesis thing where if you move forward too far you can't go backwards because the game doesn't want you to. Miss a pickup on the ground? Too bad you can't go back and get it even if it's just a couple inches back from where the game decides the next battle is going to be. \n\nYour boons/buffs are maybe ok but there seem to be so few. Are they tied to class? I don't know. I mean i was the \"MARTIAL ARTS WIZARD WITH GIANT SWORD\" class so all I got was water/fire/air. Does the dwarf and high school dropout character get different offerings? IDK maybe? Anyway, I was offered the same ones over and over and over in my 90 minutes with this. This isn't like Hades where you have a lot of different gods giving you tons of different options where you could combine builds and play around. Here you better pray for a certain element (fire/inflict burn) and just run with that because everything else is trash. \n\nQuests give you nothing. No experience, no gems, nothing. Why should I do them? What is the point? \n\n\nAlso, for those who care about technical stuff; there is no way to change resolution. The game is capped at 60fps and looks atrocious on monitors or tvs with higher refresh rates. On a 77in OLED I had to screw around with the nvidia app to force \"smoothing\" on to get it to run at 120 and not make the backgrounds during movement look like stilted. I assume lossless scaling would fix this the same. No reason whatsoever for this to not run at 120fps at minimum. It uses 17% of my GPU. At 4k the lines on the drawn images still look choppy and broken. I can increase resolution scaling to 200% and it does nothing, and puts zero additional strain on my GPU, so I think that it is literally broken over 100%. Looking at something as old, (yet still updated) as Castle Crashers, you can see the difference in the lines at 4k to a remarkable degree.  Castle Crashers is significantly better looking than this and I don't really even like Castle Crashers all that much. \n\nI regret buying this even though I got it for almost 50% off. I'm actually rooting for all the magic to be gone from the land and machines to take over and burn all those trees or whatever because they gave me nonsense buffs that didn't help me and now they can live with the results. \n\nTHE WIZARD CAN'T CAST ANY SPELLS.",

When you want to defend yourself from attacks, you can't because you have to wait for the syrup-y attack animation to finish.
