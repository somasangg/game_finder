It's already become a tradition, but this year I wanted to write a review.\nI can't remember how many years ago I started playing this game, a long time ago, back when the game had a 2D version. But back then, I was scared to play solo :D\nI'm crazy about the zombie apocalypse genre, and I'm always trying out new projects, both story-driven and sandbox, but Zomboid will always be at the top of my list because it gives me that same feeling of loneliness and hopelessness, but at the same time, the desire to fight and explore.\nIt's never boring to come back to it, because every time I played, I experienced new events and a new story, I still remember many of my characters :3\nAnd now there will also be updated crafting, cooler construction, and livestock farming. I really like it🐥💕\nPlaying with friends is also a really fun experience. I still remember how we had an event with helicopters. In the process, we accidentally burned down our house, and I tried to save my friend and killed her in a car accident. It was both funny and sad, I still remember the fine times we had.\nThe game is great, you should definitely try it despite the graphics.\nBeautiful graphics are found in many modern games, but freedom, cool gameplay mechanics, and such an atmosphere are rare.",

The devs did make some pretty questionable changes in Build 42 and the game definitely feels harder for no real reason, but I’m hoping they’ll balance things out before the final release.\n\nWhen I first started, I kept dying in like the first couple of days. The learning curve is steep and the leveling system can be grindy, but you can adjust the settings to make things more manageable.\n\nAlso, the modding community is fucking amazing.

The customisation settings for your world is such a cool thing too because i suck so bad at all the swarms and what not so I honestly made it as close as the walking dead as possible with low zombie count and making them slow as hell. This game gives you that freedom of being able to make it a cool breeze or an absolute blazing fking nightmare.\n\n10/10 game. although I was sceptical I can safely say money well spent.

The problem is, after all those hours, you'll be left thinking \"why did I do all this?\"\nTheres literally no endgame. You will spend hours raising your skills, building your base, getting supplies, etc, all for there to be no threats at all once you cleared your area.\nThe only real answer to that as of now is multiplayer, but thats on the main version, Build 41, which is 4 years old. Development is extremely slow, to the point that, when things actually come, any excitement has died out. Devs keep hiring modders but nothing gets done. Players tell the dev team what they want and they do something else while adding more new systems and frameworks, instead of fixing and expanding on current ones first. No big lategame objectives. No wandering hordes. No human enemies (or friends). No real rewards or incentives for growing skills past a certain point.\n\nWhich is a shame because this could easily become THE definitive survival game. When you start it, it really sucks you into the world. Its the most immersive game I've played, which says alot considering the graphics and perspective. It allows you to do so many things you wouldnt even have thought of.\nFrom finding the keys to a vehicle or learning to hotwire it, to learning how to make doors and windows, to finding random furniture for your house, collecting a bunch of unique items, play dressup, make a garden, and much more. \n\nBut it's ultimately not about what the game offers, it's about what it doesn't. If you're wondering what that is, just check the Workshop or any discussion forum for this game, because the list goes on and on.\n\nSo while, yes, i do recommend this game, i do so with a pinch of salt, because it could be so much better than it is, and it shows no signs of improving. I do hope the devs prove me wrong and pull like 3 updates next year, but by the way things are going, TES6 is releasing before the next build.",

Speaking for Build 41 (I hear B42 is a bit worse in this aspect, for now), the menus are not intuitive at a first glance, but become second nature very fast, especially if you're a regular PC user. The soundtrack is excellent; the songs still sound new and varied to me, and perfectly fit whatever I'm doing in game. The combat is simple, but tense, due to how easy it is to let your guard down. The fact you can't see what's behind you is a great choice, as is not knowing what is behind the next door or corner. Hearing a gurgle and not knowing if it came from upstairs, the window outside or the door on your right never gets old. As for why this could be the best zombie game ever, it's simple: If you don't like the default settings, want to make it easier or harder, or want your perfect apocalypse, it's all there. And if you want something more, there's a crazy workshop available. For the price, it's a no-brainer. Best part is Build 41 already feels like a fully developed game, and yet there's more to come.",

One minute I’m living my best post-apocalyptic chef life, the next? I’m a crispy shadow on the wall, 10/10 would die to dinner again.\n\nI’ve spent 150+ hours in this game and still haven’t survived winter. I’ve been bitten, starved, depressed, chased by one zombie that somehow turned into 50, and once got stuck in a bathroom with a raccoon I thought was dead. Spoiler: it wasn’t. The game doesn’t just kill you—it embarrasses you on the way out.\n\nBut that’s why I love it. Project Zomboid isn’t about winning. It’s about the stories you tell while failing spectacularly. Want to farm corn in Kentucky while wearing a traffic cone as a hat? Go ahead. There is a mod for that, Try to hotwire a cop car only to immediately crash into a gas station and summon every zombie in six counties? Been there. The modding community keeps it fresh, the updates keep improving it, and the sheer nerdiness of its survival systems is beautiful.\n\nIt’s janky? Sure. The UI looks like it was designed in 2003? Absolutely. But that’s part of the charm. This game doesn’t hold your hand—it kicks you into the apocalypse and says, “Good luck, dumbass.”\n\nHighly recommend.

Hope you don't get lost into the depths of Illiterate while playing with your buddies though...\r\n\r\nIn terms of content, you've got a pretty large map I'd say, and all sorts of weapons. From a pen to a katana, from a toy gun to a real rifle. \r\n\r\nThe modding support is great too. Cant wait for build 42 stable relase.",

And that comes from a 2k hour DayZ veteran. \n\nCombat is so clunky that i struggle to stay motivated after 10 kills. Especially annoying when a single bite is all it takes to end your run.

      "review": "I love this game. However there are some serious issues with its development. The first and biggest is the way and the time-frame in which they handle updates. Zomboid only does major updates so no minor ones at all(other bug fixes or when its in unstable), and each time its a minimum of 3 years before it comes out. This on its own would be bad but then each time they add a major update the game goes into unstable branch for another 3 years. During this time the new update is available with no multiplayer and mp is disabled on every new update... for at least 3 years... Yes you can still play multiplayer on the old version but of course you wont have any new features to try out. This is such a bad way of handling things. The slow update schedule would feel far better if there was at least MP but instead you sit waiting years for it to come out. It splits the community, it leaves modders split between making mods for the new build (which you can only enjoy solo for 3 years) and making/maintaining mods for the old version because all MP servers are still using the old build and thus the old mods, but this also means less people are making mods for the old version so the old version doesn't really even get new mods either so you are stuck with no new content even in the form of new mods for years. \n\nHandling updates this way is nonsensical and if you dare to try mention or discuss the lengthy wait between updates on the community page you get bombarded by a horde of white knights and power tripped community moderators who hand out community bans/warnings for using the word \"clown\" to describe someone but only if you are being critical of the game, if you are white knighting it you can say it all you want and white knights who will defend anything even the removing of multiplayer for the release of a major update. Imagine if every time call of duty added a new season or did a major update they disabled multiplayer for 3 years... the game would be dead. The devs have complained at the community before for speaking up about some of these issues saying in as many words \"it makes it hard for them to work on the game when people are speaking negatively about it\". Essentially saying stop complaining or we will stop developing the game. Its a shame because the game itself is incredible, there really is nothing like it. And again the incredibly long update release schedule would probably feel less bad if multiplayer was available straight away but instead you will wait as long for that as you did for the update in the first place. At 6 years per update wait 30 years until the game is fully realised and then you'll be fine or if you don't care about new content and updates being added outside of mods which even they will become fewer and fewer as a new update goes into unstable branch then go for it. In my opinion if they cant manage to release a major update without breaking multiplayer then just do smaller more regular updates where multiplayer can continue to work because making it work with 1 new feature will be a lot quicker than doing it for the 100 new things in a major update. \n\nI didn't want to put this in a negative review but indie stone need to sort out their community moderators who are tripping out of their minds on the minuscule amount of power they have been given and are censoring criticism and discontent people are having over the issues i laid out among others. I would not have left this review if not for the censorship of zomboids community page and the side taking of its moderators who hand out community warnings to you if you are critical but if you are defending it you can say the same thing and be fine.",

If you have someone very patient to play splitscreen with and a LOT of time on your hands, I might recommend it. But at the same time, there are so many other games to play that are less of a PITA than this one. If you have friends to play on a server with, I'm sure that would be fun but if you're an adult then good luck gathering a group of friends who all have the time and patience for this lmao\n\nThe vast majority of my \"playtime\" has been spent configuring the many mods that are (in our opinion) must-add to fix the many issues this game has. Some of that was my own fault by going overboard at first (and that's easy to do with any game lol) but a lot of it has been random headaches that just appear from nowhere from one launch to the next, or fighting with the game itself. It took forever just to tune the sandbox settings to something that was possible for us to survive more than a couple days in while still being entertaining.\n\nThe modding community seems big into AI, there's a lot of vibe-coded junk that breaks the game in unexpected ways (not to say that there aren't a lot of amazing modders too, of course!). This is not helped by the developer's numerous questionable design decisions, the amount of scope creep and completely unnecessary features is ridiculous. They'll add half-baked implementations of important things and leave them sitting untouched for ages while they work on... hair & facial hair growth (in a low-res isometric game where you can barely ever see the character's face). Just an example, I'm not sure how much work they put into that specifically, my point is that there are elements of the game all over the place that to me reek of spaghetti code and Star Citizen's bed-sheet physics.\n\nThere was a post recently about them hiring some people, I hope it means they'll finally focus on making the game releasable within the next five years instead of just faffing about forever.",

Played it for an hour, hated it, thought it was in Early Access so they would improve it.\n\nYears down the road, 2025, trying it again and.. this still feels like work.\n\nThe primary issue that existed back in 2017 is still there. The UI/UX is total and utter garbage, the combat is fucking awful and everything this game does can be done better in FPS view zombie survival game, except with more immersion.\n\nThe combat especially is so bad that it's a major turn-off. If the combat was fun like Diablo 2, Titan Quest, Grim Dawn, then I would actually enjoy the game, but the way it's done here is so awful. They have never fixed the controls. The fanbase loves what it is so I doubt it they'll change it ever, but that doesn't really mean I have to like it. \n\nI might TRY to play this game a few more times to see if I can get less annoyed by the combat and and UI/UX. Depending on how it goes, I might change the review in the future to positive (if I don't, you know how it went).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[h3]EDIT: I tried to play it again, this time in builder difficulty, but I just can't.[/h3]\n\nThe world is way too uninteresting and all you do is.. eat, drink, wash, sleep and kill. I'm sure that's very exciting gameplay loop for the fans but, considering how boring the world itself is, I just can't be arsed to do this. Then again, I find such pointless survival \"slider-watchers\" boring in any other game as well these days, so chances of this game impressing me with this stale survival style are none.\n\nMeh. Not for me. I guess I was in a different mindset when I bought it back in 2017. There are no good zombie games (still aren't) so that could've been the reason for me going for this and supporting the development. Oh well..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[h3]EDIT 2: Tried again.[/h3]\n\nSneak around > kill a zombie or two >  get inside and loot > cook > eat > drink > wash > sleep > read something (and by that, I mean watch sliders move). That's the whole game in 3.9 hrs. I know there is base building and all that jazz as well, but I don't really care that much about grown virtual plants and trees unless it's a game like Stardew Valley (mostly cause this game already feels like a chore without that element).\n\nI'm thinking, I'll try custom sandbox difficulty next and lower the zombie to the lowest possible, without removing them. Because ironically, Zombies are the biggest drawback of the game called \"Project Zomboid\", all thanks to the dog-shit combat (again, devs had Diablo and Grim Dawn to copy combat from, yet they went with.. this).\n\nIf there are only a few Zombies, I can explore more and not get bored trying to just eat and drink while sitting in same spot, watching sliders move for hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n[h3]EDIT 3: I uninstalled Zomboid.[/h3]\n\nI know I kinda said I would try sandbox, but I just installed Void Bas_tards (which I bought ages ago) and started playing it. 3 hrs in, I realized that game was ten times more fun than even 30 mins inside Zomboid, so I uninstalled Zomboid and binned it into a category where I just dump games I'll never touch. Goodbye.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[i]\n[b]PS:[/b] I might try to play it a bit more to see if I'm missing something. Give it another try.\n\n[b]PPS:[/b] I played again, EDIT 2 is the update. I'll now try sandbox difficulty.\n\n[b]PPPS:[/b] I uninstalled Zomboid.\n[/i]",

This is just blatant disrespect of the player's time disguised as ''difficulty''. Yes there is a sandbox mode but it doesn't have a slider for weapon durability which is really bad design. Also the traits system is really bad, if you pick a profession you need to pick like 5 negative traits to offset the negative points it gives you. All that for an almost useless bonus. Picked carpenter? Still can't build stairs. Picked mechanic? Still can't change engine parts. Prepare for the most tedious grind of your life to level up skills (1.5 exp per action, 90 000 exp required to level up) that you can all lose in a single moment when a zombie lands an instantaneous lucky bite on you because of one of the game's numerous frame freezes or combat bugs, leading to your death and loss of all your skill points. Completely ridiculous. According to this game i'm a real life super hero because I have to give myself 60 free trait points in sandbox settings to make a character that is true to my real life build. I'm just that much of a hardcore badass I guess. OR maybe the devs are a bunch of pencil neck dweebs that have never worked a manual labor job a single day in their lives and have no clue of how the real world works since they think dragging 2-3 corpses or cutting down 2-3 trees will exhaust and cripple you to a complete stop for 3 hours. \n\nOh and the community is absolutely rancid and has a weirdly disproportionate quantity of basement dwelling tr00ns and furries forming a cult around it. They will harass you and permanently kick you out of the discord if you politely criticize the game in any shape or form and all of that on the first offense. This is pretty much a multiplayer death sentence since there are no ways in game to find other players to play with, no server list, no searching for games etc. From what I have heard and seen the developpers seem just as cringe and unprofessional when engaging with criticism. One of the devs would get on Twitter drunk and tell people to kts. (instead of actually working on the game lol)  \n\nTL;DR: Unacceptable development speed (early Access for 12+ years, slow mediocre updates), bad UI, bad combat, bad skill system, buggy, misguided sense of realism, tedious gameplay loop (inventory management simulator) cringe community and cringe devs. \n\nWait for a HUGE discount if you must buy.",

It’s missing so much stuff in fact, that most players Recommend Mods.\n\nProject Zomboid is a lot like those MMO games, the majority of people understand the game is trash, but the fans stayed and played. Hear me out, you have to spend actual hours of your real life working out and doing other things in game. Someone may reply and say “no you don’t, you can just speed up time” or whatever excuse you have, you’re wrong. ChatGPT estimates you will spend 400-600 hours in real life trying to max out your character.  This means that if time is sped up, you’ll still spend about 200 hours irl. This obviously won’t happen for most players, as who wants to play survival for 150-600 hours? Atleast in Minecraft you can build or do other fun things. \n\nThe main goal for each time you create a new character is almost always the same: look around the house you spawn in, leave the house and loot more, make one of the houses you’ve looted the house you’ll stay in, find sheets to cover windows, ect. Now someone will reply whining about how you don’t have to play this game in any particular way. Sure, if you don’t want to efficiently survive, then yes don’t do any of that. The point is, the game is super boring. Even killing zombies feels like ass. You can’t cancel animations, so I’ve gotten cut on broken windows multiple times due to the janky controls. They try to tell you project zomboid is verified on the steam deck, but it’s at the bare minimum of being playable, I mean the game won’t even let me use the trackpad as a mouse without the right click/context menu constantly opening and bugging out. When using the trackpad as a mouse, 2/3 of the time the object you pick up and put into another storage area will just refuse to go in, untill you get lucky. \n\nNow on the controls,  Zomboid fans will defend the janky controls, trying to act like it’s needed or something, i don’t know. Video games should be fun to play, you’d think the first ever video games such as super Mario bros would feel worse to play, but nope, I’d rather play SNES games just because it’s more enjoyable to play. Project Zomboid is basically a keyboard and mouse only game, people will argue and say no it’s not, but it sure as shit is. You’ll die from a tiny mistake on keyboard/mouse which you can’t cancel/control because the game is kinda bad, on controller it’s must worse. Just to zoom out/in you have to hold down a button, and click another button, and then repeat that process until you are zoomed in at your desired position. \n\nDon’t buy this game until TIS sells this game to another company or actually starts working on it.

There are also some other lesser irritations such as the display settings not setting resolution correctly, not honoring v-sync settings, font scale up not working properly, and a couple crashes. Reading other reviews, there may well be a fantastic game beyond all of these issues, but after a few hours of trying to get it up & running, we moved on to the next game on our list.
