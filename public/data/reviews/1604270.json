And still have lot to do so.\nBut we cant expect things to improve in just a month. And crying over and over wont do anything. Share you feedbacks to them instead of giving bad review with just \"game bad\"\n\nScince the release i can affirm this changes: \n\nPositive:\nLess leaver\nLess cheaters ( i've seen only one really in 100 games, it would depends on which server you are, for me its EUW).\nMore balance in Nation BY A LOT\nEnemy AI improved in PVE\nBug fixes of course\n\nNegative: i have quite a good computer but my friend has some:\nGame instability regarding anti-cheat system.\nAnd some leavers penatly system can be improved. Like i see players with 50% abandonning the game. WTF or even worse, team killing, this happened to me once.\nAnd right now i think, penatly because game instability... ouch, this wont do a good reputation for sure.\n\nMeanwhile with a friend we have a really good blast of joy for these reason:\nExperiencing gameplay in deck building. We just have 100 hours experimenting deck building and try new ways to crush enemies.\nWe have some differents gameplay: he is more like pushing into enemies while i wait them. So our teamplay is really good.\nLot of various units, so it's not this new player friendly. \nWith my friend we tested a lot against AI, pushing from times to times our limits before starting to PVP.  Meanwhile we are quite experienced. And trying to convince more people around us.\nThe campaign is quite long. But a good way to start gaining the interest about Nation's specializations. With flaws... Like US Airforce to start ?? using mainly airborne units are complicated... @Devs this is not newplayer friendly ^^'\n\nThe game has quite unique mechanics.\nFlanking, dropping a nuke right from the start, dropping your entire army from the skies, using only artillery or armored vehicles, pinpoint strike, or even just supporting your teamates (avoid a flank, or anti-air system) can give you good rewards at the end.\nEven if you dont like to face against players you can still do things in the shadows instead of fighting face to face.\nI'm not a fan of pvp. But i can find ways around to win, it's much more than just arm wrestling duel, use you own gimmicks\n\nStill has a lot to do,\nstatic units like sand bags or trenches to come. A patch note speak about this.\nFaction like germans (Deutsch) to come maybe ? Leopard are in the game...\nMatchmaking improvement, will be allways (even 15 years old MOBA games still improve)",

As someone who used to play Warno, this is just better in every way, fights aren't decided by rng, teamwork is a must, and as long as you aren't playing at the highest Elo's, the win rate of nations isn't as much of an issue as your skill issue.",

      "review": "Ill be real idk why people are hitting this game so badly with negative reviews and for the odds of things which I can and cant agree with.\n\nA lot of the reviews hit the game for negative reviews about this games campaign, AI, cheating and no punishment for players that leave games right away so I'm going to hit all the points for me at least but this will be from my point of view so idk anyone else situation with this game other then close friends who play along side me.\n\nNow this is form 117hrs of game play and 60 games that I have played through just a note before hand. Along with the open beta before the launch.\n\nGRAPHICS\nThe graphics in the games are incredible and everything is incredibly detailed maybe not perfect cause there are a few models that have graphical errors that I've seen mostly in the Russian tank options but its only like 3 of them with 1 of them being very noticeable but the other 2 very miner ones I be leave. Now that wasn't the case during the second beta and the launch of the full release where I at least kept getting a bug were I couldn't see the map at all at most angles and my units would lose the symbols above them so It became unplayable but they fixed that after about 2 weeks which sucked but I haven't had that issue since and have had no issues since.\n\nGAME PLAY\nGame plays fine really don't have much to complain about for this other then on very VERY rare occasion (3 times) once for my friend, once played against and once a random player where 1 vehicle at random just doesn't exist for anyone but the player using it. Now my friend and the random teammate would both send the unit back and the problem was solved when they recalled them out but the one person I played against abused it heavily as they had a tank that would just drive up and kill everything in are back lines only getting rid of it after bombing the whole area. It may have happened more without knowing if they hid in the trees cause you just cant tell in that case. also only ever ran into 2 cheaters in my 60 games and both where band last I checked so over all game experience has been very good otherwise.\n\nBALANCE\nIdk what to say really as while I would say stuff is a lot stronger then other things in their only slots but its only as good as the player so most of the time I personally have no complains about balance I just work around it.\n\nPLAYER PUNISHMENT\nNow this I even complained about as it took way to long to have something done about it personally but I kept up with why they held of and understood why but it still really sucked but I think what they have done works now or at least helps a lot with getting people to stop leaving just doesn't help with people wanting to quite and put in a forfeit request in the first 5-10 minutes into the game even if your not losing the game just lost a small fight that broke your personal moral but cant control other players.\n\nCAMPAIGN/AI\nNow Ill be extra real the campaign is not good not in the sense of the story but the AI even the lowest level of AI difficulty was overly observant like it can see everything you do without scouting or drones and so on so every time you would be engaged by the AI without every getting the chance to see them weather you had drones above or scouts below you almost never see the enemy before they see you making it impossible to play against and the campaign no fun to play but to be honest its not that be of a deal for me at least cause this game is not really for the campaign but for the multiplayer but that me at least. Which leads me to see people say they should add AI for players that leave, but I am fully against that doing that if the AI stays the same and would rather do what they have been doing which is give the players that stay a higher point count accumulation but I do feel they then have to automatically add more unit count for the units you brought to the battle because you can get a load of points but if you still cant bring as many active units to the fight as the enemy and they have 2 heads thinks and focused on 1 person and that person brings everything they can but are still out numbered cause they actually don't have enough units to bring and counter an attack or bring to an assault that stopped dead cause its they had 3 units for every 1 of yours it does make it almost impossible to win if its in the late game especially since by then you've either had all you units wiped and don't have enough time to bring in new units cause everything is on cool down still or enough points cause you spent everything on an assault it can really kill the vibe but at the end of the day not much you can do about random players on your team.\n\nIn my opinion this game in great even if some crappy things happen but they don't happen often and its just a game at the end of the day. The game just came out and there is a lot of work to be done and after seeing their road map I'm excited to see the game develop more and see what's to come... Even if I'm a little disappointed that we arn't getting a new faction to play with for at least 1+ years is kind of disappointing ngl but what can we do.",

The battles are set in Northeastern Europe, present year.\n- You deploy new units with points which you get over time and through bonuses based on your team's performance.\n- You build your army loadout which determines the amount, specialist units and unique units/missions. For most units you can customize certain features, with plenty of juicy dilemmas.\n- Unit types work as realistically as can be expected.\n- Visibility is a major issue in the battles. It decides battles, means of scouting are important. It's all very well done.\n- Artillery is extremely important and diverse. You have to micromanage it by looking for the enemy positions and moving it around as well as managing ammo.\n\nIt's catchy. Beautifully done. It's fun.\nGet it if you love realistic modern warfare and 21st century warfare as a theme!",

This game is a breath of fresh air for the RTS genre and people should acknowledge what the devs have worked hard on creating before shitting all over it. There is constant attention and development from the devs, more than can be said for a lot of games, considering how horrendous the community has been towards them and their project I think they frankly deserve commendation for even sticking with the project.

It seems like no matter what you do, you will have people crying and review bombing the game into oblivion, because they don't agree with the current meta or some dumb shit.

The reddit for this game is just a cesspit of people crying about this constantly.\n\nThis game deserves an 80%+ on steam, yes there have been genuine issues like the anti-cheat situation (I mean come on), but the review bombing from a chinese streamer being banned while cheating live??? Just to get him unbanned? Pathetic and I feel for the Devs here.\n\nGood Game :)",

There are so many different deck combos to try and use, with a wide range of roles you can undertake. The devs make mistakes, but they do love their product and are trying to fix it constantly. \r\n\r\nOverall, the thrilling degree of unit customization, battlegroup creation, and gameplay loop keep me coming back. The strategic depth and options of other titles without the extreme clunkiness and massive friction. The learning curve is actually a curve, rather than a steep cliff.

The micro here is surprisingly good, it's based on sensible tactics such as laser designating targets, hiding behind cover etc.\r\n\r\nThe learning curve is quite steep, there is a lot to know and the campaign is hard.

If a teammate gives up 10 minutes into a 45 min match because they made a few mistakes, it makes it harder for the rest of the team. The large number of complex mechanics can also contribute to this.

      "review": "It's finally time for me to write a review, which I probably should have done a long time ago.\n\nI had waited patiently for this game for 5 years, and had been a Patreon supporter for STB for multiple of those years, including prior to Slitherine supporting the game as a publisher. I played the earliest alphas that I recall being available to patrons, all the closed and open betas, all of it. I provided feedback and felt that I was not shouting into a void. I at one point spent a couple of hours in a voice chat with one of the devs (FLX, this will have meaning later) helping create ideas for voice lines, and I think I recognize at least one that made it to release as something I helped with. I was asked at multiple points, because I was previously in the military, questions about fairly simple, small things that showed me the depth at which the devs wanted to go to create perhaps not a realistic, but immersive experience. My hope was through the roof.\n\nThinking back, the warning signs started popping up before the game released. The institution of auto-smoke for vehicles was a red flag. By this point, I had already realized that the feedback I provided post-Slitherine involvement was ignored (not blaming Slitherine, just using it as a time reference), and I can only imagine that providing feedback was an illusion of being involved in something we were all passionate about. The campaign was literally an afterthought because in the games formative years the team intended for it to only be multiplayer PvP. They didn't even think about adding skirmish until some of the later betas and the massive amount of feedback they received on that particular point (and we of course saw that enemy skirmish AI wasn't present at release, and allied ones still aren't).\n\nOn release, I had fun in multiplayer because it was a new experience, I could access everything rather than just some (as in the betas), but I quickly learned how frustrating the game was to play. Vehicle survivability was absolutely insane, and infantry felt incredibly weak (spoiler alert: this is still true because the devs refuse to make changes that would actually fix the problem). Many of us went from Wargame Red Dragon, where these devs also came from, which had incredibly strong infantry, to a game where the polar opposite was true. I don't need to belabor how awful the balance is because you can find what I can only assume are thousands of reviews complaining about it. I've seen people make tangible, constructive suggestions, only to be ignored on countless occasions. I've a good, longtime friend who is a popular content creator (>100k subs) who also told me to give up on the game, because he also tried to provide feedback after sinking countless hours into the game and understanding it at a fundamental level and was told he was wrong.\n\nThe anticheat, or lack thereof, is of course a core problem.  Most of the actual 'anticheat' was STB/Slitherine relying on Discord mods to read and evaluate cheating reports that were initially set up in the discord then were routed to a specific email address. Even with EAC implemented now, the original anticheat is still in the game. This means that modding the game is nigh impossible, and at this point, that is the only thing that will bring me back to the game: allowing me to not play FLX's version of this game. He is primarily responsible for the squandering of this title's infinite potential.\n\nHere's the kicker: the game's state is completely in line with FLX's vision. If the community didn't have a say (through terrible reviews, diminishing player count, the Discord being full of negativity, PARTICULARLY the patrons, etc), I am 100% confident he would double down and keep things as they are. He completely, and openly, rejects criticism, whether constructive or otherwise. From my understanding, he similarly rejects dissent from within even the dev team itself. I've watched members of the moderator team leave or at least become openly critical of the game, not because they're volunteers/unpaid, but because they also share the cynical view of the game, which exists largely because of FLX. He is, in every sense of the word, the end-all-be-all decisionmaker. Recently, he asked me a question after a rather cynical scathing of the state of the game in the Patreon channel, I spent over an hour compiling what I felt was a constructive, holistic answer (the subject was, in particular not just on the balance but the OPTICS of the balance; i.e. how it looked having the community be the reason that the demonstrable lack of balance only got worse with every single patch since release), and he rejected it outright as a personal attack on the team (read: him). That was the last straw for me. I experienced his good side, but my opinion of him has significantly tanked and probably will never recover. In the words of the same aforementioned friend, \"he's [FLX] is not typing a response, he already had all the answers.\" It was shortly after this that I cancelled my Patreon subscription. Sure, that is largely symbolic, but to go from one of the longest-time supporters at the highest Patreon level before Slitherine was in the picture to joining the cynics after release was never, ever something I expected to do. \n\nThe sad thing is this: I still believe in the potential of Broken Arrow. Somehow, some way, I believe it is possible to salvage. I don't believe they'll ever truly balance the game as long as FLX has any say in the decisionmaking, but I do believe in what I can only assume will be years, the ability to mod the game will make it worth playing again (maybe you shouldn't make a modding channel in the discord if modding the game got people permabans from the in-house anticheat). Modding being added is exactly the answer I gave to the most well-meaning, awesome member of the Slitherine team involved in the game (Sam) when he asked me what would bring me back. \n\nMy review doesn't even touch on some other broader issues, like the network affecting missiles, nor some other, more drama-related issues surrounding the anticheat that the vast majority of the community isn't aware of.",

The game is struggling with technical issues that its been working through for a long time. They're a small studio, I get it, so I won't give them too much flak for it.\n\nBut gameplay wise...it's horrific. It's designed to attract players new to the genre/subgenre, but it has almost no staying power because of the absolutely baffling decisions on part of the Creative Director. To keep it short: Combined arms doesn't exist like it would in a Eugen game (or even really bigger titles, like COH); it plays more like a traditional RTS where everything is a stat check. This, along with the absurd economy of the game where there is basically no penalty for losing all of your units, leads to Bloons TD style gameplay where people just pivot from one massed hoard of unit types to another, hoping to overwhelm the enemy since units are quite spongey and usually can't be hard countered by just a specialist unit or two. \n\nThe Creative Director himself is quite adamant that this is intended gameplay, and has stubbornly roadblocked other devs' attempts at overhauling the game with a few exceptions (Airspam used to be REALLY bad in the betas, but we got a rework by release). Other development problems cropped from the couple years of relative dormancy the game experienced, meaning the Singleplayer is very haphazardly and quickly thrown together (Probably one of the worst campaigns of any game I've ever played) and a lot of things are noticably half baked, like the UI and general stability of the game.\n\nAll in all, it makes me sick to my stomach to talk so much trash about this game because I really do consider many of the people involved with its development old friends, and I was very excited to see them go out and make a game I really feel has potential to fill a gap left by more stagnant RTS concepts and Eugen itself.

This led player to use only \"bombing run\" command.\nSo instead of just fixing long range SAMs, that indeed not worked properly in beta, we have this absurd nerf of planes across most important stats - from aimtime to extended respawn time for every airframe, which is not affected by fuel or munition used. You basically can call airframe and sell it, and bam 5 minute respawn. For example destroyed PAC-2 respawn ~3 minutes, while JET that can destroy it will be refueling and rearming for 5 to 7 minutes, if jet was lost - up to 12 minutes.\n\nBecause airtab was nerfed for both faction(and US rely on airtab very much), obviously, RU start pumping winrate vs US, because of better versatile ground units.\nNow we have patches that nerfing RU ground and making US as versatile as RU. \nExample: RU had best Shorad(short air defense) arsenal in-game. There were no analogue in US. \nIn last patch US got SeaRAM, practically second best Shorad in-game after Pantsir. \nInefficient shorads for US was a distinctive feature allowing to play HELIs more aggressive vs US. Now US and RU have same Shorads capabilities.\n\nCurrently both factions plays the same: you buy tower defense units, recon and tube or rocket arty. In very competetive games you see no action for 90% of game time, because meta is to turtle and accumulate units/points for 2 phases and rush for objective at last minutes of phase 3. \nIn beta, at least, there was no kills objective, so u could trade as much units as u want to capture zone.\n\nInstead of making better and efficient air superiority planes, we got airtab nerf.\nInstead of making better balance between airtab and long range anti air, we have useless SEADs, had to abuse radar off SAMs and \"enjoying\" overkill feature.\nInstead of making unit counter better, we have unnecesary and sometimes absurd price nerfs.\n\nAnother issues that current playerbase doesn't scale with current distribution of elo. 90% of leaderboard is a dead weight and need to be adressed with elo wipes every 3-4 months to refurbish matchmaking, because now it can be practically impossible to find opponent at high elo bracket, which may lead to more than hour in queue just for one game.\n\nGame was fun in beta, it was dynamic because of airtab for both faction won't let you blob spamming ifvs with infantry or playing tower defense whole game, u had to move units, attack and wasn't afraid to lose expensive tank, cause this wont led to \"skull objective\" gain for enemy.",

Devs are constantly playing with unit prices and moving units from one deck to another to achieve so-called \"BALANCE\".\n\nSince the release of this game, the US has had two advantages: strong special units, good mobility (cheap helicopter transport) and a very good air force at low cost.\nIn contrast, the Russians had the advantage of strong mechanized units and good anti-aircraft units.\n\nTo give you an idea, every nation has fifth-generation aircraft.\nRU: Su-57 with stealth value 1.25\nUS: F-117, F-22, F-35A, F-35B and B-2 all with Stealth value 1.75 (the bigger value, the better)\nThe B-2 bomber also carries a tactical nuclear bomb, which it will most likely always drop, because air defense forces cannot see the aircraft and the bomb cannot be destroyed in flight.\n\nIn UAVs as aerial recon units. The US absolutely dominating as they have RQ-170 Sentinel stealth drone and Globalhawks with perfect visibility. And if you know these Wargame games, strong recon is must have. Russian side does not have UAVs as S-70 Okhotnik in the game.\n\nFirst \"balancing\" update, they nerfed Russian reactive artillery, B-21 Grad, and TOS-1A. And in the latest update, they messed with air defense, which completely robbed the Russians of any chance to defend themselves against the powerful US Air Force, which was already dominating the skies.\n\nAfter the game's release, the win rate remained at 52% for RU Nation vs. 48% for US Nation. So the balance was practically perfect. There are a lot of very good players consistently playing only Russia, which is why they have a slightly higher win rate.\n\nAfter the several patches winrate stats are 58,59 % USA / 41,11 % Russia (date: 2025-10-31)\nSource BA stats.\n\nSo the developers of this game ensured an absolute drain of players and negative reviews with their actions. Instead of taking care of real problems with the game, such as cheaters.\n\nP.S. to Steel Balalaika Studio.

The result is the inexistence of RU lobbies at the higher elo and the prevalence of US vs US matchups.\nThe constant nerfs that hit the RU specs while understandable at first, made the RU faction without an identity by now, the only things that were working either made rediculously expensive or weak to the point it is not worth to use anymore, which forces the RU faction enjoyers to yet again shift their playstyle (for the third time), and the result was a boring MLRS abusing tower defence meta, because if you try doing anything else the trades becomes unfavorable to RU due to the cost/effeciency of their units compared to US.\nAlso, we have been asking since release to remove the overkill mecanism which hasn't been adressed yet, the addition of a replay feature is also a necessity. \nA tip to the devs : just because a minority of the playerbase (which appears to be a majority because of its prevalence on the forums and the under representation of the others) keep whining and bitching that their favorite toys needs buffs and that the opposing side need nerfs because it suits them, doen't mean you should alter the entire gameplay to catter for them.",

The amount of air units the US loses, combined with their ground units when trying to combat this will always end up in a positive trade for the RU player.

The range is far to short when compared to the real world counterparts, does hardly any damage to any unit type except support, and seems expensive since artillery does not really kill or immobilize combat units.\r\n-Buildings provide far too little cover for infantry. (a infantry squad consisting of 10 men can occupy a 12 story high rise and be taken out by a T90 with two High explosive rounds. I hardly believe that is realistic especially if you consider maximum elevation of the t90's main gun and the sheer size of the building compared to the amount of troops inside)",

      "review": "When I first played the demo, I was excited for this game. A somewhat realistic strategy game filling a long neglected niche with a variety of units, maps, and a great user experience. Shortly after release I bought this game because for me it was one of the most highly anticipated ones of the year. However, it became pretty clear pretty quickly that the game is horribly optimised. As with all games I buy, I checked the requirements first and my PC is far above the minimum requirements and comes close to the recommended.  Already from the start it was impossible to play larger city maps as the game would either freeze or crash. Playing only was also nearly impossible, which is annoying as it hinders me from playing with friends. Still, I was more than happy having the campaign and skirmish battles. My main hope was that the devs would try to optimise the game to make it at least playable on the lowest settings for people with devices fulfilling the requirements. Unfortunately, when I tried to play a small campaign map on the lowest settings today, first my game crashed and on a second try it almost killed my PC (literally had do hard kill it and was almost forced to factory reset it).\n\nTo wrap it up: In theory Broken Arrow could be a great game, but you should only think about buying it if you treat the recommended requirements as the minimum reqs and take the gamble that it might be not just a wasted 50$ for an unplayable game but also consequences for your device. I have no idea how such a horribly optimised game could have ever landed on the market and I am seriously disappointed in the devs for lying about the minimum requirements and the unwillingness to fix the optimisation after several months of the full release.",

      "review": "Broken Arrow is the kind of game that makes you question whether your computer is broken or if the developers just decided to run a social experiment. It promises an epic modern-war RTS with tactical depth and then delivers something that feels like commanding troops through a PowerPoint presentation held together by duct tape and regret.\n\nThe performance issues alone could qualify as a stress test for both hardware and human patience. Even the best gaming rigs struggle like they’re running a physics simulation of quicksand. Crashes come often enough that you start treating them as tactical timeouts. And since you can’t save mid-mission—yes, in 2025—any crash means you get to relive the same two-hour operation like some kind of military Groundhog Day.\n\nThen there’s the multiplayer, which feels like someone tried to organize a war game over dial-up internet. Half your team might vanish mid-match, and the game doesn’t even penalize quitters. You’ll spend more time fighting your own connection than your enemies. Matchmaking feels random enough that you begin to suspect it was designed by a random number generator that’s just given up on life.\n\nThe user interface seems determined to hide vital information behind submenus that look like they were designed by someone who’s never played their own game. The tutorials are so unclear you might learn more from watching a pigeon peck at your keyboard. And while unit customization sounds cool, it’s buried beneath layers of confusion, jargon, and buttons that don’t always do what you think they do—kind of like a nuclear launch panel labeled in emojis.\n\nThe campaign has ambition, sure. But ambition without direction just becomes chaos, and Broken Arrow proves it with long, joyless missions that feel less like strategic battles and more like endurance marathons for the clinically stubborn. The lack of saving is such a baffling omission it borders on performance art.\n\nAt sixty bucks, you’re paying for what feels like early access with delusions of grandeur. The game isn’t so much broken as it is perpetually under construction. Every time it shows a glimmer of promise—like a well-designed unit or a satisfying explosion—it quickly reminds you that fun is a bug, not a feature.\n\nIn short, Broken Arrow is a brilliant concept trapped in a catastrophic execution. It’s like someone handed you the blueprints for a stealth jet and you ended up with a lawnmower that explodes when you press “Go.” Maybe, someday, after enough patches, it’ll become what it wants to be. For now, it’s just a cautionary tale in real-time suffering.",

The main problem in my opinion is the surrender option. It's taking a large part of the fun out of the game. If you like sitting in the cue waiting to get put into a match for 5 minutes, only to have someone surrender before the first stage is over and end the game then this one is for you. One of the things I enjoy is trying to figure out a way to win when things get difficult. Problem is that when people starting getting beat they give up, and 9 times out of 10 somebody is gonna start spamming the surrender option and end the game early instead of trying to figure out a way to win and possibly taking a loss. It's making the game so that it's not fun anymore, because you hardly ever get to play a full match. I don't think I've played a full match in the last couple of months since everyone gives up when things don't go their way. Back when the game first released I ended multiple games by myself with 1 vs 5 after my whole team would leave the match, and it was so much fun playing like that. I never won when that happened, but fighting against those odds was exciting. Now you're lucky if you even get to make it to the third phase. It either needs to go away, have a heavy penalty for saying yes to a surrender, or have they option to turn it off.",

Being able to customize specific unit weapon loadouts is a really amazing feature for a game like this.  On paper this game seems to be everything I could ask for in an RTS.  \n\nAfter playing 200+ hours and reaching level 35, I've accepted the hard truth that the devs don't seem to listen to the community and it's seemingly unplayable unless you bring along 4 friends for a 5 stack lobby.  \n\nEvery time I queue into a match, I always meet the same type of players.  There's always someone who either spams nothing but artillery and anti air, and refuses to actually bolster the frontline with tanks and infantry, or there's someone who pushes a point or airdrops and loses all their units at the start and immediately gives up.  Since the new leave penalty has been implemented, the people who just give up immediately don't even leave the game.  They just sit in the lobby spawning in nothing while the rest of my team attempts to pull off a 4v5 without extra income from the teammate doing nothing.\n\nI've often seen people say Broken Arrow is a super toxic game, but after a while of playing it's understandable.  When you have a level 30+ on your team doing literally nothing to contribute to the team it's super demoralizing and makes you not want to even touch this game.  \n\nTL;DR:  This game has a bunch of cool new mechanics for a niche genre like this, but in the current state of the game it's just not that fun unless you reliably have a 5 stack to play with every time.",

When I try to install it, my computer refuses to launch it, and when I try to go into the files and install the anti-cheat manually, it still won't install\n\nI finally managed to get the game to work with watching a youtube vid still I had to find my own way to get the game to work on my own when u guys should be responsible for it to install when we first open the game or update it",

Each balancing update just swings the win rates back and forth, leaving it clear that the devs don't have a handle on the game's balance. Their recent roadmap feels unrealistic, and I seriously doubt much of it will come to fruition.\n\nOn top of that, the game’s player base is virtually nonexistent. Matches often take 10+ minutes to find, and when you do finally get one, 90% of the time its a one sided stop.\n\nFor the time I spent with it, I felt the $50 price tag was worth it. But honestly, anyone buying the game now would be lucky to get even $10 worth of fun. Save your money and pick up something else.",

Maybe the creators can fix it, but doubtful. Lots of hacking involved in the game. Extremely disappointing game and mechanics are busted as hell. 3/10",
