      "review": "Infinity Nikki is just a mix of Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves but instead of gambling for cute characters, you gamble for outfits and makeup. \r\n\r\nThe game is 100% made for the women audience, but if you a chill dude who likes fashion and rpgs then Id recommend it.\r\n\r\nThe only downside for most people would be the lack of combat. Dont get me wrong there are still enemies to fight, but they are all one-shot no matter your level. Since the game is designed to mainly focus on styling of clothing and styling battles, the enemy battles are simple and easy to pass.\r\nI personally quite like the combat being simple, since it doesnt pull you away from the actual point of the game, and it makes it easy for people who dont have much combat experience in games.\r\n\r\nThere are also occasionally a few bugs while in dialog, as well as the game freezing while switching tabs. But nothing insane or game breaking has happened to me. \r\n\r\nOtherwise I 100% recommend this game.  I absolutely love it so far. The costumes are amazing and the stories are decently well done, with amazing art and animation. I can not stress about how insanely good the animation is. \r\nI hope anyone reading this will give it a go! >:3",

      "review": "I've been playing this game daily for several months now. Having wracked up over 350 hours, I'm torn as to whether I can recommend it. While I appreciate the sweet, chilled out vibe and beauty of the game, there are a few major issues.\n\nPros:\n. The outfit design for this game is otherworldly! It's truly a beautiful game, with elements including dress-up, RPG and story-focus, exploration, puzzles, dailies and house building. All of which are designed to visually please.\n. You can choose when to interact with the multiplayer aspects of the game. It runs as a single player with elements of multiplayer interaction.\n. There are lots of mini games and puzzles, with new and continuous content release each month.\n. Best home building I've seen in a game, and I've played a lot of home builders in my time!\n. Really well coded game. Having played as much as I have, I've rarely encountered bugs. It's really solid.\n. Calming and relaxing gameplay with chill vibes. Lots of room for customisation, with a focus on dress-up and outfit creation.\n. It feels like the devs really take feedback on board.\n. You get a lot out the F2P aspect, basically the whole game. Certain outfits come with abilities, but this does not effect the game or story whatsoever. \n. Exploration is really fun!\n. I love taking beautiful pictures of Nikki dressed up all sweet. The scope for this is huge, with loads of poses and places to take pictures and share them with the community. Granted, this aspect will cost you really money in the long-run, as the diamonds you get at the start of the game will soon deplete, which is when you'll need to start forking out real dosh!\n\nCons:\n. The biggest issue for me is the monthly outfit acquisition. You spend real money to buy diamonds for outfits - okay fine. But here's the kicker - outfit pieces aren't guaranteed even after spending real money. I've spent up to £40 on a single outfit before, and still not received the entire thing because of bad luck drawing each piece. It's basically a lottery. I think this is completely unacceptable. \n. The multiplayer aspect of the game is very limited. You can share snapshots: pictures you take around the world. You can view other player snapshots and like them. You can \"reveal\" players in one particular area (with their consent), but ultimately there isn't much interaction between players. I'd say that this was a singleplayer, with very limited multiplayer aspects.\n. The stories are sometimes long and boring.\n. It's impossible to complete collection, as outfits become unavailable after the season ends. For those who like to neatly collect and complete, this is a real nightmare. Besides, you'd literally need to spend thousands in order to collect everything. Very unsatisfying. \n. The dailies are an absolute drag.\n\nOverall, I've enjoyed playing this game. I wouldn't mind paying for outfits if it wasn't a literal lottery each time. For this reason alone, I'm considering quitting, because the dress-up and picture taking aspects were the most appealing for me. Once you're up to date with the content, this aspect becomes pretty important.",

While I have few hours on steam, I've been playing the game since launch and have logged over 400 hours on the game overall at the time of this review. I play it every single day. A majority of the negative reviews on this game came from a barrage of upset players during a rough update where the game admittedly struggled with a lot of bugs, glitches, and was unplayable for some. However the game was amazing before and continues to be amazing after.\n\nThe graphics of this game are absolutely gorgeous, I am continuously in awe. The story is deep and beautiful and has a lot more to come. The dress up aspect is hands down the best of anything I've ever played. There's so much content and so many outfits I could spend hours just playing dress up. For a franchise that was previously exclusively a mobile game, I am genuinely impressed with how they've created such an amazing open world experience on multiple platforms INCLUDING mobile. \n\nCozy? Well... it has it's moments. It's a good mix of cozy (farming mats, exploration, dress up, photo taking, gardening, etc) and some pretty difficult combat and puzzles. I've been surprised at how much I've struggled in some of the boss fights. \n\nIt's important to remember that this is a gacha game and with that, survives off of predatory money grabbing micro transactions and gambling. It is completely possible to play and enjoy this expansive game without spending a penny, but it does take some self control and some missing out on certain things. Be cautious playing if you have a history of gambling addictions or irresponsible spending. With that being said, it's a free to play game so in most cases it doesn't hurt to give it a shot. \n\n11/10.",

Transferring the account is simple, just login with the existing infold account and it will automatically link it to Steam.\n\nEvery day there's something new and interesting to do, see or find. It's very cozy and relaxing. The story is fun and engaging and the characters are interesting.\n\nI love the style and customization. Taking pictures is also super fun and you can spend hours making new looks and finding pretty locations to take new pictures.\n\nThere's not much combat, and the little there is, is very simple. Don't come into this expecting high levels of complexity, it's mostly point and shoot, and when fightning bosses, point and shoot when the weakspot glows.\n\nThe gacha is... well. Gacha. It will ever be expensive and frustrating and you will not be able to get everything the game sells without spending copious amount of money, but I do believe the freely available costumes and the ones you can get with the limited f2p premium currency is enough to be happy with, without spending anything. And you don't need every single dress to be fabulous!\n\nHighly recommend, but as with every freemium game, be cautious with your purchases. The game itself tells you to budget responsibly.",

I had heard about the ret-conning of the prologue, which made me wait for more updates before deciding to give the game a shot again.\n\nPros:\n* Beautiful graphics, a comfy environment that just breathes relaxation.\n* Fun gameplay - the mix between gathering, exploring, quests, and battles.\n* Even with the gripes on the new prologue (see cons), the story was written in a way that it's more like how X-Men always uses time travel when they've written themselves into a corner. The original prologue still technically happened, but just in a different time/universe.\n\nCons:\n* Needing to do a brand new tutorial that took me away from where I left off in the main story. The fact I couldn't go \"do tutorial later\" and I was automatically thrown into it, is what made me not like how they ret-conned the original prologue. This could've been done as a sort of event to make the transition more smooth.\n* The game doesn't close fully, as exiting the game doesn't bring you back the the launcher, which also doesn't show up as an active app on the taskbar. Clicking stop on Steam doesn't force the launcher to close. Instead, you have to go to your Task Manager and manually close it that way. Very weird for this to have been a problem since the Steam launch and it still hasn't been addressed.",

Very beautiful!\n- The housing is nice, haven't done too much with it myself just yet but I haven't had any gripes about it. The furniture sets are all really cute too, love that you have access to so many pieces without spending a dime.\n- The crafting system is fun too, I love that you can interact with the world by grooming animals, picking flowers, catching bugs & fish etc. to make a bunch of free outfits!\n- The combat has gotten more challenging and fun with every update, and I like how you can customize the way your purification attack works.\n\nCons:\n- The optimization HAS gotten better, but it still runs really crappy even on the lowest settings and it's a huge issue. I don't have problems running any other games with more intense graphics so it's really annoying when the game freezes every two seconds while trying to explore. \n- Doesn't run well on my iPad either, tons of crashes, had to just uninstall since it either won't load or will just crash two seconds after logging in- again, I don't have this problem with other graphically intense games on there either.\n\nI DO spend a bit on the game so this isn't a f2p review.

As someone who played previous Nikki titles, I was excited to see familiar outfit styles return. I spent countless hours exploring, gathering materials, and enjoying what seemed like a casual, F2P-friendly experience.\n\nThen the Sea of Stars update arrived. Gacha became harsher, the story shifted into amnesia and multiverse territory, and paying started to feel necessary. Multiplayer was added and became required for events and progression. The focus moved away from exploring Miraland with Nikki and toward constant “recover your memories” and “help another Nikki” plots, which wasn’t what many of us came for. And honestly? I don't like it one bit. Sure, it's cool but like-- why? it started out so well and now it is all about \"well actually I know everything already, I just need to remember so gimme a minute\". It feels like an Isekai now. \n\nThe newest Itzaland update continued the same trend. Instead of a fresh adventure, Nikki suddenly remembers being there centuries ago and explains the world’s history to its own inhabitants. The visuals remain stunning, but the story direction feels increasingly disappointing.\n\nOverall: 5/10.\nGreat graphics, lovely music, difficult gacha, and heavier grind than expected.\n\nFor players of past Nikki games: you’ll enjoy the visuals and outfits, but not much the story.\nFor newcomers: you may like it more if you start with no expectations.\nFor early-game returnees: it’s hit or miss.\n\nThe clothes still slay, though (in a good way!).",

To have a story centered around female characters that enjoy feminine things without any sexualization makes me so happy. The male characters aren't threatening in the slightest with the female characters being so confident and self-assured. Usually you'd only find something like this in children's media. Infinity Nikki, to me, feels like a wonderful respite from the often tiresome world of both anime and gaming.",

      "review": "Mildly salty that Steam calls me out for the ungodly amount of time I've spent on this game every day when I'm about to fire it back up. Fun fact, I started playing during the 1.5 update because I wanted to see what the hate was about and was immediately sucked in like the gacha simp I am. \r\n\r\nWhy I play (and religiously log in every day to do my dailies):\r\n- I love collecting stuff. Literally my fav part of open world games is picking stuff off the ground don't @ me\r\n- Combat is minimal (unpopular opinion in some circles). Most monsters you hit 1-3 times and they poof. The new area in 2.0 has some harder enemies with more health, but they're still relatively easy to defeat. Used to be obsessed over Genshin, but now prefer IN over Genshin because there's no boss grinding getting in the way of my busy schedule picking stuff off the ground. \r\n- Pretty clothes. So many sparkly and cute outfits your head will explode. I have an ironclad grip on my wallet so I'm staying f2p somehow, but every day I stray closer to giving in and become whale.\r\n- Fun community. 90% of the player base are cool people who are chill and welcoming. Even tho co-op mode is still buggy as hell sometime (more on that later), hanging out, taking pictures with the 1 million different cute duo poses, and generally acting like gremlins with people in game is fantastic.\r\n- The housing mode has ruined my life. Every day I spend at minimum 5 hours planting my crops, collecting stars, and making my 3 mansions more and more elaborate. 2.0 update will raise load limit and and more furniture and I am not prepared to lose even more of my life to this godforsaken game plz help\r\n\r\nWhy a normal, non-gacha game simp might be turned off:\r\n- the gacha system is, as always, a cold and cruel mistress. RNJesus will laugh in your face every time you fail to get your favorite piece from whichever 5* sparkly outfit they dangle in your face that season (btw, they have new outfits every 2 weeks so good luck every saving up as f2p)\r\n- many bugs (and not the kind you can collect in game). Literally just yesterday I ran into a co-op bug where my person disappeared off the map and came back as a squeaking disembodied hand. It was hilarious, but probably not conducive to actually enjoying the game for a lot of people. The issue where you have to shut down the game via Task Manager persists for a lot of people. Some people still can't start up the game without getting frozen out on the black screen of death. \r\n- A lot of other reviews already talk about this, but infold is shady as hell with trying to coerce you to spend your money. Tbf, most gacha game companies are the same, but infold can be incredibly shameless about it at times.\r\n\r\ntl:dr it's a fun game with problems. If the problems don't outweigh the fun for you, go for it!",

I utilize the skip feature often in these cases so it truly doesn't effect my gameplay much. However, it has turned into how fast I can skip through the epicly long dialog for random quests lol",

I had heard about the ret-conning of the prologue, which made me wait for more updates before deciding to give the game a shot again.\n\nPros:\n* Beautiful graphics, a comfy environment that just breathes relaxation.\n* Fun gameplay - the mix between gathering, exploring, quests, and battles.\n* Even with the gripes on the new prologue (see cons), the story was written in a way that it's more like how X-Men always uses time travel when they've written themselves into a corner. The original prologue still technically happened, but just in a different time/universe.\n\nCons:\n* Needing to do a brand new tutorial that took me away from where I left off in the main story. The fact I couldn't go \"do tutorial later\" and I was automatically thrown into it, is what made me not like how they ret-conned the original prologue. This could've been done as a sort of event to make the transition more smooth.\n* The game doesn't close fully, as exiting the game doesn't bring you back the the launcher, which also doesn't show up as an active app on the taskbar. Clicking stop on Steam doesn't force the launcher to close. Instead, you have to go to your Task Manager and manually close it that way. Very weird for this to have been a problem since the Steam launch and it still hasn't been addressed.",

Even though I am a buying customer who spent a lot hours into this game, they refuse to help me in a very simple matter. The game's item buying design is flawed especially for the housing items. I accidentally bought seeds with all my astralites (700+ Chilixy Seeds, so you do the math). How am I supposed to use that many seeds? How many days will it take me to grow all that? They are refusing to respond to me from the e-mail (it's mostly AI that directly rejects the roll back). The worst part is that they say that it will be unfair for other users, while there are posts on Reddit who talk about getting a rollback.",

I've never seen such bad building gameplay in any game.\nThere's no building grid. You have to struggle to place it however you want, and it still doesn't work out the way YOU want. I have such a strong tilt that I deleted the game.💀\nBuilding furniture, walls, floors, etc. for the house, requires growing flowers. LOTS OF FLOWERS - is a grind that drags on for months or even more.\nThe recent in-game events also annoyed me with the grind, and the stupid time-wasting mechanics, but the house just killed me. If you want to build something in game, go to Palia, Paralives, The Sims, anywhere - but not here.\nEven in Warcraft, house building will better than in Nikki.\nIf you come to this game only here for outfits, then my review is not relevant to you. \nBut still, be prepared for the in-game events to be stuffy and boring. The open world will be very empty without chests - when you collect them all, like in all gachas.\nAfter a while, you'll lose the energy to log into the game, and everything in this game will start to annoy you.\nI think even if I continue playing in the future, I still won't remove the negative review, because the developers are unlikely to fix most of the problems that are driving me crazy.",

      "review": "I have played this game daily on the OG launcher since release, I cannot recommend this game anymore to anyone and am uninstalling for good now. I have played near daily for a year, only missing a few days here and there for travel. They broke their steam deck version in 1.5, so I stopped playing it anytime i was traveling, and they've refused to fix it for 6 months!\n\n1.0-1.4 had incredible stories involving story characters like nonoy and marquez jr, and introduced us to cool new things to look forward to, like cicia and umbrasso and linglang! After 1.5, they threw it all away. The original story was fantastic, i am truly grateful i got to experience the TRULY original opening, and could choose to \"ignore\" the new one, since the game's writing chose to ignore it too! \n\nif you're going to retconn an incredible opening for a generic one to push outfits that wont be available for potentially 1+ years, you should at least lean into the story set up in the retconn omfg!!!!!! It has gone nowhere, and done nothing for the actual story ever since. It just makes the original plot more confusing and upsetting than ever! The Danqing island event SORT of plays on the elements introduced in 1.5, but still is lackluster. \n\nthe dye system and housing system are terrible, and were clearly reworked from the original concepts. We had a whole event showcasing the dye system before it launched! I wouldnt be surprised if the majority of the OG team was laid off and replaced by 1.5 as infold and paper got more and more greedy. \n\nAnd they ARE greedy, so so greedy! Diamond and extra rewards for quests have dwindled from 200 to 180 to 120 to 80 to FIFTY this last patch, what a joke! They do not reimburse for major affected gameplay anymore, maybe 50 diamonds here and there and a \"dont be so mad\" message, after telling us leaking info and outfits was as good as stealing the jobs of everyone there and sending us a \"ban hammer\" item. They only release previews of new outfits 24 hours before the next patch, btw, so you have no chances to spend or save properly. We got 2 banner reruns the whole year just to add photo props to outfits that didnt have them before, to give you more fomo. This is why leaks were happening. They postponed the corpse bride outfit until this patch, and potentially fully scrapped the lolita unicorn fit as \"retaliation\". \n\nThis last event was awful, making us PVP on a fundamentally broken boardgame with wrong timers displaying for the vast majority of mobile users. This locked some people out of major story events and rewards, like the entire conclusion to the Philomia questline, which the other parts of are PERMANENT, and closure quests w all the 1.0 npcs. \n\nNow, 2.0, which we have waited a full year for, is launching with incredibly insensitive items to Native americans (the war bonnet, which was removed from the EN version of LOVE NIKKI in 2017, and featured a CANNIBALISM STORYLINE, BTW.... of the native american \"savage tribals\" EATING NIKKI if she didn't dress like them). The bonnet, which is a very important symbol of The Great Plains tribes + a high honor that is hard to earn and should be respected. How are we still doing this in 2025??? I thought we all moved past this over a decade ago! Same w the dream catchers. \n\nThis is not to say they should not represent other cultures, but things like the jingle dresses, different native jewelry or accessories featuring things like silver and turquoise, woven textile goods etc etc are right there!!!! \n\nAnd the \"SEXY\" attribute belly dancer outfit, showing clear disregard to our middle eastern sisters, when we could have gotten an incredible Lehenga cholis, or even saree, with bindi, nose rings, bangles and more as makeup and accessories. No, instead we get the same washed up oversexualized belly dancer crap media has been pushing since the 1960's. Belly dancing is obviously part of the culture, but the outfit is terrible and the choreography of the dance itself is also terrible! \n\nThe game doesnt close properly, you need to task manager it. it crashes constantly, and you need to task manager it. its full of bloat and the fps is terrible. And you need to task manager it. I play on a decent enough pc, my friends with 3080+ hardware also have extreme fps problems, falling through the world, nikki showing up sideways in cutscenes, all audio breaking. \n\nWhatever happened to the game that launched last December, that ran incredibly, looked fantastic, and had a clear timeline (that was scrapped) and potential from a very cool hook intro???? I went from orca to dolphin to goldfish to f2p since launch because i just cannot stand to give the company money for making a badly running game and ignoring players, now releasing straight up racist outfits FOR MONEY. Their customer service is also entirely an AI bot and it is impossible to contect to people normally, as the bot tries to uno reverse you and regurgitate the same 5 solutions over and over again even if you say they failed. \n\nI have never played a game like IN, even shinning nikki was vastly different, and I will miss it terribly. But not while they are doing this.",

The open-world and dress-up/styling aspects are so fun. There is much to do and explore. Not a big fan of the puzzles but they are somewhat manageable and most don't have direct effect on the gameplay. I try to log in everyday to do the dailies on mobile. They improved the performance on mobile over time, for which I am grateful. There are far less crashing. I can even manage to do some quests, yet for the dungeon/puzzle parts I prefer PC. \n\nI was very happy when they announced this game will be on Steam as I can play it on the Deck without complicated download/installation processes. However, it has been a huge let down. Since its launch on Steam, for the Steam Deck part at least, they haven't improved the performance of the game. Constant crashes, way to long loading screens, overheating the Deck and so on. I don't expect the best graphics or performance like its on PC (with another launcher I am currently using) when I am playing it on the Deck, I just want to play it more than 15 mins without it crashing or stucking on a loading screen. If it's possible for some mobile devices and tablets, I think Infold can improve this game's performance on the Deck as well esp for a game that they've been advertised as 'cozy.' Unfortunately, at this stage, I cannot recommend playing this game on the Deck via Steam.\n\nIf you have any suggestions to improve this game's performance on the Deck, feel free to comment and I'll be very happy to try them!",

Even though its open world the place feels barren with only a few things to find before the area becomes boring. There are also just huge stretches of empty land that make the world feel even more empty. Genuinely feels like some areas were unfinished\r\n-Clothes dying is very limited unless you own the entire outfit and even then it uses a lot of resources to dye, so dying a limited five star set any of the nicer colors is basically impossible unless you get the whole thing \r\n-As many others have said, the devs really seem to not care about what the playerbase has to say which is sad.\r\n-My game would not close when i  exited so id have to restart my computer every time and this doesnt even begin to speak about all the bugs players are having. \r\n\r\n\r\nOverall... besides the cute outfits i cant say much more positives about this game. It feels like a husk, when you explore and try to do anything else. The quests don't feel super involved and it really feels like playing an unfinished game or something. It is upsetting because i thought there would be more fun to have and explore rather than the game just making you grind some annoying thing :(",

Infinity Nikki has no relevant characters except cardboard Nikki and cardboard Momo, the main narrative was forgotten a year ago when the game launch and even what we have was very boring, I was going to let it grow over time but time has left in the backburner for so long and its ashes now. The clothes are nice enough but have little variety in style so I got tired of them, the events are so mind numbing you can complete with your eyes closed in a few hours every month (I haven't played the past few events but last I played this was the situation). The dailies are even worse, so many different dailies with nothing actually engaging and are just interacting with some things or sweeping through some enemies in 2 minutes (the time it takes to find one). You also barely make enough gems for the gacha through all this so you either log in everyday to TRY to get like half of a set you really like or you pay up and wait for the next gacha. \n\nShining Nikki in contrast, even with fewer resources, has a very interesting story that keeps evolving years into the game's life with colourful characters that in game design each outfit so you can see who they are through their works as well as the great narrative in the main quest and the events. Nikki as a protagonist is amazing, her drive to solve the problems that haunt her is neverending but still she falls down many times, you don't get Mary Sue feelings from this incarnation at all so it's not annoying to accompany her in her adventures. The events mostly revolve around certain characters, developing them nicely, or bring new plots that sometimes are relevant to the main story and sometimes are mentioned in nice callbacks.

      "review": "As someone who played this game since the original release back in December, the most recent patch has outright ruined the game for me and many others. Ultimately it comes down to the following reasons:\n\n1. The company that develops this game (Paper Games in China) has a long history of being greedypouchs, however, for the first 5-6 months of this game, they had struck an okay balance between generating decent revenue and having enough players okay with the prices that they are willing to spend regardless of it being kind of pricey. But, now we have seen their greed come through in this most recent patch. The rewards for adding this game to wishlist on steam were teased and then retroactively changed after we hit milestone, making players up. They showed us this lovely livestream teasing a lot of the new features and regions coming in 1.5, and made a point of saying \"No broken promises.\"\n\n2. This patch turned out to be more than just broken promises, it was also broken trust. It started by everyone, new and old alike, being dumped into a 15 minute unskippable cutscene + story sequence that effectively kidnapped you from where you logged out last. Then this sequence would go into a massive lore dump dialogue that would effectively ruin some of the communities favorite characters and any chance of seeing them by effectively saying \"The world suddenly ended\" (and we didn't even get to see it, just the aftermath) and \"Giovanni Turned Evil\" and \"Ena sacrificed herself\". It wasn't until later we would realize that this unskippable cutscene became the new player tutorial as well, which completely retconned the introduction of the game for new players.\n\n3. This patch was buggy to all hell. I've played early access games (Like ARK when it first released) and many many others, but this takes the cake for one of the buggiest experience ever. Cutscene failures, Dyeing system not applying colors correctly, Story Quest markers broken and having untranslated text at times, Minigames not functional, Serenity Island straight up missing collision in big parts of the map (this was not just some small corner). This was alpha testing level bugs, but they released it this way for their players, effectively making us into unpaid beta testers for weeks. From the start, many PS5 players were unable to launch the game with this patch, and some of them (the ones who refused to reinstall and lose their pictures, or those who do not have a 2nd device to try unsticking whatever got stuck with their accounts) are unable to log in to this moment over 3 weeks later. When someone finally heard back from Customer Support about this issue, they were told that the downtime (That was infold's fault) was \"not compensable\" and to \"Please log in on another device\", which completely ignores folks who only have a PS5 and especially those who paided for monthly passes that WILL continue counting down regardless of if you login or not. These passes give limited currency for the Gacha system, and they were paid for with real world money.\n\nThe gacha system is also a point of issue. This patch, they released 11-piece outfits. Historically, it has been 10 or 9, but most often 10. It's up to 20 pity per piece, so that's 200 pity (which the exact cost may vary but up to a couple hundred dollars simply for completing the outfit once). Outfits have special abilities that can only be used with the full outfit, so it's often recommended to complete them. These new outfits were no exception, and by being 11 pieces, they were changed to 220 max pity if you wanted the complete set. This is effectively a pity increase and it came with 0 extra compensation from events for the increased pity, and additionally, the company tried silently changing the cooldown on the endgame mode that contributes to freebie currency to be 21 days instead of 14. This negatively impacted our freebies at the same exact time they were increasing the pity. Additionally, it's worth noting that 1 piece out of both fits (the socks) are completely invisible when wearing the full set due to the long skirts. This begs the question of \"Was these socks needed for the fit, or perhaps for your wallet?\".\n\nThe backlash: Many members of the community have been vocal from Global and CN alike in their dissatisfaction. About a day or 2 after the release, the company released a public apology that gave 20 draws for the limited banners and 10 for the standard, apologizing for the bugs, the dissatisfaction with the dye system, and most importantly the increased pity. They promised no 5* fits will exceed 11 pieces, which was still considered expensive by many. Additionally, previous nikki games have featured 6* fits, so this did not set many at ease, including myself. They did confirm adjusting the endgame mode to be every 1st/16th of the month, however this is still a downgrade from the 14days we had before. Overall, this apology was unsatisfactory, and became less and less satisfactory with each passing day with more and more bugs. Over the next 2 weeks, players have attempted boycotts (later renamed to Girlcott due to some censorship on various social platforms such as discord/reddit) for various reasons, many for the reasons listed above along with some others I'll list very quickly:\n- One of the events ingame has an IRL 2 hours window tied to your game server that you must participant in order to receive rewards\n- The Dye system was teased in a way that implied using materials from the open world, but ended up being a very limited currency that you could buy from the shop (it's expensive). The RGB slider that you get from maxing out a 5* fit requires unlocking all the previous colors to use, making it even more expensive! Additionally, colors like black and white are locked behind evolutions, some of which are obtained from pulling the fit more than once. 4* don't even have black and white in some cases.\n- The Sea of Stars region is extremely disappointing from a gameplay perspective. We have 4 activities and 3 of them are very childish, like riding a See-saw, or Jumping on a bubble once, or turning into random animals in a ball pit. The dailies missions they introduced for this area are basically community service of collect these 20 shells and put them in the bucket. They introduced these new stars on this map for the new heart of infinity shard, which have 2 outfits you can unlock from it. These stars respawn 3 per day, but there was a bug that caused NA/EU to be able to collect twice. Rather than just give ASIA extra stars to fix it, they attempted to retroactively remove stars from those who duped, but many didn't even know it was a bug in the first place, and some got retracted without exploiting and some got to keep their stars. Additionally, a couple of people have reported having their limited gacha currencies being manipulated after the star adjustments went in, which is a very scary prospect for a Gacha Game.\n- The shop featured an illegal bathtub pack, where it was offered for a limited time ONLY at 10$ from a \"discounted\" 50$. This item was never available for 50$ and never will because it will be removed from the store after 1.5\n\nSaturday/Sunday (depending on timezone), we finally got another reply. I'll explain the highlights:\n- They're very sorry for the bugs and the lack of testing. They'll do better they say\n- 1.5 will be extended by 1 week\n- The story retcon was not intended to be a retcon and they failed to properly tie in story beats from the prior tutorial.\n- They're releasing Whale VIP tiers but more info later. (wtf why is this in your apology)\n- They're creating a \"new\" feature area (which is just the CS center reskinned) - They also just released surveys a week or two ago, so what happened to feedback from that?\n- The compensation for weeks of issues and downtime: 8.8 pulls and it's given across 8 days, all leading up to 1.6 (a poorly disguised login event.\n\nThis company does not care for it's players.",

I just can't believe this issue has yet to be fixed.\n\nFirst, I have at least 50 extra hours logged because you MUST end the game via task manager instead of just ending your game. There were two days where the game was accidentally left running overnight for who knows how long because I quit the game and went on with my life doing other things. This has been an ongoing issue for months, but before 1.10, it was a sporadic thing. Now it is literally every time you end the game. \n\nI'm actually kinda sad, because it started out with so much potential. There's really nothing else like it in terms of dress up with cute characters, a fairly compelling story line, and a beautiful open world. However, since 1.5 (when the it came to steam), I can't recommend the game anymore. The greedy monetization and game-breaking bugs with every single patch make it clear that monetization is pushed even to the detriment of the game experience. \n\nI don't play any other gachas so maybe it is naive of me to expect some kind of decency. I've supported the game monetarily, so I'm not just whining about not getting this beautiful game for free. It's just so disappointing in its current state vs what it started out, and there's no way I would ever recommend any family or friends to play it right now.

I've never seen such bad building gameplay in any game.\nThere's no building grid. You have to struggle to place it however you want, and it still doesn't work out the way YOU want. I have such a strong tilt that I deleted the game.💀\nBuilding furniture, walls, floors, etc. for the house, requires growing flowers. LOTS OF FLOWERS - is a grind that drags on for months or even more.\nThe recent in-game events also annoyed me with the grind, and the stupid time-wasting mechanics, but the house just killed me. If you want to build something in game, go to Palia, Paralives, The Sims, anywhere - but not here.\nEven in Warcraft, house building will better than in Nikki.\nIf you come to this game only here for outfits, then my review is not relevant to you. \nBut still, be prepared for the in-game events to be stuffy and boring. The open world will be very empty without chests - when you collect them all, like in all gachas.\nAfter a while, you'll lose the energy to log into the game, and everything in this game will start to annoy you.\nI think even if I continue playing in the future, I still won't remove the negative review, because the developers are unlikely to fix most of the problems that are driving me crazy.",

      "review": "I have played this game daily on the OG launcher since release, I cannot recommend this game anymore to anyone and am uninstalling for good now. I have played near daily for a year, only missing a few days here and there for travel. They broke their steam deck version in 1.5, so I stopped playing it anytime i was traveling, and they've refused to fix it for 6 months!\n\n1.0-1.4 had incredible stories involving story characters like nonoy and marquez jr, and introduced us to cool new things to look forward to, like cicia and umbrasso and linglang! After 1.5, they threw it all away. The original story was fantastic, i am truly grateful i got to experience the TRULY original opening, and could choose to \"ignore\" the new one, since the game's writing chose to ignore it too! \n\nif you're going to retconn an incredible opening for a generic one to push outfits that wont be available for potentially 1+ years, you should at least lean into the story set up in the retconn omfg!!!!!! It has gone nowhere, and done nothing for the actual story ever since. It just makes the original plot more confusing and upsetting than ever! The Danqing island event SORT of plays on the elements introduced in 1.5, but still is lackluster. \n\nthe dye system and housing system are terrible, and were clearly reworked from the original concepts. We had a whole event showcasing the dye system before it launched! I wouldnt be surprised if the majority of the OG team was laid off and replaced by 1.5 as infold and paper got more and more greedy. \n\nAnd they ARE greedy, so so greedy! Diamond and extra rewards for quests have dwindled from 200 to 180 to 120 to 80 to FIFTY this last patch, what a joke! They do not reimburse for major affected gameplay anymore, maybe 50 diamonds here and there and a \"dont be so mad\" message, after telling us leaking info and outfits was as good as stealing the jobs of everyone there and sending us a \"ban hammer\" item. They only release previews of new outfits 24 hours before the next patch, btw, so you have no chances to spend or save properly. We got 2 banner reruns the whole year just to add photo props to outfits that didnt have them before, to give you more fomo. This is why leaks were happening. They postponed the corpse bride outfit until this patch, and potentially fully scrapped the lolita unicorn fit as \"retaliation\". \n\nThis last event was awful, making us PVP on a fundamentally broken boardgame with wrong timers displaying for the vast majority of mobile users. This locked some people out of major story events and rewards, like the entire conclusion to the Philomia questline, which the other parts of are PERMANENT, and closure quests w all the 1.0 npcs. \n\nNow, 2.0, which we have waited a full year for, is launching with incredibly insensitive items to Native americans (the war bonnet, which was removed from the EN version of LOVE NIKKI in 2017, and featured a CANNIBALISM STORYLINE, BTW.... of the native american \"savage tribals\" EATING NIKKI if she didn't dress like them). The bonnet, which is a very important symbol of The Great Plains tribes + a high honor that is hard to earn and should be respected. How are we still doing this in 2025??? I thought we all moved past this over a decade ago! Same w the dream catchers. \n\nThis is not to say they should not represent other cultures, but things like the jingle dresses, different native jewelry or accessories featuring things like silver and turquoise, woven textile goods etc etc are right there!!!! \n\nAnd the \"SEXY\" attribute belly dancer outfit, showing clear disregard to our middle eastern sisters, when we could have gotten an incredible Lehenga cholis, or even saree, with bindi, nose rings, bangles and more as makeup and accessories. No, instead we get the same washed up oversexualized belly dancer crap media has been pushing since the 1960's. Belly dancing is obviously part of the culture, but the outfit is terrible and the choreography of the dance itself is also terrible! \n\nThe game doesnt close properly, you need to task manager it. it crashes constantly, and you need to task manager it. its full of bloat and the fps is terrible. And you need to task manager it. I play on a decent enough pc, my friends with 3080+ hardware also have extreme fps problems, falling through the world, nikki showing up sideways in cutscenes, all audio breaking. \n\nWhatever happened to the game that launched last December, that ran incredibly, looked fantastic, and had a clear timeline (that was scrapped) and potential from a very cool hook intro???? I went from orca to dolphin to goldfish to f2p since launch because i just cannot stand to give the company money for making a badly running game and ignoring players, now releasing straight up racist outfits FOR MONEY. Their customer service is also entirely an AI bot and it is impossible to contect to people normally, as the bot tries to uno reverse you and regurgitate the same 5 solutions over and over again even if you say they failed. \n\nI have never played a game like IN, even shinning nikki was vastly different, and I will miss it terribly. But not while they are doing this.",

      "review": "I enjoyed the variety of game play of dress up, puzzle games, very light combat, mini games, 3D platforming, ect. Then I discovered the numerous and ever-increasing controversies surrounding Infold Games. Mind you, I started this game with no prior knowledge of the devs ignoring all feedback and concerns from their player base starting from v. 1.5 as I didn't start my game play until v. 1.7. The publishers of this game, Papergames, have allegedly been engaging in predatory and potentially illegal practices concerning gacha mechanics, including, but not limited to: False Discount Pricing, Daily Gem Packages Unusable Due to Unplayable Update, Hidden Drop Rate Weighting (Accessories more likely than dresses/hair), purchasing bots to post fake reviews to artificially inflate the ratings on Steam. Please use caution if you decide to install and play this game!\n\nUpdate: I have continued to play this game, despite my doubts and qualms about the studio, with false hope that this game would change. There has been very little, if no improvement since my original review. Th creators still consistently ignore player feedback, despite refusing to hire beta testers. On that note, the game is SO buggy. I continuously have to close the game in task manager to get it to actually shut down after closing its window. This games' bugs used to be charming to me, until they started to make the game unplayable.\n\nAlongside continuous controversies from the creators, specifically regarding this game, a long-awaited v 2.0 is soon to drop almost a full year post-release. Many original fans hope this continues the main storyline, as we have gotten little, to no updates to that since release, despite events happening every month or two. I found myself getting excited for the potential of this update, only to see the creators dropping sneak peaks of straight-up cultural appropriation. There is no reason for a white character to be wearing a Native American headdress, especially as that particular item of clothing is closely tied to their culture and religion. \n\nI highly recommend you DO NOT download or play this game. The amount of content is not worth the controversy and disappointment.",

At this point its a malware program that locks up my pc resources in addition to the kernel level anti-cheat access IN requires. Aside from mass community backlash, seeing less-than-expected money spent and less-than-expected playtime are the few things that will spur a company like this to action.\n\nIf you keep playing / giving them money, it signals that a broken game is acceptable to the playerbase. For everyone enjoying the game and having fun, please continue to do so - that's what games are for, in my opinion. But as for me, I'm done until these issues are fixed. Depending on how long the devs take to fix, showcasing how much they care, I may not return at all.\n\n---\nOriginal review:\nThe devs/pubs need to get their shit together, because the launch/exit process is completely borked. You want ZERO friction between your players and them getting into the game without issue. Invest in your QA process, or create one because it looks like it's nonexistent at the studio.\n\nAlso, I now abhorr Momo.

      "review": "Not Recommended\r\n\r\nHere are my 2 cents after 300+ hours in this game and having played Zelda Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, Sims 4, Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing. I’m always in for cozy games, but this one fails at almost everything apart from dressing.\r\n\r\nStory and Dialogue\r\nThe game lacks any serious storyline. There are endless dialogues that feel like they’re targeted at kids. There is no meaningful connection between the player and the character (Nikki). I understand it’s supposed to be a cozy game, but cozy doesn’t mean soulless.\r\n\r\nCombat\r\nThe combat is too easy to the point of being pointless. There’s no thrill or sense of danger. Even cozy games like Stardew Valley have better combat while mining at least that gives you a sense of accomplishment.\r\n\r\nMini Games\r\nThe mini games are diabolical. Why am I doing “spot the difference” like I’m five years old? If you want to include puzzles, give something challenging like Zelda does. These mini games are brain-dead fillers.\r\n\r\nCo-op\r\nThe co-op feature sucks and has no meaningful purpose in the gameplay. It exists only on paper.\r\n\r\nProgression, Weeklies, Dailies\r\nThere are a bunch of weekly and daily tasks you have to do, and they quickly start to feel like chores. Nothing feels rewarding it’s obligation-based gameplay.\r\n\r\nHousing Update\r\nOne of the worst systems in the game:\r\nEverything is time-gated.\r\nThere is a limit on home insights.\r\nBasic building blocks like floors and walls take 2–3 hours to craft a single piece.\r\nTrees are harvestable only once.\r\nYou have to fish the fish you’re growing, which makes no sense.\r\nThe entire loop is meaningless grinding collect materials → wait for hours/days → finally place one block of floor or a wall.\r\nHousing mechanics are clunky. It’s hard to place even a single block on the ground.\r\nWhat do you mean I have to struggle to lay down one floor tile?\r\n\r\nBuilding and Controls\r\nThere’s no grid system like Sims 4, so everything feels awful to place. The mechanics actively fight you instead of enabling creativity.\r\n\r\nGacha and Monetization\r\nThe gacha is rigged. As a F2P player, the free currency given is decent, but it’s not enough to pull everything each season which is fair for a gacha game. If you save across seasons and only pull when you absolutely need an outfit, it’s manageable. The free outfits are good too.\r\nBut let’s be clear apart from the dresses, everything else in this game is wrong.\r\n\r\nFinal Verdict\r\nThis game markets itself as cozy but delivers grind with baby-tier content. No story, no challenge, no satisfaction. Just waiting, tapping, and pretending it’s fun which is so frustrating. I Could just complete the entire new season in just a few hours just by tapping F and skipping every dialouge to get one free outfit and few sketches.\r\n\r\nIf you only care about dressing your character, fine. If you want an actual engaging cozy game, look elsewhere.",

However, the \"collab\" was just a 2 minute scene and you didnt even need to do anything. The housing was also underwhelming, I had high hopes as the devs do have the funds to make something great but... I just dont like it, at all. \n\nI played around 50 hours to get a whole outfit set with cat ears and a tail, super cute and the excitement for the stardew stuff and housing kept me going, but this game is just not \"it\".

      "review": "The tldr is that the game used to be ok but its now a whale fest with a shallow story, that they may recon at any moment. Go play the OG nikki mobile game, theres nothing here but looks man. Cool looking characters with no substance, nonexistent style battles. Early game is fine, then expect to fumble pulls late game if your ftp. Evil gotcha and grinding. The only reason Im still playing is I feel like I've invested to much time in it, played off steam for a year first, more than 300 hours in total not just steam.\n\nI have a soild year of play time on this game, I couldn't play for 3 days on their launcher so switched to steam, been playing since the og closet intro before they changed it. There is almost anyways something wrong with the game, performance wise and game play wise. My little aus gaming laptop can run god of war on medium settings on a 3050 with no crashes or bugs, I know im pushing it but I got lag and a frozen screen in a empty area. For me its usually a 70/40 chance of encountering an issue but crashes are insanely common, too common for a game with these resources. Expect lag especially in co-op. The damn game barely opens too.\n\nTrying to get outfits is different beast. It started out pretty fun I wont lie. Getting the ingame currency for pulls was pretty good and I didn't feel like the outfits I wanted could only be achieved with real cash. That changes real quick in late game. You better be sure you want both the four star and the five star version of a set because more often than not you might be able to fully evolve an outift because these pulls are STINGY with the shit you actually want.If you are late in the game and have done all the quest that would give you 10-20 gems and spent em the events tied to the newer outfits never give you enough to try and get the set its is a five star, you have to spent money. I know that's a staple of gotcha lotteries but if you are a ftp player, this is coming from a ftp player, you will not have a good time nor get more than 5 pieces max if you aren't lucky. In the later game, you can completely exhaust 5000 gems and still not get anything you want. It feels like you have to bust out the wallet on everything outside of outfit pulls now. You want a rare material you can only get once a day? Better hope someone feeling charitable in the Sea of Stars with those wish bottles, or bust out the wallet. Energy for bubbles, thread, or the realm of dark orbs? Wait 2 days to fully replenish or money. Supplies to make fucking furniture? Nah you have to plant this one flower that has 3 color variants, they grow randomly btw, and hope you get the right one enough times, or bust out that handy dandy rent money. Thats not the worst of the home system either, it seems like they halfheartedly attempted to make a home system like stardew valley but forgot theres actually stuff to do and different furniture other than european cottage. They seems to plan to update the home system but this may be my tipping point for the game rn.\n\nAside from trying to get outfits and materials, the rest of the game just as infuriating. There are a fair bit of interesting story points and characters but the game will introduce them then do fuck all with them. The other nikki looking woman in the new intro, the seer, and newly added to this list is orin. They do this with so many characters everyone feels hollow as shit. The characters in the trailer for this season are literal brick walls and are even really mentions or have actionable roles on the story. The seasons where stuff happens can vary between really fun and cool with the blue tears and the Danqing realm or mid like pet day and this music season thats lackluster with its music.Its always so close to something interesting then doesn't commit to anything other than overtly lecturing the player with whatever the 'moral' of the season it. This season was so close to having an actual villian then went out in a whimper. You dont use any interesting ability, do not be fooled by the trailer all that happens in cutscenes, you get to do nothing but go her and initiate talk sequence. I feel like some of it may be build up for when they expand the other area's/kingdoms if they ever do but Idk.\n\nThe style battles suck. They aren't battles like in the og nikki mobile game, its just a turnaround sequence of whatever garbage the recommended button says fits the theme as its actually only looking for one theme type despite the challenge having 4 or something. Its so very soulless after the one hundredth watch pretty fabric walk and turn.\n\nCo-op is lame because the sea of stars if like a golden wasteland, its pretty to look at then thats it. Theres like some challenge obstacle courses for co-op like the trials but you really just got to get lucky with the people online. As far as functionally its just working, not good not bad, just lame and shallow outside of pictures. 9 times outa 10 you'll get other people who either dont want to do co-op stuff or can't for technically reasons. The new mini game is not for me, its like music tiles if the music times taps were off beat and had no rhythm, the keys dont match the song and thats just jarring to me. I also just suck at them so take that bit as you will.\n\nI had alot of fun with it starting out but then everything just slogged together. Once you finish the main story, any npc you thought was interest is essentially just a recap \"heres what happened after you did this this\" button. You are just waiting it out til the next update or taking outfit pictures, which is not a thing im super into, so im just left thinking how much potential different plot points had or grinding an hour or two for materials then getting off. For example, I really liked the abandoned queens place and the little story with her sister, you never find out if she was actually a tyrant or not. The only thing you get is 'aw poor queen she liked her sister' which is fine but what about everything else? Most the games 'conflicts' are just aw this person wasn't really evil and now were going to give you an absurdly long monologue on why you should be nice or why grief is sad etc, and a boss fight with a design cooler than its moves. This game is like a fancy decorated cake but the inside is styrofoam. Im not gonna lie tho, the newest season seems promising, theres a 'farewell' type quest, and they added some expanded lore to queen philomia that shouldve been there with her event, and they have npc's with a slightly not white skintone and something about a new area itzaland (its a land lol). We'll see.",

      "review": "*This review will be about my experience with Infinity Nikki on Steam Deck.*\n\nLove this game and I've been playing it on my bf's PC and on mobile (iOS) since launch almost everyday. The open-world and dress-up/styling aspects are so fun. There is much to do and explore. Not a big fan of the puzzles but they are somewhat manageable and most don't have direct effect on the gameplay. I try to log in everyday to do the dailies on mobile. They improved the performance on mobile over time, for which I am grateful. There are far less crashing. I can even manage to do some quests, yet for the dungeon/puzzle parts I prefer PC. \n\nI was very happy when they announced this game will be on Steam as I can play it on the Deck without complicated download/installation processes. However, it has been a huge let down. Since its launch on Steam, for the Steam Deck part at least, they haven't improved the performance of the game. Constant crashes, way to long loading screens, overheating the Deck and so on. I don't expect the best graphics or performance like its on PC (with another launcher I am currently using) when I am playing it on the Deck, I just want to play it more than 15 mins without it crashing or stucking on a loading screen. If it's possible for some mobile devices and tablets, I think Infold can improve this game's performance on the Deck as well esp for a game that they've been advertised as 'cozy.' Unfortunately, at this stage, I cannot recommend playing this game on the Deck via Steam.\n\nIf you have any suggestions to improve this game's performance on the Deck, feel free to comment and I'll be very happy to try them!",

      "review": "After playing this game consistently through every version patch since this games release, unfortunately the performance has only decreased. It has become nearly unplayable with the game taking 10-20 minutes to launch every time you open it, this is because they frequently patch bugs but you must restart the entire client every time it does this. The game launcher has recently introduced a new issue where it's process does not stop properly so you may be forced to restart your PC just to play the game. I won't even get into the large number of in game bugs, there are too many to talk about. \n\nThere have been has been no new major region additions since launch but there have been new maps added (just singular islands). Events have been mostly the same recycled content since launch as well with little variety. The patch that I am writing this review in introduced the housing system - it is absolutely terrible. You must collect hundreds of materials which cannot be auto-farmed/completed quickly as far as I am aware to make even a single chair. There are additional wait times on creating the furniture, new currencies and battlepasses tied to it as well. \n\nAs the main feature of the game is dress up, I will definitely give credit where it is due - the fabric textures and clothing look stunning and have been the reason I kept playing. There are definitely significant problems though and most of that is the lack of \"normal\" clothing items and the dyeing system. Certain clothing items can have their colour changed but the problem behind this is that most colours are locked behind owning duplicates, AKA. A paywall. Not to mention the separate currency with several tiers of rarity that have to be used to unlock a small array of colours - this has to be done for every single item of clothing. A lot of the clothing pieces are dresses, it's quite hard to create any non-feminine outfit. This problem can definitely be remedied, the best patch they did was the Danqing update which gave us a lot of Chinese inspired outfits and a few more gender neutral / masculine options but for the most part, clothing items are almost exclusively European / western style clothes with little variety. \n\nTLDR: The clothing and dress-up system is pretty good but you'll definitely feel that it's lacklustre and you cant create a whole lot of outfits because you'll be outright lacking in clothing or you just can't dye it the colour you want. Everything else in the game feels pretty terrible.",
