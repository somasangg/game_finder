      "review": "I've enjoyed hundreds of hours of Giant's FS games over the years and they keep improving, and FS25 is no different. The latest update introduces a gorgeous new map and fishing mechanics but even without that optional DLC the core game is excellent, add on some free maps like Silverrun Forest and there are alot of options for different gameplay styles available\n\nDo you like large projects that require huge amounts of resources to complete, that changes as you contribute to it, and is visually updated - then FS's \"contruction projects\", an optional feature (that can be ignored if you just want to \"farm\") add that aspect, and boy it's so much fun\n\nIf you enjoy the process of building a \"business\" from the ground up that is here too - start small (even give yourself some debt to clear from the get go) and build up over in-game years until you own factories, production lines, land and bigger machines as you aim for that \"$10,000,000 in the bank\" achievement\n\nWant to jump straight to a big farm with everything and just plow the fields? Go ahead, start off with tons of cash and go big off the bat, even add on the optional \"Precision Farming\" mod for extra realism if that's your thing - or if you like the realism on the lower end there are options to turn it all off, so no weeds, lime, plowing etc. Everyone is catered for\n\nSpeaking of mods - well this has plenty, to put it mildly. Are they essential / required? Nope. Do they enhance the game? For sure! Mod support is even part of the main menu, no external software required, and they don't break achievements. There are websites dedicated to them and Giants even supply the software on their website so you can start making your own\n\nWhat's missing? Hmm, maybe some of the repairing & restoration gameplay in Farmer's Dynasty? But one could argue even that is kinda there with it's construction projects...\n\nOverall it's a very polished high quality game (is \"game\" the right word?) and I've enjoyed every moment of it - never had any issues with performance, nor has it crashed, nor have I experienced any bugs. If that doesn't qualify as an overall positive experience, I don't know what does",

I'm a city girl who grew up across the street from an automotive plant, and know very little of farming.  I mean, I understood that plants are farmed from the land and that follows seasons, and that herds of animals are kept for meat, wool (sheep), eggs (chickens), and so on.  But other than that... not much, lol. \n\nFor someone like me who has never been involved in the rural, agricultural way of life, it's a STEEP learning curve.\n\nIn order to build up some basic background knowledge in the subject, I've resorted to leaving my \"legit\" playthrough for another future time and just on learning how things work on farms.  I've googled how to activate the console commands/unlimited money to make that a non-issue, and am just taking lots of contracts out and using the \"lease equipment\" option on them, then resorting to looking things up on the Internet when I get stuck.  I'm learning a ton about the different kinds of equipment and different tasks people do around farms.  \n\nIf anyone else loves sandbox games but is being hamstrung by a complete lack of agricultural knowledge, that might help you.  It's helping me, at least.",

So I waited around for the videos to start coming out to explain how it would work. I'm not very happy about how the fishing mechanic works so I probably won't buy the expansion. But I do like the core game and it seems to run pretty well. I've only had one crash so far. For me that's pretty good. So I'll keep playing.

      "review": "[b]Originality[/b]\n Giants' studio is one of the first companies to make such a precise game around the farming world as most competitors have basic farming functionality as an addition to the main game but this is where this game is different, instead of farming being a small mini game inside of the main game as a bit of padding to the main story this game is all about farming with a countless amount of machines and ways to play the game. This is the only game that I willingly purchase at release, regardless of their previous game, because unlike EA with their football/soccer games, this game always evolves drastically from its previous release. \n\n[b]Consistency/Fun[/b] \nI find this game drastically enjoyable and that is granted through the countless ways of playing from doing basic contracts at the start with nothing and building up to a farming empire via the use of the 23 different crops for a game revolving around a field or using greenhouses and being able to grow 10 different plants in a small form factor which will require a tedious amount of forklift usage or if you don’t like the business management part you can also start out with millions and play this game as you would Minecraft in creative. There are many ways of playing this game, which just makes the game very re-playable and enjoyable in the long term. \n\n[b]Previous Games[/b]\nThis is an ongoing series of games set in the farming world; their previous PC, Xbox and PS game was Farming Simulator 22. \n\n[b]Difficulty[/b]\nThis game is not the easiest to adjust to; it may require a lot of extensive research on the game’s mechanics and even research on real-life farming. Ideally, if you have never played a game from this franchise (or farmed in real life), it would be best to play with a friend who has because there are many mechanics that people who haven’t invested hundreds of thousands of hours into this game won’t be familiar with, and all this leads to is premature quitting. Gameplay - Farming Simulator 25 has no ending. This is a crucial thing to remember: you must be creative and constantly set goals for yourself, which shouldn’t be too hard, as there is always a different you can do to increase profits. Replay value - Even though this game never ends, you may want a new start. The best part of this game is the beginning, where you must strategize every single one of your moves, and luckily, starting fresh isn’t annoying because of the countless crops, production chains, farming methods, and animals you can tend to. \n\n[b]Modability[/b]\nFarming simulator has always and will always have a strong modding community, and even Giants Software makes mods for the community, such as their precise farming mod, which makes the game even harder and even more realistic. Modding is available in the vanilla version of the game on both PC and console, but PC does have a larger array of mods compared to console as they can run more extensive code and download mods from the internet, whereas console is locked to the in-game mod menu which in my option is more than enough already, it always guarantees greater safety for the user. \n\n[b]Storage Capacity Required[/b]\n≈ 45GB\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\nThis game has the best graphics compared to their older games, but if you like hyper-realistic, breath-taking graphics, then the graphics could be better. The attention to detail with environmental factors is extremely impressive as seen with vehicles getting stuck in mud, rain system which isn't only graphical and the ground deformations due to different vehicles and different weight makes the game so much more immersive and enjoyable. The environmental aspects isn’t surprising given that the whole game's point is sowing and harvesting. \n\n[b]Stability[/b] \nThis game is currently quite stable without any game-breaking bugs that the average user will experience but bugs do pop up here and there even in normal gameplay so be beware and report any bugs to https://feedback.giants-software.com/login_page.php. \n\n[b]Multiplayer[/b]\nThe online aspect works flawlessly but the only downside is for the average user who wants to set up a 24 hour home server they will not be able to set up a server on a separate machine such as a raspberry pi as the game for one forces the owner of the server to buy two copies of the game + DLCs - one for the server and the other for themselves as a client - and another issue is that the game doesn’t offer a stable linux server file meaning they will have to have a strong enough computer to have the game running with graphics and an active session.\n\n[b]Overall[/b]\nI love this game and all of their previous games and therefore would definitely recommend this game to anyone interested.",

Used vehicle market is fun and often gives amazing deals.\r\n\r\nGraphics & Performance\r\n\r\nHuge improvement from FS22.\r\nBetter lighting, cleaner shadows, more realistic terrain, and generally smoother gameplay.\r\nRuns well even on mid-range laptops like RTX 3050 Ti once you tune settings.\r\n\r\nNew Features\r\n\r\nBetter AI workers\r\n\r\nImproved field management\r\n\r\nMore production chains\r\n\r\nSmooth BGA and silage workflows\r\n\r\nPoplar and forestry feel more rewarding\r\n\r\nCrop textures and animations upgraded\r\n\r\nWhat Could Be Better\r\n\r\nAI still gets confused in weird-shaped fields\r\n\r\nSome performance dips on ultra settings\r\n\r\nA few tools and systems need balancing\r\n\r\nMods will make the game even better later\r\n\r\nFinal Verdict\r\n\r\nIf you love farming, building, expanding, and managing a big operation with hundreds of machines, FS25 is absolutely worth it.\r\nIt’s addictive, relaxing, and extremely satisfying once your farm takes off.\r\n\r\n9/10 — The best Farming Simulator yet.",

I have to say the Terrafarm works so much better in FS25.. Maps are cool. BUT, i can see it will take some time before we get too see all the great MODs modders made in fs22, BUT so far, there is atleast a good option for MINING,LOGGING,TERRAFARM MODS.. Enough to keep busy a while.. The game itself is pretty simple and similar to the fs22 format.. and actually has a few mor new cool features..  Only complaint, Is hiring AI workers, They sort of drive all over the fields. there is a way too adjust the ai workers, but i did not get that far.. Also the terafarm has some differnces, but is not bad.. ATLEAST every TF Mod ive tried works rite away.. \r\nIMHO, I would wait till its on sale a bit, And if your playing and looking for as many mods as possible, give it another few months, till lots of old style cool mods from fs22 can get transfered.. \r\n\r\ni do like how there are lots more types of crops. maps, locations.. \r\nI have yet too try the fishing\" addon, Im hoping the add on and mods will let us use boats and mods related too water better.. And it would be pretty awesom too have some basic machines too fly, Like crop sprayer planes or choppers, and airfields may?.. just a thought.. \r\n\r\ni wish they would ad a garbage dump lol, for dumpingand removing garbage with rol off containers, and garbage trucks, and even scrap yards, etc..\r\nbut, other then that, theres lots of cool new things too farm,harvest, and or stuff to make and sell..",

      "review": "Farming Simulator 2025 has become one of my most played titles this year, and despite its early shortcomings I still actively enjoy it. At launch the performance issues were hard to ignore, with fps drops and shader stutter occurring frequently. Thankfully the game has improved over time and now runs noticeably smoother.\n\nGraphically the game is undeniably modest. As a simulation focused on repetitive fieldwork, I personally do not see any real value in features like ray tracing. When you are harvesting soybeans for the fourteenth time on the same field, visual effects matter far less than clear visibility and a stable framerate.\n\nLogging remains a mixed experience. Using a mouse makes the controls feel clunky and awkward, but with a joystick or controller the activity becomes surprisingly smooth and enjoyable. If you plan to engage in logging regularly, a controller is almost essential.\n\nOne of the most disappointing additions for me was the new extreme weather system. It was heavily advertised but ultimately underdelivers, as storms mostly just damage crops without offering anything visually impressive or mechanically interesting. It feels like wasted potential for a more dynamic challenge.\n\nWorker behavior, however, has improved significantly from previous entries. You can fine tune their settings and they now operate far more logically in fieldwork. Being able to set them to complete the headland first and then finish the inner field makes automated tasks much more reliable and efficient.\n\nAnother pleasant addition is the set of large construction projects included in the original maps. These multi stage builds can be completed by delivering the required materials and serve as great long term goals for each savegame. They add a sense of progression beyond simple farming routines and make the world feel more alive.\n\nContent wise the game launched a bit light, but Giants has strengthened it with several high quality official mods available for free on the in game Modhub. These updates make the game feel more complete and show consistent developer support.\n\nThe modding community deserves enormous praise. There are countless maps and game changing mods that add both depth and realism. I strongly recommend financial overhaul mods that introduce proper interest rates and annuity loans, as well as mods that rebalance machinery wear to prevent a situation where an old combine becomes scrap metal after harvesting a single small field. These mods elevate the experience and make long term progression far more believable.\n\nPersonally I spend a lot of time on the Chadlington map, recognizable from Clarkson’s Farm. Its tight village layout brings its own challenges and keeps everyday tasks interesting. Like many simulation games, Farming Simulator 2025 is at its best when played with friends or when you simply want to unwind and think about something other than your day job.\n\nOverall Farming Simulator 2025 is a solid and continuously improving entry in the series. With community mods it becomes a deep, flexible and highly enjoyable farming experience that I can easily recommend.",

It doesn’t try to reinvent anything, but it definitely feels more polished and easier to get into if you’ve enjoyed the older games.\r\n\r\nThe new Highlands Fishing Expansion is a nice change of pace. You get a fresh map, some new crops, and the whole aquaculture system, which adds something different to focus on besides the standard fieldwork. It’s not a massive overhaul, but it brings enough variety to keep things feeling new.\r\n\r\nMods are where the game really shines. FS25 is already solid, but with mods it can feel like a totally different experience. The community adds everything: custom maps, new vehicles, realism tweaks, graphical upgrades, production chains, and more. If you’re willing to explore the mod hub or third-party sites, you can tailor the game to exactly how you want to play.\r\n\r\nOverall, Farming Simulator 25 comes across as a comfortable and improved version of the series. The DLC adds some fun extras, and the modding scene keeps the game exciting long after the base content. It’s not a groundbreaking sequel, but it’s easily the most flexible and enjoyable entry so far.",

B. dynamische Böden oder allgemein etwas, das das Gameplay grundlegend weiterentwickelt. Hoffe, dass da in Zukunft noch was kommt.\n\nMultiplayer dagegen ist eher durchwachsen. Sobald mehrere Leute auf dem Server sind, wird’s  von Zeit zu Zeit etwas laggy. Kann am Server liegen (Nitrado?), aber Spaß macht’s so nicht wirklich. Auch die Ladezeiten könnten insgesamt etwas kürzer sein.\n\nTrotzdem: Wer LS mag, bekommt hier ein richtig gutes Spiel – nur im Multiplayer sollte man aktuell nicht zu viel erwarten.",

The graphics are so good that I genuinely apologized to a cow after driving a $300,000 tractor straight through her field like a drunk lawnmower.\r\nThe gameplay is pure chaos in slow motion. You think, “Oh cool, I’ll do a little farming,” and suddenly it’s 3 a.m., half your fields are crooked, your tractor is upside down in a ditch, and you’ve somehow leased five machines you can’t afford.\r\nMultiplayer is even worse. Invite your friends and watch them immediately sprint toward the nearest expensive equipment and flip it. Someone always becomes the “accidental arsonist” even though the game doesn’t have fire.\r\nAlso, shoutout to the economy system: I sell 10 tons of wheat and make like $12. I sneeze too hard and vehicle repair costs $40,000. Truly realistic.\r\nAnimals are great though. Cows stare at you like they’re judging your life choices. Chickens roam around like they own the property. And horses? Don’t even get me started. I rode one directly into a fence for 30 seconds and the game praised me for “training.”\r\nOverall: Farming Simulator 25 turns normal people into sleep-deprived crop addicts. 10/10 would crash my tractor into a barn again.",

This is a basic necessity for realism.\n- NPCs (IMO, creepy as heck. I much rather liked the 2d portraits from FS22 in the contracts panel)\n- UI is obviously different from FS22 that may need getting used to, but there was nothing bad with the previous UI style for the store & placing down buildings.\n- No 3rd POV interaction with vehicles and trailers, it is still automatic touch-of-a-button, not a big issue but doesn't score realism points.\n- Re-used models, especially for animals (you'd think being a new game, you'd get new models for stuff)\n\nConclusion:\nIMO if the pros from FS25 had been added to FS22, it would've been a near perfect game. I wouldn't pay full price for FS25, especially since modders have gone to lengths to make FS22 more complete with the additions that FS25 included.

Almost nothing in the world reacts to light properly, the trees don’t move, the foliage is dead, and the whole map feels static and flat. It’s not “stylized,” it’s just outdated.\n\nThe worst part?\nMost of the Steam screenshots look way better than the actual game. They’re heavily edited, downsampled, captured in a debug mode or simply not representative of normal gameplay. Once you play it yourself, everything looks overexposed, washed out, and with zero atmosphere.\n\nEven with ReShade you can’t fix the core issues, because the engine doesn’t support any modern features. No raytracing, no GI, no proper sky lighting, no volumetric shadows, nothing. Other simulators moved forward (UE4, UE5, HDRP, etc.), but FS25 still uses DX11 and old screen-space tricks that break with FOV or camera movement.\n\nThe trees are a perfect example:\nNo proper animation, no believable lighting, no depth, no softness, no scattering. They look almost the same as in FS15. And when the environment looks dead, the whole game feels dead.\n\nFS25 plays fine, but visually it’s extremely outdated.\nIf you expect modern graphics in 2025, you will be disappointed.\n\nDon't forget the wood, it's unplayable.",

Also after 5 years of playing this game they still haven't figured out how to fix the overall gameplay for example the AI in this game is still the same as FS 15. \n\nExamples are when hiring the AI farmers to work on your field, the devs still haven't fixed the issue where they decide to go to the middle of the field or somewhere else and ruin the look overall field itself. Also sometimes they stop mid-work even though the fields are still full and not finished. The NPC and overall look and feel of the world feel very outdated and, honestly, depressing. It still feels empty and I thought the devs would have figured out by now and made the overall look and feel of the map more alive and active. We are in 2025 and the game feels and plays the same. \n\nLook, regardless of what I said and me not recommending this version of the FS game I still love FS and this game is the sole reason why I've been addicted to games like FS.

I enjoyed the laid back ability to farm and not worry about to much. It was a great game when I had some free time, but didn't want to make a lot of noise. \n\nI enjoyed it when they made a mod hub in the game, so I didn't have to worry about going to 18 different sights and hoping I clicked on the right button to download the mod instead of an ad (looking at you modhub). It allowed you to customize the game the way you wanted based on what was available there. That being said, I am very displeased with the amount of mods and the sheer number of categories. It makes it challenging to even find where to look for a mod that you didn't know you were hoping for. \n\nThe amount of things I have to turn off now is really annoying. I don't want to mess with weeds, lime, stones, rolling, tilling, plowing, etc... Good lord it would take you HOURS just to go from harvested to planted again. I prefer playing back on 19 because I didn't have so much to do (or turn off) just to farm. \n\nRunning has been made really weird... jumping stops all speed and forward momentum and changing direction makes it feel like you are skating on ice with how you just kind of float around",

However, as an absolute beginner, I was very confused, if not overwhelmed, pretty much instantly.\n\nThe game lets you into a large sandbox where you are able to get acquainted with all the different tools, machines, fertilizers, and agricultural terms that the tutorial does not explain at all. There are different tools that are very similar in appearance, items with the same specifications but different names, and a lot of authentic agricultural terms that are simply not known to the majority of people. The game is not very helpful at all in teaching the player what the various things are that are not real-world farming.\n\nYou soon find yourself surrounded by seasons, crop calendars, various soil treatments, weeds, lime, PH, and different tillage tools, and left trying to comprehend the differences between cultivators, plows, mulch, power harrows, direct seeders, subsoilers, sprayers, spreaders, etc. It is not user-friendly, and as a newbie, it seems to be an unnecessarily complicated experience.\n\nAlso, there is not any real development, objectives, or a feeling of going in the right direction. If you are the kind of gamer who likes to have a clear path to follow or tech progression, then Farming Simulator would feel very dull to you. It is practically an open-to-air sandbox with no directions or significant goals, which might be fun if you are already acquainted with the whole process, but not if you are a lone learner.\n\nI completely understand the reason for the long-time fans to love the franchise. If you have been playing FS for several years or if you are acquainted with real-life farming machines, then everything seems to be in sync. But for a novice looking for structure, progression, or intuitive systems, the experience is confusing, overwhelming, and not very fun at all.",

For something calling itself a simulator, it really doesn’t behave like one.\n\nMissing depth\nWe’re in 2025 and there are still no proper pesticides, plant diseases, or any real depth to crop management. Fields feel way too clean and simple.

As i work in a seasonal field, during the work months, i may get an hour or two a night or two a week to play, and sitting here and sleeping 3-8 times to make a crop grow, after how long it takes to work the fields is bullshit.

I had to use 2 different video guides due to vehicles getting stuck and refusing to connect equipment in the 3 hours I played. there's only 3 maps so get use to playing in the uk or eastern europe; the midwest usa map is dlc content but somehow everyone speaks with an american accent in the base game.\n\noverall this is a downgrade from the previous farming sim game I played ('22) but I wouldn't recommend that either and in the past 3 years of development they are somehow getting worse. this game is maybe worth $3 if I'm being generous.",

Almost nothing in the world reacts to light properly, the trees don’t move, the foliage is dead, and the whole map feels static and flat. It’s not “stylized,” it’s just outdated.\r\n\r\nThe worst part?\r\nMost of the Steam screenshots look way better than the actual game. They’re heavily edited, downsampled, captured in a debug mode or simply not representative of normal gameplay. Once you play it yourself, everything looks overexposed, washed out, and with zero atmosphere.\r\n\r\nEven with ReShade you can’t fix the core issues, because the engine doesn’t support any modern features. No raytracing, no GI, no proper sky lighting, no volumetric shadows, nothing. Other simulators moved forward (UE4, UE5, HDRP, etc.), but FS25 still uses DX11 and old screen-space tricks that break with FOV or camera movement.\r\n\r\nThe trees are a perfect example:\r\nNo proper animation, no believable lighting, no depth, no softness, no scattering. They look almost the same as in FS15. And when the environment looks dead, the whole game feels dead.\r\n\r\nFS25 plays fine, but visually it’s extremely outdated.\r\nIf you expect modern graphics in 2025, you will be disappointed.\r\n\r\nDon't forget the wood, it's unplayable.

This is a basic necessity for realism.\n- NPCs (IMO, creepy as heck. I much rather liked the 2d portraits from FS22 in the contracts panel)\n- UI is obviously different from FS22 that may need getting used to, but there was nothing bad with the previous UI style for the store & placing down buildings.\n- No 3rd POV interaction with vehicles and trailers, it is still automatic touch-of-a-button, not a big issue but doesn't score realism points.\n- Re-used models, especially for animals (you'd think being a new game, you'd get new models for stuff)\n\nConclusion:\nIMO if the pros from FS25 had been added to FS22, it would've been a near perfect game. I wouldn't pay full price for FS25, especially since modders have gone to lengths to make FS22 more complete with the additions that FS25 included.
