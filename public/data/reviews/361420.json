Occasional but frustrating bugs, unstable multiplayer (as we are currently experiencing after an update), and limited creative capacity. For some, it feels like a stink on a game that is just -this- close to being a favorite. \n\nBut, what keeps people coming back is the laid back, at-your-own pace adventuring with satisfying moments and a sense of progression that never feels unbearably slow. It's a lovely palette cleanser as compared to the complex and intensive games that seem to have become the norm. It scratches an itch few games can reach, and I'd recommend it as a relaxed multiplayer that can result in some funny but unexpected moments.",

      "review": "What to say.. This game is just very chill, cozy and nostalgic at this point for me. I am really happy to see that the developers still do add new things to the game so as I revisited the game recently, there was a ton of new things :).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHere is a short summary for those who don't wanna read whole review:\n\nAstroneer is a cozy, chill sandbox game with intuitive mechanics, beautiful visuals, and a relaxing soundtrack. Great solo, even better with friends. Gameplay is easy and satisfying, though it can get a bit grindy later on. Runs well on decent hardware. Story is minimal, but not really the focus. Worth buying on sale. Solid 9/10 for me.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere is what I would say about different aspects of the game:\n\n♦ Gameplay ♦\nI enjoy most of the game mechanics, they are mostly intuitive and easy to learn. Game is very chill, I play solo, but I feel like it may be a lot more fun to play with friends, you just need good friend or two, who are willing to work on your basement and automation system. Travel on the planets and digging into the cores of the planets should be easier and more fun with some friends as well, but overall, you are good to go at solo as well. Teraforming in this game is really satisfying.\n\n♦ Graphics ♦\nVisuals are simple, but very beautiful. Art style is original and memorable. I just love how materials are represented and how enviroment in this game looks.\n\n♦ Audio ♦\nCalm and cozy soundtrack, cute sound effects of your astroneer guy, but also \"scared the sh*t out of me\" sound of one specific plant which attacks you from far by farting on you. \n\n♦ PC Requirements ♦\nI would say, that you definitely need a decent PC to avoid lagging and low FPS, but you don't need Nasa computer to avoid potato graphic's settings. My old AMD Radeon RX 580 Series runs this game on high settings smoothly.\n\n♦ Difficulty ♦\nThis is chill game. It's much easier than many other survival/management games. As mentioned before, mechanics are easy to learn and you can progress pretty quickly. It can just become maybe a bit grindy in some stage of the game if you wanna complete the \"story\" or just hunt achievements.\n\n♦ Story ♦\nI said \"story\", and not story, because there actually is some sort of lore in the game, but this is really not very important part of this game. It's more of a background/context building, than playing a story. You have some missions to fullfill, but aside of that, you explore, harvest resources, make your basement bigger and cooler, 3D print some buggy and ride over the planet. But most of the time, you don't care about the story, I can imagine, that some folks don't worry about it at all.\n\n♦ Price ♦\nI would say, that full price is a bit too much for this game. I value the hard work of the developers, but for 30Euros, I can imagine some more complex games, this is just a sandbox where you can 3D print a rocket and visit 7 planets in total. I bought this game on sale, and would definitely recommend to do so to anybody, at least down to 20Euros, but in the end it's up to you and your financial options.\n\n♦ Bugs ♦\nIn the past, I experienced some crashes because of the big amount of tethers in my game, but when I played recently, I didn't noticed any bugs so kudos for developers :)\n\nIf I would have to rate the game on scale 0-10.. \n\nI would say, for me it's 9/10. \n\nMy only personal issue is that moment when you find yourself doing something repeatidly for too long just to grind some XP or specific resource. But overall, this game just have it's place in my ♥",

Растения? Да, эти милые зелёные штуки, которые выглядят как декор из магазина для домохозяек — на самом деле живые мины. Газовые облака? Вполне дружелюбные, если ты любишь умирать как персонаж в дешёвом триллере. Гравитация? Она просто ждёт, когда ты наступишь не туда, чтобы выдать тебе бесплатный урок полётов… с посадкой лицом вниз.\r\n\r\nА кислород? Да это вообще лучший друг, который превращается в маньяка-убийцу, стоит тебе отвлечься на секунду. Не следишь — и всё, уже валяешься на поверхности планеты, разлегся как художественный натюрморт «Провал экспедиции №42».\r\n\r\nТранспорт в игре — отдельная форма пытки. Каждая машина будто создана инженером, который всю жизнь мечтал только об одном — чтобы ты никогда не вернулся домой. Переворачивается, закапывается, улетает, как будто в ней встроен режим «Хаос».\r\n\r\nНо самое страшное в этой игре — это то, что ты продолжаешь играть. Тебя убили? Ладно. Потерял половину ресурсов в дыре размером с твой IQ в момент прыжка? Нормально. Полтора часа строил базу, и её сдуло твоей же кривой логистикой? Бывает.\r\n\r\nИтог: 10/10. Прекрасная игра. Ненавижу. Засасывает как чёрная дыра, только чёрная дыра хотя бы не делает вид, что она милая.",

It's worth the price although obviously you shoul try and pick it up on sale if you can (They might have changed the price since I bought it idk).

The only good reason to have an intermediary currency is if you could earn it in game. And you can't. Its just scummy practices that you hate to see a company take.

The progression is poorly paces, and even though you make factories, there isn't a good reason to automate production. Even if there was, there is no way of getting unlimited resources. You have to mine pretty much all of the metals you need for advanced materials.\n\nExploration is very limited. You need to be connected to an air supply or have oxygen tanks in your inventory, so the exploration feels like short runs where you desperately try to find the resource you are looking for before you have to go back to base to get more tethers or clear up your inventory. This problem still exists even with vehicles because vehicles have a very limited inventory space and you still need tethers to go out to explore.\n\nI can see why people like this game, but the progression is poorly paced and there is no way to build pretty buildings, so not much for me to enjoy.",

Joined player's vehicles would suck into the soil and stop moving or even textures won't load all together in time. All player's hoverboards would periodically stuck in place and stop moving. And now we come to the biggest recent disappointment - the Megatech DLC with it's key feature mostly not working and if it is working with additional tweaking it will horribly misbehave. I really like the idea of this DLC and the scale but what I do not like is to pay the cost and get the bunch of irritating bugs instead of fun family gameplay. So this is it - I would not recommend to buy this game until all the bugs in Megatech will get fixed.

The game makes it incredibly hard (for some reason) to understand what (and how) to do stuff in the game. \n\nThere are other major issues that seriously frustrated my playing experience: \n\n1. The crafting interface is clunky and not intuitive, and not knowing how to unlock stuff. \n\n2. There are some random progression quests that show up, with no clear path on how to get there. For example, I had to unlock something for which I needed a smelter. There was no information in the game on how to do that - this was not in any of the printers. I wasn't going to Google this because that is not really how I like to play. \n\n3. There is no way to traverse the planet other than tethering long distances which I found was really silly in such a massive landscape. I really wanted to enjoy the game, but the devs have made it impossible to like it.\n\n4. What's the point of such a massive compass right in the middle of the screen? This could have easily been a minimap.\n\n5. Most importantly, I didn't find anything in the game sucking me in - there is no sense of curiousness imparted to the player by the game and even exploration is made miserable because of tethering.\n\nMaybe I'm spoilt by No Man's Sky - but it had a way of keeping me hooked in the game unlike Astroneer.\n\nMaybe I'm too dumb for the game, I don't know, but I don't think I've ever been frustrated with a video game as much as I was with Astroneer.\n\nThe problem with recommending the game is that you only realize these things after having bought and having started to play. If you can look past all this, and if you don't mind using Google to find how to do stuff, then this game is fine I guess. Otherwise, it is a hard no from me.",

That's fine.  But then some stuff says 'small printer' but is actually printed from the back pack.  What?\n\n- The mining/digging down mechanic felt haphazard.  Difficult to judge angles and when you are about to drop further than you can jump back up.  Wouldn't matter if you weren't on an oxygen clock.

I really dislike that.... they only gave me like 150 points in the store im not goin to buy outfits even when i see something i like, theres not point to that.",

I've had this game since Dec 2016 and in many ways it has definitely improved but there is still jarring issues that should've been resolved pre-official release. Instead there's DLC before stable physics, there's MTX before consistent collision detection.\n\nMore bugs...Playing on server with friends cannot land on Novus if someone is already on the planet, your game will crash and put you to the main menu. Trying to rejoin the game again just freezes all the buttons in the main menu. \n\nTwo people launching rockets at the same time is enough to crash servers",
