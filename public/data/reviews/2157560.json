      "review": "[h1] Better Upgrade and 2nd Attempt from Previous Game [/h1] \r\n\r\nGranblue Fantasy Versus Rising is the perfect game for me, and I think it’s great for anyone who wants to play an anime fighter (or fighting game in general) without being overwhelmed by long combos or high execution requirements.\r\n\r\nIt plays fast without sacrificing clarity. Even though it uses modern fighting game features like auto-combos and special move shortcuts, it’s not dumbed down at all — there’s still plenty of depth.\r\n\r\n[h2] Character Roster [/h2] \r\nRight now there are 38 playable characters, with one more on the way. (Season 3 hasn’t been announced yet, so we’ll see.) Every character feels distinct, so you can easily find an archetype that fits your playstyle. Some characters even come with extra gimmicks that make them stand out more.\r\n\r\n[h2] Online Experience [/h2] \r\nMatchmaking has been fine for me so far. I’m playing from Indonesia (SEA) with a so-so internet provider, and I can still get stable matches against players from Japan and China. Disclaimer: I use a cable connection — and you should too.\r\n\r\nThe playerbase is still active enough that you can find online matches without long queue times. And since the game has crossplay, the actual number of players is bigger than what SteamDB shows.\r\n\r\n[h2] Single Player Content [/h2]\r\nThere's Story Mode, Arcade Mode, and Survival Mode (where you get random power-up bonuses every 5 rounds). That’s already enough for a proper single-player experience.\r\n\r\nIs the story only for Granblue Fantasy fans? Not really. Newcomers can still enjoy it because the game includes glossaries and character bios. The cast is lovable enough that you won’t feel alienated or lost.\r\n\r\n[h2] Art Style & Soundtrack [/h2]\r\nThe art direction is chef’s kiss 🤌 and the soundtrack goes hard. Every character has a theme that fits their personality and vibe, and almost all of them are bangers.\r\n\r\n[h2] Price & Monetization [/h2]\r\nI suggest to grab the Deluxe Edition when it’s on sale (usually around 60% off). You’ll get the base game plus Deluxe Character Pass 1, which already unlocks about 87% of the roster. Most of the other DLC aside from Character Pass 2 — are cosmetics only and is purely optional.\r\n\r\nThere is also seasonal Battle Pass, which also unlocks more cosmetics contents. [b] Do note that with recent updates, some battle pass exclusives item (costumes, weapon skins, exclusive colors) will be sold as separate DLC at later date. [/b] So less FOMO contents I guess?\r\n\r\nIf you’re still unsure, there’s also a free-to-play version. It limits you to 4 rotating characters and locks most modes outside of online lobbies, but it’s enough to test the waters.\r\n\r\n[h2] Overall [/h2]\r\nThis game is fun for both casual players and competitive ones. Like I said earlier, every character is charming in their own way, so you’ll definitely find someone to love — whether that’s for their design, gameplay, personality, or the whole package.\r\n\r\n[b] Now go give Cygames your money so we can get Season 3!

I regret that I waited so long now after playing it, but I will say that I got the deluxe edition on sale, which is a fantastic value for what you get for that price. I would recommend getting it on that sale, with that edition, as you get a jump start with a lot of the extra content.\n\nSpeaking of the extra content that you could pay money for, you don't have to buy anything. If you're invested enough to put the time in, you can buy the costumes, character colors, and even the DLC characters with an in game currency called ruppee I believe it was. You can gain these by completing daily and weekly missions. When you start, you will have a nice handful to spend. I would find your character, deck them out a little bit, and go from there. I wish a lot more games did this, allow you to pay with your wallet, or your time, because both are valuable. I really like that and the game gets huge points for it.\n\nThis is a pro and a con for me, but the battle system is fairly simple with the basic short auto combo that leads to options. I get that it's easy to get into for beginners, but i've always hated mashing the same button for little auto combos. I much prefer chaining attacks from light, to medium, to heavy ect. But it is fun, and it does work well. You get a dash in attack with light, medium, and heavy, and when you've closed the gap, and are in their face, then the auto combo system takes effect, generally 3 hits with whatever given button, and properties of those attacks changing slightly dependent upon which you pushed. If you push forward and medium, your third hit will be a low, forward and heavy will be a overhead. This is the foundation upon which you will chain moves and find combos. It's simple, and effective, just slightly limited and repetitive. \n\nThe characters play very different from one another, and the roster is quite sizable, and very enjoyable. One of the reasons I put this game on the back burner for so long is that I always kind of felt the characters were over designed, but the more I played, the more it felt just right. The character models and animations are drop dead gorgeous to look at. The super animations are fantastic, exciting, and have a lot of impact and weight. I think the intro and outro animations are spot on perfect. Your intro animation changes dependent of if you are on the player one or two side, with unique dialog between all characters dependent upon which side you started on. And you have two outro animations, your first if you win without using your ultimate super, and the other plays if you did win with your ultimate. Always love games that do this, and take full advantage of the voice actors, which all do a great job here, both in japanese, and in english. \n\nThere are enough modes to keep me statisfied, but I do wish story mode let you spend time with other characters, and I do wish Arcade mode at least gave you proper character endings. It does not and that is always a huge let down to me. \n\nAll and all though I would whole heartedly recommend this fighting game to anybody. It's a joy to play with responsive controls and dripping with style and quality. It's pretty simple, but fast paced, fun, and it does take skill. It has a great training mode to get you into the mechanics on offer. If I remember right, at the time of this review, the deluxe edition is on sale until Oct. 20th 2025, and I would say, if it's been sitting on your wishlist for a while now like it was on mine, now is the time to grab it.",

Sure, some people are going to complain about certain ones but I think most any fighting game veteran should easily be able to find a handful of characters they enjoy and who cares if Anre sucks? \nDon't really care for the multiplayer aspect, I know that is what some people come for. This game puts a LOT of effort into multiplayer with not much for you to do beyond story and arcade mode if you're an introverted isolated misanthrope like me.

Character balance is solid as well if you care about that. Certain characters have select moves that are overtuned, but overall you can pick up literally anyone and get far.\n\nThat being said, as a player in Gold Master rank, HOLY SH** the system mechanics of this game are some of the most obnoxious out there. Don't let anyone convince you this is \"anime street fighter\"... Granblue Rising is deceptively fast-paced and has some absolute deep-fried bullsh** in it that is likely to make you tilt very quickly. The moment you decide to play this seriously, you will be cursed with a lifetime of nightmares about 66L and counterhit Brave Counter.\n\nDespite how quickly rounds can end sometimes, in Granblue Rising, patience is key... but you will need [i]plenty.[/i]",

While this game is different than vanilla GBVS and it's sad that these can't be two games with equal playerbases and network quality, I absolutely love it. In terms of online interaction and play, it's the best it's ever been, but if you're looking for solo content, you'll unfortunately not find as much here. I like to think of GBVS and GBVSR as one being single-player oriented and the latter being multiplayer oriented. As a fighting game, it's great, and as good and active as you could ask for. As a game, I wish they didn't cut RPG Mode, Tower of Babyl, and the entire concept of coop raids and grid building. I'll still recommend Rising since I know the reason these were cut is because barely anybody cared about them in the first place, and the game (outside of Grand Bruise lol) has just about anything you could ask for from a modern fighting game.",

      "review": "If you're too braindead to make proper matchmaking, then just don't make an online pvp game.  It's the year 2025, this isn't a difficult concept.  The devs should step in a boxing ring with a professional ufc fighter.  Don't worry the ufc fighter doesn't really know the buttons for boxing so you're both \"beginners\" and at the \"same skill level\".  \n\nThe game is actually good in general and I'm sure if you have 5k hours in fighting games then what I say here doesn't apply, but the matchmaking is just so horrendous for anyone remotely new that the rest of the game doesn't matter.  Other critiques I would give, that are generally applicable to most fighting games, is that the game doesn't make clear many aspects of characters kits.  You are force to go to 3p forums, find the character, scroll down to the 8th page, read the 3rd paragraph describing the skill, to find out how to counter play it.  Now people will say some dumb crap like, just figure it out yourself by wasting 15 minutes in training mode trying every option.  Firstly, what a waste of time to do this for all the knowledge check bs for every character.  Second, go try that yourself.  The game literally won't let you even run training mode against DLC characters unless you buy them.  Good shit.",

(Yes it was a Belial player how did you know?)\n\nTrue story btw but in all seriousness streamlining combos and most of the decision making really highlights how depthless the moment to moment gameplay is. Online connections and matchmaking aren't that bad its just that wifi users don't have human rights and no amount of rollback netcode can bring you far enough back into the stone-age to actually game with such troglodytes.",
