The 2000's graphics are acceptable, earlier civ games have interesting and great mechanics but the graphics are just to archaic. The consensus is that the later versions of civ were simplified to give it a wider audience and that is great because the game is still releasing to this day, but civ 4 seams more realistic and really gives you a feeling that you have lived through world history. Even though the AI is older, the characters  seem more real in civ 4. I also always prefer the grid lay out over the tiles. I know the grid can be exploited as in you can travel further in a diagonal line but the grid just seams more intuitive and satisfying. Combat also seems more realistic. I also prefer the religious and cultural mechanics in civ 4. But really all of the civ games are worth playing and they all play different. Civ 3 is also great as are civ 1 and 2 though i can not take the graphics past 3.",
