      "review": "I played this game back when the demo was out, and it was a blast with friends. In the demo, you started in a house, could go around beating up neighbors, taking stuff from their homes, and selling it to buy upgrades and new equipment. It had a real Thief Simulator vibe open, free, and full of potential.\n\nBut when the full game came out, it felt completely different. You still go into houses, steal things, and fight people, but now everything happens under a strict time limit. The stages are short and fast-paced, and you even have to give away part of the money you earn. Sure, you can eventually pay off what you owe and (I assume) become free, but I didn’t get that far, so I can’t say for sure.\n\nOverall, the demo had a much better feel  no timers, more freedom, and a more immersive experience. The full release feels more like Payday  still fun, but missing the charm and open-ended style the demo promised. If you never played the demo, you’ll probably enjoy the game more. But for those of us who did, it’s hard not to miss what could have been.",

There’s just something about the atmosphere, the attention to detail, and the satisfaction of piecing everything together that keeps you coming back for more.\r\n\r\nEven after hours of play, it never really got old. For me, it’s a very, very good gamepolished, engaging, and oddly relaxing despite the subject matter.

It’s kinda just one of those games that you'll play with someone or by yourself and still get enjoyment out of it because of how ridiculous of a situation you might get into, sometimes a bit annoying if you take it too seriously so the entertainment value is definitely there. What actually keeps it playable though, for me personally, is the roguelite side of things. The progression and run based gameplay give it just enough structure to make you want to hop in for just one more try even after completion. This game can be better with more content, stuff to complete and maybe a bit more story aspect to explain how you ended up in that situation in the first place.",

Planning heists together, splitting roles, and dealing with the inevitable chaos after one tiny mistake creates a unique, almost comedic atmosphere.\n\nCo-op gameplay is surprisingly satisfying — even simple tasks become fun because everything requires coordination, communication, and a bit of creative problem-solving. You feel the progression, but also the constant joy of handling the mess you and your partner accidentally caused.\n\nIt’s not a game that will impress you with graphics or technical polish, but if you’re looking for light-hearted, goofy fun with a friend, Crime Simulator delivers. Co-op gives it personality and makes every session unpredictable, funny, and genuinely enjoyable.",

If you keep this in mind and understand that the devs were going with a different type of game, you can have a lot of fun. This doesn't mean its without faults though, the gameplay cycle is that of the average \"get x amount of money/whatever per period of time with an increase every time you surpass it\" time game, like lethal company, or others in the genre. It does succeed in this loop but you have to be into or okay with that kind of gameplay. The other fault that is big for some is the lack of thievery options, the devs add more and more with each update, and map selections. Some big pluses are that the devs are working on adding new stuff to the game with each update or fix issues brought  forward from the community, and the price isn't an over inflated cash grab price.  Overall get the thing, try it out and if its not for you its not for you refund it but if you like the concept you and the homies will be having a blast sleep gassing houses to rob them in no time!",

      "review": "Crime Simulator Review\n\nRating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)\n\nCrime Simulator tries to deliver the thrill of a life of crime — from petty thefts to larger heists — in a sandbox world where you start broke and have to work your way up by stealing, sneaking, and upgrading your gear. It’s a familiar setup that fans of Thief Simulator will instantly recognize, but this game adds its own touches with a debt-driven story and customization options.\n\nThe gameplay loop is simple yet satisfying. You case houses, learn guard patterns, break in, and make your getaway — all while managing risk and avoiding capture. There’s a good sense of progression as you earn money, buy better tools, and unlock new areas. The tasks are varied enough to keep things interesting, and the freedom to plan your approach gives the game a nice sense of agency.\n\nHowever, Crime Simulator still feels rough around the edges. The controls can be clunky, AI behavior is sometimes inconsistent, and the environments feel small and repetitive. In its current form, it’s more of a promising prototype than a polished product. Many players have noted that it lacks the depth and fluidity of Thief Simulator 2, which it clearly draws inspiration from.\n\nVisually, it’s serviceable but not impressive — the lighting and models do the job but don’t stand out. The sound design adds some tension, especially during stealth segments, though it could use more variety to keep long sessions engaging.\n\nOverall, Crime Simulator offers an entertaining experience if you’re craving a casual heist game. It has potential, and if the developers keep refining it, it could evolve into something great. But as it stands, it’s a fun but flawed crime caper — worth trying, especially on sale or once it’s more complete.\n\nGifted by snuspus",

Might be okay for those who are suited to more challenging co-op games, but sadly not for single players as such. Levelling up and gaining XP and other stuff is nearly impossible with having a debt and time frame that leaves no room for comfort. And that's just on the casual difficulty setting! \r\n\r\nOnly other problem I've encountered is the fact it's taken more time loading than actually running on the lowest settings. Even though I meet the minimum specs to run this, it's still slow and lagging most of the time, however I think it's because of the online connectivity aspect. \r\n\r\nOverall:\r\n\r\nNot bad for those who like online co-op playing with a challenge.\r\n\r\nNot really suited for single playing, regardless of the option.\r\n\r\nNot as fun, or as easy to play and master as Thief simulator 1 and 2 or the 80s prologue.",

      "review": "Schedule I, Grand Theft Auto, or Payday 1 or 2 are probably going to be heavier hitters if what you're looking for is a \"Crime Simulator\". After playing Thief Simulator and disliking the tedium and cryptid braindead AI in that one, we're back with another project that tastes like an part-baked pie.\n\nI'm so exhausted of \"concepts\" and \"experiences\" and \"XYZ Simulators\". Just because a game is possibly fun to play with friends doesn't mean it's a good game, especially if the game gets frustrating even [i]when you're playing with friends[/i].\n\nYou can read the other reviews for an in-depth examination into the quirky AI, repetitive NPC behavior, static locations and props (Save for stuff like codes, notes and mechanic-relevant items), static object physics making it easier to get stuck than to actually maneuver around, and having the Stamina of an underdeveloped child with severe asthma.\n\nThe common theme with these \"Simulator\"-type games is that they're pumped out almost a dime-a-dozen. You can clearly see [i]some[/i] effort has been put into this title to make it better than the previous iterations, but it's still just as patience-testing and grindy as how the original Thief Simulator felt to me.\n\nAs I usually say with these types of games; Give it a few years to develop, maybe it won't feel like such a chore to wrangle around with.\n\n[h3]What I Liked[/h3]\n[list]\n    [*] Voice acting is decent, doesn't overstay its welcome. Even the AI barks - While certainly coming out of their mouths like robots - Isn't bad audio quality.\n    [*] The character animations aren't as floaty or jank as previous iterations of Simulator games made by the same people.\n    [*] The Skill and Ability system is interesting, with Skill books and Skill boxes. Although, the fact that it's a two-part system that both requires XP gates to gain \"Skill Points\" in order to make use of the Skill books reeks of artificial progression. Hopefully it'll be tweaked in the future.\n    [*] Co-op support, giving the game a higher chance of staying relevant in coming years.\n    [*] Varied locations offer a reason to revisit to maximize loot potential.\n    [*] Expansive toolsets with various methods to approach \"marks\".\n    [*] One doesn't require a Stethoscope to loot Safes, it just makes them easier. (Why isn't this mechanic used with other tools??) .\n    [*] Jumping out of the Safehouse map fence has the Handler play a funny line before the Player gets sniped from a distance, respawning back in-bounds, which I thought was pretty funny and cleaver.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]How It's Bad[/h3]\n[list]\n    [*] Rudimentary NPC AI lends to both predictability in some aspects of their behavior and unpredictability in others. For example, NPCs will sometimes exit on to the street going \"Who is there?\" when you leave, since they're programmed to \"Home in\" to triggers (Like if you make too much noise, or are seen). The issue is that these triggers are extraordinarily quick to proc in the beginning due to the Player Character having.. Zero Skills.\n\nPolice response is almost immediate, offering VERY little time to compensate. Police [i]also[/i] don't run out of Stamina - [i]YOU[/i] do however - So getting away is a back-and-forth of letting my one-lunged elderly wannabe-thief regain their sweet oxygen while Police or angry Civilians keep hot on my tail.\n\nPolice Tazers are instant-kills. Regardless of if Co-op players can revive you with a Medkit, one-hit-kills regardless of Health level don't feel good, fair or balanced. Just because you can also buy a \"Vest\" to survive one or two doesn't make it better, it's artificial difficulty.\n\nPolice flip-flop between knowing [i]exactly[/i] where you are at all times (Likely due to overlap from the beginner Player Skill being zero, and funky behavior by the engine in regards to NPC sightlines and level geometry), or straight-up running past you.\n\nCivilians who notice the Player will call the Police every time without fail, regardless of whether you're actively punching their lights out or smashing their face with a crowbar. There actually is no animation for Civilians calling the police (As far as I've observed), it just happens. There's zero reason to try and stop them from contacting the Police once you're seen.\n\nCivilians follow set paths and activities depending on their AI, however the way they go about this is extraordinarily jarring. NPCs will sometimes be crouching in the middle of rooms, standing in one place occasionally turning around only to stare into nothingness, or immediately change what they're doing to begin moving to another location. There is very little telegraphing from them - If at all - Which makes circumnavigating them a frustrating chore.\n    [*] Unless the Players are fulfilling Challenges, money (Credits) are impossible to gain until after one has earned enough past the \"Quota\", which increases with every subsequent submission. In addition, extra cash achieved through going over quota isn't distributed to the Players until the current amassed amount of stolen goods are \"locked in\" and submitted, leaving Players with the decision to either turn-in early to get cash to continue heisting, or enter missions without extra tools or supplies.\n    [*] There's no way to heal the Player for free when at the Safehouse. You must buy and use a Medkit - Which - Are also used to revive downed Coop players.\n    [*] Cameras sometimes don't show their \"Red FoV\" cone in certain angles, or the \"edge\" of the cone can become so transparent that it's difficult to see until caught. Also, Cameras catch the player [b]immediately[/b]. \n    [*] You cannot open/close doors with a \"Two-handed\"/\"Heavy\" item in your hand, requiring the Player to drop the item to interact. In a rush this easily translates to dropping the item from standing height, alerting every NPC in the house whilst also potentially blocking the door you're trying to exit from.\n    [*] Figuring out how tall is \"too tall\" when it comes to vaulting over fences or other objects is tedious, and constantly runs the risk of over-exerting the Player whilst they try to determine if they can proceed. This is typically why other games have visual indicators for the Player in those situations.\n    [*] A static physics engine in regards to level geometry makes objects as small as gnomes, standing circular grills, benches and other props impossible to move, easily creating obstacles that can freeze the Player in their tracks if one attempts to push, maneuver, or otherwise jump around them.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Final Thoughts[/h3]\n\nAll in all, it's better than Thief Simulator in several aspects (Though I never played the second one), but it still falls flat heavily when it comes to NPC Intelligence, which unfortunately is a large problem right now due to the nature of the game.\n\nRight now I'd give it a solid [b]6/10[/b]. Above average and fun with friends, but frustrating and tasking to take seriously in regards to actual forward progression.",

Cops will find you even if you are hiding far away. The map isn't that big and the boundary is nearby that when you cross it you do not return to base, but instantly die. You are required to full fill quotas to pay off a bale bond just like in Thief Simulator, but is virtually impossible to do by the second day. There's not enough loot to do this and even the odd jobs of vandalism do not help towards the total. Even if you pick up the strong man leaflet you'll never carry enough lot back to pay the required quotas in time. If you get caught you loose your equipment and cannot afford to replace it and constricts what you can do the next night.

NPC's will detect your friend see him leave get mad and run straight for you despite not knowing in the slightest where you are and end your whole career in one kick. People will call the cops for the dumbest reasons. I don't know why I am punished in crime simulator for stealing because it sure feels like it when people noticed their rusty wheel isn't in the corner where they left it then proceed to call the cops or if a door isn't locked up either without them even getting to the door they can just sniff that its locked up. Then said cop's gaydar will go off telling them right where the brokie is run straight for you and fire off 3 taser shots in 3 seconds before you can utter the words \"police brutality\". The game is super punishing for you dying because the basic tools for breaking into peoples houses cost so much. why does a single screwdriver and 1 bobby pin cost 100$? and the singular bobby pin costs 50$ and you get 1 bobby pin you only get paid reliably every quota I don't know why we are even thieves in the first place if I have to ration out credits like I am living paycheck to paycheck. I feel like turning in any loot should give the amount of credits it would have instead of only when you turn in the quota. The multiplayer in this game is miserable I'm reminded every waking second this isn't my save because I cant do anything move furniture, accept jobs, turn in quests, turn in requested items ect...ect....ect i understand griefing is a problem but in that case add private lobbies like games have been doing for over 20 years I was invited in a game and then the game tells me I am a pest. The higher difficulties do not feel rewarding in the slightest just more miserable by a mile cops decide that since they get paid by the hour they are gonna sit around for 2 in game hours sniffing out who stole that 50$ vase. Drones are miserable to deal with because the stealing stealth game has no stealth mechanics other then popping a squat so you will be spotted chased down by ever tom dick and harry then given the firing squad by 5 cops with tasers that fire once a second because you cant outrun them and god forbid the helicopter spots you because its execute on sight. Placing items is a gamble either you place it down gently or your character tosses it like he works at fedex overall the game is fun and enjoyable and I would recommend if it wasn't so buggy and inconsistent and the balancing wasn't designed by a person who hates you specifically by name.",

Casual mode is the only way the game feels realistic, and even there sometimes you have guys hitting you with the kung-fu flying kick, but their tenant info says NOTHING about that. I don't understand why a tazer kills you, why tenants can survive being hit with a fireaxe to the face, why anyone can hit you 3 times with fists, twice with a hammer/axe, and bam there goes a day of availability for the next quota. Why are there no hiding spots? I don't mean places the cops don't check, with the golden card \"Cops\" (if you're lucky to find it) They dont search half the rooms anyways, but you cant use the closets, the dumpsters, etc. I like the attempts at using stealth, but sometimes, despite knowing their exact routine, some tenants will up and decide \"no, actually i wont go outside im gonna randomly check the basement now\" and where the heck do you hide then? I get the game isn't thief simulator, that's fine, although i did wonder how we got from those graphics to these, and how that game was hella polished in comparison, but I was giving the benefit of the doubt, I desperately, genuinely want to love the game, i've gotten some hilarious moments out of it, some really fun times even, but sometimes i just sit there and think \"It'd be great if i didnt die to some schmuck who sprinted at me, A CRIMINAL, who broke into his house with a TAZER, and beat me to death with his fists\"\n\nI'll keep playing, and keep hoping that content updates and patches arrive to make the AI feel more...like they are supposed to feel, i mean, normal mode  (cant imagine hardcore mode) has the tenants waking up in an entirely DIFFERENT room, because i grace a dollar bill off the bathroom sink, do you have the hearing of batman?",

Too late for that now so here I am, hopefully giving other players a closer look at this game without wasting their own time or money.\n\nI knew what I was getting into here, loot extraction game with punishing systems. Sure that's all well and good.\n\nWhat I didn't know however was how cobbled-together this game feels, even compared to Thief Sim 2.\n\nTake a look at said other game. Sure, it is a bit more feature complete but it's not without its (unaddressed and unfixed) bugs. Still this dev wanted to push out DLC for that game too. Just check out the reviews. Said DLC is still not finished with a release date at the end of 2025. The dev wanted to make this game more I suppose? Oh well.\nBut despite all that, this game still feels like someone's first Unity project.. It's like the dev just used asset packs and called it a day. Art styles clash and things don't fit together right. And the (likely) AI voicelines, just listen to them. Horrid. Steam makes you disclose any use of AI-assisted assets in your game, but no mention of this is anywhere on the store page.\nYou can find a lot of models this game uses on the asset store. This much is evident from just checking out other cheap games. I guess the lockpicking system is made by the dev maybe? Hopefully? Anyway, I can understand all that for a game that's in active development, maybe the dev isn't done with those parts yet.\nBut why is this already a full release? Surely you don't actually think this game is worth $15 in it's current state, I sure don't. I got it on sale for $7 and still feel like I've been fleeced.\n\nDon't even bother reading the developer responses to these reviews, they all say the same thing. Though give a few of them a read if you want a quick laugh.\n\nPlease for the love of god, just release this in Early Access so people know what they're getting into. It would allow you more leeway as a developer to actually finish the game. Adding on new content won't fix what's already there (and broken)\n\nTL;DR? If you like asset flips and broken promises go ahead and buy this. I don't have faith in it improving much further.",

Police are on site within seconds. Your character has very few options in the way of stealth. You lumber around with very few ways to sneak or use subterfuge to trick the occupants.\n\nIf we have to start with a lumbering smash-and-grab oaf, there needs to be a way to do more than grab a tv remote and sprint into the woods.\n\nWhy not start with general theft at stores? Let us build up the character a bit while working on this game's version of basic stealth? Get used to how this specific game treats NPC vision and cameras in a setting where you arent necessarily engaged in criminal activity yet.\n\nVisually and mechanically, this feels like it wants to be Thief Sim. Take notes from the quiet gameplay of the Payday series. Maybe some of the stealth movement from things like Metal Gear. Even just the basics of \"lowering your head 6 inches isn't 'crouching'.\" Being able to distract people can be as simple as letting me ring the doorbell and then sneaking in a bathroom window. As is, it feels like stealth isn't your character's aim.",

You start with nothing and everyone is too alert and there's a learning curve, that while rewarding, feels like way too much friction to be starting out with. \r\nI had to delete my save and start over 6 times within my first hour because I kept failing into a state where I had no money left, and could not afford lockpicks or anything at all. I couldn't accept further missions either. This game should explain it's mechanics more, also I really dislike that I have to earn my way up to being a criminal.

I could get like three shipping palettes of zipties for that much. \r\nThe lockpick? I'm sorry, a bobby pin and a screwdriver does NOT cost $100.

Might be okay for those who are suited to more challenging co-op games, but sadly not for single players as such.

      "review": "Schedule I, Grand Theft Auto, or Payday 1 or 2 are probably going to be heavier hitters if what you're looking for is a \"Crime Simulator\". After playing Thief Simulator and disliking the tedium and cryptid braindead AI in that one, we're back with another project that tastes like an part-baked pie.\n\nI'm so exhausted of \"concepts\" and \"experiences\" and \"XYZ Simulators\". Just because a game is possibly fun to play with friends doesn't mean it's a good game, especially if the game gets frustrating even [i]when you're playing with friends[/i].\n\nYou can read the other reviews for an in-depth examination into the quirky AI, repetitive NPC behavior, static locations and props (Save for stuff like codes, notes and mechanic-relevant items), static object physics making it easier to get stuck than to actually maneuver around, and having the Stamina of an underdeveloped child with severe asthma.\n\nThe common theme with these \"Simulator\"-type games is that they're pumped out almost a dime-a-dozen. You can clearly see [i]some[/i] effort has been put into this title to make it better than the previous iterations, but it's still just as patience-testing and grindy as how the original Thief Simulator felt to me.\n\nAs I usually say with these types of games; Give it a few years to develop, maybe it won't feel like such a chore to wrangle around with.\n\n[h3]What I Liked[/h3]\n[list]\n    [*] Voice acting is decent, doesn't overstay its welcome. Even the AI barks - While certainly coming out of their mouths like robots - Isn't bad audio quality.\n    [*] The character animations aren't as floaty or jank as previous iterations of Simulator games made by the same people.\n    [*] The Skill and Ability system is interesting, with Skill books and Skill boxes. Although, the fact that it's a two-part system that both requires XP gates to gain \"Skill Points\" in order to make use of the Skill books reeks of artificial progression. Hopefully it'll be tweaked in the future.\n    [*] Co-op support, giving the game a higher chance of staying relevant in coming years.\n    [*] Varied locations offer a reason to revisit to maximize loot potential.\n    [*] Expansive toolsets with various methods to approach \"marks\".\n    [*] One doesn't require a Stethoscope to loot Safes, it just makes them easier. (Why isn't this mechanic used with other tools??) .\n    [*] Jumping out of the Safehouse map fence has the Handler play a funny line before the Player gets sniped from a distance, respawning back in-bounds, which I thought was pretty funny and cleaver.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]How It's Bad[/h3]\n[list]\n    [*] Rudimentary NPC AI lends to both predictability in some aspects of their behavior and unpredictability in others. For example, NPCs will sometimes exit on to the street going \"Who is there?\" when you leave, since they're programmed to \"Home in\" to triggers (Like if you make too much noise, or are seen). The issue is that these triggers are extraordinarily quick to proc in the beginning due to the Player Character having.. Zero Skills.\n\nPolice response is almost immediate, offering VERY little time to compensate. Police [i]also[/i] don't run out of Stamina - [i]YOU[/i] do however - So getting away is a back-and-forth of letting my one-lunged elderly wannabe-thief regain their sweet oxygen while Police or angry Civilians keep hot on my tail.\n\nPolice Tazers are instant-kills. Regardless of if Co-op players can revive you with a Medkit, one-hit-kills regardless of Health level don't feel good, fair or balanced. Just because you can also buy a \"Vest\" to survive one or two doesn't make it better, it's artificial difficulty.\n\nPolice flip-flop between knowing [i]exactly[/i] where you are at all times (Likely due to overlap from the beginner Player Skill being zero, and funky behavior by the engine in regards to NPC sightlines and level geometry), or straight-up running past you.\n\nCivilians who notice the Player will call the Police every time without fail, regardless of whether you're actively punching their lights out or smashing their face with a crowbar. There actually is no animation for Civilians calling the police (As far as I've observed), it just happens. There's zero reason to try and stop them from contacting the Police once you're seen.\n\nCivilians follow set paths and activities depending on their AI, however the way they go about this is extraordinarily jarring. NPCs will sometimes be crouching in the middle of rooms, standing in one place occasionally turning around only to stare into nothingness, or immediately change what they're doing to begin moving to another location. There is very little telegraphing from them - If at all - Which makes circumnavigating them a frustrating chore.\n    [*] Unless the Players are fulfilling Challenges, money (Credits) are impossible to gain until after one has earned enough past the \"Quota\", which increases with every subsequent submission. In addition, extra cash achieved through going over quota isn't distributed to the Players until the current amassed amount of stolen goods are \"locked in\" and submitted, leaving Players with the decision to either turn-in early to get cash to continue heisting, or enter missions without extra tools or supplies.\n    [*] There's no way to heal the Player for free when at the Safehouse. You must buy and use a Medkit - Which - Are also used to revive downed Coop players.\n    [*] Cameras sometimes don't show their \"Red FoV\" cone in certain angles, or the \"edge\" of the cone can become so transparent that it's difficult to see until caught. Also, Cameras catch the player [b]immediately[/b]. \n    [*] You cannot open/close doors with a \"Two-handed\"/\"Heavy\" item in your hand, requiring the Player to drop the item to interact. In a rush this easily translates to dropping the item from standing height, alerting every NPC in the house whilst also potentially blocking the door you're trying to exit from.\n    [*] Figuring out how tall is \"too tall\" when it comes to vaulting over fences or other objects is tedious, and constantly runs the risk of over-exerting the Player whilst they try to determine if they can proceed. This is typically why other games have visual indicators for the Player in those situations.\n    [*] A static physics engine in regards to level geometry makes objects as small as gnomes, standing circular grills, benches and other props impossible to move, easily creating obstacles that can freeze the Player in their tracks if one attempts to push, maneuver, or otherwise jump around them.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Final Thoughts[/h3]\n\nAll in all, it's better than Thief Simulator in several aspects (Though I never played the second one), but it still falls flat heavily when it comes to NPC Intelligence, which unfortunately is a large problem right now due to the nature of the game.\n\nRight now I'd give it a solid [b]6/10[/b]. Above average and fun with friends, but frustrating and tasking to take seriously in regards to actual forward progression.",

NPC's will detect your friend see him leave get mad and run straight for you despite not knowing in the slightest where you are and end your whole career in one kick. People will call the cops for the dumbest reasons. I don't know why I am punished in crime simulator for stealing because it sure feels like it when people noticed their rusty wheel isn't in the corner where they left it then proceed to call the cops or if a door isn't locked up either without them even getting to the door they can just sniff that its locked up. Then said cop's gaydar will go off telling them right where the brokie is run straight for you and fire off 3 taser shots in 3 seconds before you can utter the words \"police brutality\". The game is super punishing for you dying because the basic tools for breaking into peoples houses cost so much. why does a single screwdriver and 1 bobby pin cost 100$? and the singular bobby pin costs 50$ and you get 1 bobby pin you only get paid reliably every quota I don't know why we are even thieves in the first place if I have to ration out credits like I am living paycheck to paycheck. I feel like turning in any loot should give the amount of credits it would have instead of only when you turn in the quota. The multiplayer in this game is miserable I'm reminded every waking second this isn't my save because I cant do anything move furniture, accept jobs, turn in quests, turn in requested items ect...ect....ect i understand griefing is a problem but in that case add private lobbies like games have been doing for over 20 years I was invited in a game and then the game tells me I am a pest. The higher difficulties do not feel rewarding in the slightest just more miserable by a mile cops decide that since they get paid by the hour they are gonna sit around for 2 in game hours sniffing out who stole that 50$ vase. Drones are miserable to deal with because the stealing stealth game has no stealth mechanics other then popping a squat so you will be spotted chased down by ever tom dick and harry then given the firing squad by 5 cops with tasers that fire once a second because you cant outrun them and god forbid the helicopter spots you because its execute on sight.

People who are unarmed? one hit with a bat, crowbar, axe, etc and they go down, but if they are armed with anything they can take 4+ hits with a crowbar to the face?! Why?? Casual mode is the only way the game feels realistic, and even there sometimes you have guys hitting you with the kung-fu flying kick, but their tenant info says NOTHING about that. I don't understand why a tazer kills you, why tenants can survive being hit with a fireaxe to the face, why anyone can hit you 3 times with fists, twice with a hammer/axe, and bam there goes a day of availability for the next quota. Why are there no hiding spots? I don't mean places the cops don't check, with the golden card \"Cops\" (if you're lucky to find it) They dont search half the rooms anyways, but you cant use the closets, the dumpsters, etc. I like the attempts at using stealth, but sometimes, despite knowing their exact routine, some tenants will up and decide \"no, actually i wont go outside im gonna randomly check the basement now\" and where the heck do you hide then? I get the game isn't thief simulator, that's fine, although i did wonder how we got from those graphics to these, and how that game was hella polished in comparison, but I was giving the benefit of the doubt, I desperately, genuinely want to love the game, i've gotten some hilarious moments out of it, some really fun times even, but sometimes i just sit there and think \"It'd be great if i didnt die to some schmuck who sprinted at me, A CRIMINAL, who broke into his house with a TAZER, and beat me to death with his fists\"\n\nI'll keep playing, and keep hoping that content updates and patches arrive to make the AI feel more...like they are supposed to feel, i mean, normal mode  (cant imagine hardcore mode) has the tenants waking up in an entirely DIFFERENT room, because i grace a dollar bill off the bathroom sink, do you have the hearing of batman?",

There is already plans for future DLC, when the game is in this current state?? Disappointing at best. Makes me want a refund at worst. Too late for that now so here I am, hopefully giving other players a closer look at this game without wasting their own time or money.\n\nI knew what I was getting into here, loot extraction game with punishing systems. Sure that's all well and good.\n\nWhat I didn't know however was how cobbled-together this game feels, even compared to Thief Sim 2.\n\nTake a look at said other game. Sure, it is a bit more feature complete but it's not without its (unaddressed and unfixed) bugs. Still this dev wanted to push out DLC for that game too. Just check out the reviews. Said DLC is still not finished with a release date at the end of 2025. The dev wanted to make this game more I suppose? Oh well.\nBut despite all that, this game still feels like someone's first Unity project.. It's like the dev just used asset packs and called it a day. Art styles clash and things don't fit together right. And the (likely) AI voicelines, just listen to them. Horrid. Steam makes you disclose any use of AI-assisted assets in your game, but no mention of this is anywhere on the store page.\nYou can find a lot of models this game uses on the asset store. This much is evident from just checking out other cheap games. I guess the lockpicking system is made by the dev maybe? Hopefully? Anyway, I can understand all that for a game that's in active development, maybe the dev isn't done with those parts yet.\nBut why is this already a full release? Surely you don't actually think this game is worth $15 in it's current state, I sure don't. I got it on sale for $7 and still feel like I've been fleeced.\n\nDon't even bother reading the developer responses to these reviews, they all say the same thing. Though give a few of them a read if you want a quick laugh.\n\nPlease for the love of god, just release this in Early Access so people know what they're getting into. It would allow you more leeway as a developer to actually finish the game. Adding on new content won't fix what's already there (and broken)\n\nTL;DR? If you like asset flips and broken promises go ahead and buy this. I don't have faith in it improving much further.",

Police are on site within seconds. Your character has very few options in the way of stealth. You lumber around with very few ways to sneak or use subterfuge to trick the occupants.\n\nIf we have to start with a lumbering smash-and-grab oaf, there needs to be a way to do more than grab a tv remote and sprint into the woods.\n\nWhy not start with general theft at stores? Let us build up the character a bit while working on this game's version of basic stealth? Get used to how this specific game treats NPC vision and cameras in a setting where you arent necessarily engaged in criminal activity yet.\n\nVisually and mechanically, this feels like it wants to be Thief Sim. Take notes from the quiet gameplay of the Payday series. Maybe some of the stealth movement from things like Metal Gear. Even just the basics of \"lowering your head 6 inches isn't 'crouching'.\" Being able to distract people can be as simple as letting me ring the doorbell and then sneaking in a bathroom window.

Might be okay for those who are suited to more challenging co-op games, but sadly not for single players as such.

After playing Thief Simulator and disliking the tedium and cryptid braindead AI in that one, we're back with another project that tastes like an part-baked pie.\n\nI'm so exhausted of \"concepts\" and \"experiences\" and \"XYZ Simulators\". Just because a game is possibly fun to play with friends doesn't mean it's a good game, especially if the game gets frustrating even [i]when you're playing with friends[/i].\n\nYou can read the other reviews for an in-depth examination into the quirky AI, repetitive NPC behavior, static locations and props (Save for stuff like codes, notes and mechanic-relevant items), static object physics making it easier to get stuck than to actually maneuver around, and having the Stamina of an underdeveloped child with severe asthma.\n\nThe common theme with these \"Simulator\"-type games is that they're pumped out almost a dime-a-dozen. You can clearly see [i]some[/i] effort has been put into this title to make it better than the previous iterations, but it's still just as patience-testing and grindy as how the original Thief Simulator felt to me.\n\nAs I usually say with these types of games; Give it a few years to develop, maybe it won't feel like such a chore to wrangle around with.\n\n[h3]What I Liked[/h3]\n[list]\n    [*] Voice acting is decent, doesn't overstay its welcome. Even the AI barks - While certainly coming out of their mouths like robots - Isn't bad audio quality.\n    [*] The character animations aren't as floaty or jank as previous iterations of Simulator games made by the same people.\n    [*] The Skill and Ability system is interesting, with Skill books and Skill boxes. Although, the fact that it's a two-part system that both requires XP gates to gain \"Skill Points\" in order to make use of the Skill books reeks of artificial progression. Hopefully it'll be tweaked in the future.\n    [*] Co-op support, giving the game a higher chance of staying relevant in coming years.\n    [*] Varied locations offer a reason to revisit to maximize loot potential.\n    [*] Expansive toolsets with various methods to approach \"marks\".\n    [*] One doesn't require a Stethoscope to loot Safes, it just makes them easier. (Why isn't this mechanic used with other tools??) .\n    [*] Jumping out of the Safehouse map fence has the Handler play a funny line before the Player gets sniped from a distance, respawning back in-bounds, which I thought was pretty funny and cleaver.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]How It's Bad[/h3]\n[list]\n    [*] Rudimentary NPC AI lends to both predictability in some aspects of their behavior and unpredictability in others. For example, NPCs will sometimes exit on to the street going \"Who is there?\" when you leave, since they're programmed to \"Home in\" to triggers (Like if you make too much noise, or are seen). The issue is that these triggers are extraordinarily quick to proc in the beginning due to the Player Character having.. Zero Skills.\n\nPolice response is almost immediate, offering VERY little time to compensate. Police [i]also[/i] don't run out of Stamina - [i]YOU[/i] do however - So getting away is a back-and-forth of letting my one-lunged elderly wannabe-thief regain their sweet oxygen while Police or angry Civilians keep hot on my tail.\n\nPolice Tazers are instant-kills. Regardless of if Co-op players can revive you with a Medkit, one-hit-kills regardless of Health level don't feel good, fair or balanced. Just because you can also buy a \"Vest\" to survive one or two doesn't make it better, it's artificial difficulty.\n\nPolice flip-flop between knowing [i]exactly[/i] where you are at all times (Likely due to overlap from the beginner Player Skill being zero, and funky behavior by the engine in regards to NPC sightlines and level geometry), or straight-up running past you.\n\nCivilians who notice the Player will call the Police every time without fail, regardless of whether you're actively punching their lights out or smashing their face with a crowbar. There actually is no animation for Civilians calling the police (As far as I've observed), it just happens. There's zero reason to try and stop them from contacting the Police once you're seen.\n\nCivilians follow set paths and activities depending on their AI, however the way they go about this is extraordinarily jarring. NPCs will sometimes be crouching in the middle of rooms, standing in one place occasionally turning around only to stare into nothingness, or immediately change what they're doing to begin moving to another location. There is very little telegraphing from them - If at all - Which makes circumnavigating them a frustrating chore.\n    [*] Unless the Players are fulfilling Challenges, money (Credits) are impossible to gain until after one has earned enough past the \"Quota\", which increases with every subsequent submission. In addition, extra cash achieved through going over quota isn't distributed to the Players until the current amassed amount of stolen goods are \"locked in\" and submitted, leaving Players with the decision to either turn-in early to get cash to continue heisting, or enter missions without extra tools or supplies.\n    [*] There's no way to heal the Player for free when at the Safehouse. You must buy and use a Medkit - Which - Are also used to revive downed Coop players.\n    [*] Cameras sometimes don't show their \"Red FoV\" cone in certain angles, or the \"edge\" of the cone can become so transparent that it's difficult to see until caught. Also, Cameras catch the player [b]immediately[/b]. \n    [*] You cannot open/close doors with a \"Two-handed\"/\"Heavy\" item in your hand, requiring the Player to drop the item to interact. In a rush this easily translates to dropping the item from standing height, alerting every NPC in the house whilst also potentially blocking the door you're trying to exit from.\n    [*] Figuring out how tall is \"too tall\" when it comes to vaulting over fences or other objects is tedious, and constantly runs the risk of over-exerting the Player whilst they try to determine if they can proceed. This is typically why other games have visual indicators for the Player in those situations.\n    [*] A static physics engine in regards to level geometry makes objects as small as gnomes, standing circular grills, benches and other props impossible to move, easily creating obstacles that can freeze the Player in their tracks if one attempts to push, maneuver, or otherwise jump around them.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Final Thoughts[/h3]\n\nAll in all, it's better than Thief Simulator in several aspects (Though I never played the second one), but it still falls flat heavily when it comes to NPC Intelligence, which unfortunately is a large problem right now due to the nature of the game.\n\nRight now I'd give it a solid [b]6/10[/b]. Above average and fun with friends, but frustrating and tasking to take seriously in regards to actual forward progression.",
