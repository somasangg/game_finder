      "review": "A Ubisoft game indeed....\r\n\r\nSTORY:It had potential, but it never fully committed to the grittiness of cartel warfare. It tried to balance between the military banter from the movie Sicario and the brutality of cartel crimes, safe to say they did not find the line, almost every time they've shown or talked about the horrible things the Cartel Bosses did, they sounded overly sassy and quippy (especially in the bowman cutscenes).\r\n\r\nI’d consider this a nitpick, but as a former Rainbow Six Siege player, those little bonus missions tied to R6 are so incredibly cheap. I hated them. They’re pure fan service with zero cohesion; Nothing about the setting matches or even makes sense. Why are there barricaded doors like in R6 inside a research facility in Bolivia? Don’t they know those are training facility props from Siege’s gameplay setup? Deployable shields for no reason? My god.\r\nCaveira is brazilian,i get it, you dont have to keep mentioning it or making her say stuff in portuguese, and the R6´s voice lines being randomly throw out to you, randomly, quite random indeed. \r\nHER BROTHER IS SUPPOSED TO BE BRAZILIAN BUT HE DOESNT EVEN PRONUNCIATE HER NAME RIGHT!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dialogue doesn't feel natural, and Nomad (main char) loves to say shii(t)balls\r\n\r\n Gameplay: Stealth is undeniably fun, but saying the AI is “lacking” is an understatement. Because of that, Extreme difficulty is the only real challenge. (You get detected more easily, die in one or two shots, and enemies aren’t auto-pinged on your minimap.)\r\n\r\n  The problem is, the game doesn’t have the foundational mechanics to support that difficulty. The sound design is weak, and the combat system is clunky. To make up for the dumb AI, they just gave them aimbot-level accuracy and godlike awareness. Like, if you shoot a guy 400m away and someone happens to spot the body? Suddenly the entire base knows you’re behind that specific bush, they will ´´Hunt´´ you like they don't know where you are, but they know and they will rush to you.\r\n\r\n The game does not reward stealth in any substantial way. \r\n\r\nYou can adapt to your AI teammate's lack of proactivity when you stop seeing them as humans, and more like drones. \r\n\r\nDriving  is quite fun when you ignore the wonky gravity, the problem is, the topography of the map indirectly forces you to use helicopters, either because off-roading equals bumping into rocks 24/7 and flipping your car, or driving around the objective that should be 1.3km away, and turns into 3.5km trip. \r\n\r\nStill, even with the criticism, doing 100% still feels rewarding, and again, as much stealth is not rewarded and extreme difficulty is more on the annoying side than difficult, you can adapt, and it is satisfying to do so. \r\n\r\nCustomization is pretty good, a lot of options are behind loot boxes so not gud, but you can make unique soldiers with the standard stuff.\r\n\r\nThe DLCs......\r\n\r\nNarco Road is extremely disjointed from the main game, it's an attempted Just Cause-styled drama/gameplay loop but you know, this isn't Just Cause, If you’re not chasing 100% completion, and it’s not on a fat discount, I wouldn’t recommend it. \r\n\r\nFallen Ghost is more of the same, nothing unique, no new combat loop, yes, new enemies but nothing substantial story/gameplay wise.",

      "review": "Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands is an open-world tactical shooter built around cooperative play, infiltration, and large-scale mission freedom. Set in a fictionalized Bolivia dominated by a powerful cartel, the game presents a sprawling landscape of mountains, jungle, deserts, and rural settlements. Its design emphasizes player-driven approaches, allowing stealth, direct assaults, or mixed tactics depending on preference.\n\nThe narrative follows a four-person Ghost team tasked with dismantling the Santa Blanca cartel by targeting key lieutenants and destabilizing its operations. Story progression is segmented into regional arcs, each focused on a specific cartel figure with their own personality, influence, and mission chain. While the overarching plot remains straightforward, the structure provides consistent goals and context for each zone.\n\nGameplay centers on coordinated tactics. Players can mark targets, sync-shot enemies, deploy drones, breach compounds, and plan multi-angle attacks. The AI teammates function reliably, enabling solo players to execute synchronized eliminations. In co-op, coordination becomes more dynamic, turning infiltration and extraction into fluid team operations. The variety of weapons, attachments, and gadgets supports experimentation.\n\nThe open world is one of the game’s strongest elements. Each province offers different terrain, enemy density, and environmental obstacles, encouraging players to adjust strategies. Helicopters, motorbikes, trucks, and boats provide rapid traversal across wide distances. Side activities such as resource raids, convoy interceptions, and rebel support missions contribute to progression while keeping the environment active.\n\nEnemy encounters combine patrols, fortified bases, and cartel-controlled towns. Outposts are designed with multiple entry points, vantage positions, and varied security levels, enabling stealth paths or high-intensity assaults. The presence of Unidad—the hostile military force—adds an extra layer of tension, as their involvement escalates difficulty quickly.\n\nPresentation highlights the environmental scale. Day-night cycles, weather changes, and distant vistas reinforce the sense of a living landscape. Audio design supports tension with distinct gunfire, radio chatter, and situational music. While character animations and dialogue can feel utilitarian, the world itself remains visually cohesive and functional for tactical play.\n\nTom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands succeeds as a cooperative, open-ended tactical shooter that gives players broad control over how missions unfold. Its strengths lie in world scale, flexible combat systems, and replayable infiltration scenarios. For players seeking a large, mission-driven sandbox focused on teamwork and planning, it provides a comprehensive and adaptable experience.",

      "review": "Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon: Wildlands is… fine, but it trips over its own ambitions more often than not. I enjoyed clearing territories and watching the map open up, but the experience becomes painfully repetitive, same missions, same enemies, same side-quests, same grind. It all starts to feel copy-pasted after a while.\r\n\r\nTier mode doesn’t help. If you want to progress, you’re forced to play on Extreme difficulty, which basically turns every enemy into an instant aimbot. They either rush you and melt you in two seconds, or they glitch out and stand still. About 90% of the difficulty comes from fighting the game’s buggy AI and janky mechanics, not actual challenge.\r\n\r\nBasic gameplay logistics are equally frustrating. Fail a mission and you might respawn 3km away thanks to the broken checkpoint system. Call in a vehicle? The game happily spawns it 2km away on the nearest road, which is almost never where you need it. And the vehicle selection itself is bizarrely limited, your default options are a sedan, an MRAP, or a dingy little helicopter. If you want anything more interesting, even after grinding the entire game to completion, you have to go hunt it down manually.\r\n\r\nRescue missions are the worst offenders, you’re expected to pull some clueless NPC out of a building stuffed with aimbot enemies, and the mission can fail just because the person you’re rescuing decides to bug out and get stuck inside.\r\n\r\nTo top it off, I had to mute in-game voices for the last 30 hours thanks to a bug that made my AI teammate repeat the same cringey line nonstop.\r\n\r\nOverall, Wildlands is “just okay.” A huge open world with surprisingly little to do besides grind, bogged down by repetitive content, technical issues, and inconsistent AI. I finished it, but with minimal enjoyment.\r\n\r\n5/10 - Play if you have nothing else to do or play",

The Fallen Ghosts package is essential I would recommend it highly also. I have been trying to get a similar experience with Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Breakpoint, The Division 2, etc. There's just something about this gaming world that is so alive simply put. The characters dialogue makes the game so much better. When characters act like the simulator from Rick and Morty at level 1 playing \"People Music\" on the radio and stuff, it kinda kills the game in the other Ghost Recon games. This game is full of hyperbolic dialect, funny cultural references, and awesome war dialogue from your soldiers. The guns and their customization are heavily emphasized and I find the weapons to be fun, unlike the other Ghost Recon more recently where the guns sound like pop guns from a toy store or nerf guns almost. Also, the vehicles handle in a more fun way overall, unsure exactly why. I find the missions also to be much more fun than the other games because they are slightly more straightforward and more rewarding while in the other games again the reward is probably another pop-gun with crappy customization options making everything feel the same. \n\nThis game is along the lines of Far Cry 5, it's just a perfect specimen, before it got ruined by its successors. I really hope they make a game like this again, I can guarentee it's because they brought cool people onto the team during the development of this game, just like how Far Cry 5 had a team change when they developed Far Cry 6 which I almost considered unplayable. Montreal created Far Cry 5, while Far Cry 6 was developed in the USA. \n\nBRING BACK UBISOFT PARIS / MONTREAL",

      "review": "I'm torn about this game. It definitely is good overall, but I have rarely ever had a single player game be so rage inducing. Why? Because of the ai controlled teammates.\nLet's split the game into positive and negative aspects.\n\nFirst the negative, because I just had to rage quit before getting a stomach ulcer.\n- The ai controlled teammates are HORRENDOUS in the sense of actual gameplay. Even if they try to be useful, they really aren't. I catch them standing around in the middle of a fight, while looking completely lost and just getting blasted by bullets. But that isn't the worst part. The worst part is their unparalleled ability to be three miles away, while you are in the enemy base fighting for your life. I don't know, if they are taking a sh*t in a bush or having a smoke, but they are so far away, they aren't even on the minimap. If I then go down against two dozen enemies in an Unidad camp, they finally run in to do their only actual job (being a one or two time medkit), but even then they manage to screw up and die on the way or get stuck or something else. And in a stealth mission? Yeah... Forget it. I had to redo missions so many times, because I have to play as a one man army with three brain cells tagging along and making my life hell.\n- Then there is the problem with the start-up time, which is enormous (even if the Ubisoft thing is already running, it doesn't matter wait time stays the same). I can easily start the game and then have breakfast, before it finally fully starts (probably 15 to 20 minutes). People should plan for a long wait. At least it will be stable, once it finally managed to get going.\n- The controls feel pretty clunky at times, due to the age of the game. Things like Nomad having a seizure behind cover or facing the wrong way and straight up refusing to simply turn around are a regular occurence. Such things. Sometimes you just have to fight the bad guys and the controls at the same time.\n- My final grief is the climbing mechanic... I'm pretty sick and tired of being told where I can climb or not. If there is a spot a primary school kid could climb, but a Special Forces Operator can't do it, because the game says \"No\"... then I feel (rightfully) annoyed.\n\nNow the positives. And don't get me wrong, there are a lot of those, too. I'm just so fed up with the ai... >_>\n- There is a lot to do with all the main missions, side mission, collectibles and what not.\n- The overarching story is good and every bad guy (or every señora mala ;P) has their own story. They are fleshed out characters with their own background and personality. Some are even likable to a degree or you feel bad for one or two of them.\n- The environment looks nice and diverse. It is rare to notice buildings repeating due to being used too often. Villages/towns, camps and other places feel unique.\n- The game gives lots of opportunities for customization. You can \"dress up\" both the main character and the other three brain cells (aka the teammates). Most of the weapons are also very customizable in both function and appearance. It is easy to choose a personal playstyle and then do it fashionably.\n\nAll in all it is an entertaining game, if you can look past the frustrations and don't mind being sabotaged by your teammates. I shut down the game in frustration again and again, but I also try again (and again) the next day, because I want to know the rest of the story.\nPersonally I bought it on a huge sale (80% discount) and it definitely is worth the money I paid. But I'm not sure about paying the full price, though. I would recommend waiting for a sale and I also advocate for playing Wildlands before Breakpoint, due to the improvements to the mechanics in Breakpoint, which makes Wildlands feel clunky (as I mentioned before). And obviously because Breakpoint kinda sorta continues the story and is set after Wildlands. (I started Breakpoint first, because it was on sale first XD Now I regret it a little, due to the frustration I feel regarding the older controls.)\nAnd if you are easily enraged by having to babysit three imbeciles... then maybe this isn't for you. Spare yourself the stomach ulcers. ;D",

      "review": "I quite enjoyed this game, especially more so with friends. Combat in this game is good and satisfying. Enemies are not bullet sponges you can easily kill them with 3-4 bullets. But same rules apply to you, you are no bullet sponge either at close range you die fairly quickly like a effing NPC. Playing solo in higher difficulty zones becomes a real challenge since there's no one to cover you or correct your mistake or revive you if you die (though you can always use AI teammates). But I don't think I am alone in this when I say that the slowed bullet velocity and bullet drop in this game is exaggerated from what I know it is intentional. Recoil also feels to much sometimes since most of the strong guns have high recoil.  Mission variety is good you won't get bored and it's not repetitive. The bosses in this game have interesting stories. The world has a variety of biomes from deserts and forests to snowy mountains, swamps and sometimes underground bases. Though for me the map is slightly too big and travelling from one point to the other gets a bit boring (but not if you put the first person mod). The weapon customisation is satisfying you can put like 6 attachments each having more than 5 options to choose from. There are plenty of weapons to choose from like 30-40+. But some weapons are locked behind weapon crates which either needs to be bought or you need to get to level 30 to buy the crates with in-game currency. Player customisation is also good though quite a few items are again locked behind crates (you know Ubisoft with their micro-transactions). And I don't know why they made female operator faces so ugly there are only 2 which look OK, it's such bummer. But if you play as a man then don't worry all of them look like chads. Now the stealth in this game is not forgiving. Not because it is challenging but frustrating. You miss one shot with your sniper and the enemy runs like a mofo and it is almost impossible to shoot him again to stop him from alerting others since the bullet velocity is so slow that you have to aim a few centimetres forward predicting its path but that's not enough he immediately finds cover calls all of his homies and somehow they know my exact location even when I shot half a kilometre away from the base with a suppressor on. So being stealthy is really hard in this game. But yes, taking one enemy out while your buddy takes the other feels so damn satisfying and if you do everything right the stealth feels very rewarding.\n\nOne huge flaw in this game is the stuttering you get even after running the game at 60 fps and lowering most settings. One fix that works for most people is to download nvidia profile inspector and turn on frame limiter to 60, turn on vsyn and tripple buffering and vertical sync tear control to adaptive. Worked wonders for me. SSD is a must since the loading times are super long. And one more thing that gets annoying is that when you call for a vehicle, especially a heli they spawn like half a mile away.\n\nMy suggestions:\nAfter you get a hold of this game try playing it without the HUD, maybe just keep the map for navigation but after disabling the enemy location feature.\nIf you start to get bored try out the First Person View Mod. It is in my opinion a must. It adds an extra thick layer of immersion and realism and the world feels truly vast and believable. The installation of this mod is so easy even a 4 year old can do it. But your friend also needs to put the same mod if you want to play together. And don't worry you won't get banned.\nAnd personally the standard edition is enough you don't need to buy the ultimate unless you want the DLC which I have seen has mixed reviews.\n\nAll in all I'll give this game 7/10 and 8/10 with the FPS mod. If only the stealth was more realistic and the game was more optimised it can get more points.",

      "review": "Ghost Recon: Wildlands, I swear I own this on every platform because it is always so damn cheap and this is the first time I have ever sat down and done 100% of the story and collected everything so lets start from the top.\n\nThe story is set in Bolivia and you and your team of \"Ghosts\" are tasked with dismantling the Cartel using intelligence and other means, However with the sheer size of the map and the amount of missions each Cartel head has the game becomes a gruelling job of go here blow this up, follow this guy until you get the info and do this stealthy...that pretty much sums up the games missions and if I am honest I can see why I have bought this game so many times but never dismantled an area. Because it is so god damn boring doing the same shit over and over again. If like me you wanna 100% the game have patience and play a single region at a time, take a head out and take a break otherwise you're gonna burn out so fast.\n\nThe map is simply massive, well structured, well built and simply going from north to south you end up from a vast desert all the way to craggy and frozen mountains even through swamps, however all of this is purely visual and makes zero impact on the gameplay.\n\nThe Ghosts, this bothers me some as the devices you get given to be a Ghost aren't nearly enough, There are a few missions one in particular in Konai (Top-Left 5* area) and the mission is so simple, sneak in and take photographs of the documents, however the shed is swarming with enemies, the cartel having power, aswell as Jammer in the area so to disable these you have to get into the location that is locked down and surrounded. The enemies AI is absolutely busted, the wind can blow in their direction they will become \"suspected\" and if you use a silenced weapon to waste someone quitely down a back-alley or outside a warehouse someone inside will COME AND CHECK what they heard, A FUCKING SNEEZE NOISE FROM A PISTOL. So this caused real concern for me and I tried to outsmart the game, lower the jammer and use the drone to go take the photos...no, even though in missions prior I have filmed aswell as voice recorded certain situations...so why wasn't I able too in this one. I lowered the difficulty to Arcade I felt I was getting ripped off that badly and the AI persisted, I couldn't figure a way around this warehouse that had 6 guys in it... believe it I shot at a wall a few times with a silencer on and the group walked around the back as a pack to check what the noise was so I could go inside... Diversion Lure? Nope, causes an alert, Flash bang...Alert, set up sync shot with allies to kill 4 at once...ALERT...NOTHING WORKED, yet the game states we are GHOSTS. I had zero utility for this one mission but stupidity that worked out for me.\n\nThe Cartel itself have alot of background and some make a lot of noise whilst others are simple just find and kill or find and recover. Of all the Head Buchons only Nidia Flores had a storyline that felt worth listening to and watching the rest were just filler for some reason or poorly written it just felt like the story revolved around Nidia and how she started as the Beauty Queen and become the boss of smuggling and you got to see how she became more and more corrupted even in her final acts. I thought she was even more well written that Sueno who barely plays a role in the entire game if I honest, Nidia is mentioned in almost every region heads documents and she even has beef with a few of them.\n\nThe gameplay, it's a shoot em up that tries to take a twist on tactical combat. You start with basic weapons AR, pistol nothing much else. Snipers are useless early game as the scope barely surpasses 400m not to mention when you kill someone enemies become alert so ranged was pointless most of the time, I found once I upgraded Rebel Support to maximum, scouting erased every skill I had - Drone and Bino's became redundant so quickly as scouting would show every single enemy in the selected location which then allowed me to set up sync shots aswell as sneak attacks. Repeat this 5000 times the game gets extremely stale. \n\nArmory, the game has shit loads of weapons and accessories but whats the point if enemies don't spawn in until you're dead close or if you snipe the enemy AI will spot you from 300m away and then send a swarm to your last known location, this happened way too often the AI aren't smart but had super senses regardless of difficulty and it felt like most of the time the best option was just never to engage in combat or you would die due to being overwhelmed, this I noticed in the 5* Unidad locations. Enemies would spawn non-stop, X2 choppers and X2 APCs always aswell as footsoldiers to the 9. It never ended and even on EASY you die so fast, it's ridiculous. I could not imagine playing this game on anything higher than standard and I wouldn't even touch \"Ghost\" mode as you're not a fucking ghost with the tech you get given....\n\nOverall the game has SOME interesting elements not the gameplay and not the story but some parts of the story like I mentioned above are worth listening to. The enemy AI are too overtuned no matter the difficulty and the game is too drawn out with the size of the map aswell as how many cartel members you have to take out for 100% if you play just to beat it you can face El Sueno much earlier which I should have done as I was already bored by that point. \nIt's a 6/10 for me, something that really bothered me was rebel support if I asked for a chopper on a empty path in front of me why spawn it in on a mountain I can't climb or why place it in a Unidad base??\nAlso when jumping from a chopper why did I fall through the worlds floor at least 6 times when I played, how after 8 years hasn't this bug being fixed?\n\nOh and why is there multiplayer achievements,ffs...\n\nI still have the DLC to do...",

It never manages to create real tension or emotional weight, and after a few missions, it’s hard to stay invested. The side missions, which could have added variety, quickly become repetitive and formulaic, often feeling like filler content instead of meaningful objectives.\r\n\r\nBugs are also a major problem. During co-op sessions, several quests fail to activate properly, breaking progression and forcing frustrating restarts. The multiplayer connection system doesn’t help either joining or maintaining sessions with friends can be a chore, making teamwork feel like a battle of its own.\r\n\r\nOn a positive note, the skill system is at least decent, offering gradual upgrades that let you fine-tune your playstyle. There are also plenty of outfits and cosmetics to unlock through side activities, giving players some sense of reward for exploration.\r\n\r\nHowever, these small positives can’t outweigh the disappointing overall experience.

      "review": "It's so close to being a good game, but polish makes or breaks a stealth game, and this is comparable to coarse sandpaper.\n\nA stealth game needs to be completely predictable, so that if you get caught, you can only blame yourself.\nIt is not good stealth when an enemy can spot you crouching in the foliage in the dark, while wearing invisibility cloaking. It is not good stealth when I can't reliably take down an enemy with a melee attack, or when bodies are detectable, but you cannot move them.\nThe biggest example of this lack of polish is the Sam Fisher DLC mission, where you cannot kill anyone, nor get spotted, and whenever I would talk to him and get stuck in a cutscene, a guard, who did not see nor hear me, would walk up the stairs, notice me, and then that would fail the mission.\nWorst of all, I managed to distract him once with a flare, and after you talk with Sam, you have to then kill everyone. What was the point of not killing them, exactly?\n\nThe UI is fine, apart from the detection/damage indicator. Games 20 years before this game already figured this out. If the damage indicator points a nice horizontal right, you would assume that you are getting shot from 3 o'clock, right? No, you're actually being shot from somewhere between 12 and 1, and the moment you pass 1 with your crosshair, it switches back to a completely horizontal left, disorienting you until you get used to it.\n\nThe vehicles are janky, but this is incredibly fun when playing with friends.\nMortars are useless unless it's for destroying stuff like jammers. We would often joke that \"The game could really use a mortar upgrade that allows you to kill enemies\".\n\nAnother big issue with stealth is that they tried to recreate the Far Cry random event generator, like when you're clearing out outposts and a random tiger shows up for extra chaos. This worked great in Far Cry. Not at all here. You're doing a stealth mission, in a game with janky stealth mechanics, and what little predictability enemy behavior has is ruined by the fact that the rebels, or the other enemy force showed up (especially annoying with Unidad helicopters, forcing you to either get detected or shoot them down and get detected from that) and started shooting at the guys you are trying to sneak around.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that the game sucks cause it can't compare to stuff like MGSV, or Thief or something, but Ubisoft is well-known for making plenty of stealth classics that are either up there with the champions, or serving as the pillars they stand on, so this was massively disappointing.\n\nI will say that, although every character and plot development is pretty much a trope, I was surprised by the endings. They could've easily cheapened them, but they respected and cared enough for their art to keep the endings they did.\n\nIf it was just a bad game that'd be it, but the fact that this game has so much potential and care put into it makes the lack of polish sting so much more.",

The game features multiple difficulty levels, each of which significantly alters how players approach missions:\n\nArcade Mode: Ideal for casual players, this mode allows for more forgiving enemy AI and plenty of room for error. It’s great for those who just want to enjoy the game’s story and explore the world without constant tension.\n\nRegular Mode: A balanced experience that still allows for tactical play but with a safety net. Enemies pose a moderate challenge, and resources are plentiful.\n\nAdvanced Mode: Requires more strategic thinking. Enemies are more aggressive, reinforcements arrive quicker, and stealth becomes much more important.\n\nExtreme Mode: The ultimate test for tactical players. One wrong move can cost you the entire mission. Enemy AI is relentless, spotting you quicker, coordinating attacks, and responding with deadly precision.\n\nThe difficulty settings make a huge difference in how the game feels. On lower difficulties, you can get away with run-and-gun tactics, but on Extreme, every engagement requires careful planning, drone scouting, and synchronized shots.\n\nThe Immersion of Ghost Mode Is Insane:\nFor players seeking the most intense, realistic, and immersive experience, Ghost Mode is where Wildlands truly shines. Introduced in a later update, Ghost Mode transforms the game into a high-stakes, permadeath tactical operation. Here’s why it stands out:\n\nPermadeath: If you die, you start over. No second chances. This adds an immense level of tension and forces you to play carefully.\nLimited Resources: You can only carry one primary weapon at a time, making loadout choices critical.\nRealistic Reloading: Partial reloads discard any remaining bullets in a magazine, requiring proper ammo management.\nNo HUD or Minimal Assistance: The absence of traditional game aids increases immersion, requiring players to rely on natural navigation and observation.\nTeamwork is Everything: Whether playing solo with AI teammates or in co-op, every action must be coordinated to avoid detection and minimize risks.\n\nGhost Mode enhances the tactical depth of Wildlands, making it feel like a true special operations experience. Every mission becomes a carefully planned operation where one mistake could mean losing hours of progress.\n\nSo basically it gives players the freedom of choice in difficulty and how they wanna play.\n\nBUT, Tier One mode is just pain disguised as a challenge.(when you go above 20) Enemies have god-tier aim, body armor that might as well be plot armor, and somehow, their bullets hit harder than yours even when you're using the same gun and upgraded it to LEVLEL FUCKING 30. You spend more time crawling in the dirt, waiting for revives, and praying your AI squad actually does something useful. And the XP grind? Might as well be a second job.  \nHonestly, Tier One mode feels less like a tactical shooter and more like a \"how much suffering can you endure before uninstalling\" simulator. (unless you are a content creator farming for views and glaze how good this mode is.)\n\nAlso Ubisoft being Ubisoft took down taskforce servers so no special tasks to grind Prestige Credits, Fucking Bastards also locked localization settings so god forbid you want another language pack, its a pain to fix. 7/10\n\n----------------------------------\n\nNow lets talk about 2 major DLC's:\n\nFirst is Narco Road: \nWhy Narco Road is Terrible!\n\nRepetitive, Hollow Gameplay\n\nThe DLC swaps out the tactical squad-based missions that made the base game unique for shallow, recycled side activities.\n\nMost “missions” are copy-pasted tasks: chasing cars, blowing up convoys, or racing — none of which fit the Ghost Recon identity.\n\nAwful Follower System, Basically Progression is kinda tied to grinding “followers” (basically social media clout), which feels more like a parody of Ubisoft’s obsession with metrics than meaningful gameplay.\n\nIt’s not satisfying — instead of rewarding tactical play, it forces players into repetitive stunt missions.\n\nAchievements/trophies are tied to this pointless follower mechanic, making completionists suffer through content that already feels tedious.\n\nDriving & Vehicle Handling = Worst in Class\n\nWildlands already had notoriously bad driving physics — Narco Road doubles down on it by centering DLC around racing and stunts.\n\nThe result? Floaty cars, stiff steering, zero grip, and controls that feel more broken than fun.\nNot to mention the LSD-like Nitro System, Instead of improving driving, Ubisoft slapped on a ridiculous “nitro boost” that turns vehicles into uncontrollable, glowing missiles.\n\nIt looks and feels more like a cartoon power-up than anything grounded in the Ghost Recon world.\n\nThe Tone-Deaf Design:\nThe gritty cartel narrative of Wildlands is replaced with an over-the-top “extreme sports narco celebrity” vibe.\nIt clashes so hard with the base game’s identity that it feels like a parody DLC, not a serious expansion.\n\nAND THE CHARACTERS WONT SHUT THE FUCK UP. 0/10\n\n-----------------------------\nSecond is Fallen Ghosts:\nBack to Tactical Roots\n\nUnlike Narco Road, this DLC doesn’t forget what Ghost Recon is supposed to be: stealth, strategy, and squad-based infiltration.\n\nThe missions are built around sneaking, planning, and using your tools effectively — not grinding meaningless side tasks.\n\nNew Enemies Actually Add Challenge, Introduces tougher enemy types (snipers, jammers, armored heavies, cloaked assassins).\n\nThey force you to change tactics instead of steamrolling every fight with the same strategy.\n\nSometimes it feels a bit “Ubisoft-y” (throwing gimmick enemies instead of smarter AI), but overall it keeps you on your toes.\n\nYou’re stranded after a helicopter crash with limited resources.\nThat setup ALONE feels more desperate and immersive compared to the cartoonish tone of Narco Road.\n\nBetter progression: New weapons and skills feel meaningful instead of grindy. \nSadly it's a bit short tho. 8/10",

It never manages to create real tension or emotional weight, and after a few missions, it’s hard to stay invested. The side missions, which could have added variety, quickly become repetitive and formulaic, often feeling like filler content instead of meaningful objectives.\r\n\r\nBugs are also a major problem. During co-op sessions, several quests fail to activate properly, breaking progression and forcing frustrating restarts. The multiplayer connection system doesn’t help either joining or maintaining sessions with friends can be a chore, making teamwork feel like a battle of its own.\r\n\r\nOn a positive note, the skill system is at least decent, offering gradual upgrades that let you fine-tune your playstyle. There are also plenty of outfits and cosmetics to unlock through side activities, giving players some sense of reward for exploration.\r\n\r\nHowever, these small positives can’t outweigh the disappointing overall experience. The multiplayer, in particular, was chaotic and buggy, to the point where it overshadowed the game’s potential.

Additionally, online connectivity is inconsistent – sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Given the game's instability, I wouldn't recommend it.

You can't direct your squad individually, only tell them to regroup but that becomes pointless as they just warp to your position anyway.\n\nI've experienced a countless number of bugs from falling through the terrain to being unable to vault objects.\n\nIt's a game I will finish just to see if it gets any better but so far, its not a Ghost Recon game at all. I bought for less than £5 and I wouldnt pay any more than that for it if I'm honest,\n\nThe customisation options are fun especially as you can customise the whole squad but that lasts about 20 minutes before you've seen everything and won't go back to it, different cosmetics don't seem to add any bonus to detection or combat.",

      "review": "This must be second worst game Ubisoft ever made since Far Cry 2, in fact Ghost Recon: Wildlands even worse than Far Cry 2 ever was.\nThis piece of garbage took me almost THREE YEARS to complete and at least 8 drops of a game, but F**KING FINALLY I HAVE NO MORE REASON TO REMEMBER THIS GAME AND GOD FORBID PLAY IT EVER AGAIN!\n\n\nWhoever the f**k inside of the studios walls thought \"hmm, let's try to make Ghost Recon in a open-world, but fully use Tom Clancy's The Division base\", not only that Ghost Recon and The Division games are FUNDEMENTALLY DIFFERENT but also first The Division game is also a pile of garbage that has nothing great but style of snowy winter post-apocalyptic-ish NYC, but anyways, that's a story for another time, let's talk about what's wrong with Wildlands: ... pRetTy MuCh EvErYtHiNg, yeah.\n\nEnemies on both minimal and maximum difficulty barely use ANY cover, they're either barely move and just be standing in the wide open field (which is about 80-90% of this game's garbage ass map, lol) or will just rush you while running in a straight line without any thought or tactic to one-shot you in the end with LITERALLY ANY WEAPON, no matter if it's a shotgun, pistol, AR or SMG, if you are playing above medium difficulty - you're a dead man in any Loud Playstyle situation.\n\nGame has no tactic or strategy whatsoever, in fact - rebel system can do 50-70% of your job. There's a drone jammer on the outpost that you cannot get to or at least get to turn off the generator? - PFFT, JUST CALL IN REBEL SCAN THROUGH THE TAB MENU, which scans EVERYONE and EVERYTHING through WALLS or inside of the caves and buildings also inside of a pretty large spot-zone with cooldown timer of 60 seconds, holy moly my balls are falling apart because of these tactical big braind opportunities!!!|\n\nYou're in a middle of the fight or just want to distract enemy forces off the outpost to do something else? - You can either shoot a signal rocket while standing somewhere outside of an outpost and 80% of armed personnel will just, well, LeAvE tHe OuTpOsT tO sEe WhAt HaS jUsT hApPeNeD, or you can call in Rebel-Infantry Backup or send Rebel Mortar Strike on the half of the outpost, even though Mortar Strike in this game is actually useless (both friendly and enemy strikes).\n\nFor some f**king reason, the \"pEaK oF tAcTiCaL sHoOtErS\" (MGS series, please, step aside) doesn't even have SMOKE GRENADES IN IT'S INVENTORY, so if you're in the middle of a difficult fight with maximum wanted level - you're just f**ked with NO ability to retreat in ANY way, especially if you're fighting inside of a zone that's affected by an enemy drone jammer.\n\nEnemies are literally spotting player through walls, inside of bunch of bushes, laying in a grass, with camouflage, without camouflage, in the day or in the middle of a night, because these morons didn't forget to add ALOT of grind for perks and upgrades but forgot to add basic f**king thing like an ACTUAL stealth and hiding system that was present in stealth games since like, what, early 2000s? You CANNOT hide ANYWHERE, you CANNOT do ANYTHING if you're getting spotted but to kill an enemy who's doing that, BUT EVEN THAN - YOU CAN'T EVEN MOVE THE GOD DAMN DEAD BODY. THIS GAME CAME OUT IN 2017, AFTER LIKE AT LEAST 7-8 METAL GEAR SOLID GAMES ONE OF WHICH BEING THE PHANTOM PAIN, YOU SIMPLY CANNOT F**CK EVERYTHING UP THIS BADLY IF YOU'RE NOT DOING IT ON PURPOSE.\n\nEnemies NEVER lose sight of a player and all the time trying to shoot you through SOLID WALLS AND OBSTICLES, enemies also can gun you down with an akimbo SMG while barely aiming or not aiming at all on AT LEAST AROUND 200 METERS DISTANCE WITH JUST FIRING THREE FIRST BULLETS STRAIGHT AT YOU, enemies also shoot on ANY distance IN A STRAIGHT F**CKING LINE WITH NO BULLET SPREAD WHATSOEVER (of course, dear player, you cannot do that, as because EVERY God damn weapon in this game (except, perhaps, sniper rifles) has a bullet spread of your drunk father's piss on a toilet and a recoil of a horse kick to a face).\n\nWhile in Stealth - even the strongest, armored enemies will fall down from a SINGULAR pistol bullet to the helmet.\nWhen in Loud mode - enemies will sometimes eat multiple DMR bullets to the naked skull or a body that's only covered with a couple of tattoos and a stinky tank top.\n\nYour bullets are also not stunning any of the enemy classes, so you better aim to the head or abuse the living crap out of this game to kill everyone on location.\nOh, did I also mention that this \"pEaK oF tAcTiCaL sHoOtErS\" that doesn't even have smoke grenades inside of it's arsenal, also have NO blind firing while using cover? Well, now I did mention it, wanna give a little personal F**K YOU to a bunch of morons who designed this pile of garbage.\n\nGround vehicles are f**king diabolical to use, that's just it. Airborne transport is not really any better, but at least helicopter is tolerable enough.\n\nAnti-Aircraft launchers are another poorly designed mess, as they do not give any sh*t how low are you flying or how many trees/houses around you, you either just fly hiding behind the mountains or pray that you have enough time to escape it's range, there's also no point in destroying those things as they respawn even with a simple reload of checkpoint.\n\nEvery grenade, C4, even Mortar Launchers have visualized radius on the ground, for explosives it's bright red and for flash grenade it's bright white, also mechanics taken straight out of 2016's The Division game together with all of the animations and of course - gameplay that sucks ass. Also grenades can't roll down hills/stairs or anything and just stick to the ground once they fall down.\n\nIt's clear as day that everyone who worked on this either never played any of the Ghost Recon games or never worked on a videogame before, as they clearly had no clue what the hell they were doing with this product of this genre.\n\n\nMusic made by Alain Johannes kicks ass, it's cool and very nice sounding, sadly it's a huge waste of talent because you rarely hear it while fighting (I don't think that I've ever heard any soundtrack while in fight)  and missions are poorly designed garbage in which music only plays during travel time and then never again (also the game itself sucks ass).\n\n\nStory is actually not that bad, but you'll have to play ALL of the story missions (all bosses, mini-bosses, and both of the Ricky Sandoval missions) to actually get an somewhat worthy ending, or at least satisfacting-ish one, but it's going ot be painful if you'll choose to play all of them.\n\n\nIt's better to avoid this game as hard as possible, but if FOR SOME REASON you'll choose to play it - either play it solo with bots by which you'll have at least SOME chances for survival or if you want to play it with those people you call \"friends\" - play it on minimal difficulty and never set it above medium.\n\n\nThis game is on unimaginable before levels of ass, an unbearable barely playable piece of f**king dogsh*t, I hope that no one ever has to play this garbage and experience any of this.\n\nI'll give this game -100 out of 10, just go get yourself a copy of Ghost Recon Breakpoint or any of the better games, like Metal Gear Solid V.\n\n\nP.S. - Also little note to everyone who \"designed\" this or \"playtested\" this: [b]I will see all of you in Hell[/b].",
