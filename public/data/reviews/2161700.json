What i won't let slide is the fact that the dlc is a complete scam and shouldn't cost more than 5$, it just feels like a huge troll by the devs. Oh you want to see the conclusion to the base game's story? Buy overpriced dlc, torture yourself through 100+ dungeon floors with nothing else going on, only to see a 2 minute cutscene! You might aswell just watch it on youtube unless for whatever reason you like tartarus so much that you wanna spend 35$ for it. The end of the dlc is nice, yes, but it should've been in the base game. \n\nAnyways, i'd recommend this game only if you haven't played FES/portable and can get it on sale. Now excuse me because i must go romance ChatGPT so it comes to my house in 10 years.",

Jumping from the visual novel style of the PSP version into this was just an amazing feeling. You finally get to experience every action and emotional scene fully animated, which P3P was lacking. Plus, they fleshed out some character interactions and development through Link Episodes, which made some key moments more impactful. The remixed and newly added musical scores are also just as amazing. ATLUS gave me more reason to listen to the P3 soundtrack on repeat again, in the same way as when I first experienced P3P. P3Reload is basically P3 injected with P5's blood and style, which is a good thing. If this is how they remade P3, then I can't wait to see how they cook JoJo Part 4... I mean P4's remake.\n\nMemento Mori, Memento Vivere. Will lie down and cry again for another 100+ hours just to get all the achievements.",

Everything in this game was made with care, with lots of effort and time put into every small detail. I came into this game nothing absolutely nothing about it; in fact I had bad expectations for this game due to the fact that it was an anime, but it proved me wrong and blew me away. This game is very addicting, I bought the game a week ago and I spent 2 days playing the game for 13 hours straight on each day. Persona 3 Reload is my first ever true RPG, as well as my first turn based game, so I didn't/don't know what to expect but for me, the combat is spectacular. You can't just attack on every turn, you have to play with strategy while considering other factors in the battle. This game is also really hard, and even harder if you don't know what your doing, even on normal mode. The UI, mechanics, everything about this game is so smooth. The soundtrack is probably one of the best soundtracks I have heard in anything, if not the best. It fits perfectly into the situation the game is portraying, and the songs are so catchy and are actually amazing. Overall, I feel that this game is perfect and for that reason I'm giving it a 10/10.",

      "review": "Keep in mind I beat it on PS5. I played a bit of FES on PS2, before I wrote this review.\r\n\r\nPersona 3 Reload is a fascinating remake — one that takes a beloved classic and bathes it in modern polish. From the moment the opening theme plays, it’s clear that ATLUS poured genuine care into revitalizing this world. The music, a perfect mix of nostalgic remixes and new energetic tracks, sets the mood brilliantly. It’s stylish, emotional, and unforgettable — a soundtrack that makes even the most mundane moments feel alive.\r\n\r\nThe heart of Reload, though, lies in its characters. Spending time with SEES is still one of the highlights of the game. Aigis, in particular, shines more than ever — her emotional journey is handled with subtlety and warmth, and her connection to Makoto Yuki (the protagonist) remains one of the series’ most touching dynamics. Akihiko Sanada also stands out, his blend of stoic discipline and quiet vulnerability making every scene with him memorable. The voice acting and updated character models breathe new life into these familiar faces, making it easy to fall in love with them all over again.\r\n\r\nHowever, for all its style and emotional weight, Persona 3 Reload can sometimes test your patience. Tartarus, the massive, ever-changing tower that serves as the game’s main dungeon, is still a slog after the first several hours. The first 50 or so floors carry a sense of discovery and tension — but after that, the repetition sets in. The layouts start to blur together, and even with the improved combat system, grinding through wave after wave of Shadows begins to feel like a chore rather than a challenge. It’s a shame, because the story pacing and atmosphere deserve a more engaging dungeon experience.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Persona 3 Reload is a stunning and heartfelt remake that captures the soul of the original — its themes of mortality, connection, and purpose remain as powerful as ever. But while its emotional highs and incredible music kept me invested, the tedious grind of Tartarus sometimes broke the immersion.\r\n\r\nStill, for fans old and new, this journey with Aigis, Makoto, Akihiko, and the rest of SEES is absolutely worth taking — even if you might find yourself wishing the climb through Tartarus were just a bit shorter.",

      "review": "If you like any of the Persona games, you should play it!\n\nPersona 3 Reload is a faithful remastered version of Persona 3, with upgraded graphics, gameplay and music (some are downgraded imo). This game balances the social sim and action/dungeon-crawling elements very well. I'm sure most people will be getting into this game after playing Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal. If you enjoyed that game, this game is surely a game that you will enjoy. However, keep in mind that I didn't finish this game yet, so my review on this game may be incomplete.\n\nFirst of all, the cast of this game is amazing. Like any other Persona games, the casts all have their own deep stories that makes each of them unique. Persona games do a very good job at making you feel connected to the characters, and the character development add to the connections that you will form with the characters throughout your gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay is also significantly enhanced from the older Persona 3 games. No more moving around blue/pink circles across your screen to interact with things! You as a character will be able to walk around and interact with your environment. Plus, the combat system is enhanced so that there are a lot to learn for returning players, but also intuitive enough for newer players to get into. One thing to note however, unlike Persona 5 Royal, where there are palaces, Persona 3 Reload has a dungeon system where it acts similar to Mementos in Persona 5 Royal. The dungeon is basically a huge tower that changes each time you enter, so bare that in mind if that was something that you didn't enjoy.\n\nLastly, the music. Oh, the music in Persona games never fail to amaze me. If Persona 5 Royal had music that was heavily influenced by neo-soul and jazz, Persona 3 Reload has music that are influenced by old-school hip-hop, and rock. The blaring horns with the old-school drum patterns, the distorted guitars, the call and response in the rapping, the pianos and crowd chants really remind me of hip-hop in the 90s like Ice Cube.\n\nOverall, you can tell that there are so many details in this game that harmonize well that resulted in a game that engages the player and immerses them in a very interesting world. As I've mentioned many times before in this review, if you enjoyed any of the Persona games, this one is a must play.",

The monad doors at the different gates have been my favorite part of battling, because they are optional battles with increased difficulty, and each of the bosses has a unique battle style that becomes apparent to the player, and makes it fun to work around. There's also just a lot to do, whether it's working on confidants, social stats, grinding in tartarus, or fulfilling Elizabeth's requests.

But it is certainly a worthwhile one.\r\nThe story, which surrounds these themes, is gripping and emotional. You spend so much time getting to know your allies and can't help but get invested in it all. Very few games have made me cry as the credits roll, but this was one of them.\r\n\r\nThe game is visually stunning, particularly in the UI, battles, main set pieces, and cutscenes. I love the designs of the characters, Personas, and even the enemies.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack is flawless. Consistently good music, whether it be It's Going Down Now or Color Your Night, the game is constantly enhanced by what is easily one of the best game OSTs. \r\n\r\nThe dialogue and character interactions are a joy to experience. At times, its hilarious, but there are plenty of moments that will tug at your heartstrings too. A welcome change from Persona 5 is that much more dialogue in the game is fully voice acted. Oh, and the voice actors are great!\r\n\r\nThe turn-based gameplay is fundamentally simple, but satisfying nonetheless. Some of the boss fights have unique quirks that keep things interesting. And its always fun to see you and your team get stronger, gaining new gear and abilities as you continue upward. \r\n\r\nOverall, this game is a must play in my opinion.\r\nFace the Dark Hour and go on an unforgettable journey.",

They've all got their own unique quirks and personalities and it makes the interactions between them really fun to watch. Some of the side characters that you're supposed to form bonds with to increase your social standing aren't nearly as interesting as the main characters, but I think that's the case with any Persona game.\r\nIn terms of combat, there's some strategy that goes into making sure you have a properly assembled party so that you can deal with any shadows you come across. It's easy to make a party that hits all of the major elemental types, but then you've got to account for any stronger enemies that don't have weaknesses and need to be debuffed to beat.\r\nFor exploration, the overworld can get repetitive because it takes place within a tower that has an unknown number of floors, but the varieties of floor aren't that many. If you've played Persona 5, it would be like the entire thing takes place in Mementos with no palaces.\r\n\r\nCompared to P5R which is the only other Persona game I've played, this game is a close second. There are some QoL improvements that were made in P5R which makes sense since that came out after P3, but all in all this is a great game.",

If you're unaware, Persona is basically Pokemon with demons. I had fun but there are some caveats. If I had to give the game a score, I'd give it a 7/10. \n\nI don't think I would have enjoyed it as much if I wasn't familiar with the SMT series. Weak social links / quests, forgettable environments and a lot of enemy re-use really keep this game from being a solid recommend. Coming from Persona 5 Royal, this games feels like it's missing a lot. Persona 3 originally came out in 2006, so you have to keep that in mind when playing; it's a somewhat tedious JRPG from the PS2 era. Also, despite the new coat of paint (pretty as it may be), it can feel old at times. \n\nYou can't get the feel of a Persona game within the Steam refund window, so I'd recommend grabbing it on sale to see what all the hype is about; however, if you like anime and JRPGs, this is kind of a no brainer.",

The only characters I thought were under cooked was Takaya and Jin, but I'll get into that in the cons.\n\n- Graphics + art style is clean. Cutscenes were amazing too, especially the 3D ones.\n\n- OST is absolutely incredible. Not a single miss.\n\n- Combat is unique and very fun, almost every boss switches up your strategy.\n\n- The story overall is pretty good, but the ending was absolutely incredible. It was one of the most emotional scenes I have ever seen in fiction. I was crying for the final half hour of the game.\n\nCons:\n- Tartarus is extremely tedious and feels like a chore, and unfortunately, takes up a large chunk of the game.\n\n- The story did not need to be this long. The big plot moments are sometimes very far apart. The middle of the game just felt like it dragged on way too long, and could have been cut in half. \nBasically, after the prologue, the pacing of the story is pretty bad until the final 20 hours of the game where it picks up again.\n\n- (SPOILERS) Strega, besides Chihiro, was very underwhelming. Like I said earlier, Takaya and Jin felt very undercooked. As the main antagonists of the game, you would expect them to have more of an impact on the story, but they really don't. The biggest thing they did was kill off a character that was already going to die anyway. When we finally fight them at the end, the boss fights are very underwhelming and easy. And Takaya literally has no conclusion to his character. He just dies and that's it.\n\nOverall 8/10",

I'll be making some comparisons to P5, which for context, I really enjoyed.\n\n[h3]Strengths[/h3]\n[hr][/hr]\n[list]\n[*] Pretty crisp UI; almost as good as P5.\n[*] Gameplay loop of leveling up social links and stats is as addictive as ever.\n[*] Great vocal performances (I played in English). The voice acting does wonders for making the characters feel like real people.\n[*] Most of the big emotional moments hit for me, especially the epilogue.\n[*] I liked the 3 physical damage types and weapon variety more than P5's melee & ranged attack system. The different types of attacks available to different party members helps them feel distinct.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Drawbacks[/h3]\n[hr][/hr]\n[list]\n[*] The actual graphics are a tad blurry. I got used to it but I was expecting a cleaner look from a remake.\n[*] Persona fusion (the primary means of getting stronger) is an unsatisfying system for me. I had the same problem with P5.\n[*] I don't like how the time management system incentivizes you to spend a lot of time in Tartarus (the combat grind area) in a single day. The pacing would be better if you could switch more frequently between combat and day-to-day things instead of doing them in big chunks. I had the same problem with Persona 5 and Fire Emblem: Three Houses.\n[*] Character writing is pretty hit or miss. At times it's melodramatic and some character stories are a bit dull. Some characters have great payoffs with excellent emotional performances, others are very forgettable.\n[*] The plot is pretty weak. There's very little driving the story until halfway through the story, and even then it's a bit generic. Where P5 consistently creates compelling plot hooks for each month and sets up villains you want to defeat, P3R simply has you wait a month until you fight the next boss.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Recommendation[/h3]\n[hr][/hr]\nIn many ways, this game has a lot more rough edges than P5, especially in regards to the plot and writing. While there are good payoffs, there's not a lot propelling events and the early game especially feels uninspired.\n\nIf you're into the Persona formula, I'd give this a yes. If you're into RPGs and want to give Persona a try, I'd recommend Persona 5 instead.",

Although I dislike the amount of floors in the dungeon, I genuinely think everyone should play this game. I also recommend listening to it in the English dub (the English Dub V.A.'s do a REALLY good job with voicing the characters, and the comedy quips work so well with it).

It combines the amazing characters and story of Persona 3 with the fun gameplay of Persona 5 and has the best voice acting and soundtrack of any persona game. Some people say portable/FES is better but idk i havent played those. A criticism i have for the game is that a lot of the time the game can look a little ugly. a lot of cutscenes (like the protag awakening for example) look odd and kinda bland compared to previous versions of persona 3. The camera is often at bad or flat angles for cutscenes also, another point in P3FES' favor. Tartarus can be a slog and the game can take a few months to get rolling, but idk i just love this game. The voice acting is top-notch i love it so much. \nIf you want to play this game, play the demo first cause its like the first chunk for free. \n10/10 even though i have some complaints",

      "review": "Persona 3 Portable was my first ever persona game and, as it seems to be when it is your first persona game, it was always my favourite. That’s why coming into this I was excited to experience the beautifully dark yet hopeful story, flawed but likeable characters, and listen to that catchy soundtrack all once again. I loved the gameplay depth in the original but it flowed less than later entries (specifically P5/P5R). Reload sought to change that. The addition of shifting and theurgy was a great addition to make the combat have more cinematic weight and flow. Graphically this is a major step up from PSP and aids with bringing this world to life. It was exciting to see the cutscenes that weren’t present in P3p (although I’m aware there were ones in FES) that give movement to the story and characters. \n\nTo be more general to P3 as a whole it is a great story about Memento Mori, accepting the fleeting nature of life and learning how to fill the time until then and making the most of it whether through connecting with others or other means. I will hold off spoilers but just know all the social links explore making the most of the cards you are dealt and working through your inner trauma. \nAs for the DLC I found a second Tartarus-like dungeon with level and persona resets to be a little grindy but I loved the additions it made to the overall story and I definitely recommend at least watching the cutscenes in order to get the full experience. \n\nThis game will always hold a special place for me, playing it at a time when the themes of the game were as relevant to me as ever and maybe that added to my bias, but I will always recommend this game.\n\n10/10",

      "review": "First I would like to start off that this is a decent remake, it adds some gameplay mechanics that the game really needed and added a few cutscenes. However the problem this game has is that it hasn't added nearly enough. \n\nSince P3 was the original start of the social rank system it was in no way fleshed out like they have done in P5. With there being 10 social ranks for 22 characters you quickly start to notice they have not a lot to offer. Most link levels tell a \"story\" that honestly just falls short, maybe if you pasted 3 of them together it would finally be at a comfortable level (example the Grandpa with dementia where 5 of his 10 social links are about him forgetting something.) Since the reward it gives you is extremely minor and has no real impact on the story in any way. It starts to become a chore to the point that I've heard of people who rather just ditch the whole system and sleep through the days instead. \n\nThe overall main story is quite nice, however again it's not enough. There are so many days where just F all happens where the game would've benefitted a lot from some extra story cutscenes inbetween to make you interact with the characters some more.\n\nFinally the dungeon itself is extremely boring, there is nothing interesting to explore there with the only difference being a different color overtaking the dungeon every 10 or so floors. I truly wish they did more with it and reworked the whole thing.\n\nThe fact that this game has a review score of \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" scares me since this just shows the developers that they can release a half baked remake and still get full support because it's Persona. Since I enjoyed the original P3 I can somewhat recommend it but at the same time it's a major dissapointment for what it actually could have been.",

I own Persona 3 FES on PS2 as well so I was really looking forward to this games remake and for the most part I wasn't disappointed. However I am disappointed in ATLUS for the DLC situation. FES included The Answer in it's base form but ATLAS decided to instead make that part of the game locked behind a $34.99 expansion pass, you can't even just buy The Answer by itself, you have to get it through that pass which is ridiculous. What do you mean I essentially have to pay $105 before tax just to play the full game that was given to us on PS2 for $29.99. For that reason alone I cannot give this game a thumbs up as much as I love it. If you don't care about the answer or the price then by all means get it, it is a super good game so I am sure you'll love it, but even then I seriously just recommend getting it on sale. It has been knocked down to $31.49 4 times now so I am sure it will happen again, and the DLC was recently $13.99 so if you can get them at that price go for it. \n\nGame itself 10/10\nATLAS Business Practices -100/10",

So I guess I'll have to take one for the team and stand against the crowd. The UI and atmosphere is terrific as ever, but the the pacing is brutal: weeks of repetitive slice-of-life grind followed by marathon dungeon crawls in Tartarus. The Social Links are nowhere near strong, and the protagonist doesn't feel like the protagonist at all. In other Persona games, I felt involved. In this one, I felt like I was just watching the narrative. And after 30 hours, I asked myself if I was having fun. Well, once while playing, I feel asleep. So there's that.\n\n🎨 [b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Modern polish, classic vibes. The visual upgrade is genuinely impressive. Atlus did their homework. The lighting, UI, and character models all simply beautiful. The voice acting’s solid too. \n\n[*] The soundtrack slaps (again). The music, as always, is immaculate. The new remixes and added tracks? Gorgeous. Shame you’ll be hearing them on loop during hour ten of Tartarus.\n\n[*] Combat. You can see the bones of the combat system in later games. Still, the improved “One More” system, Baton Pass–style mechanics, and elemental weakness juggling make battles fluid and satisfying. You actually get to think strategically about exploiting weaknesses, chaining turns, and managing SP instead of just mashing attack.\n\n[*] The girls are just <3\n[/list]\n\n💤[b] Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] I think the thing that gets me is the fact that the game feels like there's no stakes, no urgency. The story’s premise—fighting during the Dark Hour—is interesting, but your character feels weirdly unnecessary. In P4R and P5G, your presence mattered. Here, the team would be fine without you. They can fight and recruit without you. You’re just some guy tagging along for an “apocalyptic” story that feels oddly low-stakes. The world isn't going to end. No one's in any real danger. There's no reason why to care about anything! The slice-of-life narrative isn't strong enough to carry the slow narrative, or the fact that nothing really happens? I quit in the 10th or 11th month. So yeah, it's a boring game underneath the gloss. \n\n[*] Social Links are atrocious. Every character feels like they were written in one sitting. Ten hangouts of the same topic stretched over hours—zero growth, zero spark. The “quirky friends” are so generic it hurts: a guy obsessed with his teacher, a girl talking about her parents’ divorce for ten ranks, a weird monk who likes to drink, a narcissistic dude whose arc is “being fat.” It’s mind-numbing.\n\n[*] Stat grinding kills momentum. You have to max all three (Charm, Courage, Academics) to unlock your actual friends—people you see every day but can’t hang with until you’re max-smart. And each stat requires wildly different EXP totals—Academics is 230 points while others are 80–100. It’s padding disguised as “progression.” I have no idea why this is a choice.\n\n[*] Dungeon crawling is a chore. Tartarus is one big ass, randomized tower that overstays its welcome by the second floor You end up saving it all for one massive run right before the deadline, because doing it piece by piece is a waste of time. It's the same thing forever. I got to 70 floors and decided to give up. I hate Tartarus. It is literal hell.\n\n[*] Pricey for what it offers. Between the high base price and the absurdly expensive Expansion Pass, it’s hard not to feel nickeled and dimed. Get on 50% sale.\n\n[*] Not great on Steam Deck. The framerate tanks in random areas (Paulownia Mall and Tartarus especially). Super battery hungry, as well. Not what you expect from a premium remake.\n[/list]\n[hr]\nIf you enjoyed this review, please check out my curator page to find more: [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45814768-Verdict-Play-or-Pass/]Verdict: Play or Pass.

I don't think I hate any game as much as this game, which is a shame, because I actually really like the new English voice cast for this game, they clearly have passion for this game and did a great job, and have been active members of the community, its just a shame that it seems nobody else working on this game had that same passion.",

      "review": "This game sucked. I hated the entire middle portion. Persona 4 and 5 take the same generic story structure and actually make it work with characters you can care about. I genuinely could not give a single damn about most of the cast here. There is absolutely no reason this game needed to be 100 hours long.\n\nSure, it’s got a cleaner UI and a few quality-of-life improvements, but that doesn’t stop it from being a total slog. The dungeon crawling hasn’t changed one bit since Portable, and you’d think they’d make it more accessible like Persona 5. but nope. You get nothing new. There’s barely anything to do during your life as a student either. I maxed out the nighttime Social Links super early because Tanaka and Mutatsu were so easy to level, and after that? Nothing. You’d think they’d make the Social Links actually matter outside of the fusion system since that’s supposedly one of the game’s “core” features, but they don’t. There’s no real reason to bother unless you’re obsessed with fusing every Persona.\n\nAnd don’t even get me started on Aigis. She’s painfully overrated thanks to the weird group of fans who romanticize her like she’s their perfect AI waifu. I can’t stand her. The whole pseudo-romance storyline they force on you is awkward, uncomfortable, and just plain creepy. I seriously do not get the obsession.\n\nWhat really grinds my gears is how bland the SEES cast is. I get it, they’re grieving, traumatized, and brooding, but good god, if I’m going to spend 100 hours with these people, at least give them some chemistry that isn’t just making fun of each other. They saved all the interesting, likable characters for the Social Links instead. Honestly, those side characters were the only reason I didn’t uninstall halfway through. They felt more alive than the main cast ever did.\n\nAnd while we’re here, Mitsuru is completely overhyped. She’s useless in battle and her personality’s carried entirely by people projecting their “cool upperclasswoman” fantasies onto her. Nobody acts like Mitsuru in real life, and if they did, nobody would want to hang out with them.\n\nThe only real positives here are the visuals and sound design. As much as I can’t stand Unreal Engine, the game does look great. The soundtrack is phenomenal, and the voice actors did a fantastic job. Aleks Le especially.\n\nPersona 3 Reload is all style, no soul. It looks shiny, it sounds great, but the pacing is miserable, the characters are bland (at least in my opinion. They're deep and whatnot, but not in a way i find interesting), and the gameplay loop hasn’t evolved at all.\n\n5/10",

The story’s premise—fighting during the Dark Hour—is interesting, but your character feels weirdly unnecessary. In P4R and P5G, your presence mattered. Here, the team would be fine without you. They can fight and recruit without you. You’re just some guy tagging along for an “apocalyptic” story that feels oddly low-stakes. The world isn't going to end. No one's in any real danger. There's no reason why to care about anything! The slice-of-life narrative isn't strong enough to carry the slow narrative, or the fact that nothing really happens? I quit in the 10th or 11th month. So yeah, it's a boring game underneath the gloss. \n\n[*] Social Links are atrocious. Every character feels like they were written in one sitting. Ten hangouts of the same topic stretched over hours—zero growth, zero spark. The “quirky friends” are so generic it hurts: a guy obsessed with his teacher, a girl talking about her parents’ divorce for ten ranks, a weird monk who likes to drink, a narcissistic dude whose arc is “being fat.” It’s mind-numbing.\n\n[*] Stat grinding kills momentum. You have to max all three (Charm, Courage, Academics) to unlock your actual friends—people you see every day but can’t hang with until you’re max-smart. And each stat requires wildly different EXP totals—Academics is 230 points while others are 80–100. It’s padding disguised as “progression.” I have no idea why this is a choice.\n\n[*] Dungeon crawling is a chore. Tartarus is one big ass, randomized tower that overstays its welcome by the second floor You end up saving it all for one massive run right before the deadline, because doing it piece by piece is a waste of time. It's the same thing forever. I got to 70 floors and decided to give up. I hate Tartarus. It is literal hell.\n\n[*] Pricey for what it offers. Between the high base price and the absurdly expensive Expansion Pass, it’s hard not to feel nickeled and dimed. Get on 50% sale.\n\n[*] Not great on Steam Deck. The framerate tanks in random areas (Paulownia Mall and Tartarus especially). Super battery hungry, as well. Not what you expect from a premium remake.\n[/list]\n[hr]\nIf you enjoyed this review, please check out my curator page to find more: [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45814768-Verdict-Play-or-Pass/]Verdict: Play or Pass.

I don't think I hate any game as much as this game, which is a shame, because I actually really like the new English voice cast for this game, they clearly have passion for this game and did a great job, and have been active members of the community, its just a shame that it seems nobody else working on this game had that same passion.",

I know everyone isn't the same as me but when I buy a single player RPG, I tend to try to aim for all the achievements. Whether it's killing all the superbosses or playing the game on hard mode. Not spending more money for some crappy DLC full of cosmetics I have no iterest in. \n\nSega. Go f**k yourself. You did this on purpose and you also do the same crap with my beloved Yakuza franchise. I'm sick and tired of seeing it and I want people to start boycotting this type of behavior. We need to speak up otherwise this will continue to happen with all our games. \n\n/end rant",

      "review": "This game sucked. I hated the entire middle portion. Persona 4 and 5 take the same generic story structure and actually make it work with characters you can care about. I genuinely could not give a single damn about most of the cast here. There is absolutely no reason this game needed to be 100 hours long.\n\nSure, it’s got a cleaner UI and a few quality-of-life improvements, but that doesn’t stop it from being a total slog. The dungeon crawling hasn’t changed one bit since Portable, and you’d think they’d make it more accessible like Persona 5. but nope. You get nothing new. There’s barely anything to do during your life as a student either. I maxed out the nighttime Social Links super early because Tanaka and Mutatsu were so easy to level, and after that? Nothing. You’d think they’d make the Social Links actually matter outside of the fusion system since that’s supposedly one of the game’s “core” features, but they don’t. There’s no real reason to bother unless you’re obsessed with fusing every Persona.\n\nAnd don’t even get me started on Aigis. She’s painfully overrated thanks to the weird group of fans who romanticize her like she’s their perfect AI waifu. I can’t stand her. The whole pseudo-romance storyline they force on you is awkward, uncomfortable, and just plain creepy. I seriously do not get the obsession.\n\nWhat really grinds my gears is how bland the SEES cast is. I get it, they’re grieving, traumatized, and brooding, but good god, if I’m going to spend 100 hours with these people, at least give them some chemistry that isn’t just making fun of each other. They saved all the interesting, likable characters for the Social Links instead. Honestly, those side characters were the only reason I didn’t uninstall halfway through. They felt more alive than the main cast ever did.\n\nAnd while we’re here, Mitsuru is completely overhyped. She’s useless in battle and her personality’s carried entirely by people projecting their “cool upperclasswoman” fantasies onto her. Nobody acts like Mitsuru in real life, and if they did, nobody would want to hang out with them.\n\nThe only real positives here are the visuals and sound design. As much as I can’t stand Unreal Engine, the game does look great. The soundtrack is phenomenal, and the voice actors did a fantastic job. Aleks Le especially.\n\nPersona 3 Reload is all style, no soul. It looks shiny, it sounds great, but the pacing is miserable, the characters are bland (at least in my opinion. They're deep and whatnot, but not in a way i find interesting), and the gameplay loop hasn’t evolved at all.\n\n5/10",

The only thing that is somewhat fun to do is Social Link progressions. Trying to up my Social Stats isn't as harsh as P5R, but, it stops the fun. Doing Tartarus over and over again, not letting you romance or have confidants with your S.E.E.S members until later, makes it GRAAH, frustrating. Sure, the visuals are nice, the graphics too, but the content ain't it man. Persona 5 Royal and Persona 5 Strikers are hitting strong with their content. The characters genuinely seems more tasteful.

The entirety of the game is just 100 hours of mementos but way worse. The bosses of the game aren't even fully fleshed out they are just bosses for the sake of being bosses with no real buildup. The game is also priced at $60 which is just absurd for the quality. Sure the music, characters ,and menus are great the but most rest of the game is not. The graphics are way worse than P5Rs despite P3R coming out over 4 years later and some areas like the Naganaki Shrine look like those horrible 3D scans of houses. Also I'm not sure if P5 made me paranoid or if it was horribly written but i'm 99% sure I figured out who the villain was within the first hour. I know that Persona doesn't try that hard to hide them but still within an hour is a bit fast for a 100 hour long game. Its going to take some major plot and gameplay upgrades to get me to like this game even a fraction as much as I like P5R. \n\nI understand this game is a remake of an old title so gameplay will be sparse but for $60 just buy P5R or get it on sale.

      "review": "I want to start off this review by saying that if you don't care about any of this stuff, this game is fine I guess, it's mostly just a bad remake.\r\n\r\nThis game is actual slop.  $70 dollar remake of a nearly 20 year old game that desecrates the visual style of the original, trading it for visuals that range from boring and generic to straight up incredibly ugly, generally makes the soundtrack sound worse aside from a few of the songs, brings no real improvements to any aspect of the gameplay at all and actually makes the gameplay worse by making battles so easy that I'm sure a fucking toddler could beat this game, rewrites practically none of the story where nothing of note happens for 80% of the game, instead adding linked episodes for characters who had no social links originally, which is nice but isn't what the game needed, and some of them aren't very good, and worst of all has a $30 dlc which re-adds a worse written version of the the answer, which was base game content in fes, meaning this is actually a $100 remake that improves nothing from the original except adding voice acting to social links and adding linked episodes, which just isn't enough, while also making many other parts of the game worse.  I don't think I hate any game as much as this game, which is a shame, because I actually really like the new English voice cast for this game, they clearly have passion for this game and did a great job, and have been active members of the community, its just a shame that it seems nobody else working on this game had that same passion.",

The animation is tight, the combat is rewarding and the story is beautiful.\n\nWith that being said. I'm going to downvote this game for personal reasons. And that is the greedy corporate BS of blanketing achievements behind a $40+ DLC. I know everyone isn't the same as me but when I buy a single player RPG, I tend to try to aim for all the achievements. Whether it's killing all the superbosses or playing the game on hard mode. Not spending more money for some crappy DLC full of cosmetics I have no iterest in. \n\nSega. Go f**k yourself. You did this on purpose and you also do the same crap with my beloved Yakuza franchise. I'm sick and tired of seeing it and I want people to start boycotting this type of behavior. We need to speak up otherwise this will continue to happen with all our games. \n\n/end rant",

      "review": "This game sucked. I hated the entire middle portion. Persona 4 and 5 take the same generic story structure and actually make it work with characters you can care about. I genuinely could not give a single damn about most of the cast here. There is absolutely no reason this game needed to be 100 hours long.\n\nSure, it’s got a cleaner UI and a few quality-of-life improvements, but that doesn’t stop it from being a total slog. The dungeon crawling hasn’t changed one bit since Portable, and you’d think they’d make it more accessible like Persona 5. but nope. You get nothing new. There’s barely anything to do during your life as a student either. I maxed out the nighttime Social Links super early because Tanaka and Mutatsu were so easy to level, and after that? Nothing. You’d think they’d make the Social Links actually matter outside of the fusion system since that’s supposedly one of the game’s “core” features, but they don’t. There’s no real reason to bother unless you’re obsessed with fusing every Persona.\n\nAnd don’t even get me started on Aigis. She’s painfully overrated thanks to the weird group of fans who romanticize her like she’s their perfect AI waifu. I can’t stand her. The whole pseudo-romance storyline they force on you is awkward, uncomfortable, and just plain creepy. I seriously do not get the obsession.\n\nWhat really grinds my gears is how bland the SEES cast is. I get it, they’re grieving, traumatized, and brooding, but good god, if I’m going to spend 100 hours with these people, at least give them some chemistry that isn’t just making fun of each other. They saved all the interesting, likable characters for the Social Links instead. Honestly, those side characters were the only reason I didn’t uninstall halfway through. They felt more alive than the main cast ever did.\n\nAnd while we’re here, Mitsuru is completely overhyped. She’s useless in battle and her personality’s carried entirely by people projecting their “cool upperclasswoman” fantasies onto her. Nobody acts like Mitsuru in real life, and if they did, nobody would want to hang out with them.\n\nThe only real positives here are the visuals and sound design. As much as I can’t stand Unreal Engine, the game does look great. The soundtrack is phenomenal, and the voice actors did a fantastic job. Aleks Le especially.\n\nPersona 3 Reload is all style, no soul. It looks shiny, it sounds great, but the pacing is miserable, the characters are bland (at least in my opinion. They're deep and whatnot, but not in a way i find interesting), and the gameplay loop hasn’t evolved at all.\n\n5/10",

The only thing that is somewhat fun to do is Social Link progressions. Trying to up my Social Stats isn't as harsh as P5R, but, it stops the fun. Doing Tartarus over and over again, not letting you romance or have confidants with your S.E.E.S members until later, makes it GRAAH, frustrating. Sure, the visuals are nice, the graphics too, but the content ain't it man. Persona 5 Royal and Persona 5 Strikers are hitting strong with their content. The characters genuinely seems more tasteful.

      "review": "After playing P5R I was really hyped for P3R after hearing many say it was the best in the series yet almost 30 hours in my only thought is \"How could Atlus fumble the bag so hard?\". The entirety of the game is just 100 hours of mementos but way worse. The bosses of the game aren't even fully fleshed out they are just bosses for the sake of being bosses with no real buildup. The game is also priced at $60 which is just absurd for the quality. Sure the music, characters ,and menus are great the but most rest of the game is not. The graphics are way worse than P5Rs despite P3R coming out over 4 years later and some areas like the Naganaki Shrine look like those horrible 3D scans of houses. Also I'm not sure if P5 made me paranoid or if it was horribly written but i'm 99% sure I figured out who the villain was within the first hour. I know that Persona doesn't try that hard to hide them but still within an hour is a bit fast for a 100 hour long game. Its going to take some major plot and gameplay upgrades to get me to like this game even a fraction as much as I like P5R. \n\nI understand this game is a remake of an old title so gameplay will be sparse but for $60 just buy P5R or get it on sale. Don't get me wrong, the stories refreshing and the characters are good just its not 100 hours of gameplay and $60 good.",

      "review": "First I would like to start off that this is a decent remake, it adds some gameplay mechanics that the game really needed and added a few cutscenes. However the problem this game has is that it hasn't added nearly enough. \n\nSince P3 was the original start of the social rank system it was in no way fleshed out like they have done in P5. With there being 10 social ranks for 22 characters you quickly start to notice they have not a lot to offer. Most link levels tell a \"story\" that honestly just falls short, maybe if you pasted 3 of them together it would finally be at a comfortable level (example the Grandpa with dementia where 5 of his 10 social links are about him forgetting something.) Since the reward it gives you is extremely minor and has no real impact on the story in any way. It starts to become a chore to the point that I've heard of people who rather just ditch the whole system and sleep through the days instead. \n\nThe overall main story is quite nice, however again it's not enough. There are so many days where just F all happens where the game would've benefitted a lot from some extra story cutscenes inbetween to make you interact with the characters some more.\n\nFinally the dungeon itself is extremely boring, there is nothing interesting to explore there with the only difference being a different color overtaking the dungeon every 10 or so floors. I truly wish they did more with it and reworked the whole thing.\n\nThe fact that this game has a review score of \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" scares me since this just shows the developers that they can release a half baked remake and still get full support because it's Persona. Since I enjoyed the original P3 I can somewhat recommend it but at the same time it's a major dissapointment for what it actually could have been.",

I own Persona 3 FES on PS2 as well so I was really looking forward to this games remake and for the most part I wasn't disappointed. However I am disappointed in ATLUS for the DLC situation. FES included The Answer in it's base form but ATLAS decided to instead make that part of the game locked behind a $34.99 expansion pass, you can't even just buy The Answer by itself, you have to get it through that pass which is ridiculous. What do you mean I essentially have to pay $105 before tax just to play the full game that was given to us on PS2 for $29.99. For that reason alone I cannot give this game a thumbs up as much as I love it. If you don't care about the answer or the price then by all means get it, it is a super good game so I am sure you'll love it, but even then I seriously just recommend getting it on sale. It has been knocked down to $31.49 4 times now so I am sure it will happen again, and the DLC was recently $13.99 so if you can get them at that price go for it. \n\nGame itself 10/10\nATLAS Business Practices -100/10",

      "review": "Reviewing (mostly) every game (or DLC) in my library, part 463:\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️☆☆☆☆ (6/10)\n\nSeriously, am I the only person on this planet that didn't like [i]Persona 3 Reload?[/i] Like, even check out just the negative reviews: most of them are about the DRM or the price, nothing to do with the actual game itself. So I guess I'll have to take one for the team and stand against the crowd. The UI and atmosphere is terrific as ever, but the the pacing is brutal: weeks of repetitive slice-of-life grind followed by marathon dungeon crawls in Tartarus. The Social Links are nowhere near strong, and the protagonist doesn't feel like the protagonist at all. In other Persona games, I felt involved. In this one, I felt like I was just watching the narrative. And after 30 hours, I asked myself if I was having fun. Well, once while playing, I feel asleep. So there's that.\n\n🎨 [b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Modern polish, classic vibes. The visual upgrade is genuinely impressive. Atlus did their homework. The lighting, UI, and character models all simply beautiful. The voice acting’s solid too. \n\n[*] The soundtrack slaps (again). The music, as always, is immaculate. The new remixes and added tracks? Gorgeous. Shame you’ll be hearing them on loop during hour ten of Tartarus.\n\n[*] Combat. You can see the bones of the combat system in later games. Still, the improved “One More” system, Baton Pass–style mechanics, and elemental weakness juggling make battles fluid and satisfying. You actually get to think strategically about exploiting weaknesses, chaining turns, and managing SP instead of just mashing attack.\n\n[*] The girls are just <3\n[/list]\n\n💤[b] Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] I think the thing that gets me is the fact that the game feels like there's no stakes, no urgency. The story’s premise—fighting during the Dark Hour—is interesting, but your character feels weirdly unnecessary. In P4R and P5G, your presence mattered. Here, the team would be fine without you. They can fight and recruit without you. You’re just some guy tagging along for an “apocalyptic” story that feels oddly low-stakes. The world isn't going to end. No one's in any real danger. There's no reason why to care about anything! The slice-of-life narrative isn't strong enough to carry the slow narrative, or the fact that nothing really happens? I quit in the 10th or 11th month. So yeah, it's a boring game underneath the gloss. \n\n[*] Social Links are atrocious. Every character feels like they were written in one sitting. Ten hangouts of the same topic stretched over hours—zero growth, zero spark. The “quirky friends” are so generic it hurts: a guy obsessed with his teacher, a girl talking about her parents’ divorce for ten ranks, a weird monk who likes to drink, a narcissistic dude whose arc is “being fat.” It’s mind-numbing.\n\n[*] Stat grinding kills momentum. You have to max all three (Charm, Courage, Academics) to unlock your actual friends—people you see every day but can’t hang with until you’re max-smart. And each stat requires wildly different EXP totals—Academics is 230 points while others are 80–100. It’s padding disguised as “progression.” I have no idea why this is a choice.\n\n[*] Dungeon crawling is a chore.
