Nope, not a memory in my head but \"Ugh, why did I marry Gust?\" Rest assured, he didn't get the Husband treatment this time around (Mint did, however).\n\nPortia is, unfortunately, leagues behind Sandrock. Pathea really took everything we loved about Portia, and left behind everything we hated, for Sandrock. But it's still worth playing, if just to understand the easter eggs in Sandrock (my memory of this game was so bad, Owen mentioned he met 7 brothers and I didn't even remember the Hulu brothers of Portia. How does someone forget THEM?).\n\nThere are a lot of little issues that add up; voice lines unvoiced, wrong dialogue being said, some quests leading no where. And boy howdy, the controls and main gameplay are hard to get used to after Sandrock.\n\nBut it's still got charm, a great story, interesting characters and is generally fun to play. I played this second time because I wanted to remember the whole story in preparation for My Time at Evershine, the third game in the franchise. I love the whole story of Duvos vs The Alliance/Ethea, the Day of Calamity, everything - it's fascinating.\n\nI don't know if I'll ever play a third time; hopefully the memory of the story sticks from this playthrough. lol But I'm glad I played it again, and honestly, I can enjoy Sandrock even more now that I understand the Portia easter eggs.

I like the vibrant colors, and the environments are nice, but the stylization of the people and animals is... something I'm not a fan of. The horse in particular, with its noodle legs, was one of my least favorite models to look at.\r\n\r\nI also was a bit frustrated by how limited decorating the house felt. I really liked that decorating the house provided buffs, though!\r\n\r\nI actually wound up buying Sandrock while playing this game, and I kind of had to force myself to finish the main storyline in Portia because I was too excited to try out Sandrock hahaha. I definitely recommend finishing Portia first before Sandrock, if you have an interest in the series. The graphics in Sandrock are much prettier, and there are a lot of quality of life features added to it that I think would make playing the games in reverse frustrating.",

I chose this game because it (and its sequel) had been positively talked about in a facebook cosy game group I am a member of and the price was right (less than $10 AU).  Clicking the buy button was a no brainer.  \r\n\r\nIt is a relatively old game (released in 2019 and I am playing it for the first time at the end of 2025), but it has been worth every penny and it has held up surprisingly well after 6 years.  I am impressed.  Steam says I have 81 hours at the time of writing this.  I don't.  I think a few times I had logged out to the main menu and walked away.  I would say easily 40 hours though and I don't regret a minute I have spent and have thoroughly enjoyed my time in Portia.  I have only hit the end of year 1 and there is still so much to do with 61 achievements remaining.\r\n\r\nThere is so much to do and so many characters to meet and it is like Stardew, but also uniquely its own with the dystopian back story.  There is mining, farming, construction, romancing townies, quests, fighting...it has it all.  And for someone who is a bit uncoordinated with the fighting, the battles are super easy and if you die, you restart without losing anything (thank you!).\r\n\r\nI look forward to trying out the sequel (My time at  Sandrock), but I am glad I started at this one first.  Now my only question is who do I romance.  I think I am leaning towards Arlo....wish me luck!",

      "review": "I LOVE this game. \n\nWhile this is supposed to be a \"play at your own pace\" kind of game... It's not. You only get so many hours (minutes) each day, and even when you adjust game speed, you still have to plan ahead by days or even weeks, in order not to miss anything. Each day seems like a rush to get things done until near the end of the game. You also can't just save. Your game only saves at the end of each day, so make a mistake at the end of the day and need to start over, and you start the entire day over. \n\nThe characters are really amazing, and I have played it through several times. My first play through I picked Ginger as a wife sort of at random. Then I learned her back story, and she was so relatable, I never went with another romantic partner in any other play through. Small spoilers here, so skip to the next paragraph if you don't want to know. Ginger is sick, and can't be in the light very much. There is an event each year where gifts are dropped from a balloon and everyone tries to grab them. Even though I had max reputation with Ginger, I realized that she could not participate. So I got her gifts. That is how much I liked the character. I felt bad for her, and wanted to make this make believe person happy. That is because her story is done so well. \n\nOther characters are going to appeal to different people. I think there is probably someone for everyone, and their stories are fantastic. \n\nPeople complain about the fighting mechanics, but I never had an issue with it. \n\nI like to build things, and build up a base without having to fight things off in some sort of war, so this was great, as you start with a tiny plot of land and grow it to be huge and filled with things. However, you are in competition with another builder, so there is a drive to do it better faster, without fear of losing what you have built. \n\nOverall I love this game, and recommend it to anyone who enjoys this kind of game.",

If you're not a hardcore gamer or just want something low-stress to relax with after work or school, this game really hits the spot. It doesn't rush you, there's no pressure to \"win,\" and the world is just genuinely enjoyable to spend time in.\n\nThe best way I can describe it is cozy. You wake up in your workshop, check your commissions, maybe tend to your farm, explore some ruins, or just stroll around talking to the locals. The pace is completely up to you, and there’s something super satisfying about slowly upgrading your home, building machines, and watching the town respond to your progress. Even simple tasks like gathering wood or decorating your space feel rewarding over time.\n\nWhat really kept me coming back, though, were the characters and the atmosphere. The people in Portia have their own routines, personalities, and little story arcs that you can get involved in at your own pace. It makes the world feel alive without being overwhelming. Plus, the soundtrack and visuals are really calming—perfect for when you just want to zone out and de-stress.\n\nIf you're looking for something chill, creative, and full of charm, My Time at Portia is 100% worth checking out. It's not trying to be the biggest or most complex game out there, but that's exactly why it's so good.",

I don’t think my kids are doing alright though.\n\nNow, one caveat to my recommendation: I have a theory that the first life-sim you play will always be the best one to you.  And this was my first.",

The machines take time to do their thing, so time management is a must here. \n\nSo far, so good. Nothing groundbreaking obviously, but most of what’s on offer here is perfectly fine.\n\nThe problem with My Time at Portia, though, is the other part of the game -- specifically, the dungeon crawling part. Because it’s… not great, to say the least. The combat is extremely barebones, the enemy variety is extremely sparse, and the dungeons you can delve are boring, short, and almost without exception procedurally generated. This is only exacerbated by the fact that they’re full of important crafting components you can’t get elsewhere, so you’ll likely have spent hours farming in them before the end of the game.\n\nDecent fun overall, but not particularly memorable.\n\n6/10",

      "review": "I LOVE this game. \n\nWhile this is supposed to be a \"play at your own pace\" kind of game... It's not. You only get so many hours (minutes) each day, and even when you adjust game speed, you still have to plan ahead by days or even weeks, in order not to miss anything. Each day seems like a rush to get things done until near the end of the game. You also can't just save. Your game only saves at the end of each day, so make a mistake at the end of the day and need to start over, and you start the entire day over. \n\nThe characters are really amazing, and I have played it through several times. My first play through I picked Ginger as a wife sort of at random. Then I learned her back story, and she was so relatable, I never went with another romantic partner in any other play through. Small spoilers here, so skip to the next paragraph if you don't want to know. Ginger is sick, and can't be in the light very much. There is an event each year where gifts are dropped from a balloon and everyone tries to grab them. Even though I had max reputation with Ginger, I realized that she could not participate. So I got her gifts. That is how much I liked the character. I felt bad for her, and wanted to make this make believe person happy. That is because her story is done so well. \n\nOther characters are going to appeal to different people. I think there is probably someone for everyone, and their stories are fantastic. \n\nPeople complain about the fighting mechanics, but I never had an issue with it. \n\nI like to build things, and build up a base without having to fight things off in some sort of war, so this was great, as you start with a tiny plot of land and grow it to be huge and filled with things. However, you are in competition with another builder, so there is a drive to do it better faster, without fear of losing what you have built. \n\nOverall I love this game, and recommend it to anyone who enjoys this kind of game.",

Ursula? The Rogue Knight? The All-Source? Defeating the Rats? Nope, not a memory in my head but \"Ugh, why did I marry Gust?\" Rest assured, he didn't get the Husband treatment this time around (Mint did, however).\n\nPortia is, unfortunately, leagues behind Sandrock. Pathea really took everything we loved about Portia, and left behind everything we hated, for Sandrock. But it's still worth playing, if just to understand the easter eggs in Sandrock (my memory of this game was so bad, Owen mentioned he met 7 brothers and I didn't even remember the Hulu brothers of Portia. How does someone forget THEM?).\n\nThere are a lot of little issues that add up; voice lines unvoiced, wrong dialogue being said, some quests leading no where. And boy howdy, the controls and main gameplay are hard to get used to after Sandrock.\n\nBut it's still got charm, a great story, interesting characters and is generally fun to play. I played this second time because I wanted to remember the whole story in preparation for My Time at Evershine, the third game in the franchise. I love the whole story of Duvos vs The Alliance/Ethea, the Day of Calamity, everything - it's fascinating.\n\nI don't know if I'll ever play a third time; hopefully the memory of the story sticks from this playthrough. lol But I'm glad I played it again, and honestly, I can enjoy Sandrock even more now that I understand the Portia easter eggs.

If you're not a hardcore gamer or just want something low-stress to relax with after work or school, this game really hits the spot. It doesn't rush you, there's no pressure to \"win,\" and the world is just genuinely enjoyable to spend time in.\n\nThe best way I can describe it is cozy. You wake up in your workshop, check your commissions, maybe tend to your farm, explore some ruins, or just stroll around talking to the locals. The pace is completely up to you, and there’s something super satisfying about slowly upgrading your home, building machines, and watching the town respond to your progress. Even simple tasks like gathering wood or decorating your space feel rewarding over time.\n\nWhat really kept me coming back, though, were the characters and the atmosphere. The people in Portia have their own routines, personalities, and little story arcs that you can get involved in at your own pace. It makes the world feel alive without being overwhelming. Plus, the soundtrack and visuals are really calming—perfect for when you just want to zone out and de-stress.\n\nIf you're looking for something chill, creative, and full of charm, My Time at Portia is 100% worth checking out. It's not trying to be the biggest or most complex game out there, but that's exactly why it's so good.",

I had gotten it also in a bundle so it wasn't a huge deal to wait till the game was refined and my PC was upgraded. Thankfully, I don't have those original issues anymore. However, the game's pacing is absolutely awful.\n\nFirst, the game's guidance is pretty abysmal. It is designed in a way where you either need to use a wiki, or *really* spend a lot of time exploring every area. This wouldn't be a huge issue if there was plenty of room for such a thing, except that...\nSecond, most of the game functions are time-locked. You don't get to choose when time sensitive events happen. And in many cases, you won't have enough hours in the day to do all the things expected of you. In some cases, you receive quests which you don't even have access to the resources yet. (Lookin' at you, Pinky the Devourer.)\n\nOver it. Not sure I'mma try this one again.\n\nI want to be clear: you *absolutely* can receive quests that you have *no way* to complete in the time allotted. Does it end the game? No. Is it stressful AF? Absolutely. A quest shouldn't trigger when *access to the required area* isn't possible and *the time needed to finish materials for the required quest are longer than the entire quest timer for the new quest*.\nBad design, and I do *not* have patience for it.",

(Is there a setting I missed or...?)\n- The character design is different and needs tweaking, especially with our character\n- The game as a whole doesn't really give you hints nor any sort of guide as to what you should be doing; except for missions/quests. Not much of a tutorial to get you settled into the game, just throws in you and gives you a few pointers real quick then boom, done.\n- Feels like it's a bit difficult to mine and gather materials if I'm on a very strict time limit per day\n- The way we have to build is....interesting and some of the mechanics feel like a waste of time. I get the need for some realism, but get rid of any menial steps\n\nSo as of Sept 2025 (not sure if I'll be able to change the recommendation option or not) I'm giving this a THUMBS DOWN :(",

It looks like the devs just had a list of \"features\" and called it quits after the list was done. Many mechanics are not fun at all (ie, the dates). You also waste tons of time just waiting around for things to start. \n\nI would recommend achievement hunters skip this game.

(Is there a setting I missed or...?)\n- The character design is different and needs tweaking, especially with our character\n- The game as a whole doesn't really give you hints nor any sort of guide as to what you should be doing; except for missions/quests. Not much of a tutorial to get you settled into the game, just throws in you and gives you a few pointers real quick then boom, done.\n- Feels like it's a bit difficult to mine and gather materials if I'm on a very strict time limit per day\n- The way we have to build is....interesting and some of the mechanics feel like a waste of time. I get the need for some realism, but get rid of any menial steps\n\nSo as of Sept 2025 (not sure if I'll be able to change the recommendation option or not) I'm giving this a THUMBS DOWN :(",

SV is relaxing and you do what you want each day pretty much, MTaP has leaderboards and many timed events that require your constant attention. SV also has a major farming element while in MTaP has a factory farm which is much less fun.\n\nOverall, MTaP is simply not that fun. It looks like the devs just had a list of \"features\" and called it quits after the list was done. Many mechanics are not fun at all (ie, the dates). You also waste tons of time just waiting around for things to start. \n\nI would recommend achievement hunters skip this game. Not only are many RNG and not fun (ie, picking up 500 poop, winning rock paper scissors, etc), but you need to do a whole bunch of romance quests with both genders. Totally immersion breaking regardless of which way you swing.\n\nRedeeming features is that the game looks pretty nice and is relatively bug free. Overall, 5/10.",
