Once your account is linked, there’s no way to unbind or switch platforms. That can be risky if you lose access to your linked service or want to change how your data is stored.\n\nIt would be great to see the devs add a secure unbind feature (with verification and cooldowns) in future updates. That extra flexibility would make the game even more player-friendly.\n\nOverall, still recommend — great game, just hoping for a bit more control over account settings in the future.\n\n(I will update my review if this is available)",
