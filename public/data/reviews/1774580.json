      "review": "Better than the first in most ways. The stance changing is annoying, there are mods to fix it, I suggest using them.\n\nPerformance with a 9800x3d, NVME, and 3080ti @ 144hz and 2k res, maxed settings was 90% great. There were a few unexplained slowdowns from an avg 100fps to 30fps for a few minutes, then it'd switch back. Opening up the galaxy map on the ship tanks performance.\n\nI completed about 90% of all collectibles and the entire story in about 25 hours. About a perfect amount of game as an adult with responsibilities.\n\nThe exploration aspect of the game is DEEP. You'll wander into a new area, which leads to a new area, which leads to a new area. It's all logical and very enticing. This game really achieves the \"here's a huge map, with tons of details, go check out all the nooks and crannies for collectibles\". This is by far the best aspect of the game.\n\nMovement is good and interesting, getting around the map and unlocking shortcuts makes traversal fun. Fast travel is limited and handy but not too excessive that would lead you to do absolutely 0% extra exploration.\n\nThe combat is slightly harder than the first but only 1 or 2 required fights stand out with much difficulty.\n\nI personally like the progression of the first game better, this game is mostly about upgrading your movement and gaining access to new parts of the map.\n\nThe story is well written, easy to follow, and character development is mostly logical.\n\nReally akin to God of War with lightsabers.\n\nMusic and sounds are great, might just be Star Wars nostalgia.\n\nOverall 9/10. All aspects of the game are performed well and it seems like the game was designed and coded by people who care, an atypical EA win. Some additional polish in progression, performance and design would make this a 10. Play it, it's fantastic.",

That's the only good thing i can say [/b]\n\nWith how many frustrations i had while playing this, I ADVISE EVERYONE to buy this only on a discount.\n\nExploration is fun, but with how ability unlocks are all locked behind story, you need to go back multiple times to the same area just to get past one-or-two puzzles just to be brought back there again for the same reason because next ability got unlocked. When you get the last ability it's almost the end of the story ;//.\n\nThe amount of traversal sections WOULD BE good if they would've had improved feel of the movement. It felt really clunky at first, but it wasn't as bad in the end.\n\nIt's been over 2 years since the release and the game is still poorly optimized. IF your pc doesn't meet the suggested requirments, don't bother. Also the amount of visual glitches e.g. lighting not loading in, cloth doing things all over your screen during cutscenes and map not loading in.\n\nIf you're ready to fight through these issues, go for it, have fun!",

A dislike though, is on normal settings, some of the bosses are impossible.  Be prepared to die often, even when leveled, geared, and skilled up.  At the same time, some bosses were extremely easy.  So such is balance.  The visuals, modeling, clarity, and voice acting are better than expected.  Don't sleep on this one, It's going to be a great classic.",

      "review": "Review after playing through the campaign, which took about 31 hours.  TLDR, this is a game with a good Star Wars story that checks a lot of boxes.  While it does have its flaws it is worth picking up on sale.  This is the second game in the series, and yes I think you should play Jedi Fallen Order first.\r\n\r\n You should know that this game does use the EA app to launch through Steam.  The EA app does not allow steam family sharing.\r\n\r\nWhere this game really shines is in the story, and if you are into Star Wars stories this is a good one.  No spoilers, but this does pick up a few years after Fallen Order finishes.  There are a lot of references to characters in that game, so I think you should play it first.\r\n\r\nThe game itself as mentioned, checks a lot of boxes.  The cynic in me feels like that is what they were doing.  There's adventure game parkour, collectables galore, open world areas, loads of cosmetics and customization, metroidvania style backtracking, multiple saber stances, and parry focused combat.  A lot of that is done well.  I personally hate 3d level parkour but in this game the majority of it was pretty easy to do so I'm going to give that a pass.  As mentioned a lot of boxes are checked, but I think you would find better versions of those features in games in those genres.  It feels a little corporate.\r\n\r\nThe saber stance switching is pretty cool.  There are 5 stances in total.  I personally gravitated toward Cross-guard stance, Kylo Ren style, which feels like greatsword play in other games.  There's new force powers too which flow really well with combat.\r\n\r\nAs a negative, toward the end of the game the bosses all seem to have 3-4 phases with QTE's and cutscenes between each phase.  With the difficulty turned up you'll have to spend some time learning the fight and you'll have to go through all of that each time.  While the cutscenes are skippable the QTE's are not.  And each endgame boss has a lengthy grab attack animation if you get caught (seriously, I could put my controller down and look around the room while it was going on).  All of that makes having to repeat those end-game bosses a slog.\r\n\r\nI did not encounter any bad bugs, but framerate slowdowns were pretty common.  They would happen when things were loading in more than anytime else.  Like, spinning around in a circle outside can make the game chug a bit.  I didn't encounter that in boss arenas where that would matter most, as those places are confined.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, pick this one and Fallen Order up on sale if you are looking for a good Star Wars story.",

It captures the magic, mystery, and adventure of the universe I’ve loved since childhood, and delivers it through an exciting, emotional journey.\r\n\r\nOne of the game’s strongest elements is its exploration. The worlds feel alive and rewarding to traverse, full of secrets, optional paths, and environmental storytelling that pulls you deeper into Cal Kestis journey. The story itself is amazing—engaging, emotional, and filled with memorable character moments that make the whole adventure feel truly epic.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is a ton of fun as well. Combat is fluid and stylish, and while it can be challenging at times, that difficulty makes every encounter feel meaningful. The new rumour system adds a nice sense of discovery, giving you optional leads that encourage wandering off the beaten path. Overall, it strikes a great balance between narrative, action, and exploration.\r\n\r\nThat said, the game isn’t perfect. There are definite technical issues, including stuttering, performance drops, and the occasional bugs. In my case, most of the problems were just small graphic glitches, nothing major—but still noticeable. It’s the kind of game where the heart and ambition shine through, even if the polish is lacking in places.\r\n\r\nDespite those flaws, I had a fun playing this one. It’s honestly way better than the prequel, and it reignited my excitement for Star Wars games in general. I’m absolutely looking forward to the next entry in the Star Wars Jedi series.\r\n\r\nA flawed but incredible journey—and one that everyone should experience.",

Great performances from the actors and it was great to see old and new characters. \n\nOne small complaint I would say is that the story here felt [very] slightly less emotional and powerful compared to its predecessor.  It had potential to explore Cal's relationships, how and when the dynamics changed, and personal chemistry. This chapter felt more of like \"we need to do this because it's the good of the cause\" and I think that's the point of the character's arc [flaw] but the times it slowed down to just be Cal were wholesome.\n\nThe first one felt like you were rediscovering who the character was and the music perfectly matched that tone. I feel that if we had a bit more of Cal's background, perhaps some flashbacks, build on the current lore based on the timeline the game takes place. That would ground and connect the player to the whole star wars universe and add an extra touch of richness.\n\nNonetheless, another amazingly crafted game in the Jedi series and my hats off to Respawn for giving us this gem.",

Combat, story, world exploration, everything was great and was a fine sequel to the first game. Disney could never; can't wait for the next game :)",

      "review": "Amazing game, Respawn. Jedi Survivor is easily one of the best Star Wars games I’ve ever played. The combat feels fantastically smooth, weighty, and incredibly rewarding. The story is equally impressive: satisfying, emotional, and genuinely heartbreaking at times. I can’t wait to see where it goes next.\r\n\r\nThe amount of content packed into the game is impressive, and the metroidvania level design fits perfectly with the exploration focused gameplay. Humanoid enemies and bosses are consistently fun and engaging to fight. Customization for Cal is also a highlight. There’s a ton of variety and freedom in how you can shape his appearance.\r\n\r\nFor the next game, though, it would be exciting if lightsaber parts offered more than just cosmetic differences. Maybe subtle stat bonuses, unique effects, or small mechanical perks could make customization feel even deeper. It would also be great to freely swap between any lightsaber stance on the fly, with enemy encounters designed to encourage or even require certain styles to overcome them.\r\n\r\nNow, for the negatives. Creature enemies and bosses really need some improvement. They’re often not enjoyable to fight, especially the Rancors and Ogdo bosses. Their attacks feel janky, their hitboxes are inconsistent, and the frustration outweighs the challenge. If one-shot grab attacks remain in the game, their hitboxes absolutely need to be fixed, or the moves should be removed altogether.\r\n\r\nOverall, though, Jedi Survivor is an incredible experience, and I’m excited to see how Respawn evolves the series from here.",

The story expands upon the first games perfectly and has some great twists throughout. The puzzles are very fun and remind me alot of portal test chambers with how complex they can get at times.

Combat feels smooth and weighty — you can actually feel the impact of each strike, and chaining abilities together is deeply satisfying. The game does a great job balancing intense duels with quieter exploration moments, letting you absorb the world rather than just rushing from fight to fight.\n\nThe environments are a huge highlight. From ruined cities to dense forests, every planet feels alive and distinct, full of secrets and side paths that reward curiosity. Story-wise, it continues the narrative in a way that feels meaningful, with compelling characters and choices that matter in small but noticeable ways.\n\nTraversal is also satisfying: wall-running, Force-assisted jumps, and climbing make movement feel fluid, and the puzzles are just the right level of challenge to break up combat.\n\nIf there’s a downside, it’s that the camera can occasionally be tricky during fast-paced fights, especially in tight spaces. It’s not game-breaking, but it can be frustrating in a heated duel.\n\nOverall, Jedi: Survivor is an exhilarating Star Wars adventure. The combat, world-building, and story combine to make it one of the most immersive experiences in the series yet — a must-play for fans of lightsabers and the Force.",

Though yes its not as bad as it was on launch but its still a big oof for sure\r\n\r\nStory\r\ncookie cutter stuff cmon its star wars you know the drill this aint rdr2 \r\n\r\nCombat\r\nI LOVE IT!!!!\r\nSuper punchy and wooshy and just... feels stylish\r\na bunch of challenges that are actually a challenging\r\nthere is some jank to the combat in some fights as im sure youll find a certain fight thats clearly doctored to be \"hard\" that clearly shows the jankyness to how the AI works\r\n\r\nAll an All\r\nIf they can just figure out the performance of this game its easily 9/10 and maybe even worth $70.. maybe... BIG MAYBE! but im having/had fun with it. def worth trying out for $5",

Fixing the crashes brought back the muddy textures.\n\nMost issues seem to pop up when players get to the second planet (a bit over the two hour refund window).

There's still lag spikes right before a lot of cutscenes causing you to miss part of them. Frame gen \"works\" but the HUD looks doubled when spinning around if you stare at it.

On one hand, the gameplay and the story are very good and I enjoyed my time with it but on the other, the performance is so abysmal that it made me regret even buying this game on sale.\r\n\r\nJedi Survivor builds upon what you had learned in fallen order, meaning you don't have to relearn  everything that you had acquired during that game. It also builds upon the foundation set in that game, you get new stances, new perks and a variety of different enemies to fight. The story is also good. I found it a bit boring at the start. However, I enjoyed how it ended and I'm excited to see how it goes on in the future\r\n\r\nHowever, all the positives are sort of taken away by the fact that the performance is terrible. I ran this game on an RTX 4070 laptop at 1080P, med/high settings, DLSS set to balanced, no Ray tracing and frame generation turned on. I was getting around 80 to 100 FPS this way meaning I was getting a base FPS of around 40 to 50. I don't believe the game looks that good to warrant this kind of FPS. The other issue with this game is the stuttering, the game relies heavily on dodging and parrying opponent attacks and the stuttering really makes that difficult, not to mention frustrating.\r\n\r\nWhile the game is an improvement in every aspect over the first, I don't believe you should buy this game unless you have a really good computer or you are okay with frame generation.

Who said the original lacked stuff? WHO?? Ummm... effing nobody - well ok lets put more stuff into it - how much stuff? ALL THE STUFF! \n\nAnd the self-referential joke at the start 'hey this guy got a jetpack - wouldn't that make things more convenient?' just gets worse and worse as the game goes on - incredibly tough jump about puzzles that border on ridiculous - you know... how expensive are these jetpacks anyways? they rare? - only to be used by people with certain genetic codes? \n\nSo as a review - be warned - there is some hell in the game that sets it far apart from the greatness of the original. theres some really good stuff to be sure - Cal Kestis is a great character and you get to do a lot of cool stuff in the game - all the maps and art are top shelf, the music and fights are cool - theres's a lot of good stuff going on. But they just couldn't help themselves but to go overboard with the stuffing. So they stuffed it.\n\n(so many similarities to Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus)\n\nI guess there's that fuel that after a big success - well now we can show off ALL OUR STUFF - we got a bigger budget - which means we can stuff away till the stuff does stuff and then stuff and stuff and stuff. People learn - unfortunately mostly due to accident or harm - but they do learn - and it is all the more severe the bigger the money.\n\nStill worth a shot for at least once it is fun for the most part - on a gameplus+ second round halfway through the first mission and a foreboding of the ridiculous parkour that happens later is already ruining the experience.

The selectable weapon types are a big deal, and they're all pretty good, I like that you get to choose two, so you can play your favorites or have one style cover for a weakness of the other. I wish this was more viable in the actual souls games, because switching weapons to fit the situation just works. However, the combat feels a lot like \"taking turns\". In Dark Souls/Elden Ring etc when you're hitting an enemy you can keep it locked down as long as you have the stamina or timings and spacing to keep pressure up, it feels great. Heck, in Elden Ring, you get your best openings for damage/healing by keeping pressure up, and earning the openings goes a long way to make it feel more like a real duel. Here I hit them, and eventually they get sick of being hit after more than a couple swings and then block and counter with no counterplay outside of just respecting it or effortlessly parrying them until they stop. It gets so much more repetitive because of this. I don't get to have those magic souls moments where I master a fight and feel amazing, every fight allows for only so much skill and that's it. And it's such a waste, because that's all that really holds this back. It's got all the makings of a great game, it just needs to rework some stuff like stamina and enemy blocking. \n\nIt's just kinda worse than a Fromsoft game, but I feel like that about most games.\n\nNever buy this at full price I got it for under 10$, and it's nowhere near worth 70$",

It's badly optimized, and apparently over a year ago they patched the game in a way that completely broke the second planet you go to - Koboh.\n\nFirst major issue:\nThe game becomes unplayable unless you turn all graphics to low and reduce resolution to windowed 1080p. Even then, the textures don't resolve, moving through the planet will see textures and polygons de-render into monochrome triangles and blobs, and there are occasional freezes.\n\nThere are reports that this only happens to 4GB graphics cards, but I have an 8GB Radeon 6600 XT, and it still happens. It also happens to the most modern cards available on the market, as reported by users on Reddit and EA forums. \n\nEdit: I powered through the horrible experience on Koboh, was able to turn graphics up to medium and turn off film grain/motion blur/ray tracing and it seems stable now. Even back up at 2k borderless windowed.\n\nSecond major issue:\nSpawn of Oggdo is a trash boss. It was designed by bad people to upset good people. The boss has no attack cooldown, spams red flashing moves, does over a quarter of your maximized health bar per regular attack and over half with each flashing attack. Its health bar is out of control and its dashing hitbox is the entire screen. Eff whoever greenlit this fight. I hope they do nothing but suffer.\n\nEA are owned and run by the worst people in gaming. They are thieves, liars, and abusers, who don't give a single care toward the customer. Every game is a cash grab, released in garbage condition and intended to prove how stupid we are. If I could get a refund for this game I would.",

It is abandoned, there has been no new patches or changes in over a year. Even after removing the horrible Denuvo DRM, it hasn't changed the fact that the system requirements [b] DO NOT TELL YOU THE TRUTH. [/b]\n\nIt says 16 GB is recommended, but it is actually a full 32 that will be needed, otherwise it CHUGS memory like water and causes bottlenecking. Having looked into the issue and tried many different settings, others have pointed out much better performance on much more demanding settings. But, the main difference is an additional 16GB of memory available to use. This is the same problem with and the same conclusion found with TLOU 1 port, where it also sucks up 14.5GB of active memory to the point where 15fps is the average, regardless of settings, because of bottlenecking and stuttering. \n\nHowever, unlike The Last of Us, this game wasn't ported to PC by a 3rd party that was stupid and lazy, this was entirely done by Respawn Entertainment. They made a masterpiece with Fallen Order, but screwed the pooch with this subsequent sequel with arbitrary decision making. \n\nI [b] DO NOT RECOMMEND [/b] this game unless you can obtain or already have 32GB of RAM AND you get it on a steep sale, because this isn't worth the full price tag.

      "review": "Okay, I toyed with posting a review of this game and finally decided that things need to be said. First, I bought this game a while ago and haven't played it since my controller had trouble connecting to my tower. I was REALLY looking forward to it, since I played Jedi: Fallen Order a few times through and really enjoyed it.\r\n\r\nI wished I had quit while I was ahead.\r\n\r\nJedi: Survivor is just BORING. When I say boring, I mean tedious and irritating, too. Imagine having powers and a laser sword, but instead of fighting, all you do is try to slog your way through pointless mazes, climb walls, or even climb maze walls, and then solve puzzles. Seriously...SOLVE PUZZLES!!! You never get really good or develop significant combat skills because, and here's the ugly truth, you DON'T use combat skills enough to be good at them!!\r\n\r\nIn action games, you use mostly combat skills with puzzle solving as \"seasoning,\" a break from the combat to help \"spice\" up the game a bit. Puzzles are a touch of \"something else\" to make the games last longer and engage your MIND in a different way. But ACTION is the key. Combat requires a variety of techniques, with your fingers performing actions quickly and without much thought. That CAN'T happen if you're only doing it once in a long while. Reactions don't develop without a substantial amount of experience. Of course, you can use the training function, but even if you practice in the training function, by the time you get to an actual fight, the skills you practiced will be rusty again. That's how infrequent combat is.\r\n\r\nIn Survivor, you'd better hope you don't have to fight a Sith Lord because the only skills you've honed are how to use BD-1's little goop shooter and his slice dart shooter. OOOOOOOH. Exciting, I know! Also, you'd better hope there's a climbing wall you can jump to using a double jump, and then press B for an extra little zip. I mean, that's probably the best way to fight a Sith is to PUZZLE him to death, right?!?! Heck, partway through, you have to play as a completely different character. Fun right?! Wrong! You spend a lot of that time doing EVEN MORE puzzles!!!\r\n\r\nGood Sith Lord!!! This game plays like the developers listened to overprotective mommies who complained that the Jedi were just too violent for their special little pookey-wookie and couldn't you make a game that's more cerebral for our little boys??? It's obnoxious.\r\n\r\nI rage quit when I was trying to solve yet another puzzle, and instead of using Jedi powers or a lightsaber, I was squirting BD-1's black goop on the floor...again.\r\n\r\nHeck, you don't even really play. You're just a character in a video. There's only one way to get through each map. You end up respawning from falling so many times that to try and solve some puzzles, you just jump off of things, hoping to see the right path as you plummet to you pretend death. I even saw streamers do that while I was researching how to complete some ridiculous maze or another. They would just take a \"leap of faith\" and jump.\r\n\r\nI uninstalled it from my computer and I won't finish it. That's the first time I've done that in a very long time.

Also there was one part after a fight that I needed to lower my aspect ratio + graphics setting to the lowest because of a bug, that's still in there...\n-Fish tank + garden in game we have a garden because we want to grow something usefull but in this game the garden existence is just there for nothing I collect seeds but whatsfore? As for the fish I can't wrap my head around for the same reason.\n\nPositive aspects:\n+ Story Loved it\n+ Character 's story development (Merrin & Cal kissed and there are implication that they got together![I do not know why but the kissing scene was my favourite in the last movie of the skywalker saga betwen Daisy & Adam also that was a high point otherwise a very boring movie])\n+new interesting character like Caij, Toa, Dagan, Bode, Skova, Neez\n+Music I loved the HU addition (I think it was from them the first game also featured a song from them)\n+Voice actors\n\nI do not reccommend this game because the main aspect of it is a way too annoying (talking about the acrobatics part).

(also some shortcuts feel like they are in the wrong place)\nIn the first few hours its ok then it really is just annoying. Feels like a forced way to make the game longer?\nCombat is ok. The dodging feels kinda off. Most of the time just jumping or running around is easier to evade attacks.\nApart from the blaster the playstyle didnt change much compared to the first game. Its ok but not overwhelming.\nThe enemy respawn and souls-like aspect doesnt fit for me but its not a huge drawback.\nThe story is meh. It was much more interesting in the first one, it feels like they made the story up while already working on the game.\nThe loot system is bad (like the first one) all you can loot is upgrades for health and abilities. The rest is pure cosmetics which dont affect the game at all. No weapons or equipment that can be changed or that change the way you play the game or approach enemies. Very sad. \n\n\nYou need to invest quite a lot of time to discover everything and thus you have to spend much more time playing for little progress in Gameplay and Story - which makes it boring for me. \nHow can i remember the story after so much jumping around and solving puzzles for random doors with a nice cosmetic inside???_Sarcasm off.\nAnyways, for Fans if its in Sale, i can recommend as not everything is bad.
