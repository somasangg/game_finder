The game completely shifted the way I see war and conflict. Instead of focusing on soldiers or heroic battles, it forces you to experience everything through the eyes of ordinary civilians who are just trying to survive.\n\nEvery in-game day feels heavy. It’s not just about finding food or medicine, but about holding on to your humanity when everything around you is falling apart. Even small choices can leave you feeling guilty or unsure, and that emotional weight really stayed with me, especially that time when i forced to robe that elder couple's house. \n\nThis game made me realize that war isn’t just about tactics or glory, it’s about people whose lives are torn apart without warning.",

In terms of raising awareness, I couldn't think of a better example that captures the hopeless atmosphere of modern warfare. I truly feel that it makes you a better person and changes the way you view wars and the civilians caught up in them, especially nowadays, when wars still poison our everyday lives. Besides, it's so refreshing to play a war game where we're not heroic soldiers. This is a beautiful game, and 11 bit studios deserves all the respect it gets. In 2022, they organized a fundraiser for Ukrainian refugees and released a special DLC, the proceeds of which went to help civilians. In terms of gameplay, I can imagine that some people will find it boring or too difficult, but this is not a game for everyone. It requires the right attitude and mood. I can only think of one negative: once you get to know the mechanics, it doesn't really offer any kind of challenge, and you'll be able to play through it without any problems as many times as you want. But maybe that's not such a negative thing here. It's meant to convey a feeling and a message rather than provide a Dark Souls experience. In summary, this is a work of art that transcends its status as a game and does so for a good cause. 10/10",

      "review": "Have you ever played State of Decay and wished for the same experience, but in 2D? Then you’ve probably missed This War of Mine from 2014. This game was made by the same developers who created Frostpunk. I played it for 5 minutes, got tired of learning the mechanics, and uninstalled it. I haven’t touched it again since. But who knows? Maybe in the future, I’ll give it another shot.\n\nThis War of Mine is a single-player survival base-building game where you control a group of civilians trying to survive in a city that’s been under siege for months. Some people compare it to Come and See—a brutal war film—saying it shows the real dark side of war. But it’s not quite that deep. Keep in mind that the story isn’t as profound as some might suggest.\n\nThe atmosphere, however, is great. The colors, music, and art style are all very well done. The gameplay is solid, too. You have access to a variety of buildings for your base, and there are plenty of resource types. Traders will occasionally visit your base, which is helpful, especially early on. I really like the characters in the game; they each have traits and abilities, giving you a bit of role-playing potential. Almost everyone has both positive and negative sides, which adds depth to the experience.\n\nI love the moral system. For example, you might have a character who’s a smoker and is upset because there aren’t enough cigarettes stocked for him. If you don’t keep his supply up, he’ll get depressed. Or if you have a woman who’s a babysitter and you steal a log of wood from the soldiers, she’ll get depressed over your shameful actions. It’s a neat touch.\n\nI almost like everything about this game, but there’s one thing: I really enjoyed it for the first 20-25 days of play. Each game takes about 40-45 days, and in the early days, it feels like you’re truly surviving in a war-torn city. But after a while, it becomes repetitive. You start skipping days and just doing nothing. Once you figure out how the game works, it gets way too easy. I completed three campaigns: the first two were fun, but the third one was boring by the late game. I was just skipping days and feeding my group a mountain of canned food just to finish the campaign. It wasn’t fun anymore.\n\nSo, This War of Mine doesn’t have much replay value. The story mode is simpler than the classic mode, but it offers a \"touching\" story. That’s about it.\n\nCharacter controls are fine for the most part, but since it’s not a combat-focused game, when you do have to fight, the controls are awful. I’ve died too many times because of it, and the clunky combat is a real frustration.\n\nOne last thing I really hate: the saving system. Why can't the game save automatically at the end of each day? It’s so frustrating. You die because of the terrible combat controls, and then you have to replay the whole day and hope the game behaves the way you want it to during the next fight. It’s horrible.\n\nOverall, as a game in its genre, I’d rate it a solid 7/10. I’d recommend giving it a try, but only if you get it on sale. For me, paying $20(including DLC which is STORIERS WHICH I DONT GIVE A FUCK) for a game that I played for 30 hours, never touched the story mode, and will probably only play again in my 90s at a retirement home? That’s a bit pricey. My country isn’t exactly wealthy, so it’s hard to justify that cost. We not even have retirements homes do I will be on streets. If you are in same situation its better to save that 20$.",

Reminiscent of another title, Orphan Age, this dives into the nitty-gritty of surviving a war-torn city, like avoiding leaving during the day unless you wish to get your wig split playing \"Spot the Sniper\", or facing moral dillemmas: Would you steal from the sick and dying if it meant you may survive another day? Maybe you can, but your character might not be able to live with that guilt. There are many ways to lose the game, by simply dying as another casualty of war, committing suicide, dying by trying to escape in desperation, abandoning your shelter, even if you do survive, your characters would more than likely be racked with survivor's guilt, PTSD, and are forever scarred by the war.

Schleichend entscheiden, ob du jemanden bestehlen sollst, ob du jemandem die Medizin wegnimmst, ob du vertraust — und jedes Mal fühlt es sich falsch und richtig zugleich an. Spieler loben genau diese moralische Tiefe. \n\nÜberleben ist System, kein Zufall. Crafting, Kochen, Reparieren, Wache setzen, nachts auf Beutezug — das Spiel belohnt Planung und Herumprobieren. Du baust Werkstätten, bessere Betten, destillierst Zeug — kleine Siege, große Erleichterung. Leute sagen: „Man kommt immer wieder zurück, um es besser zu machen.“ \n\n\n\nGameplay-Vibe (kurz erzählt)\n\nTagsüber: du flickst Löcher, backst Brot, redest mit Leuten, handelst, heilst Wunden.\nNachts: du schleichst raus, klaust Vorräte, hoffst nicht von Banditen erwischt zu werden.\nEs ist eine Stille, unterbrochen von Entscheidungen, die sich anfühlen wie Fehltritte im echten Leben. Du wirst nicht als Held gefeiert — du wirst als jemand überleben, der zu lange gezögert hat. Und das macht’s so brutal ehrlich. \n\n\n\nWas die Community sagt (und ich unterschreibe)\n\n„Realistische, harte Darstellung ziviler Kriegsfolgen.“ ✔️ Viele Reviews loben die Art, wie das Spiel Empathie erzeugt, statt bloß zu schocken. \n\n„Wiederholspielwert durch zufallsgenerierte Ereignisse & harte Entscheidungen.“ ✔️ Jede Runde fühlt sich anders an, und trotzdem sitzt du da und willst es besser machen. \n\n„Wurde sogar von Menschenrechts-Organisationen wahrgenommen.“ ✔️ Fun Fact: Das Spiel bekam Sonderanerkennung von Amnesty International — und das sagt schon was über die Wirkung. \n\n\n\nKleiner Technik-/Designpunkt (positiv eingestellt)\n\nDie Grafik ist nicht der neueste AAA-Glanz — und das ist gut so. Diese rauhe, getönte Optik passt wie angegossen zur Botschaft. Musik und Sounddesign sind minimalistisch, aber präzise: ein Ton, und du weißt, dass etwas schiefgelaufen ist. Reviewer loben genau diese stilistische Entscheidung. \n\n\n\nDer (einzige) Negativpunkt — und ich sag’s offen\n\nDas Spiel ist brutal in seinen moralischen Prüfungen — aber es lässt dich nicht zu extremen Gräueltaten greifen. Du kannst skrupellos sein, Dinge stehlen, Leute opfern, kalt handeln — aber das Spiel erlaubt nicht, absichtlich extremste Verbrechen wie gezielte Morde an Kindern zu inszenieren. Für manche Spieler, die totale „anything goes“-Sandbox wollen, ist das ein Nachteil. Ich sag’s so: das Spiel setzt hier klare Grenzen — und ich respektiere es, aber ich weiß, manche Kritiker merken das und wollen „mehr Freiheiten“. Das ist der einzige Punkt, der nicht hundertprozentig jedem gefallen wird. (Kurz: moralische Härte ja — aber keine grenzenlose Perversion.) \n\n\n\nFazit — kurz, böse, ehrlich\n\nThis War of Mine ist ein Spiel, das dich moralisch auspresst und dir dabei das Gefühl gibt, wirklich etwas erlebt zu haben. Es ist nicht lustig, es ist nicht bequem, aber es ist wichtig — und selten war ein Spiel so effektiv darin, Empathie und Druck zu verschmelzen. Es hat Preise und Anerkennung verdient, und ja: es beschäftigt dich noch lange nach dem Ausschalten. Wenn du Narrative und schwere Entscheidungen willst — kack drauf, hol’s dir. Wenn du ein Shooter-Rush willst — such woanders.",

      "review": "Let me start by saying: [b] This War of Mine [/b] is my [u] FAVORITE [/u] game of all time.\n\nWhere as most games about war revolve around the action, the killing, the war itself, This War of Mine delves deeply into the [i] human cost [/i] of war itself. Your characters will starve, they will get depressed, and they will [spoiler] commit acts out of desperation and even commit suicide. [/spoiler]\n\nYou will be riddled with tough choices, and even tougher situations. As with most every day people living through a war, the goal is not to [i] harm others [/i] but rather to [i] ensure that you and your community [b] Survive. [/b][/i] You will need to build your base to prevent looters. You will need to actively defend yourself when patrolling for supplies. You can help others in your community to prolong their survival, or wait out their demise and loot what remains. \n\nMaking ethically bad decisions can affect your gameplay drastically. Whether this is good or bad, is up to you, and the playthrough you have. Each one is different, difficult, and a fun journey. Often, some, or none of your characters will survive to the end. Often times, your neighbors will ask for help. Often times, your characters will cry, or wish they had a book, or reminisce. This is the nature of [b] war. [/b]\n\nIf you're a fan of survival games, base builders, in-depth stories, or war games, you should absolutely pick up This War of Mine. I've loved it for over a decade (Ignore my playtime, I played hundreds of hours of this when I was trapped without wifi in a different living situation) and so will you.",

Every wound your survivor sustains, every sickness, every day they go hungry, cold or tired, you celebrate their highs and sympathize with them at their lowest point. Losing someone feels like a gut punch, taking a life is not a decision you want to have to make, will you stick with your principles or will you lose yourself to and become another casualty of the war? One step, one bullet, one beating , it is a struggle to make it through the day, and every obstacle you overcome feels like you have somehow done the impossible.",

If they had a knife i'd get it, but come the fuck on, there's no justification that someone does more damage with their fists than someone else does with a crowbar, especially when the game doesn't have a fleshed out combat system and all you can do is point and click to attack AND have a cooldown for it.\r\n\r\nAll of that stuff is annoying, but the kicker for why i can't recommend it, is because the game is REALLY bad at giving ANY sort of feedback. You in an area you shouldn't be? have fun figuring it out! People could be 100% silent to you until suddenly shouting \"get out of here!\" and will still chase and initiate fights with you WHILE YOU TRY TO LEAVE just like they JUST indicated they wanted you to. No prior warnings, no nothing, just suddenly \"how dare you exist!\" with no way of knowing without pure trial and error on the player's part.\r\n\r\nThe Aforementioned unfair trespassing situation is what became the reason for this review being negative, because it's happened too many times at this point. Place that people were talking with me just prior, suddenly deciding i'm a threat and need to leave, but attacking me before i can leave. I am also certain i'm not stealing, because the game gives a different icon for stealing rather than normal looting. They have no reason to be hostile, they don't give an indication of being hostile, but then suddenly will give a warning, and just start attacking, all within seconds, before i even have the CHANCE to leave.\r\n\r\nCouple this unwarranted trespassing situation with the god-awful combat system, and it's just not worth even interacting with any area you see people in half the time. The game doesn't like to give you do-overs, so it's all pure guessing game, and the game will just fucking kill you for guessing wrong just once.",

The moral choices that are in this game, i feel literally no emotional connection to as a result because I'm not particularly tied to the humanity of the characters that you control. \n\nBeyond that, the gameplay doesn't really play as a game as much as it plays like a chore you have to complete.  You go out, you loot, if you get seen by someone hostile you either run or die because fighting is pretty much RNG and characters haven't discovered the technology of ripping clothes to use as bandages.  It's not particularly difficult as much as more just unenjoyable.  The more annoying part is base raids which are just RNG where all your NPCs are going to be wounded and your progress set back for no particular reason other than the game decided to set you back.  This can be mitigated by more weapons at base but still, as a gamer we all just love getting random RNG setbacks we have no control over which is more where the annoyance comes from.\n\nOh, and I completely forgot the whole war backdrop.  You will too if you play it; if the title didn't have \"War\" in it, you'd think its, idk, the apocalypse, society has collapsed, you're in an anarchic state, etc.  There's no shelling, you don't come across patrols trying to go scavenge, you're never in an area you have to escape because it starts getting shelled, not even random rifle cracks as stray round strike your hideout just for atmospheric purposes.

In this game you not only don't feel it but also after a while you even forget it that a war is going on. It shows nothing about the civilian population that tries to avoid getting into crossfire or other brutal things caused by a war. It's only about the life of looting and suffering with no big context to war. If I didn't knew what this game is about, I would've never guessed it that it's about that. So the theme about This War of Mine is a fail, but what about the gameplay? Well it's not better either:\nMost of the time you gonna spend on the night missions trying to find resources to survive and upgrading your house. And I don't know if they made it on purpose or not, but you will always have a big lack of resources. You won't get enough stuff to not getting your survivors a cold, injury, starvation, happiness and sleep at the same time. Although this really make you feel \"How the hell are we gonna to survive?!\", which totally fits for the scenario, but after a while it gets annoying. Especially the problem of not being able to protect your house, even if you max upgraded your security door and made night guarding shifts, raiders will still come to your house, steal some of your stuff and injure others. This just sucks and if the developers wanted exactly that feeling then...good job, but for what price? This really frustrated me.\nThe only good thing about this, is that 11 bit studios actually talks about this topic and made donation campaigns to help those real people in need.

The moral choices that are in this game, i feel literally no emotional connection to as a result because I'm not particularly tied to the humanity of the characters that you control. \n\nBeyond that, the gameplay doesn't really play as a game as much as it plays like a chore you have to complete.  You go out, you loot, if you get seen by someone hostile you either run or die because fighting is pretty much RNG and characters haven't discovered the technology of ripping clothes to use as bandages.  It's not particularly difficult as much as more just unenjoyable.  The more annoying part is base raids which are just RNG where all your NPCs are going to be wounded and your progress set back for no particular reason other than the game decided to set you back.  This can be mitigated by more weapons at base but still, as a gamer we all just love getting random RNG setbacks we have no control over which is more where the annoyance comes from.\n\nOh, and I completely forgot the whole war backdrop.  You will too if you play it; if the title didn't have \"War\" in it, you'd think its, idk, the apocalypse, society has collapsed, you're in an anarchic state, etc.  There's no shelling, you don't come across patrols trying to go scavenge, you're never in an area you have to escape because it starts getting shelled, not even random rifle cracks as stray round strike your hideout just for atmospheric purposes.

The more annoying part is base raids which are just RNG where all your NPCs are going to be wounded and your progress set back for no particular reason other than the game decided to set you back.  This can be mitigated by more weapons at base but still, as a gamer we all just love getting random RNG setbacks we have no control over which is more where the annoyance comes from.\n\nOh, and I completely forgot the whole war backdrop.  You will too if you play it; if the title didn't have \"War\" in it, you'd think its, idk, the apocalypse, society has collapsed, you're in an anarchic state, etc.  There's no shelling, you don't come across patrols trying to go scavenge, you're never in an area you have to escape because it starts getting shelled, not even random rifle cracks as stray round strike your hideout just for atmospheric purposes.  A movie like \"The Pianist\" is something that nails it whereas this game is kinda, well, misses the vibe I'd say.  The idea of a city under siege seems very misconceptualized here.",

In this game you not only don't feel it but also after a while you even forget it that a war is going on.

Well it's not better either:\nMost of the time you gonna spend on the night missions trying to find resources to survive and upgrading your house. And I don't know if they made it on purpose or not, but you will always have a big lack of resources. You won't get enough stuff to not getting your survivors a cold, injury, starvation, happiness and sleep at the same time. Although this really make you feel \"How the hell are we gonna to survive?!\", which totally fits for the scenario, but after a while it gets annoying.

This just sucks and if the developers wanted exactly that feeling then...good job, but for what price?
