But...a thing or two before you spend your money:\n\n1. The game can only work on one screen but it has so many menus, sub-menus, and sub-sub-menus, that it takes several hours until you start feeling semi-comfortable in finding the information needed. It is very frustrating initially, but gets \"ok, fine\" perhaps at the ~25 hour mark. \n2. The in-game tutorials are useless. Even a simple thing like explaining the mechanics of a vital component like the Budget was not done (why not?). So you need to research online (wiki vic 3, Steam community guides) and read all in-game menus, sub-menus, and countless sub-sub menus, while taking notes; and then testing it in a small country (Kongo seems to be the optimal choice for testing) so your hypothesis is confirmed or rejected. Initially it is very frustrating, mainly because of in-game confusing word choice. After perhaps ~50 hours it gets super fun, like discovering something new.\n3. At about the ~100 hours mark you know the game mechanics and where to find the information required. And this is when you actually start playing the game.  \n\nFinally, the video game publishing business is about selling the game at cost or below cost, and then selling additional content (called \"DLC\", DownLoadable Content) for high profits. So try to buy a bundle (the game, plus many DLCs bundled together) on sale, as there are 14 DLCs and counting.\n\nCheers.",

      "review": "With 1.11, Victoria 3 has arrived where I can recommend the game fully.\nThe most important first: It is not a war game with included simplified economical elements, it is a full grand strategy game from the perspective of socioeconomics, internal and external politics, international trade and economy with included rudimentary warfare. If you expect a Europa Universalis in the Victorian age then this game might not be for you.\n\nThis game is the most complex simulation of the entanglement of politics, socioeconomics, economy and trade Paradox ever made so far (13 November 2025). And this comes with some trade offs. There is a relation which determines how wide a game can be with a given depth in order to be able to be simulated without a quantum computer and more important, be fun to play without becoming just boring work and rely on automations which make the game trivial.\nTherefore, Vick3 is so incredibly deep that it has to be narrowed down in its focus, that means warfare is not bad but it is the game’s absolute weak point. You basically just assign some generals to your army and send them to the frontline where the generals will fight for you. While I think the new system is much better than the old babysitting of 10,000 little soldiers on your map, it really needs a major rework to be more rewarding.\n\nBut now let’s talk about the main factor why I love the game and basically play only this one: its simulation.\n\nThe core of the game is the extremely detailed simulation of the world’s population.\nThe population is fundamentally defined by a complex matrix of cultural traits, language traits, heritage traits and religion. And your laws determine how much every ethnicity is accepted in your country. This acceptance is classified in 5 categories which span from total acceptance to cultural extinction. Every category defines the access to education and jobs, wages, assimilation, political participation and power, etc.\nThese pops consume products which they buy with their salaries they gain through their jobs or dividends. Their education level and also wealth will define what work they can do and this will also determine the political movements, interest groups, political parties and political lobbies they will support. Eventually, this social fabric will determine your political situation and what laws you can enact or have to enact in order to prevent a revolution and eventually fulfill your vision for the country you play, moreover, it will also influence your foreign politics.\n\nThis leads us to the next great point: the market.\nThe market is separated into a national market and an international global market. Both markets are connected through trade centers. These trade centers are not a lazy automation mechanic, more they employ pops, buy trade ships and do profitable trades between your market and the international one and pay salaries and dividends. You can only steer the trade indirectly through tariffs and subsidies, laws and diplomatic deals. You are able to specify your industry on the basis of your resources and the global demand.\nMoreover, your pops are also an important player on the market because they now invest in your economy and build and own plants, but who can invest  and who can own if at all depends on your laws and political system. \n\nAnother important part are now companies, these companies can now build in other countries and also open their headquarters, in any case they will transfer wealth from the foreign market to your market. Their COE have will also support their interest group of choice politically. \nAs you can see this game is now about economical imperialism.\n\nAnother great point is the diplomacy:\nyou now have to do treaties which offer ample possibilities to interact with foreign nations. In my opinion it is the best diplomatic system in a Paradox game.\n\nFinally, nationalism is implemented in the game, which changes the gameplay entirely in a good sense. The population will develop a national frevor over the time which of course depends on laws, literacy and whether a state exists where the pops are an accepted population group. Now playing an multiethnic empires are very challenging to play because it is not easy to hold them together. \n\nThis leads us directly to an very important point: flavor. \nFor every flavor pack the devs revise the region in terms of politics, power structures and history and change them accordingly by adding new laws, change of power distribution, journal entries and by adding new game mechanics. For example, now Austria, Brazil, Kabul, Japan and the USA play absolutely differently and will offer an entire different expirience. \n\n\nFinally, this game allows you not only to play min-max but rather you can play any type of political system imaginable. You want to enact Pol Pot’s agrarian communism? No problem, the game gives you the means to do it. It also doesn't shy away to allow you to play more controversial systems like a racist state which depends fully of exploitation of salves, with the next patch they will showcase the brutality of that system by have a death rate of 40 % on your plantations. Human lives are basically the fuel of the wealth of your landowners.\n\nThese are just some points which show how complex and interconnected the game systems are with each other, there are so many more points. And the best is, this all happens in the Victorian age, and you will do all these things in front of the emerging of nationalism and the change from an agrarian feudal society up to the dawn of WWII. Every decision you fell will matter because it will change the dynamic between politics, economy and the socioeconomic reality of your pops.",

The game presents itself as grounded in historical materialist view of history, and I appreciate that Paradox is finally moving in that direction. But even here it feels incomplete\r\n   The problem is that you, an amorphous player state, end up functioning as the primary engine of historical progress. Class forces exist in name, yet they don't truly drive the process. The rising classes like the bourgeoisie, the proletariat aren't shaping society through their own contradictions and interests; the player's conscius will overrides them. This creates a contradiction: the game claims to simulate history through material forces, but in practice, history unfolds according to the player rather than the dynamic of class struggle. \r\n   That said, I've only put in a few hours and haven't seen everything the game has to offer.

The Warfront system isn't something I'd change away though, even if V2 fans can still be a little sour about the lack of micro; warfronts are an extension of the core mechanics of building stuff, and with a game like Vicky 3, they're less of a micro-scale battle, and more of a production line that you need to maintain and be betterer than the enemy's, either through intelligent (ab)use of how the AI controlls itself, or by making your GDP towards military to be bigger and/or better than your enemies.\r\n\r\nSnag it when you can, and DEFINITELY snag the Expansion packs on a sale, they're near a must-buy.

It’s like watching a long-term project evolve in real time. You’re basically part of a living, growing simulation — not in a “beta tester” bad way, but in the fun way where each expansion suddenly unlocks depth that was missing before.\r\n\r\nDownsides:\r\nThe meta exists, and anything outside that meta is noticeably weaker. And yes, the game only really becomes “complete” once you start adding DLC — the base game alone still doesn’t hit its full potential.\r\n\r\nUpsides:\r\nThe game isn’t demanding enough for the meta imbalance to ruin the experience. You can ignore optimal play and still build a thriving nation. And thanks to the updates and DLC, the economic systems genuinely feel good now — stable, logical, satisfying.\r\n\r\nIt’s absolutely worth playing — but only on sale.

I feel like it's unfair for me to judge the game off of my frustration with the growing pains of my first few playthroughs from almost a year ago.\n\nHaving come back and learned the game a decent bit, I still don't like it.\n\nMy Prussia -> Germany -> HRE playthrough basically went something like this:\nIn the third year of the game, the Springtime of Nations kicked off early and I almost had half of my country secede under a liberal revolt before I even finished reading the four or five events that came up all at once.\nBetween 1842 - 1865, I did nothing but mindlessly build things that said they would increase my revenue, never mind if I had the labor force or not to staff these buildings, as well as building up my relations with Russia and the UK; in 1849, I became the North German Confederation by ACCIDENT. Austria succumbed to the Hungarian Revolution and that removed their unifier candidacy, instantly annexing North Germany to me. By 1870, I had the third largest GDP in the world, I had both the UK and Russia in alliance treaties with binding periods of 99 years, and was one state away from forming Germany; Baden refused to support me for a while. All of this with minimal effort, minimal engagement, and minimal planning. The one time the game got interesting was when my standard of living went into freefall in 1926, and I fixed it by subsidizing all of my railroads. I made money hand over fist the entire game, almost never went into any form of debt, formed the HRE in 1903, and became the second most populous country and had the largest GDP in the world by 1913. As of 1933, I was sitting at ~730 million GDP and ~160 million pops. I did not get to engage with the economy in any substantive, meaningful, or even just slightly fun way; I just clicked anything with a green number next to it. The same was true of my diplomacy; I just clicked the improve relations button with the two largest GPs and they did all of the fighting for me for the rest of the game, oftentimes without my request, despite my blatant warmongering. I did not even find reprieve from the lack of engagement in my management of society; I managed to stay an Autocratic Monarchy the entire game despite hovering at a consistent 20-25% radical populace for almost seven decades, and all I had to do to make my SoL skyrocket was turn the taxes down and turn the infrastructure subsidies up. I passed a grand total of six laws in 97 years, and four of them were because I wanted to. You can, legitimately, get through a campaign by simply ignoring the libs.\n\nFuck.\n\nI love Victoria 2, and I can admit that even in that game, the economic management leaves a lot to be desired, especially when playing as a Great Power; oftentimes, the economy just runs on autopilot. The infamy system is antiquated in a way where 24.99 infamy = socially acceptable but anything above that incurs the War of the Eighth Coalition. These are fair criticisms and real problems that Victoria 2 has, but at least it makes up for it by having a fun war system. Victoria 3's economy makes you WISH it ran on autopilot, and by the time you get to 1880, it does. The infamy system is equally nonsensical, with the added caveat being that now you can't save-scum to avoid the infamy hit, and the game doesn't even HAVE a real combat system to make up for the lack of economic sillies like Victoria 2 did. By design, a sequel is supposed to take the core concept of its predecessor and improve upon it, smoothing out the rough edges and keeping what works to present a more complete rendition of its predecessor's mechanics. Victoria 3, instead, does the same shit Victoria 2 did, except with a nonexistent war system, an admittedly in depth internal politics mechanic that still manages to leave a bad taste in your mouth by virtue of \"you can just ignore it,\" a disjointed diplomacy and sphere of influence framework, and an economy that runs on autopilot from 1880 onwards instead of from 1850 onwards. This is not even mentioning my gripes with the colonization system.\n\nVictoria 3 is a tug of war between desperately trying to get the bad things happening to your country to stop in early game and desperately wanting literally anything to happen in mid to late game.\nI got a key sent to me by my friend and I wish I could get a refund.\n\nIn summary: do not.",

      "review": "Wow. I seldom leave a negative rating for a game. I usually figure it's just me, it's just my opinion, I don't get it, etc.\r\n\r\nBut I also seldom, if ever, have encountered a game that I did not like from the beginning. The micromanagement in this game is mind-boggling. It's just me, it's just my opinion, I don't get it, etc. but surely they would have a substantial tutorial to get a player like me, with that initial impression, into the game at least. Right?\r\n\r\nLet me tell you about my tutorial experience. I clicked Learn the Game, and chose Sweden. The tutorial started promisingly. It took me through a few UI aspects without explaining much; I did not expect it to at this point.\r\n\r\nSo it directed me to the Journal which contained my first task: Change any Production Method on Rye Farms in Svealand (a province of Sweden). It explains how, and why. Not bad. Done. What's next?\r\n\r\nNothing. Nothing until that construction was complete the following \"year\". Meanwhile, I am sitting, watching the various notifications pop up, none of which mean anything at this point and none of which were operable. I noticed that I did lack fruit in my Swedish Market, but I could not find anyway to rectify this. Sweden does not grow fruit in this game, so obviously I needed to trade for it, but how? The market tab shows what is being traded, prices and taxes, but not how to trade.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, there is a second mission to \"Patronize Romanticism\". Okay, the first part I figured out: Build an Arts Academy someplace.  The second requirement is \"activated Traditional Art\". Hovering over that tells me that Traditional Art produces Fine Art but consumes Paper. It does not say how to activate Traditional Art.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Rye Farms production method is done. A long period of time goes by until, sometime in 1837 (the game begins in 1836 but each \"year\" takes a half-hour of game time to elapse), I get another objective: Research a Technology. Okay, I choose Bessemer Process. And again, I wait for something to happen. Nothing. At this stage, it takes \"years\" to attain a research objective. When I finally pulled the plug in January 1840, I still had 13 months to go (or, another half-hour of sitting around).\r\n\r\nThis, from the beginning of the tutorial, was definitely a hint: \"You do not have to learn how everything works before you play. Take it slow and learn from your mistakes, and soon you will be an expert policymaker!\" Heh, they aren't kidding, especially about the slow and mistakes parts. But where to begin? How to PLAY? (As I watched the \"days\" and \"weeks\" click by, I kept thinking about my other games . . . )\r\n\r\nLook, I know what the responses to this would be if this was a forum post:  \"Just play the game\", \"Watch YouTube videos\", and/or \"Read the wiki\". One can learn much on one's own in a new game, sure, but I prefer at least some guidance. And sitting for hours watching somebody else play the game, complete with the annoying circular mouse movements as they speak, is not my idea of fun. I often refer to wikis for details and tips, but not for reading them from start to finish in order to learn how to play the game.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the developers made this game so complicated, and utterly fell down with the tutorial, I cannot recommend it to anybody else for whom these aspects would be important. It [i]is[/i] just me . . . just my opinion . . . but the double-whammy of a very complicated game with a laissez-faire \"learn it on your own\" attitude means it's a thumb-down from me.",

I did not, however, get my time's worth.\r\n\r\nIf history is one of your hobbies, Victoria 3 is going to appeal to you--in theory. In practice, there are critical flaws in the simulation that render this alleged historical sandbox gamey and bizarre. I love the economic and social sim so much, but Paradox has not fixed essential AI behaviors in the entire game's support cycle, and it's obvious at this point that they don't particularly care to fix them.\r\n\r\nGermany annexes Austria's capital in a war. Austria moves its capital to Bohemia, which is now isolated from the rest of the country. Austria's entire economy goes into an irrecoverable tailspin, because its Ai is incapable of understanding what has happened to it or what to do about it. Dead Balkans for the rest of the game.\r\n\r\nGiant death war between Great Britain and France. Great Britain has complete naval dominance, and all of France's overseas territories get occupied. Great Britain fails to accomplish any of its colonial ambitions in the war because it added 'Liberate Occitania' as a war goal, and any war between great powers can only result in a white peace or total capitulation. White peace. Nothing happens. Boring.\r\n\r\nI was hoping these were just hiccups that would be ironed out with additional dev time, but it took them two years to add a global market, something from base Victoria 2, back to the game, and I have had an epiphany. They won't fix it; It isn't a problem. They are interested in drip feeding the playerbase regional touch ups for the next X years, and we will get country specific flavor packs instead of giving the AI a basic ability to realize when its head has been chopped off, or a war system that can accomplish a single blessed thing. \r\n\r\nWhatever.",

      "review": "Victoria 3 is a game about building infrastructure and industry to grow your economy so that you can afford to build more infrastructure and industry to grow your economy better and faster. And reading that, I'm sure some of you think that sounds great. There's nothing inherently wrong with that gameplay loop, after all. The problem, as with most of the rest of the problems of this game, is Victoria 3's startlingly poor execution.\n\nGrand Strategy titles are at their best when the systems which underpin them are seamlessly integrated into one another, and there are multiple objectives you can pursue not just at any given time, but over the course of a full game. In the context of a Victoria title, two examples might be warmongering expansionist state or a peaceful, industrializing power.\n\nReturning to the topic of integrated mechanics, let's borrow an example from Victoria 2. In Victoria 2, your taxation percentage is determined by technology, which you gain based on a research-points-per-day calculation based upon a combination of your demographics and your population's literacy. You can then use those taxes to, say, build a dock; that dock gives you an increase to your colonial range and a flat increase to your maximum colonial points, representing the amount of colonial lands you can control without penalty. These systems are all in conversation with one another, and give the player meaningful choices and considerations about how they want to proceed. If you want to become a colonial power, what do you do? Do you focus on literacy first to research more quickly, or do you instead rush straight for naval technologies to try to get better ports and ships quickly to extend your colonial range? If you do, will you have sufficient capital to fund the great cost of an industrial navy if you don't industrialize first? Might industrializing first even be the best call, since it can both provide you with the money you need to support your navy AND the demographic shifts that will improve your research? People who have played Victoria 2 will know I'm trivializing the calculus more than a little here just for example's sake, but I hope my point is clear: no matter what your objectives in such a game, there's a great deal of consideration behind how you proceed, not just moment-to-moment but also in terms of your overall, game-long strategic objectives. And it's important to note, of course, that the AI isn't just going to stand there and do what you want, either - you have to be prepared to defend your interests.\n\nVictoria 3, to its credit, does have some mechanical interconnectivity. But it's little enough. Most of the systems in the game, by comparison to its predecessor Victoria 2 and contemporary Europa Universalis 5, are disjointed, ill-conceived, and even trivialized. Your government can pass any law so long as you're willing to bash your head against it long enough, regardless of what party is in power and what they actually support - you do not need to guide your state in a particular direction to achieve your ends. Even if an enemy threatens you with war, you can just surrender without significant popular consequence (in a game set during the most politically unstable century marked by revolutions, by the way) - being caught unprepared for a war is rarely catastrophic, and even if it is the war itself, and the consequent devastation, can be avoided entirely. There are no significant consequences to global industrialization across all territories - as long as you have the population to support it, you can just farm raw materials and make finished goods everywhere, with no significant differentiation between urban and rural centers. These are just examples, and only a few, but I think they illustrate my point; the lack of any real limits on what the player can do (no matter how realistic those would be), coupled with mechanical fluidity, means that there's not only no ability to plan a clear objective for a run, but also no need to. Just do everything. Unless you're playing as a tiny and under-populated location, you can have it all: get all the laws you want, all the industry you want, all the tech you want, all the power you want. There's no real system in the game which is sufficiently integrated into other systems to stop you - so as long as you have the POPs, well... just do everything.\n\nThere's no challenge. And I realize that phrasing it that way might sound off-putting, but I mean it in a sense of the game's design rather than a subjective impression. The core gameplay loop of this game is supposed to be industrialization, and there is barely anything in the entire game that could ever stop you from doing that. The absolute worst the game can throw at you is bankruptcy, and you would have to do some truly unbelievable mismanagement to ever reach that point. Everything else, unless you're a single-province territory who can't surrender if threatened without getting a game-over, is easily survivable. And, more than survivable, it's easily recoverable: just take your knocks now and come back and beat them later, when you've done everything you want and have become an unstoppable juggernaut. Because there are no real restrictions or failure-states, there's no catastrophe if you fall to a rebellion, or don't get a law you want, or lose a war. Because that's the way this game was designed: that the player can do whatever they want, reach whatever end they want, no matter the circumstances.\n\nI hesitate to use words such as \"soulless\" in reviews because I think that describing a game as such isn't helpful; it doesn't explain anything useful, and is at best a kneejerk and subjective reaction to distaste. But I think in the case of Victoria 3 I can articulate my displeasure sufficiently well to explain why I feel this game truly is soulless: they are selling a power fantasy to the player, one where virtually every system is a vapid puppet-show designed to distract from the emptiness of the simulation. From the warfare system that the player has almost no control over (you neither control armies nor give them more than vague objectives; everything is automated); to the political parties and laws that are up for debate which are almost entirely random; to the technology system which has few options and limited ability to gameplan; to the colonial game which is nothing more than a way for the player to get more territory to build more stuff in. There is almost nothing in this game which presents any actual, serious challenge. Everything that exists does so to facilitates the player getting more places on a map that allow them to click a button. That button expands an industry, so you can get a bit more money, so you can expand another industry. That is this game. And this game has little more engagement than a visual novel - and trust me, a much worse story.\n\nIf you want a game that does Victoria 3's premise the way it should have been done, I strongly urge you to look into Europa Universalis 5 instead. It's a true masterpiece of the genre that I can't recommend enough, and treats its players seriously. This game does not.",

Not much interesting there, because the most interesting concept—imperial conquest—is botched...🍅\n\nThe game assumes politics and diplomacy is the main feature you play the game yet its not political or economical simulator at all... Reminds me of Emperator Rome, who got confused between two states, two visions of the game and none was executed. 🍅\n\n🤨 this huge numbers of 2K or 34K my gosh what happened to simplicity of 0.3+ and +12 do I really need these huge numbers?

You can blockade the Strait of Gibraltar, literally the only entrance to the Mediterranean, and somehow the Americans will bypass it and land 200k troops on a coastal province.

It starts you out with 8 pages of text-dump about the controls and the thinnest overview of what the game's about, then just shoves you straight into normal free-play with a bunch of random objectives to complete. \n\nThis sounds OK on paper, but I was given, for example, a challenge to enact universal healthcare. Well, it was greyed-out for me, and even clicking \"How do I do this?\" got me nowhere. I had to figure out for myself that in order to get that law enacted, I had to garner favour with some of my government's factions, enact several other more liberal laws, then research certain tech, then reform my government, then hope that the approval rating was high enough to get it voted in, only to get a bunch of random events along the way that caused my people to start revolting. \n\nNot only that, but no matter how many buildings I created, or how many times I right-clicked on everything and put \"auto expand\" or \"subsidise\", my civilians' standard of living kept declining, with the tooltip saying \"try creating more jobs!\"... which is exactly what I was doing by expanding everything, no?\n\nWhat did it lead to? Of course, another revolt/uprising.\n\nSo yes, in the TUTORIAL, I got a game-over screen because of a civilian uprising, even though I had a lot of tech researched, a good government approval rating, and every building on auto-expand.\n\nThat isn't it either:\n- Why are all buildings across every region just dumped into one giant sequential list? Want to build fisheries in 6 different regions? Well you have to do them 1-by-1 and it'll take you 6 years of construction.\n- Put the game on 5X speed to speed-up said production? Well good luck with that, because the game won't pause for anything, even really important events. A red popup will flash past and disappear unless you're staring at that part of the screen, and the next thing you know, you're invaded by UK/France/USA because you didn't enact X/Y/Z in the 20 seconds they wanted it done in.\n- Military stuff? Don't even bother. It's easily the worst implementation of anything military in a game I've ever seen. Just sending an army somewhere is enough to want to rip your hair out.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, but after 4 hours of playing, the fact I still have no clue how half the systems work, like inter-regional markets, product prices varying from region to region despite trade hubs and railways, how to even begin with diplomacy... \n\nClearly this game is for people who've played previous entries and already know what to do and how to do it, yet the only thing the tutorial tells you in any great detail, is how to open menus and move around the map.\n\nIt's a complete mess, oh, and has the usual Paradox special of having a ton of DLCs that probably make the game actually playable.",

I've had better general traits, perfect supply, morale and org, more soldiers (3:1, 5:1, even 8:1) slightly better tech, and mobilization options and still lost. You'll still stomp weak undeveloped countries but if you're fighting another developed country you better have at least 200 battalions more than them. I've got 110 hours in this game, watched plenty of videos and read guides on how to play the game and tested out a bunch of strategies and options so this is something the devs need to address. The other problem is the lack of certain diplomatic options. There are a bunch in the game but certain ones are missing. Look up the options for Vic 3 and then check Vic 2 or EU4 and you'll see. If the devs add some more diplomatic options that have been in past games and fix the warfare then this game would be a 8/10 or better.",

      "review": "It has been three years since release, and I finally decided to buy the game today, because I thought, hopefully most big issues would probably have been taken care of by now, and it was on sale, so fine. However, I can't even play for a little over an hour without the game freezing my entire computer forcing me to use the power button on it, so even the simplest of things, producing correct code that doesn't wreck the end-user's system isn't even taken care of.\n\nNow I am going to submit a bug report, the game left no crash dumps, and nothing useful in the logs. If they are not going to take the issue seriously and respond quickly to the issue, then I am simply just going to refund this, because if they cannot fix these kinds of things in a time-span of three years while releasing DLC after DLC, then they will never fix it.\n\n(Edit; The game says I have 35.3 hours in it, those are from free-weekends)\n\nEdit 2:\n\nSo I had a look at their forum, to see if anyone were reporting similar issues. Turns out they have a whole thread about it, and what can be done to try to mitigate the issue: https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/potential-windows-freeze-workaround.1833490/\n\nNow that is fine and well, however, not all users report that doing what they ask actually works, and it seems like they are just shifting the blame onto Windows and are now ignoring that this happens to their game and isn't fixed for all users. \n\nFrom what I can read, on their forums, their game somehow decides to hijack all your CPU cores and just lock them unless you manually tell Windows to only use specific cores. Now, the fact that the game does that is 99.99999% not Windows' fault, I literally get this issue with no other game. If they know that their engine has this issue, where it starts using too many cores, then they should simply implement a limit on their end.\n\nTo me it sounds like they have their own scheduling system that tries to use all the cores on the machine (or at least they spawn enough threads that it would happen naturally), and somehow the code that runs there gets stuck, could be an infinite loop or whatever, but then they just keep spawning threads that will run the same bad code, until the system just stops working as all cores get stuck working on the same code that never finishes. The only issue on Windows' end here is that it lets any program do that. \n\nSo here's an idea, instead of telling your users to manually pick which processors can run the game every time they start it up, implement your own system to ensure that you never use more threads than the CPU has logical cores. Now, this only ensures that the PC doesn't freeze, only the game. The real fix is obviously to find and fix your absolute shit code that you have running that does this, but it also helps to not completely wreck the users' machine when this kind of issue occurs, then you would at least have a crash log and a crash dump, and you could use those to fix the actual root cause!",

The game looks and sounds beautiful and at first feels amazing and complex, but after a few hours you will realize that the mechanics are shallow and your influence on the outcome of a campaign is rather limited. Nations that start strong will become stronger, and really small nations may raise their prestige rank during the campaign, but will never have the means to truly affect a major nation.\r\n\r\nI’ve also played Vic 1 & 2, the HoI & EU series and CK2. Out of these titles, Victoria 3 is potentially the best looking, yet also the weakest in terms of gameplay and...fun. \r\nThe overwhelming pseudo-complexity, the irrational behavior of the AI combined with a lack of meaningful options to shape the world and rewrite history, makes playing Victoria 3 an disappointment. I truly hope the game receives a full mechanical overhaul, especially by granting the player more control over diplomacy and war. \r\n\r\nThe details: \r\n\r\nYou will spend thousand of clicks expanding industries, and this is the actual majority of the gameplay. Managing production methods adds overly complicated \"fake\" complexity (with an extensive list of options), but wars and army movements - which should be really in your control - are automated, leaving the player with almost no real influence. \r\n\r\nA lack of diplomatic options is especially frustrating when entering wars as a third party. Suppose you join France to defend against Germany and you want the USA to back you. There is simply no option to persuade another nation to intervene in such crucial and common scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the data shown in a massive amount of sub-menues is irrelevant for the gameplay, and the political system will also have a rather small impact and will only need a bit of attention to push for a few recommended reforms.\r\n\r\nBugs and Balance Issues:\r\nThe game often feels surprisingly buggy or unbalanced: Nations that have just lost a devastating war, with millions dead, may suddenly try to improve relations and sign new treaties only a week after their capitulation -> Everything is back to \"normal\". \r\nOn the opposite, nations that fought side by side in a long, costly but successful war may declare war on each other just two months later, often over something trivial like creating a protectorate in a remote village at the other end of the world.\r\n\r\nIn one case, a country repeatedly declined to renew a trade contract despite having a treaty rating of 63, which the game claimed would “always be accepted”.\r\n\r\nSorry for the wall of text! :)",

I feel like it's unfair for me to judge the game off of my frustration with the growing pains of my first few playthroughs from almost a year ago.\n\nHaving come back and learned the game a decent bit, I still don't like it.\n\nMy Prussia -> Germany -> HRE playthrough basically went something like this:\nIn the third year of the game, the Springtime of Nations kicked off early and I almost had half of my country secede under a liberal revolt before I even finished reading the four or five events that came up all at once.\nBetween 1842 - 1865, I did nothing but mindlessly build things that said they would increase my revenue, never mind if I had the labor force or not to staff these buildings, as well as building up my relations with Russia and the UK; in 1849, I became the North German Confederation by ACCIDENT. Austria succumbed to the Hungarian Revolution and that removed their unifier candidacy, instantly annexing North Germany to me. By 1870, I had the third largest GDP in the world, I had both the UK and Russia in alliance treaties with binding periods of 99 years, and was one state away from forming Germany; Baden refused to support me for a while. All of this with minimal effort, minimal engagement, and minimal planning. The one time the game got interesting was when my standard of living went into freefall in 1926, and I fixed it by subsidizing all of my railroads. I made money hand over fist the entire game, almost never went into any form of debt, formed the HRE in 1903, and became the second most populous country and had the largest GDP in the world by 1913. As of 1933, I was sitting at ~730 million GDP and ~160 million pops. I did not get to engage with the economy in any substantive, meaningful, or even just slightly fun way; I just clicked anything with a green number next to it. The same was true of my diplomacy; I just clicked the improve relations button with the two largest GPs and they did all of the fighting for me for the rest of the game, oftentimes without my request, despite my blatant warmongering. I did not even find reprieve from the lack of engagement in my management of society; I managed to stay an Autocratic Monarchy the entire game despite hovering at a consistent 20-25% radical populace for almost seven decades, and all I had to do to make my SoL skyrocket was turn the taxes down and turn the infrastructure subsidies up. I passed a grand total of six laws in 97 years, and four of them were because I wanted to. You can, legitimately, get through a campaign by simply ignoring the libs.\n\nFuck.\n\nI love Victoria 2, and I can admit that even in that game, the economic management leaves a lot to be desired, especially when playing as a Great Power; oftentimes, the economy just runs on autopilot. The infamy system is antiquated in a way where 24.99 infamy = socially acceptable but anything above that incurs the War of the Eighth Coalition. These are fair criticisms and real problems that Victoria 2 has, but at least it makes up for it by having a fun war system. Victoria 3's economy makes you WISH it ran on autopilot, and by the time you get to 1880, it does. The infamy system is equally nonsensical, with the added caveat being that now you can't save-scum to avoid the infamy hit, and the game doesn't even HAVE a real combat system to make up for the lack of economic sillies like Victoria 2 did. By design, a sequel is supposed to take the core concept of its predecessor and improve upon it, smoothing out the rough edges and keeping what works to present a more complete rendition of its predecessor's mechanics. Victoria 3, instead, does the same shit Victoria 2 did, except with a nonexistent war system, an admittedly in depth internal politics mechanic that still manages to leave a bad taste in your mouth by virtue of \"you can just ignore it,\" a disjointed diplomacy and sphere of influence framework, and an economy that runs on autopilot from 1880 onwards instead of from 1850 onwards. This is not even mentioning my gripes with the colonization system.\n\nVictoria 3 is a tug of war between desperately trying to get the bad things happening to your country to stop in early game and desperately wanting literally anything to happen in mid to late game.\nI got a key sent to me by my friend and I wish I could get a refund.\n\nIn summary: do not.",

I usually figure it's just me, it's just my opinion, I don't get it, etc.\r\n\r\nBut I also seldom, if ever, have encountered a game that I did not like from the beginning. The micromanagement in this game is mind-boggling. It's just me, it's just my opinion, I don't get it, etc. but surely they would have a substantial tutorial to get a player like me, with that initial impression, into the game at least. Right?\r\n\r\nLet me tell you about my tutorial experience. I clicked Learn the Game, and chose Sweden. The tutorial started promisingly. It took me through a few UI aspects without explaining much; I did not expect it to at this point.\r\n\r\nSo it directed me to the Journal which contained my first task: Change any Production Method on Rye Farms in Svealand (a province of Sweden). It explains how, and why. Not bad. Done. What's next?\r\n\r\nNothing. Nothing until that construction was complete the following \"year\". Meanwhile, I am sitting, watching the various notifications pop up, none of which mean anything at this point and none of which were operable. I noticed that I did lack fruit in my Swedish Market, but I could not find anyway to rectify this. Sweden does not grow fruit in this game, so obviously I needed to trade for it, but how? The market tab shows what is being traded, prices and taxes, but not how to trade.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, there is a second mission to \"Patronize Romanticism\". Okay, the first part I figured out: Build an Arts Academy someplace.  The second requirement is \"activated Traditional Art\". Hovering over that tells me that Traditional Art produces Fine Art but consumes Paper. It does not say how to activate Traditional Art.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Rye Farms production method is done. A long period of time goes by until, sometime in 1837 (the game begins in 1836 but each \"year\" takes a half-hour of game time to elapse), I get another objective: Research a Technology. Okay, I choose Bessemer Process. And again, I wait for something to happen. Nothing. At this stage, it takes \"years\" to attain a research objective. When I finally pulled the plug in January 1840, I still had 13 months to go (or, another half-hour of sitting around).\r\n\r\nThis, from the beginning of the tutorial, was definitely a hint: \"You do not have to learn how everything works before you play. Take it slow and learn from your mistakes, and soon you will be an expert policymaker!\" Heh, they aren't kidding, especially about the slow and mistakes parts. But where to begin? How to PLAY? (As I watched the \"days\" and \"weeks\" click by, I kept thinking about my other games . . . )\r\n\r\nLook, I know what the responses to this would be if this was a forum post:  \"Just play the game\", \"Watch YouTube videos\", and/or \"Read the wiki\". One can learn much on one's own in a new game, sure, but I prefer at least some guidance. And sitting for hours watching somebody else play the game, complete with the annoying circular mouse movements as they speak, is not my idea of fun. I often refer to wikis for details and tips, but not for reading them from start to finish in order to learn how to play the game.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that the developers made this game so complicated, and utterly fell down with the tutorial, I cannot recommend it to anybody else for whom these aspects would be important. It [i]is[/i] just me . . . just my opinion . . . but the double-whammy of a very complicated game with a laissez-faire \"learn it on your own\" attitude means it's a thumb-down from me.",

Austria's entire economy goes into an irrecoverable tailspin, because its Ai is incapable of understanding what has happened to it or what to do about it. Dead Balkans for the rest of the game.\r\n\r\nGiant death war between Great Britain and France. Great Britain has complete naval dominance, and all of France's overseas territories get occupied. Great Britain fails to accomplish any of its colonial ambitions in the war because it added 'Liberate Occitania' as a war goal, and any war between great powers can only result in a white peace or total capitulation. White peace. Nothing happens. Boring.\r\n\r\nI was hoping these were just hiccups that would be ironed out with additional dev time, but it took them two years to add a global market, something from base Victoria 2, back to the game, and I have had an epiphany. They won't fix it; It isn't a problem. They are interested in drip feeding the playerbase regional touch ups for the next X years, and we will get country specific flavor packs instead of giving the AI a basic ability to realize when its head has been chopped off, or a war system that can accomplish a single blessed thing. \r\n\r\nWhatever.",

Yet the most blaring short comings of this game is the way it handles combat.\n\nThere are still so many game breaking bugs with units getting exiled and stranded permanently after fronts close, pathing that makes you exile your units and lose organization when a clear path is available.  The horrible selection of which general to command individual battles,  I'll have amazing Generals with great bonus's on the front, but it always seems to pick a substandard general for the given situation for you, while the opposition ai always seems to have their best general command.     it will hold your troops up on an uncontested or lowly contested front until the enemy has managed to maneuver around you.  Close fronts you are fighting on sending your troops back to an HQ then opening it back up for the ai to take unchallenged.\n\nI love this game and have played the heck out of  it, and will keep playing it, but until they overhaul combat I do not recommend it.

I don't know why i bought it.\n\nYour economy literally collapses on itself after you construct one building and being an underdog is literally hell since unlike eu4/hoi4/stellaris/ck3/ck2/vic2/sengoku/any pdx game ever, where you move troops with right click, in vic3 you set a frontline but it's not like the hoi4 frontline with units and all, it's just pure numbers, pure excel sheets. I want to love this game. I expected much from vic3. I got dissapointed. Battles are nonsensical and stupid and being a small country means nothing, there's no army proffesionalism, and i think this game will just be abandoned just like imperator. but imperator is actually good, this is garbage. Bad game.\n\n\nEDIT: I played some more and it's not as bad as i said, but it's still bad. Still weird that el salvador doesnt have firearms but vietnam does. I edited the \"horrible\" to \"bad\" in the first paragraph because it's definately better once you learn. But it definately lacks compared to other pdx titles. It's a great economy simulator and all but it needs polishing.\nAlso please fix rebellions, i had CSA rise up against me in texas, alabama and florida (i was mexico occupying them all) and after defeating CSA got back only alabama idk why.\n\nAlso the borders DO move later into the game, but mostly only in germany where either prussia steamrolls everything or prussia gets a socialist revolt and gets exiled to silesia and then dies to rebel poland. Literally germany is a wasteland in my current campaign because prussia, socialst ruhr and poland went back and forth pillaging eachother.\n\nI rate this game 5.5/10 paradox please polish military!!!!!!!!!!!",

Each system appeared as a puzzle, and I had those fleeting sparks.. the lightbulb moments where comprehension met application. For a while, I mistook novelty for depth.\r\n\r\nBut once the curtain dropped and the mechanics were stripped bare, the truth was exposed: the entire loop is nothing but endless construction chains. Build, expand, repeat. Money is just scaffolding for more construction. The economy is shallow, industries are shallow, arable land mechanics are hollow, subsistence farms meaningless placeholders. And the military... its absence is itself the design. What exists is not a system but a void.\r\n\r\nThe betrayal sharpened when I returned to Victoria 2. Suddenly, I remembered what engagement felt like. Resource Gathering Operations tied nations to land and geography. The military was not an abstraction but an organism you managed and commanded. Crises carried tension, reforms unfolded as a historical arc instead of a menu where you pick the “best law” at game start and coast for the next century. Victoria 2 had escalation: the Great Wars, the Berlin Conference, the gradual climb of reforms. Victoria 3 amputated that spirit and left behind a sterile shell.\r\n\r\nHundreds of hours taught me this: Victoria 3 is not the heir to its predecessor. It is a dismembered echo.

      "review": "Victoria 3 is a game about building infrastructure and industry to grow your economy so that you can afford to build more infrastructure and industry to grow your economy better and faster. And reading that, I'm sure some of you think that sounds great. There's nothing inherently wrong with that gameplay loop, after all. The problem, as with most of the rest of the problems of this game, is Victoria 3's startlingly poor execution.\n\nGrand Strategy titles are at their best when the systems which underpin them are seamlessly integrated into one another, and there are multiple objectives you can pursue not just at any given time, but over the course of a full game. In the context of a Victoria title, two examples might be warmongering expansionist state or a peaceful, industrializing power.\n\nReturning to the topic of integrated mechanics, let's borrow an example from Victoria 2. In Victoria 2, your taxation percentage is determined by technology, which you gain based on a research-points-per-day calculation based upon a combination of your demographics and your population's literacy. You can then use those taxes to, say, build a dock; that dock gives you an increase to your colonial range and a flat increase to your maximum colonial points, representing the amount of colonial lands you can control without penalty. These systems are all in conversation with one another, and give the player meaningful choices and considerations about how they want to proceed. If you want to become a colonial power, what do you do? Do you focus on literacy first to research more quickly, or do you instead rush straight for naval technologies to try to get better ports and ships quickly to extend your colonial range? If you do, will you have sufficient capital to fund the great cost of an industrial navy if you don't industrialize first? Might industrializing first even be the best call, since it can both provide you with the money you need to support your navy AND the demographic shifts that will improve your research? People who have played Victoria 2 will know I'm trivializing the calculus more than a little here just for example's sake, but I hope my point is clear: no matter what your objectives in such a game, there's a great deal of consideration behind how you proceed, not just moment-to-moment but also in terms of your overall, game-long strategic objectives. And it's important to note, of course, that the AI isn't just going to stand there and do what you want, either - you have to be prepared to defend your interests.\n\nVictoria 3, to its credit, does have some mechanical interconnectivity. But it's little enough. Most of the systems in the game, by comparison to its predecessor Victoria 2 and contemporary Europa Universalis 5, are disjointed, ill-conceived, and even trivialized. Your government can pass any law so long as you're willing to bash your head against it long enough, regardless of what party is in power and what they actually support - you do not need to guide your state in a particular direction to achieve your ends. Even if an enemy threatens you with war, you can just surrender without significant popular consequence (in a game set during the most politically unstable century marked by revolutions, by the way) - being caught unprepared for a war is rarely catastrophic, and even if it is the war itself, and the consequent devastation, can be avoided entirely. There are no significant consequences to global industrialization across all territories - as long as you have the population to support it, you can just farm raw materials and make finished goods everywhere, with no significant differentiation between urban and rural centers. These are just examples, and only a few, but I think they illustrate my point; the lack of any real limits on what the player can do (no matter how realistic those would be), coupled with mechanical fluidity, means that there's not only no ability to plan a clear objective for a run, but also no need to. Just do everything. Unless you're playing as a tiny and under-populated location, you can have it all: get all the laws you want, all the industry you want, all the tech you want, all the power you want. There's no real system in the game which is sufficiently integrated into other systems to stop you - so as long as you have the POPs, well... just do everything.\n\nThere's no challenge. And I realize that phrasing it that way might sound off-putting, but I mean it in a sense of the game's design rather than a subjective impression. The core gameplay loop of this game is supposed to be industrialization, and there is barely anything in the entire game that could ever stop you from doing that. The absolute worst the game can throw at you is bankruptcy, and you would have to do some truly unbelievable mismanagement to ever reach that point. Everything else, unless you're a single-province territory who can't surrender if threatened without getting a game-over, is easily survivable. And, more than survivable, it's easily recoverable: just take your knocks now and come back and beat them later, when you've done everything you want and have become an unstoppable juggernaut. Because there are no real restrictions or failure-states, there's no catastrophe if you fall to a rebellion, or don't get a law you want, or lose a war. Because that's the way this game was designed: that the player can do whatever they want, reach whatever end they want, no matter the circumstances.\n\nI hesitate to use words such as \"soulless\" in reviews because I think that describing a game as such isn't helpful; it doesn't explain anything useful, and is at best a kneejerk and subjective reaction to distaste. But I think in the case of Victoria 3 I can articulate my displeasure sufficiently well to explain why I feel this game truly is soulless: they are selling a power fantasy to the player, one where virtually every system is a vapid puppet-show designed to distract from the emptiness of the simulation. From the warfare system that the player has almost no control over (you neither control armies nor give them more than vague objectives; everything is automated); to the political parties and laws that are up for debate which are almost entirely random; to the technology system which has few options and limited ability to gameplan; to the colonial game which is nothing more than a way for the player to get more territory to build more stuff in. There is almost nothing in this game which presents any actual, serious challenge. Everything that exists does so to facilitates the player getting more places on a map that allow them to click a button. That button expands an industry, so you can get a bit more money, so you can expand another industry. That is this game. And this game has little more engagement than a visual novel - and trust me, a much worse story.\n\nIf you want a game that does Victoria 3's premise the way it should have been done, I strongly urge you to look into Europa Universalis 5 instead. It's a true masterpiece of the genre that I can't recommend enough, and treats its players seriously. This game does not.",

Then there's the lunacy of how the population and employment works in various states / provinces. The build interface says you'll make \"X\" amount of money while in reality, if there's not enough people to be employed, then you won't make as much money. Then that employment will mean that other employers will loose employees, causing problems. Next is where you spend political points (or whatever it's called) on improving the conditions in those states. For example, lets say you want to to a \"greener grass campaign.\" Now a rational interface would let you know which state needs the most migration vs states that need less. Nope, you just have to figure out which ones need it and then go to the interface. Then there's the continues notification vomit that occurs in the lower right hand corner of what's going on in the rest of the world. If it doesn't apply to me, why should I care. More importantly, how can I easily turn it off! Then there's the production queue interface that's terrible. Let's say you input a two dozen things you want to build and then events require you to add two more. You have to click on the \"up\" arrow to move it from page 3 to page 2 and into page 1. My expectations is a simple way to move the critical item to the top of the list! Then there's the hopeless quests that make ZERO sense. USA. I'm given Africa quests to build a over seas empire in Africa, but everything along the coast has been colonized already. How am I supposed to get a toehold? There's also the buggy \"auto build\" feature. I clicked on it once for Government and it added dozens of buildings when I only needed a few to boost the Administration capacity to say above zero!
