The enemies and difficulty increases provide for a good but fair challenge across tiers. Weapons and artifacts cover a wide variety of powers. \r\n\r\nAlso amazing and quick updates and response from the devs. Above all else, the devs working within the community to take feedback and help mold this game for the future is a great reason to purchase and play it. \r\n\r\nThe game is still a WIP and I HIGHLY Recommend it, a few things I would like to see:\r\n\r\n- Better and deeper synergies between items and effects. There is so much potential here. Right now it's mostly just stat stacking to create power (which is effective), but the systems here could be one layer deeper and provide for an endless number of builds and combinations. \r\n\r\n- Dig deeper into the town building / restoration aspect. Also so much potential here... As we traverse dungeons there could be collectible resources (stone , wood, etc) that we can bring back to the main town / hub to rebuild different buildings in tiers that help improve different aspects of our characters. \r\n     - These resources could help rebuild the blacksmith that lets us upgrade base weapon stats\r\n     - Restore the magic shop to different tiers to upgrade or even fuse spells for new items \r\n     - Restore the trading outpost that brings in new items (similar to pocket dimension / subspace  but more items) \r\n      - Make better use of the player owned housing to help buff base stats or items you can start a run with ( think like buffs to the mirror and fountain, upgraded tiers allow for a new skill in the mirror or increased pegs in the fountain which allow you start with even more items) \r\n\r\n- Massive expansion to the skill \"tree\" \r\n\r\nLove this game.

When in a multiplayer game much of the time can be spent optimizing and that adds at least 20 minutes to a run. If you like inventory management roguelikes I'm sure this would feel better to you but not to me personally. It is still a good game and I can't wait to see what changes in Chapter 3 onward.",

(it also encourages you to actually play more, rather than just listening to a bunch of dialogue over and over, which i enjoy) and the progression is really nice too! i dont think i would have anything negative to say about it ^^",
