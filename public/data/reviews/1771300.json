When my weapon of choice got to lvl 20 I was basically destroying everyone and it goes up to 30(which makes you even stronger) if that wasn't enough you can poison your weapons and HK everything in the game, I think this was due to Henry being already an experienced fighter from the first game, but the late game felt a lot easier than KCD1, in another hand due to combos bring easier, there was more diversity in combat moveset animations, so it didn't felt as repetitive as the first game. \n\nOverall, gonna buy the complete version with dlcs in the near future owo.",

You can feel it from the very first scene, in the presentation of every aspect of the game, and simply by playing it. There’s so much Kingdom Come 2 does to immerse you in its world and make it feel truly authentic. Every part of the experience works together toward that goal, and it’s honestly amazing. If you’ve played the first game, this is essentially the same foundation but every single aspect has been improved. And that’s seriously impressive. I can’t remember the last time I said that about a sequel. You can tell this is a game built with care and attention to detail. The presentation, the writing, the way the world breathes and reacts to your choices it all feels handcrafted. It is however not for everyone it is extremely niche, the slower pace that might not appeal to everyone. Especially certain aspects such as the mini games or passing skill checks with systems that don't always explain themselves the best, also it embraces old school design which will frustrate everyone including someone who enjoys old school design, like myself. It's got the Shenmue effect where you actually have to do a laborious job in game which becomes tedious fast.  I truly loved the first entry and now i'm falling in love with the sequel, truly an amazing experience and would love to see more unique experiences like this in different time periods in history.

      "review": "💬For the past few days/weeks, I've been completely immersed in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, and the game has captivated me in almost every aspect.\n\n🎮The storyline unfolds somewhat later from the climax of the original story. Henry as well as Jan Ptacek are trying to communicate a vital message regarding the insurrection against King Sigismund, but a robbery of their property leads them to the Trosky Castle's fortifications without any gear or official papers.\n\nThe narrative develops through three parts: Trosky, Kutná Hora, and the end. The tale is rich in tension, treason, and sensational scenes - the whole spectrum from the saving of Ptacek to the stunning conclusion with the coming of the allied army. The account is made in a way that follows a logical sequence and is easy to comprehend even if one is not very familiar with the political situation of the medieval times.\n\nThe siege of the fortress is definitely striking, especially when there isn't much hope left and the supplies are close to being exhausted. It does not exclude anyone, the audience has to sympathize with the characters for they are in the same situation as the characters have to go through their hardships. \nThe whole storyline could be compared to the movies of Guy Ritchie. A bunch of robbers with a good heart comes up with the most extravagant schemes, but everything ends in chaos!\n\nThe main combat system has undergone minor changes in its design. Moreover, it has been enriched with the addition of new weapons such as polearms, crossbows, broadswords, and boomsticks (squeakers). Henceforth, combat has been more dynamic - leg strikes have been changed to abdomen thrusts, and counterattacks demand higher skill levels. The interaction of the enemies is more natural and the impact of damage is quite apparent. To summarize, the whole combat experience is more dynamic compared to the one in the first game.\n\nThe new features consist of weapon forging, the option to walk through bushes, and various random encounters along the way - from unfortunate bandits to a frightening meeting with the \"Death.\"\n\nThe world's response to your actions is, in fact, the most remarkable part. Support a needy person - he could come back to you later with a good deed. Misbehave with a trader of great importance - expect to be charged extra or to lose completely your access to scarce items. Your adventures are talked about everywhere, and the quest choices (even insignificant ones) can surprise you with their consequences at the most unanticipated times. I helped some refugees to get rid of the bandits once, and then they took part in the defense of a castle - such events are just too intriguing for me.\n\nThe ending and the fate of certain characters hinge on past choices even in situations that initially seemed to be of little importance. This gives the impression of a genuinely vibrant world, not merely a list of missions.\n\nAlthough the graphics are not significantly different from those in previous versions, the Czech scenery still looks great. The atmosphere is especially created by the towns and fortresses. The music is right on spot with the plot, and the optimization is really great - the game works without a hitch even on average computers. One curious thing is the different menu splash screen that changes according to your level of play. \nAdditionally, the technical side has almost no problems, thus being considered almost perfect.\n\n👍Positive.\n- Immersive, historically grounded world\n- Deep, skill-based combat\n- Rich narrative & meaningful choices\n- Huge open world with lots of content\n\n👎Negative.\n- Learning curve\n- Combat can feel inconsistent\n- UI or menu navigation may be clunky\n- Some minigames or mechanics feel fiddly\n\n🧾Summary. \nKingdom Come Deliverance 2 is a one-of-a-kind RPG that features not just profound gameplay but also an absorbing narrative. Here everything is of the highest quality: an interesting storyline, thoroughly designed characters, enticing adventures, and a lively universe.\n🎯9/10\n💬The game really is a delight to play; the developers' commitment is evident in every aspect. I would not be shocked if it gets the title of Game of the Year - it is really worthy. Naturally, there will be some that will not appreciate the medieval setting or the RPG style, and for total immersion, it's recommended to start with the first part. However, if you are in doubt about its worth, the response is a loud Yes!!, without a doubt!",

      "review": "🧠My gaming experience with this marvelous game has come to an end at last... \nThe year 2021 was when I played the first part of the game and I have no regrets about it. \nI consider the first Kingdom Come: Deliverance to be an undervalued game, a sort of \"rough diamond,\" having a great amount of and featuring that were not completely polished. \nAnd now, after several years, the saga of Henry from Skalitz is finally revealed anew.\n\nThe events unfold immediately after the ending of the first part of the game. the main character and Jan Ptacek are assigned to a crucial communication and unintentionally get in the middle of a situation with perilous escapades, power plays, and ethical decisions all around them.\nThe storyline is just like a river that flows continuously, and it is almost impossible to detach oneself from the game.\n\nThe storyline has turned out to be very good overall, with the interactions being more detailed, the missions being diverse, and the characters having more growth. The environment of the game is absolutely incredible, and it is a perfect representation of the mood of medieval Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe sound quality in the game is first-class; the sound of the water flowing, the crakling of the fire, and other natural sounds are totally immersive. Besides, the game keeps up with a musical standard of the highest level; the score is nothing but wonderful, you can't help but want to indulge in it right away!\nThe graphical output of the game is magnificent; everything is alive and painting and pleasing to the eye. The world's getting around is an absolute delight, and so is the soaking up of its loveliness. \nAmazement comes with the world's detail and size; the game is mapped out quite extensively with a lot of missions and a wide array of activities. \nThe game not only has a good stock of amusing humorous quests but also lots of other engaging tasks that will not let you go bored. To put it in a nutshell, the world of Deliverance 2 is rich with various adventures that you will not want to miss.\nThe world's detail is remarkable as well; every NPC has a story to tell, and during the night characters go to sleep, close their stores and houses, etc. The combat system has been transferred from the first game; however, it is a simplified version of the original.\n\nThere are quite a few technical details involved, but in a very broad sense, all is well and I believe that the different flaws will be improved gradually. \nThe game's optimization has been conscientious, for which I'd like to express my thanks to the developers.\n\n✅The Good.\n- Realistic systems & survival mechanics\n- Players have freedom to specialize (soldier, thief, blacksmith, etc).\n- Rewarding progression\n- Great audiovisual presentation\n\n❌The Bad.\n- Not everyone will enjoy the high-realism style\n- Armor/combat impact sometimes less obvious\n- Some characters voice acting is uneven\n- Seems like female characters got less development\n\n🧾In conclusion. \nI can say that Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is therefore a game that is almost a masterpiece and definitely a strong contender for the title of Game of the Year. \nHowever, I would definitely recommend playing through the first game’s story before jumping into the second for a more profound immersion in the total story and a better acquaintance with the characters. \n9/10🔚",

This Game has been met with overwhelmingly positive critical receptions, with many reviewers hailing it as a masterpiece and an early contender for 2025's Game Of The Year due to its deep immersion, historical authenticity and significant improvements over its predecessor. There were minor bugs and glitches on its early release but all were addressed and resolved accordingly, To make the review shorter here are the lists of \"Key Themes\" that I like about this game.\n\n* Immersive & Authentic World -(stunning, realistic recreation of 15th century Bohemia.)\n* Engaging Story & Quest - (Wholly absorbing narrative which is described as grand, cinematic epic with strong relatable characters.)\n*Improved Combat System - (a little better than the first but please be aware when you start-off  you feel like your hopeless like a whelp since you'll lose majority of Fights and Duels, so working your ass-off for days to improve the character's skill will take a major role early on.)\n*Technical Success on PC -( It is noted that this game is remarkably well-optimized on PC but nevertheless runs okay in Steam Deck.)\n* Deep RPG Mechanics -( other might find it boring due to a slow, methodical progression system based on \"learning by doing,\" yet rewarding as you progress. that's why most of avid fan Players are engaged deeply with its complex systems of skill-building, crafting and survival elements.\n\nOverall Verdict:\n\nKCD2 - is a Perfect sequel of KCD 1, expanding on the best parts of the original while addressing many of its flaws. This game is a breakthrough which is a monumental achievement in the Historical Genre, offering deep and incredibly accurate Historical components based in historical events which is immersive for players who are willing to engage with its Demanding, realistic systems.\n\nRating: 5/5 Perfect star and my Nominee for 2025 Game of The Year",

The sequel definitely delivered, expanding on the story from the first while simultaneously adding new interesting storylines. \n\nPersonally wish they moved on from directional/locked combat system because I feel like it holds the game back. The removal of one of the attack directions also didn't help, all it did is limit options for combos just for the sake of simplifying combat. My only other gripe with the game is that some fetch quests can get monotonous. Though not as monotonous as some of the quests from KCD 1 (monastery quest, if you know you know). \n\nAside from that, favorite addition to the game has to be blacksmithing. Being able to craft and upgrade your weapons feels so rewarding. Not to mention how weirdly calming it is rhythmically hammering away while Henry starts to whistle. \n\nThe storyline is accompanied with stunning visuals, great voice acting and fun quests/side activities. All of this while being highly polished and optimized. I ran into no bugs or performance issues when playing this game on release. Which is very impressive nowadays considering a majority of newer titles either run poorly, have a multitude of bugs/issues or both.\n\nDefinitely recommend this game to anyone looking to scratch that medieval fantasy RPG itch.

I’ve spent around twelve hours in, and I have absolutely no interest in discovering what happens to Henry.\n\nThat said, I must admit that the introduction and the way the prologue was developed truly fascinated me. I adored the alchemy crafting system, and despite being rather terrible at it, I even enjoyed the blacksmithing mechanics.\n\nStill, I just can’t make myself like the game. It’s promoted as a realistic experience where NPCs supposedly remember your face, your crimes, and even respond differently when asked the same question — yet, in my opinion, these are merely superficial features. The game’s AI feels no more advanced than Skyrim’s: everyone behaves foolishly and can be easily outsmarted.\n\nI can’t deny, though, that the game is well-made. The combat is excellent, but the quests all feel repetitive and require too much effort to complete. Perhaps if I were invested in the story, I might enjoy it more — but as it stands, I simply don’t care. And if I already have no interest, I see no point in forcing myself to puzzle out how to progress in a game that doesn’t engage me. I’m generally against games that hold your hand with constant markers, but this one takes the opposite extreme.\n\nIn conclusion, it is a good game — compared to most, it’s outstanding — but when set beside true masterpieces, it ultimately falls short.\n\n8/10",

The map is massive (and there seem to be at least a second, equally if not larger map to explore with incredible depth and tons of nooks and crannies to get lost in), the immersive gameplay from the ringing of swords in combat to the process of forging new weapons at a blacksmith or crafting high end potions (all of which is incredibly satisfying to get good at) to even just getting yelled at by a guard for not carrying a lit torch at night is so unique and just such a breath of fresh air in an RPG and an open world game. To say nothing of the incredible story being told, amazing characters, wonderful voice work, reactive dialog to things you have said and done, seemingly half a dozen ways to resolve any given side quest... I can't believe more people aren't talking about this, and I'm angry I missed it when it came out earlier this year, but happy as hell to have it now to play!",

You can scale the settings for both high end and low end systems and the game will run well and look decent.\r\n\r\nHere's hoping the devs either make another historical medieval fiction game or maybe a full on high fantasy open world game.

      "review": "[h1]AUDENTES FORTUNA IUVAT[/h1]\n\nEasily the GAME OF THE YEAR of 2025. This game is so amazing that it left me quite speechless. The realism of this game is something to admire and kind of understand it if you play the game for a long time. The realism is on a next level, I, personally have never seen this type of realism in a video game. You get hungry, the food in your inventory gets rotten, it gets expired and may poison you which will take away your health and might even kill you, you get slower and hungover if you don’t take proper sleep. That’s not even half of the things that can happen in the game if you’re not careful enough. Characters remember you vaguely and very clearly, whether you helped them or betrayed them. The fast travel in this game is good but does have its own consequences, because while you fast travel, many events happen and you have to option to either participate in the event OR flee, and of course each option has their own consequences. The characters have so much detail and story of their own which makes the game feel very alive, each with their own expressions and their behavior towards the main character if anything happens, either good or bad. The combat in this game is just straight up brutal if you’re not careful enough or if you’re not very good at it, it can get really bad sometimes. The saving method in this game is just frustrating as to save, we need savior schnapps which we will use to save our game, we can also save by sleeping or just save & quit which exits the entire game. The dialogues are great and amazingly handled by the player by their own choice. The story on the other hand, is full of comedy and perfect mix of betrayal, emotion, and laughter. Besides these, the graphics are just chefs kiss, they look straight out of the world. The mechanics and controls are good, not bad either. The setting and theme for this game is amazing, the historical accuracy just surprises me the most. Amazing game, 2025’s Game of the Year,\nOverall Rating –⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️☆ (9/10)",

His journey from the ashes of Skalitz, starting from absolutely nothing, slowly learning, growing, failing, improving… it hit me in a way games rarely do. Every small victory feels earned. Every bruise, every lesson, every new skill feels like a part of my own story.\n\nThe world feels unbelievably authentic — not because of flashy effects, but because everything you do has weight. Sleeping, training, learning to read, swinging a sword, riding your horse… everything carries a sense of realism and reward that makes you feel deeply connected to Henry’s life.\n\nThere were moments I completely forgot I was “playing a game.”\nIt became my second life.\n\nThis isn’t just a game you play.\nThis is a life you live.",

Clear attention to detail.\n- Superb art style throughout the game, as well as its UI elements.\n- Autosave features are of help in some instances.\n- Appropriate OST that's in tune with the setting and the lore of the game. \n- Documentation provided, as well as player statistics. Much appreciated!\n- Historical references to real-world places, people and events.\n- Satisfying conclusions to long-winded side-quests which may/may not tie into the main questline. \n- Various cultures represented, though quasi-idealistically and with a somewhat modern interpretation.\n- Non-violent/Pacifist method for enemy takedowns.\n- Wabbits are fast. Accurate, both historically and presently. \n- Body decomposition present for previously hunted forest animals.\n- Average load time (47 seconds) from desktop shortcut to in-game start.\n- Not a single crash to desktop throughout my playtime.\n- Cats and mice/rats have been added to the game. This is compared to KCD1, where no cats were ever present. \n\n[b] Cons [/b]\n- Combat system still takes some getting used to. There are ways around this with poison arrows but in the beginning it's rough. \n- Auto-brewing alchemical potions is not allowed in this game, compared to KCD1. A shame, considering the complexity of some recipes. \n- No quicksave feature or manual save unless you use saviour schnapps. No difficulty scaling feature to remove this in the options, either. \n- Limited inventory space for hoarding enthusiasts.\n- Facial animations are done well but sometimes the eyes wander aimlessly towards the end of the conversation. \n- Regular voice lines and story lines have different voice actors for some NPCs. Mainly affects miscellaneous quests.\n- No option to skip long story-related horse rides.\n\n[b] Bugs [/b]\n- Rabbits going/running backwards. Amusing but immersion breaking.\n- Very rarely rocks can be seen slightly levitating above the ground.\n- KCD1 had a bug where adding a stolen item over normal items of the same type made them all appear stolen. This has been solved here.\n- When numbers change in the UI, Nvidia's DLSS lags behind a bit.\n- Instead of sitting on a bench, some NPCs prefer to magically levitate above the table (rare).\n- Rarely boars run as if on a treadmill when attempting to flee uphill. \n\n[b] Suggestions [/b]\n- More story expansions and improvements to existing DLCs, as well as game mechanics. \n- Major expansion/overhaul to crafting skills where more historical items are added that can be made, sold and used in the environment/settlement/home. Pottery, brewery, weaving, enhanced cooking, beekeeping, mining, etc. Also falconry, like the houndmaster skill line.\n- Increase in the variety of plants/insects/birds/animals both local and exotic. \n- Events, festivals, guilds, secret societies, enhanced pilgrimages and music instruments, as well as skill lines for them. \n- A Winter/Autumn based area in which a side story takes place.\n- Thunderstorms should present danger even if environmental. Hail, gale, morning dew, heatwaves during peak hours and floods could also be added or hinted at.\n- Nighttime overhaul, astronomy and related perks after certain books are read and a certain scholarship level is attained. \n- Medieval dentistry RPG mechanics for tooth loss after fights, potions for bad breath after certain/spoiled foods, etc. \n- Survival mode refinements; adding illnesses both current and historical for immersion purposes.\n- Speedrun refinements and special optional challenges associated with that. \n- Permadeath mode and a separate one hit kill mode.\n- God mode for players who wish to experience the story without any fuss. \n- Monk mode. No meat, no fighting unless attacked, no crossbows or guns, no poisons, etc. \n- More platforming sections like \"Devil's Finger\" with misc lore books or rewards.\n- Lastly, I triple dare you to add a native Linux build and support for X86, ARM and RISC-V architectures down the line.

The OST hits a level of atmosphere most games don’t touch- quiet village strings, tense combat drums, and those wandering themes that sell the countryside better than any graphics upgrade. Also, a little thing I really liked is that the soundtrack is looping when you reload a save or go in the menu, a nice little detail that adds to the immersiveness.\n\nHenry’s evolution is noticeably sharper this time: less clueless, more grounded, and with a believable arc that builds on the first game without turning him into a superhero.\nThe sword relationship is handled (hehe) extremely well. You feel the weight of technique, history, and training every time Henry draws it. It’s not “click to win”, it’s timing, footwork, and intent, and it makes even simple duels satisfying and realistic.\n\nCities feel alive and layered. Not just larger, but better designed, with social strata you actually notice as you move through them. Armor variety is deeper, visually cleaner, and the way it dirties, breaks, or reflects light gives it a functional, lived-in quality.\n\nGameplay is smoother on all fronts, but still grounded, no arcade shortcuts, just refined realism.

Smithing is finally in and it's a wonderful little mini-game, made even richer with the Legacy of the Forge DLC. Which brings me to DLCs - all of them have a different tone to them but each is a really memorable ride. With the final DLC just taking the crown for me as the best one with its thick atmosphere and perfect utilization of Jan Valta's wonderful music.\r\n\r\nThis is a game that I will definitely revisit at least once more, a testament to the incredible care the devs put into this title.",

I'd say it's both easier and harder than in KCD1 - the game is still autosaved during important parts of quests, but the early game (Trosky region) can be a bit more challenging because of the negative perks\n\n---{ Grind }---\n☐ Nothing to grind\n☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n☑ Required for achievement hunting\n☑ Isn't necessary to progress\n☐ Average grind level\n☐ Too much grind\n☐ You'll need a second live for grinding\n+ no grind except for achievements, hardcore mode or if you just want to level up different stats\n+ leveling up stats (getting new perks or learning new fighting techniques) isn't really necessary to progress the main quest, but it'll definitely make it feel a bit easier \n\n---{ Story }---\n☐ No Story\n☐ Some lore\n☐ Bizarre\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☑ Lovely\n☐ It'll replace your life\n+ combining with the first game (which you don't have to play but will get better experience if you do), the story is just great\n+ personally loved all the major characters (especially the Dry Devil's band, which reminded me of the Band of Bastards from the first game)\n+ personal preference - always liked playing games that are based on or inspired by specific events or characters\n* some later quests will actually make you question what's morally better choice, which I think is interesting\n* I also like that in the intro section, it's explained why and how Henry lost most of his stats, which most game series don't do (for example Devil May Cry, The Witcher, Final Fantasy 13 trilogy or similar)\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee\n☐ Short\n☐ Average\n☑ Long\n☑ To infinity and beyond\n+ my playthrough (normal mode, all quests, all 3 DLCs) took me a bit over 100 hours\n\n---{ Price }---\n☐ It's free!\n☑ Worth the price\n☑ If it's on sale\n☐ If u have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☐ You could also just burn your money\n+ the content you get for 60€ is more than reasonable, but you can get it on sale from time to time too already\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n☐ Never heard of\n☑ Minor bugs\n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ ARK: Survival Evolved\n☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n☐ Hollow Knight\n+ never experienced any bugs in my playthrough (other than the one below)\n- there's currently a bug that prevents one of The Legacy of the Forge DLC tasks from starting (after the Mysteria Ecclesiae DLC update)\n\n---{ 9.9 / 10 }---\n☐ 1\n☐ 2\n☐ 3\n☐ 4\n☐ 5\n☐ 6\n☐ 7\n☐ 8\n☐ 9\n☑ 9.9\n☐ 10\n\nI don't think there will ever be a game that'll be an actual 10/10 for me nor for everyone else, but I think this is probably the closest game to a perfect RPG.

      "review": "I have spent over 200 hours playing this game. My only regret, is that I did not have more free time this year to pour into this masterpiece of a game.\n\nI played the first game when it first released in Feb. 2018, and instantly fell in love with it. It became my favorite game very quickly, even with its flaws. There was just nothing else quite like it at that time. The closest you could get to a realistic/historical Medieval RPG was M&B Warband for the longest time (and I do love Warband). KCD1 will forever be one of my favorite games.\n\nThen, after 7 years of (im)patiently waiting, KCD2 finally released earlier this year. To say that it did not disappoint would be a grave understatement. It took my expectations following the masterpiece that was the first game, and left them groveling in awe at the incomprehensible majesty of this new game. If KCD1 was a Warhorse masterpiece, than KCD2 is most certainly Warhorse's Magnum Opus.\n\nI could make a very long and in-depth review, as I did for KCD1 years ago, but I will refrain. Nothing I could type here today would truly be able to convey how remarkable this game is. Just play it for yourself if you get the chance, especially if you love Medieval history. You won't regret it. Or maybe you will, but most of the hatred I have seen for this game, originates with people who don't agree with certain aspects of the game's direction. If you don't want to have Henry (the protagonist) romance other men, then don't have him do that. It's not mandatory or obligatory.\n\nI have already voted/nominated KCD2 for GOTY 2025. Will this game win? I don't expect it to. The fan-base, while larger than it once was, is still quite niche. Especially in comparison to other titles. Nevertheless, win or lose, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is my game of the year.",

      "review": "Kingdom Come II has been an amazing surprise for me. From the moment I started playing, it became clear that this game is extremely fun, ridiculously immersive, and probably the best RPG I’ve played this year. It’s the kind of game where even the smallest interactions feel meaningful, talking to NPCs, preparing for combat, managing your equipment, exploring villages and forests… everything feels handcrafted to pull you into that medieval world.\r\n\r\nAnd that’s honestly what impressed me the most: the immersion. Nothing feels “gamey” or overly simplified. Instead, every system (combat, survival, traveling, reputation) works together to make the world feel alive and believable. When you’re walking through a town or riding through the countryside, it hits you how much detail was put into making this world feel real.\r\n\r\nI’m not really the type of person who spends a ton of time on long, story-heavy games. I usually jump between different games pretty fast. So I don’t know if I’ll actually manage to finish Kingdom Come II, but that doesn’t take anything away from how good it is. Even if I end up taking forever to beat it (or never finish at all lol), the experience I’ve had so far has been absolutely worth it.\r\n\r\nFor anyone who enjoys medieval settings, realism, and games that don’t treat the player like they need constant guidance, this is a huge recommendation. The world reacts to you, progression feels earned, and the gameplay has weight to it. It’s refreshing in a market where most RPGs go for flashy magic and fast combat, Kingdom Come II stays grounded, and that’s exactly what makes it so special.\r\n\r\nWhether you stick around for the long haul or just jump in for the immersive experience, this game delivers. For me, it’s easily one of the standout RPGs of the year.",

The combat system, the meaningful consequences of your actions, the freedom in how you approach quests — everything feels fresh. In a world full of games that play the same, this one dares to be unique while still being incredibly engaging.\n\nReason #2 – Atmosphere and storytelling\n\nThe game captures medieval Czechia with impressive authenticity. There’s no need for zombies or other fantasy gimmicks — it’s pure, grounded, and immersive. The open world is massive, beautifully crafted, and truly alive. Unlike many modern open-world games where NPCs feel awkward or artificial, here they feel real. You can spend time doing everyday tasks or jump straight into grand adventures, and both feel natural. NPC stories, quest mysteries, and worldbuilding are simply brilliant.\n\nReason #3 – Czechia and its rich history\n\nThis one is personal. As a Czech player, I’m incredibly proud of Warhorse Studios for bringing our history, landscapes, and landmarks to life for the world to experience. Our country has so much to offer historically, and seeing it portrayed in such a modern, engaging form means a lot.\n\nFor me, this absolutely deserves GOTY.",

Because if you did, you're rather fucked!\nThe speech-based option seems infinitely more viable given that combat is often avoidable anyway, and unlike other games where avoiding it is a choice you make; here the combat itself is so awful and clunky that it may as well be forcing you to avoid it. No wonder they added a dlc to give you high-end equipment early-on. You need it.\nEven for a one-on-one you will struggle to block everything due to how finicky perfect-blocks are, despite the enemy rather often riposte-ing you.\nAnything other than a one-on-one is basically impossible, as the game really wants to drive home how \"only human\" Henry is by making him extremely weak for how strong and effective he should be after the events of the previous game and the intervening time.\n\nAnd you might stop and thing \"well yes, that makes sense that it's hard to fight multiple people at once.\"\nAnd you would be right.\nIf the game wasn't a sequel to another game where it's well established that your character is a capable fighter, even if you don't choose to have Henry be a career soldier; and yet this game expects it to be plausible that you can be dispatched and overwhelmed with ease by mediocre bandits with wood axes and peasants while you, a trained knight and bodyguard who has fought through hell just to survive, watch in dismay as yet another button input is delayed and your should-have-been perfect block leads to you being stun-locked to death yet again.\n\nAnd then there's the stamina.\nNow, I'm no trained knight or even in peak fitness; but I don't get lightheaded and woozy from swinging a sword five times. The stamina mechanic is just ridiculous, especially as Henry [i]is[/i] a trained knight and therefore likely [i]is[/i] in peak fitness, or near to it. It makes little-to-no sense that a few swings of a mere 1-3 pound short sword would tire Henry out unless he is intended to be asthmatic in the extreme and have hayfever year-round.\n\nThe developers have a clearly-ordained-and-intended way that you are supposed to engage in combat; that is by not doing so at all and fighting very defensively if you do.\nAnd that is not fair to the players to try and force that upon them.\nIt's called [b]open[/b] world for a reason. That should include the whole game, mechanics and all; not just the world itself.\n\nTL;DR:\nGood game, much promise of good story; ruined by terrible combat system and combat balance choices.",

      "review": "There is only one reason why I cannot recommend this game...at least for now.\r\n\r\nAnd that's because of the ridiculous amount of buggy stuff going on in this game. The story is amazing, and the side quests are great, but all too often I find myself with a broken immersion when:\r\n\r\n- I cannot really hunt well because animals move randomly af, and I mean backwards, sideways and sometimes they even fly off.\r\n\r\n- I can't really commit crimes because NPCs are omniscient and will always blame you even if no one saw you, and if you try to stop them by killing all witnesses, they will still find out, and while chasing them they can literally teleport and go trough walls and fences.\r\n\r\n- Mounted combat is completely broken and definitely not recommended. Despite having some perks available on the perk tree, the only viable way of fighting on a horse is from a distance and running away pretty much all the time because NPCs can run extremely fast without getting tired, even in full armor, all too often they might be even faster than your horse and then teleport to you, hit the horse and then dismount you, and charging them basically doesn't work at all.\r\n\r\n- The DLC of the simthy is great, but every weapon that you forge literally looks the exact same. You only get to craft 3 types of things: short sword, long sword and an axe, and they all look the exact same. Even the axis that you're supposed to craft in the story quest is literally a short sword. They didn't even bother making a different mesh, not even for the main DLC quest, which feels incredibly bad, to be honest.\r\n\r\n- And the most annoying bug of them all, happening all too often (I've already counted it 32 times in my playthrough, and that's when I started counting), is when suddenly my inventory gets bugged and I find myself in the middle of a fight, unable to change my weapon or drink any potions, even though I have them already equipped. The only way to fix this is to exit the game and re-launch it, because reloading a saved game will not fix the issue, and that means that all too often you will probably lose all your progress because of this random bug, and be unable to fight at all.\r\n\r\n- Another mention I'd like to add is that melee combat happens on rails. You can only dodge attacks if the green shield pops up, and for some reason many times this will not happen, and enemies will hit you as if their weapons were heat seeking missiles, even if you're well outside of their range (they will literally teleport to you), which is incredibly annoying, and makes the dodging gameplay extremely unrewarding and overall, really buggy. In fact, many times you'll find yourself in a fight where you cannot win with skill, because the only way to block your enemy's attacks is by having invested enough money on your skill tree abilities with that weapon, or by training until you get a high enough level. You cannot win otherwise because your enemies will have essentially infinite stamina, strength and their attacks go towards you on rails. In the end, the best choice is a bow with poisonous arrows, which by the way is incredibly broken as well. You can down an entire army with just that.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo yeah, many people will think I'm being unfair because the game has a genuinely good story, but the game is so heavily scripted that it comes with a lot of stuff that will break the immersion, and that also makes the gameplay incredibly restrictive and linear. I'm not saying that the game is bad, all I'm saying is that it still needs a lot of work in order to feel like a polished, properly finished game, that's all.\r\n\r\nAnd by the way, I'd gladly pay extra as long as this work gets properly done, after all, I've bought almost all the DLCs with the intention of supporting the developers, and trying the new content because I love the KCD series. But I really can't properly recommend this game until it's polished and released in a much better state.",

While the gameplay changes are purely cosmetic or minor rehauls like the combat system, the core mechanics haven't changed much from the first game. What has changed is the narrative, writing, quest design, and overall tone of the game.\r\n\r\nThe serious narrative has been replaced by nonstop giggles about shit, how the main character stinks, how he gets doused with shit, and quests whose plots boil down to you getting drunk and doing stupid things. A huge number of nonsensical quests that don't fit into the narrative at all. They might have fit in the first game because Henry is just a peasant and can still go and do dumb funny quests where you have to paint a cow, but by the end of the first/beginning of the second game, he's already a respected person and has grown as a person, and narratively, it makes zero sense to even suggest those given the urgent mission plot going on. I could easily write a 3000-word essay here about every poorly written quest or just how this game as a whole is, but it all boils down to this.\r\n\r\n- The narrative feels like Rockstar crap catered to normies, where all the quests are just random bullshit thrown in to amuse the player.\r\n- The quests themselves are low-quality, linear, filler, fetch quest crap. There are only 1-2 interesting quests in the entire game so far, and even those are buggy. Unlike the quest design in the first game, the second game lacks any freedom or options for solving them. You're simply following a linear chain where you're not given any choices, with a couple of exceptions. And even the choices you do get are also extremely flat and plain simple. Although the second game has almost two to three times as many quests as the first, what's the point if they're all just undeveloped, linear crap?\r\n\r\nAnd this quantity -> quality approach is evident in EVERY aspect of the sequel.\r\n\r\nIf you consider the game separately from the first game, it deserves an \"okay\" rating. 7/10, but as a sequel to the first game, it's a 4/10 at best. The first game was a carefully crafted handmade product born of passion with meticulous attention to detail, while the second game is a soulless, mass-produced product aimed at attracting a larger audience. And they succeeded. People lapped it up and are calling it Game of the Year. These are the same people for whom Game of the Year is yet another Assassin's Creed, Ghost of Tsushima, Grand Theft Auto, RDR, and other similar open-world slop games. It's truly sad that the second part saw such great success, as the industry has lost a talented studio forever.\r\n\r\nA shame.",

Absolutely horrible if you know KCD 1.\nEverything is linerary scripted and the tutorial is a boring mess. 2/3 Scripts and talking then you can play a bit. Then again scripts, scripts scripts, boring long scenes and talking. For heavens sake.\n\nAll the freedom and excitement of Part 1 seems lost.  I played this now 3 hours and have absolutely no fun. I am thrown from one scripted scene to the next. \n\nAnd why the system specifications are so high idk... It doesn't look that much better than KCD 1.While my CPU has nearly nothing to do you seem to need at least a nvdia 3080  \nfor this game. Playing with i5-12600k and nvidia 1080 is barely possible on medium settings \non 1920x1080. It is strange as the facial expressions and animations are the same as in part 1. Poorly optimized i guess.\n\nAlso you can't pillage everything like in KCD 1. Much stuff is just decoration.\nThis is a clear downgrade to KCD 1 and extremely boring.\n\nEverything they changed is worse than in part I.\nThe menues for gear and attributes are very similar but with unnecessary changes making them worse to handle than in KCD 1. Also the alchemy was a little bit changed to the worse.\n\nThe game doesn't feel open world immersive fascinating anymore with good stories and well \nmade dialogs.

      "review": "Hmm... disappointments happen everywhere. Overall, I wouldn't give the game a 6/10 anymore. Remember the combat in the first game? Well, in this one, it's not a combat system, it's pure trash! The sword is absolutely the only playable weapon in the game, everything else is just garbage. Hitting a guy in full plate armor? Hmm... I guess a heavy weapon would be a good option, right? NO, in this game you'll only take damage while wearing full plate armor. And by the way, at the beginning of the game you are a complete bum... unless you go to the criminales, it is simply impossible to get armor until the late stage of the game. If you're looking to follow the story, I'm going to disappoint you... At the beginning of the game, the plot requires you to attend a wedding, but you won't be able to get any money or anything. So what should you do? Go and do side quests... The quests in this game (most of them) were just there for the sake of it. Seriously, carry something, fetch something, go talk to this guy, that guy, poke around in other people's business. The plot itself isn't bad, a 7/10. But then again, it has some really stuffy moments! Lots of chatter, lots of awkward cutscenes, it's downright annoying at times. I was genuinely disappointed with the sequel; it's just the same first game, packaged in a new package. Although, no, the first game had more realism, better combat and side quests, and overall, the game didn't feel so lame at times. I honestly don't understand all the hype about this game. It's another game with decent potential, but the developers decided to make it more... user-friendly and arcade-like to appeal to a larger audience.",

It looks absolutely stunning (though the sky and weather are awful, but everything else is just.. wow). But the writing and quest design are just mediocre at best and incredibly dated and ridiculous at worst. I was excited for this, and don't mind the slow pace, and love just going about experiencing the world, but there's just very little to it imo, and it's not exactly well made (people's reactions and the world's interaction with you are often buggy and nonsensical, sometimes just plain broken, and every single thing is clunky). The systems, complicated as they may be, add very little to my experience overall, and the role-playing experience is also very much taking the back seat overall. You have very little agency and the character is whatever it is regardless. Acting, unfortunately, is also not very good and often leans towards the silly side.\r\n\r\nI reckon you'll know if you'll like this. It's not a horrible game, it's just a mediocre game with quite some scale and old school features added in (which can appeal to some). I'm genuinely a bit baffled by the reception of this game. Feels like if it were released by Bethesda or Obsidian or someone, people would go mild on it as dated, unpolished, and poorly written, but since it's sort of an indie game the reception is completely different.",

      "review": "This game feels like it was made by two different studios. One wanted to make an uncompromising medieval immersive sim for sickos, the other wanted to make a pseudo-AAA 2000s-style linear cinematic game for as broad an audience as possible. KCD1 had a lot of the first thing and a bit of the second thing, in a way that added up to a flawed but special gem of a game that I loved a lot. After wrapping up the story I'd often boot it up just to hang out, ride around, go to a beautiful church.\n\nIn KCD2, the mouthbreathers won out. Much of KCD1's systems are recreated here, but everything is put towards a massive and interminable main quest so boring and stupid I had to force myself to keep playing in the hopes that Kuttenberg would be worth it. The dialogue and characters are painful. I'm asked to embody and care about the bizarre and myopic revenge quest of an extremely boring and horny asshole with a puzzlingly contemporary haircut. Apparently I'm best buds with Hans Capon, and my ability to hang out in this lovingly crafted rendition of medieval Bohemia is being held ransom by literally dozens of hours of straight-to-DVD buddy cop bullshit with this character I tolerated in KCD1 but grew to utterly loathe here. \n\nKCD1 wanted to be more like this, but lacked the resources for 8-hour railroaded main quests and lavish cutscenes. This was to its enormous benefit. Left to my own devices, I was able to role play myself in a medieval world. Things like the combat system that forced you to learn it or the fact that you had to literally learn to read thinned out the membrane between player and player character. It was the kind of game I'd wanted to play since I was a kid imagining what videogames might be like. \n\nIn KCD2, there is never any chance to forget that you are playing Henry, and I don't care about Henry. Henry is a stupid person's idea of an interesting and realistic main character for a medieval RPG. I don't give a shit about him or his stupid dead stepdad. The game has no interest in getting me to care, and just assumes that I will feel the way it tells me I feel. His quest feels so much like a budget 2000s action movie that they even try to make a catchphrase happen—it's all in Latin, except for the word \"fucking.\" \n\nAnd you can't go inside the fucking churches!",

      "review": "Meh.\n\nNot recommended because it felt vastly different to the first game, and not in a good way. You never felt like a hero in KCD1, but in KCD2 Henry may as well be a fantasy character with power armour. Out of god knows how many speech skill checks I attempted, I only failed three of them and fought through so many 1vMany fights that it would make Master Chief blush. In the first game, I would get my ass handed to me if I tried fighting more than two enemies at once if I wasn't on horseback or from a superior vantage point. Here, I just slide in full heavy armour behind my opponents, putting my back to three guys, and slap each one silly like I'm Zorro or something.\n\nIt was very irritating putting in the work exploring the first region, building up a set of quality weapons and armour, slowly building up my money, and then you enter the second area and practically every enemy is now a fully kitted out elite mercenary wearing gold quality plate armour and using gold quality war grade weapons. If I ever play the game again, I will be rushing through the first area because it's pointless sticking around and smelling the roses, the second area just makes it completely redundant.\n\nThe environments were nice, but there was also a lot of liberties taken which were not taken in the first game. In the first game, I wandered for hours soaking in all of medieval brew, getting enthralled by simple things which had extensive lore entries such as a little clacking windmill on a small brook, but in this game this doesn't feel prominent at all. Whereas in KCD2 most of the landmarks you find are just dumb easter eggs or typical Bethesda game tier encounters. \n\nWhere I was amazed and impressed by this new studio out of nowhere having such beautifully designed buildings and churches with extensive artistic interiors within with KCD1, here in KCD2 I never felt particularly thrilled or taken in by anything. You can't even enter churches in this one, they're all suspiciously closed and unmodelled inside! Though the castles you could explore were nice, I must admit. Kuttenburg was nice too, but came far too late in the game, in my opinion.\n\nAlso Sigismunds Warcamp was awful to traverse, which I had to do many times. Not being able to duck under cloth walls, or slice through them, or even vault over them, just added to the annoyance.\n\nAdequate as far as games go, for sure, but miserly for a medieval simulator, as it truly feels like it gave way to fantasy or generic adventure instead of a proper simulation, but not a very good one, as it's hobbled by the fact it tries to present itself as a serious medieval adventure.\n\nThe game introduces you to characters and then they just sit around doing nothing. I still don't understand why we needed to hire half of the people we did, even Dry Devil barely has a reason to exist and there's very minimal interactions with him, he's just a generic stereotype character that pipes up in cutscenes sometimes, along with most of the cast. \n\nStory is also heavily railroaded, in part due to the fact important NPCs respawn - early \"major\" quest involves Henry and Hans visiting a fortress to affirm its loyalty, with Hans going to meet the leader and leaving you to your own devices. It quickly becomes obvious that the people in the fort are suspiciously trying to make you waste your time there and keep you occupied, so I decided to snoop around, and found a whole heap of evidence that they were up to no good. Even a wench attempted to have sex with me against my will (loyalty to Theresa only) so I proceeded to snap her neck and stab almost everyone in the whole fortressed, named NPC or otherwise, I really tore this place apart. I fully expected Hans to be imprisoned or in danger, but later on he strolled out absolutely fine. So we left.\n\nNothing came about from this. I reported my findings and suspicions, and then later when the plot took its natural course, this fortress had suddenly been repopulated. It was like everything I did there didn't even matter, all of the people I killed came back to life, so on and so forth. This pointless feeling of being railroaded with everything I did became such a persistent companion that eventually I just gave up caring about trying to resist it.\n\nCombat during the big scripted battle sections which they do a bunch of times was clearly being done with very limited AI and the enemy units clearly had reduced stats and health, as they'd die in one hit in most circumstances compared to \"real\" enemies you'd encounter around the world. People complained about the false advertisement the first game had, where it showed taking part in a siege and assault which was absent or heavily downplayed in the actual game, so I guess they felt like they needed to put in some big battles, but I really wish they didn't. They were all just scripted bullshít, with enemies that fell like wheat and didn't put up a proper fight, it was just a dull interactive cutscene setpiece.\n\nThey did this big thing at the end of the game with Henry and co surviving a long siege. It might have been a serious, thought / emotion provoking sequence. I had absolutely tons of stashed food, which helped me survive the siege like nothing was happening, even giving it away, but then suddenly it disappeared, even the unique stuff. However, they didn't take my herbs, so I brewed 1000 bottles of Henry Grade moonshine and just survived on that. Everyone else grew crumbled and cold around me, but I grew fat and warm. Nice work!\n\nCharacters having voices changed, such as Godwin, and even cutscenes showing voices of previous actors that go back to different voices when the cutscene ended and gameplay began. This happened to Lord Semine and his captain of the guard, who were basically just Lord Davish and Robard from KCD1 - ironically enough, I think they were voiced by them in the cutscenes before switching to other actors in gameplay. I think.\n\nDoes contain some excellent story setpieces and moments of intrigue though. Some pretty good comedy at times, too. Like the final cutscene the game gives you. It has some powerful moments, some emotional moments, all that you'd expect from an RPG game. It's just tied together too tightly, or something. I'd happily replay KCD1, but KCD2 feels like a one-and-done experience. \n\nIt's just a bit of a mess. It's a functional game, but it's functional in the \"used\" sense. Feels like you're not getting your money's worth, or whatever, because of all of the jank. There are some truly good parts, like I recovered a shield with Hans sigil on it and I gave it to him, told him to keep it and he used it for the rest of the game. There was a quest where Hans was giving me grief, so I choked him out and carried him instead of going the way he wanted. Those parts are great - but very few and far between.\n\nAverage, yeah that's what I'll go with. Sadly Steam doesn't let you give it a middle tier review, neither good or bad, but since I wouldn't recommend someone play this game, I guess I have to negatively review it. Oh well.",

It delivers some of the best RPG content I've played in years, only to follow it up with an almost unrecognizable, massive quality drop.\nLet’s be clear: the first region of KCD II is absolutely fantastic. I could easily give this section of the game a 9/10. It captures that gritty, lived-in historical atmosphere perfectly.\nThe true star here isn't the main plot—it’s the people. The side quests and NPCs are genuinely rich, well-written, and often hilarious. Everything feels organic; every little interaction builds the world. I happily lost over 40 hours just messing around, learning trades, and solving local disputes, feeling like I was truly part of 15th-century Bohemia.\nThe one persistent thorn is, predictably, the combat. It's still clunky, unforgiving, and often feels like fighting the controls more than the bandits. But honestly, in the first region, the strength of the world is so high that you forgive it. It’s a tolerable flaw in an otherwise stellar opening act.\n\nAnd then you move to the second region. What happened?\nThe quality drop is massive and immediate. It’s like the development team that wrote the first part was replaced by a different studio overnight. The writing suddenly becomes sloppy and uninspired. Quests that were formerly engaging, character-driven narratives turn into boring fetch quests.\nThe biggest disappointment is the main city. It’s huge, but it's strangely sterile and lacks the bustling, lived-in detail that made the smaller hamlets so great. The sheer lack of compelling content makes it feel hollow.\nAfter spending so much time invested in Henry and the incredible world of the first region, hitting this narrative wall is exhausting. The game goes from being an obsessive, can’t-put-it-down experience to a chore. I tried to force myself through, but I just couldn't.

Even the combat (though I was not good at it) is super cool! That said, this game really revels in putting the player down and keeping them there- which, fair enough; medieval times were like that. In my opinion, if you're gonna start your player with absolutely nothing to their name while implementing hunger, cleanliness, and conspicuousness mechanics, maybe include less risky ways to make some money like chopping wood (or maybe let me sell my bushels of dried herbs!)\r\n\r\nI can't speak for everyone, but with a save system that requires you to find an alchemy station to craft a save potion or spend money you don't have on an inn room, I don't really feel like going and stealing or fighting for any quest if I'm gonna lose twenty to thirty minutes of play time because the game woefully underprepares its players to explore the world.",

I have played similar games like the Witcher series, skyrim etc and loved them but this game is... convoluted.\n\nEnvironments are beautiful, characters are well thought-out (as far as I got in the game), the story was interesting,  but the gameplay was the dealbreaker for me. Your choices don't matter. I dislike that no matter what you choose, you may end up with the same result anyway (the early encounter with the knights, the bar fight). The gameplay doesn't feel like it was made for PC at all. The swordfighting was too complex to me, despite me putting a lot of practice in to get it right and visiting the trainers. The real fights are way more difficult than the training encounters too. Hit boxes are also off when it comes to wolves, which doesn't help. The potion brewing is also quite hard to master. Conversations often go wrong and it can be hard to understand why.\n\nThere are some bugs too, like rabbits running backwards or upside down. Ruins my immersion.\n\nThe early quests where boring, especially finding Mutt. It's just a whole bunch of \"go there, no go there instead, no go there instead etc etc\" around the map. It gets old real fast, especially without a horse.\n\nThe game in itself is also not very helpful for a new player like me. I have no clue if I'm over my head until I get ambushed by 6 bandits and insta killed. It doesn't even seem like the enemies have a stamina bar, they can just wail on me as long as they like while I get exhausted after 5 swings/blocks. I also don't know what quests I am supposed to prioritize (or if I have enough skill for it). \n\nYes, I might not be the most OP gamer but I would have appreciated an easier level or more balanced gameplay.

The characters feel strangely off when they talk — like something out of an early 2000s RPG, where their facial animations don’t quite line up with the dialogue. It’s not terrible, but it does pull me out of the conversations a bit.\n\nOn the plus side, the game looks great, and I was genuinely impressed with how well it ran given the amount of environmental detail. The world feels alive and grounded, and I can tell a lot of effort went into building it.\n\nUnfortunately, the main reason I can’t recommend this game — and why I ended up refunding it — is the combat. It’s… kind of janky. I’ve seen similar directional blocking systems done before, but this one just didn’t click for me. I don’t really have the reaction time for that sort of precise, twitch-based combat.\n\nNow, I know some people might say “just get good,” but reaction times aren’t something you can get good at. If I could, I’d probably be playing competitive shooters instead of single-player RPGs. For me, RPGs are about feeling powerful and getting lost in a fantasy. When a game makes me feel useless and clumsy, it breaks that illusion — and honestly, I can get that feeling from real life for free.\n\nThat said, if you do enjoy that kind of Dance Dance Revolution-style, directional combat system, there’s probably a lot here for you to love. The game clearly has depth and ambition. But for me, if a game’s core mechanic — in this case, combat — isn’t fun, then the rest just can’t carry it.\n\nThankfully, there’s a training fight within the first hour of gameplay that gives you a good feel for the system. If you don’t vibe with it there, you’re probably not going to vibe with the rest of the game. Hopefully this helps others make an informed decision before diving in.",

      "review": "Honestly surprised at the love this game has got, its disappointed me more than any other sequel having loved KCD1.  \n\nWould say don't get this unless you've played KCD1 and then only when its heavily discounted - go play KCD1 instead its honestly far better. For large parts its disappointing and tedious in comparison to KCD1 and still has game and quest breaking bugs littered in it - its worse put together than KCD1 is now. It has stripped so much of the freedom from missions and the mechanics on the whole feel worse than the first game (despite being janky in that)\n\nPros: Inventory and layers have been improved. Kuttenburg (when it works) is magnificent. The writing and story are top notch and the acting is excellent. The smithing is fine.\n\nCons: Pretty much all mechanics have been downgraded. Its buggy and janky and frustrating throughout. It has the least fun combat I've ever played - where as combos, blocks and return strikes were all used alongside masterstrikes and there was a variety of fun weapons - only swords and spamming masterstrikes really works - its honestly awful. Made worse is there is extra jank when you load into combat for a mission or are stopped on the road. So many times I have died as loading and blocks and masterstrikes don't work. So you load in, can't block and enemies hit you non-stop as stamina doesn't affect them. Quests break if you start part of a quest in the day, it becomes night and the guards and occupants are angry. Load times even off an SSD are appalling at times, can sometimes take 20/30 seconds for the map of inventory to load. \n\nThe story though good is terribly paced and Trosky is a major downgrade as region.  Its also implemented in a way that actively punishes you for trying out many of the games mechanics - I wouldn't have touched lockpicking or archery if I'd not played KCD1. I hate the lockpick mini game its somehow less fun than even Oblivion but admit that is very much personal preference\n\nThe game is so railroaded and lacks much of the freedom of KCD1 Want to sneak into a Cuman camp and poison them - nah that doesn't work as well as the first game.  The horse riding without the auto assist is painful and the worst of any game I've played. Its just so poorly paced that there are so many moments of bordom and jank that its annoying as much as it is brilliant. I honestly questioned so many times 'is this jank, bugs or deliberate but awful game design' - the answer was equally spread out.\n\nConfusing points: Henry somehow has gotten worse at everything compared with the start of the first game....except reading and has his dog from the DLC.\n\nKCD1 cost itself being as highly rated because it had one of the worst launches of all time (so bad I'll never preorder anything ever again). But almost everything is implemented better in that game than this. KCD2 is stunningly overrated. KCD1 ended up brilliant - KCD2 is moments of brilliance that punctuate terrible pacing and a frustrating experience.",

If I could request a refund at this point, I would.\n\nI spent the first 2 hours going through the intro sequences, with lots of scripted story to set the scene etc. and the dialogue was rather wooden and un-emotional, although the characters can be funny at points they seem to rely on lots of meaningless swearing.\n\nAfter this, (and conveniently after Steam's refund timer), the real game begins, and there are many frustrations.\n\nThe save system leaves me questioning the design choices immediately, I'm not allowed to save unless I brew some potion that lets me, BUT I can \"save and quit\" at any point, leading to moments where I just need to quit to save and then load the game again.  Extremely pointless.\n\nThe combat is rather static, wooden, doesn't feel realistic or dynamic in any way.  It feels like something from the old era of gaming like Gothic etc.  It's just a matter of block/parry/attack rinse and repeat.\n\nThen there's a forced first-person-view.  Why?  I want to see my character and the armour I've equipped, and I don't like all the forced camera movements in FPV when doing EVERY SINGLE ACTION.  it's like press a button, wait for 2 seconds while the camera moves around weirdly before you can do anything else.\n\nAs well as this, there are a lot of weird key binding choices, like sometimes I have to just press ESC to cancel something and other times I have to hold ESC for 1 second?  The same with E, or whatever.  Why?  This is confusing and un-intuitive and completely non-standard for PC key bindings.\n\nAnd to top it all off, once I had managed to actually get to grips with some of the game systems and kill a small camp with 3 bandits in it near the starting area, I loaded myself up with their weapons and armour then proceeded down the hill to find 3 \"wild dogs\".  I got my ass absolutely beaten raw by these three wild dogs.  A man in armour, with swords, can't beat 3 dogs.  Right.\n\nI also have issues with the stealth system, lockpicking, item equipping (you have 3 sets of equipment, and all of it ALSO stays in your inventory for maximum clutter), item stat comparison, and the combat system.  All of them feel clunky and at times like I'm not in control: the character and/or the UI feel unresponsive during actions quite a lot.\n\nAs a point of comparison with all of the above, I've been playing a lot of Mount & Blade 2 recently, and let me tell you that game does a lot of these things right, and overall has a MUCH better feel to playing it than KCD2.  It has a great first, and third-person views.  Amazing fluid and fast feel to the combat, 3 armour sets you can actually equip properly without cluttering up your inventory, and an easy to understand stat comparison for equipment.\n\nSo, I've modded this game now so I can save any time I want, and I have an optional TPV (which is pretty bad because the game hasn't been designed for it) but I'm hoping I can struggle my way through to find this supposedly \"game of the year\" content that people are going on about.\n\nSo far, it's very pretty, but every other thing about the game has frustrated me and feels clunky.  I will see how far I can get, but really not finding myself compelled to come back to play.  I unfortunately wouldn't find myself recommending this to my friends.",

This is the first game where I found myself clicking through dialogue on the first playthrough because it felt like it was wasting my time with SLOW line delivery and SO much filler.\n\nThat's the kicker actually yes - I feel like this game intentionally wastes your time - what's the point of not being able to save without \"Saviour Schnapps\" if you can just Save & Quit? Why force me to waste my time closing the game & opening it back up to save? Why can I even save like that then? What if the game crashes? \nImo this should've been reserved for Hardcore Mode, not Standard Mode - let me enjoy the game at my own pace please. If I want to save scum let me. Also, YES I did run out of Saviour Schnapps & had to Alchemy new ones - I think I manually saved maybe 5 times in 14 hours so not over-using them...I think.\n\nOther things feel like chores as well, alchemy...ffs can I just create a recipe once then PLEASE choose to automatically just create more if I have the ingredients? Blacksmithing too, sharpening your weapons too - it all just takes so f long.\n\nIn the end, I believe the story is probably fantastic, but it's just not for me.

Let me tell you (spoiler alert)\n\nAfter some prologue I started the story nearly naked and was wondering like this trying to get some money and buy basic clothing, that is until an hour later I realized that I have full set of light armor in my backpack. So I lost an hour for nothing instead of just gearing up and moving on (maybe the armor came with DLC, but still, really?).\n\nI was wondering how could I start earning some money, so I went to blacksmith as the main story suggested. He taught me how to make a horseshoe, so I crafted 4 of them and sold them for about 20 Groschen. It took me maybe 20 minutes to do. I was happy with the earned money until I realized that collecting random, widely available herb for 3 minutes will get me 300 Groschen immediately. After that crafting the horseshoes felt like a massive time loss (and crafting is a really fun minigame, REALLY, but why would I do this?! pointless).\n\nThe game spams you with massive written tutorial pages, that gives you a headache if you want to read and memorize it all. I played KCD1 so, who cares, I skip it. For the first couple of hours I forgot that I need to spend my experience points (only because there was no challenge at all so why would I wonder how to upgrade anything). So, I had about 20 point to spend, but despite that the game was still way too easy (in hardcore mode).\n\nFighting 5 wolves with an axe and shield is not a problem at all, whatever your level or if you actually know how to fight. Just click the damn thing. Fighting 3 opponents also not a big deal (in the first hours of gameplay). Parrying and counterattack? Not a problem, the game, also in hardcore, displays a green shield in your face for more than a second, to make sure you won't fail it. In KCD1 a 1v3 fight was nearly impossible to win and this was good, because it was realistic. WTF happened? I won't complain about the bow, because in KCD1 it was too difficult so I get that making it easier makes sense.\n\nFrom a game in which falling off a staircase forced you to rest for 2 days to a game where your biggest problem is repairing your shoes - unless you quickly figure out that you can sell random weed for a ton of a cash.\n\nStory is not even nearly as engaging as KCD1. I only listen to dialogues because I am Polish and I play the game with Czech audio and it is fun for me, but the game doesn't make me interested in what's being said, so I just listen to words and that gives me a tiny bit of joy from this game.\n\nI loved how fight was difficult in KCD1 and how you had to make every move count. I understand that it felt too difficult for some, but man, did you really had to make it available for a 5 year old? I feel really disappointed, I don't know how this game gets such a good score.",

The minigames are either meaninglessly easy (forging, sharpening) or unsteady to the point of unlearnability (lockpicking, alchemy). The save system is painful, especially when you're just learning the game, as you can easily stumble across, for example, a wolf pack and lose half an hour's progress, or fail to understand the pickpocketing minigame and have the same result.

Games still buggy as hell and you cant even one shot headshot anymore because realism? IDK\n\nPeople that enjoy this game are brainwashed into the flavor of the month. Wearing armor comparable to the highest I could buy in Kutenberg with a Tier 4 sword I was getting one shot by bandits on the road. It very well could have just been a bug, because this game even 9 months after release is a buggy mess, but I reloaded a save 10 times, each time fast travelling to my quest and getting an event each time.  The first time I wasnt in full armor because I thought hey, I crush each combat encounter so far, Ill be fine with sword and shield. Wrong- One shot. Ok, I say to myself, armor and go, they hit kinda hard. Wrong- one shot. Ok, my mistake, maybe he hit a weakspot. Wrong- hit for 90% of my hp cause theres 3 guys and they can magically combo no matter what I do but they get to interrupt your combo every time. Its just an annoying slog. \nPeople will argue with you and say realism this realism that, youre just a peasant blah blah. That goes out the window when Im fighting a man with an arrow sticking out of his face, or the new wanted system where they literally say \"Something was stolen and it can only be you get fucked\", or any of the hundred reasons a video game isnt realistic. Its like instead of making an actual realistic game (impossible, of course) they just slapped in the most annoying limitations they could and set edge cases (like getting caught stealing through multiple rooms in the dark) to prevent the player from having fun.

      "review": "THIRD REVIEW:\n\nSo, the main story finally started picking up last night. It was quite satisfying to take out an antagonist from the first game that well frankly, is annoying as hell. You also have a friend in the game I'd love to kill even more because he's friggin whiny as hell but anyway .... this review is not for diehard KCD fans. I've a feeling that like the roughly 40% (from what I gather from achievements) with this game that gave up, many also gave up on the first game QUITE EARLY. Then ... even more gave up later. Finally, some of us stuck it out. You'll see quite a vocal community online as with any game that'll make it seem quite great and it can be fun at times but I leave my reviews for the average gamer. If I were reviewing Dark Souls, I would choose \"No\" to \"Would you recommend this game to other players?\" because well, it's Dark Souls. \n\nUnlike DS, combat on here takes even longer to get used to. I finally found the one idiot that teaches the \"master strike\" except now it only applies to swords. Don't ask me why. Blocking doesn't work half the time. I'll have full stamina and no matter which way I'm aiming or \"aiming\" (as in, the red in the recticle), Henry simply will not lift his shield. I had a lot easier time with combat in the first KCD. By this point in #1, I could take on a group of enemies no problem. I wouldn't pick \"Yes\" to that game either however as I believe many players would have quit it and wasted their money.\n\nThat's the simple truth. The game is picking up. I'm starting to enjoy it but, I do not believe this is a game for the average player. It can be grindy, repetitive and down-right hard at times if not straight-up annoying. If you're not really into the setting and/or story or have some other major draw, you'll probably quit.\n\nAt the very least, spend a good amount of time watching some youtube videos. Not ones where someone is OP and killing hoards of enemies at once. The real ones where they are dying over and over. I've beat the first KCD on hardcore twice and still struggle with this one. The pacing of this one ... I still don't know how I feel about it. I'm not the only one either. It's all over Reddit. Some quests still seem bugged depending on the player also.\n\nI'll leave this a \"No\", while I boot it up for myself.\n\nIf you liked the first KCD, you'll probably be a bit annoyed by this one for a while but then it'll grow on you.\n\nIf you're new to KCD, you can start with just this one but, I'd be cautious. The introduction is too long for a refund on here.\n\nHappy Gaming!\n\n\nADDENDUM:\n\nIt's finally picking up ... We'll see.\nStill though, 30+ hours to get going. I spent maybe 10 or so brewing potions. I don't know where the time went. The sack carrying and stuff really stands out. I also skipped the first DLC. I'd google it. Fetch quests.\n\nSECOND REVIEW:\n\nMy original review is below. This is not KCD1 and unlike others, I'm not complaining about the combat being \"too easy\" because unlike KCD1, I'm still getting my ass handed to me. I find it harder actually. It's taking a lot longer to get some skill (training). That's not my gripe. Much of my time has been leveling alchemy, yes. Basically the rest of my time has been carrying sacks and doing other labor. This game has become a labor simulator. The story ... each part of the story is just do this labor task, do that labor task.... The side quests, suck. Sorry but they do. \n\nSome drunk up in a tree that again, I have to carry back and forth? What is it with the obsession of having me carry crap back and forth all game? I'm seriously about to electronically shred this game just for the satisfaction. I'll change this if there actually becomes something to it. As of now, it's just a bunch of whiny-ass Hans and slave-labor.\n\nI'd like to point out that while they brag about 4 million copies sold... I've a steam achievement that is required to progress the game early on. Required. Less than 60 percent of people have it. I'm telling you, they kinda shit the bed with the beginning of this game at the very least. I truly hope it gets better. Looks like A LOT of people simply quit the thing. \n\n\nFIRST REVIEW:\n\nThere's simply too much to say about this game. Honestly, I really suggest reading Reddit or such. Combat was hard in number one (until you leveled up and got used to it). People say it's easier in this one but I've died a lot more. Maybe I'm just rusty. To me, it seems very familiar. Like a continuation of the story with way better graphics. Also, I love that there's an alchemy station right near the start so you can start earning some money early without having to kill bandits (or get killed). \n\nIt's KCD2. I'm not a shill. I'm probably not it's biggest fan but, it's a pretty damn solid game so far. You just have to get used to it. The first KCD I almost gave up on and this is as a hardcore souls-like fan. The combat is simply different. I cannot think of anything I've ever played that is similar. Give it a try .. just know that unfortunately the first two hours won't give you an idea of what the game is like so if you don't like it, you won't be able to return it on here. There needs to be a policy change for games like this. I won't be returning it though.",

      "review": "First and foremost, I wish steam gave a “So-So” or something option vs just a “Yes” or “No” option when reviewing games. \r\nI only have 45 hours play time and that is split between two starts of the game, so this is just my first impression based off my own struggles.\r\nThe game has a lot to offer no doubt it has nice graphics, some good story lines (so far), it provides decent challenges for a beginner, and while grindy, it seems to be getting a bit easier. Early game cash is a bit of a challenge, but the game does give you options to make cash once you get the hang of it.\r\nNow for the “So-So” parts IMO! You soon discover the game is a nonstop continuous quest after quest type game that leaves you longing for more in the beginning. Example: I’m have discovering you cannot fish or make food using recipes. However, you can buy fish, veggies, spices, and meat, you just cannot make a fish or meat stew. There are wheat fields (but you cannot harvest them) so you’re stuck buying baked breads. \r\nIt feels odd you can craft weapons and armor, but not make a simple loaf of bread. You can hunt, yet not fish the ponds that have fish in them. And since I have found using a bow to hunt very difficult in early game, I constantly have to return to a town to buy food. Or pay for a long-term bed or hay stack so you can sleep and eat with a spoon out of a pot over a fire. \r\nOh, just an FYI; if you need to cook an item, look for the pan next to the pot as the pot doesn’t give you an option.

      "review": "I really want to love this game, there's a lot to like, but there's honestly a lot to dislike as well. Especially with key mechanics. I find the horseback traveling and exploration in general extremely clunky making me use fast travel more than anything, which to me is immersion breaking. I find the combat fun in extremely certain situations, but it is also very very very clunky. It can (sometimes) shine in 1v1 combat, but as soon as there is more than one foe, it becomes one of my least favorite combat systems I've ever played. Which does not pair well with the saving methods of the game. There are a lot of game breaking elements from random animals walking backwards or in place, plus quests breaking. The quest to find your dog, for example, I would think is one of the earliest main quests and yet if you do it in a slightly different order than intended (which you have no way of knowing) the quest will break and I had to just look up the location. Talk about an early road block. This makes me nervous for the quality control on other quests later in the game. The speech really ticks me off, choices aren't how they are portrayed, i once had an option helping a guy talk to a girl, the option i chose was \"give him a chance\" which turned into my character saying her breath was worse than a horses arse. So obviously it did not help at all. What's the point of choosing options if they come out COMEPLETELY different. Like please, just tell me if I'm just going to insult people before hand. This game shines in narrative and certain menu QOL aspects such as details with inventory. The world and its characters are also decently intriguing to invest in but to me this is overshadowed by an annoying combat system that tries to be chivalry 2 but fails (rather horribly), and poor exploration all paired with a bad saving method. I'm always game for a tougher, less forgiving save method but please pair it with features that are not super clunky. Many features are cool but poorly executed. Such as dog relationship, even with buffs to slow the decline i feel like i need to pet my dog every few minutes which is annoying. BTW don't risk any type of falling or jumping off any heights. I think if this game deserves a GOTY award, it must've been a slow year.....  Errand boy simulator\n\nTLDR:  It feels like a Skyrim type game but still in beta with many cool features but none of which seem polished, except maybe blacksmithing and alchemy. The game can also come to a crawling pace where you may find yourself going hours without a fight only to be ambushed by 3 men who spook your horse from a mile away and kill you because the combat system causes migraines with more than 1 opponent. Now you must go way back in gameplay bc saving sucks. Honestly.... the combat makes the game completely unplayable to me which is crazzzzzzyyy",
