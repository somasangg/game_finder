      "review": "A good game to start hating driving before ever starting. The ingame logic is so... interesting that it´s har to play the game more then 20 minutes. E.g. if you stop at a traffic light´s and there are 2 cars in front of you, you will not be able to pass the intersection during the next green light! Why? Because the bot cars think so slowly! And after waiting at this traffic light you will have another one in 30 meters! Basically you learn to wait most of the time which is certainly good but not for a car simulator. If waitin in a traffic jam (consisting of 3 cars!) for like 20-30% of your game time  is not enough stress, do not worry, the game has more to offer: if you are driving with a passenger and a pedestrian runs into your car (\"an emergency situation\") and you avoid them by braking, you get rating penalty for sudden braking! Indeed every paseenger would give you low rating for avoiding killing a person in front of them... bevause you had to brake!",

      "review": "A good game to start hating driving before ever starting. The ingame logic is so... interesting that it´s har to play the game more then 20 minutes. E.g. if you stop at a traffic light´s and there are 2 cars in front of you, you will not be able to pass the intersection during the next green light! Why? Because the bot cars think so slowly! And after waiting at this traffic light you will have another one in 30 meters! Basically you learn to wait most of the time which is certainly good but not for a car simulator. If waitin in a traffic jam (consisting of 3 cars!) for like 20-30% of your game time  is not enough stress, do not worry, the game has more to offer: if you are driving with a passenger and a pedestrian runs into your car (\"an emergency situation\") and you avoid them by braking, you get rating penalty for sudden braking! Indeed every paseenger would give you low rating for avoiding killing a person in front of them... bevause you had to brake!",

I need to fucking uninstall ALL the crap that comes with the game its req packages and everything from the steering wheel Gay hub and such. Outragously bad programming.
