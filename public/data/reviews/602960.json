      "review": "Played this game with two buddies of mine. We get a mission to clear out a nest of crawlers. Before we can even fucking leave the station, a goddamn CLOWN attacks us and nearly kills one of my friends. So, to save his life, my other friend injects him with alien blood. This causes him to start hallucinating fires all over the ship. He just walks through them since, y'know, they're not real. But the thing is, he was carrying nitroglycerin on him for some reason. And one of the fires turns out to be real. So there goes half the ship because he turned himself into a fucking walking bomb. And then after that me and the other guy die because we cant get back in the ship because its on fire.\n\nBut finally, after reloading, we go to clear out the crawler nest. No issues, they clear it out just fine and i made sure the ship stayed intact. I was the mechanic, after all. On the way to the next outpost it does NOT go fine. A pack of mudraptors attack us, and both my friends instantly die to water pressure and vicious raptors. Leaving me, a lowly mechanic, the last one alive on the sub. Bad enough, right? It got worse.\n\nFUCKING CHTULU HIMSELF ATTACKS ME. A giant, tentacled, 20-eyed sea monster i can only describe as lovecrafitan descends upon the sub and breaks damn near everything. So this has to be the lowest point, yea?\n\nThe sub then lands ON AN ACTIVE FUCKING VOLCANO. So now the ship is infested with raptors, being attacked by an elder god, AND being melted by goddamn pompeii. \n\nI tried my best, and managed to stay alive for about 20 minutes by injecting myself with enough fentanyl to kill an elephant and unloading enough ordinance to level a small town. Unfortunately, i eventually ran out of fent and died.\n\n10/10 game, would die to horrid eldritch horrors again.",

      "review": "66+ hours in and I still don't really know what I am doing, but I am surviving.\r\n\r\nI'm going to be honest.. I hate roleplaying games or heavily immersive games (example gta rp, arma, etc) but there's just something about this game that just scratch a very specific itch that I didn't know I needed. I got the game so that me and a few friends could suffer together for a bit and scream at each other because someone in the crew isn't doing their job correctly, to now having me be fully invested into the game and I WILL ensure I reach the end to see what is there. 60 hours in and we are still in zone 2 after immense trial and error, yet we're still finding new things and discover different things to do. If the game is bending us over this hard already then I don't even want to know what zone 3 and 4 has in store for us.\r\n\r\nI think the main thing I don't like about the game though, while at the same time makes it enjoyable (idk how to explain it but it's like a love-hate relationship) so is it the character combat. It is difficult, but not just in the \"you better come prepared\" way, but also in the \"WTF IS MY IDIOTIC FUCKING CHARACTER DOING JUST SHOOT OR SWING OH MY GOD I JUST KILLED A CREWMATE TRYING TO SHOOT THE ENEMY BECAUSE MY ARM WENT THROUGH THE MONSTER\". It's this mix of being QWOP movement while also fully understanding just why the game is like this. As frustrating as it is, I am unsure if the game would even be the same without it. There's obviously some fixes to be had though.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is that there really isn't much talking, diaries, notes, etc that explains really anything. I don't mean guides, I mean lore. You go to an outpost and you got 4 different kinds of NPCs: merchant, random event chat, quest giver, stale npc that does nothing. Why can't I just walk up to someone and just have a chat about whatever? Why is it that absolutely every encounter, every chat just HAVE to have meaning to it. If I am allowed to talk to someone then it means they have a quest for me. Why can't I just have a dialogue about rumors to example? Give the game more life. Make it feel like I actually exist and is part of this universe. Currently so does it just feel like I am here to go from point A to point B and nothing else. The crew members you have got so much personality like different traits that change how they react to dialogue, why can't we have that with the outpost npc's too?\r\n\r\nIt just feels like I am a spectator to everything. I'm not allowed to initiate or talk to anyone myself. The funny bits with the crew members happen at random you can't force anything to happen.\r\n\r\nThat being said though everything else is great. Sub combat is satisfying and victory from a tough fight or reaching the outpost barely alive really gets the adrenaline pumping. \r\n\r\nI will never forget the first time we came across crawlers and they breached into the sub instantly and just completely mauled everyone onboard except one npc. We make it to the outpost and someone apparently ended up with a husk infection and absolute hell broke loose. That outpost ended up being world war 3. We're still recovering from that chaos. We may have been able to repair, resupply and gear up again, but mentally we're still scarred. We always got husk vaccines on board, never fight anything husk related without protection and we have a dedicated doctor to ensure and check that we aren't infected now. Thank you Barotrauma for giving me a core memory about the dangers of a virtual virus.",

Shining specially through its multiplayer, Barotrauma manages to craft a bonkers mood in an incredibly rich setting which never fails to communicate the dread and oppression of living ♫ under the sea ♫. \n\nI've played this game from early access and I've seen its evolution through years and years. Its such an awesome game which exudes love and creativity, man, I swear. I live for these kinds of games and as a designer myself, I hope to achieve something like this some day. The game is a thing in of itself, so yeah, there are wacky corner cases, bugs, and shit happens. But it happens within the context of an experience that, for the people who like these kinds of games, only feeds into its lore as a game. I really want to tag along and see how it evolves over time, and I really hope way more people venture into this deepsea adventure over time cause the developers deserve as much success as humanly possible.\n\nPD: Half my time in game has been on the Sub Editor. Holy Molly is that shit dank. Whole other game in itself. And big, BIIIIG thanks to the modding community (and to the devs for making things easy for them) since mods are the bread and butter of this game, as it tends to be. A big-ass sandbox like this gets really enriched by the input of creative modders and I hope that over time the bond between that community and the devs gets stronger so we, the players, may get the best of both worlds. \n\nAwesome, awesome work all of you guys.

Also, HELL YEAH MONOGAME!!!! I really can't think of anything negative against the game. The gameplay is really solid, performance is great, and there's very few bugs (at least that I've seen), and there's also native Linux builds which is pretty cool, no having to run it through proton.

We were wondering what the hell was out there. My heart was pounding. In real life, and in the game. Probably from the 60 gigajoules of voltage that my captain took, but thats besides the point. I constantly stared at our measly coilguns, trying to see if we had reached the end of our campaign. \n\nWe were right\n\nA giant caraspace of a creature far bigger than we had ever imagined rose out of the gloomy depths. We hit it with everything we got. \n\nBut it. Hit. Harder. \n\nIts many eyes locked on to the light produced from the periscopes. slamming into the sub harder than the hammerheads could dream of. The water level rose, and we knew we were dead. We flailed and scattered around the dying sub with the diving suits on. The Latcher was seemingly laughing at our struggles. Our engine gave out, then the oxygen, then the electricity. The sub hit the floor of the Abyss with a screeching thud. \n\nYou can probably imagine what happened next.\n\n\n\n\ngood game.",

You take on your role of either; Captain, Mechanic, Engineer, Security, Doctor, or Assistant and try to get from point A to point B while maybe doing some tasks along the way. This can be easy peasy... or you can have everything fall apart if people aren't pulling their weight or someones decided to block your teams progress... Or maybe some creatures of Europa have decided it's your time. When all the parts of Barotrauma are working together like a well oiled machine nothing else quite feels like it. A team of people who work together and have a little knowledge and skill can go far in this game. While the game of shooting, exploring, crafting, and etc. isn't mind blowing it has a good amount of variety and depth to it. Leveling up feels good. Finding rare materials around the map is rewarding. And taking down the enemies with the ships guns or your personal weapons engaging enough to keep you playing. Overall I'd give the game a 9/10, it has some janky bits and some stuff can get a little complicated and be a lot of work. Nothing quite does what Barotrauma does... it's in a box of its own in a way and has given me some of the best gaming experiences I've had (and I game to much lol).

I mostly play the campaign with bots in my crew - It really does feel like you command a submarine and you are responsible for ensuring the crew runs well and the submarine is taken care of. Whether it be issuing the right standing orders or responding to crisis or picking the mission per your sub and crew's capability or managing finances and upgrades, etc. The responsibility is fun for me!\n\nAlso drowning or having your hull breach and flooded feels scary and absolutely life threatening. \n\n- The game mechanics feel well thought out and consistent. You have unrestricted creativity on how you modify your submarine with gadgets, traps, wirings, etc. Has a bit of programming feel to it since your engineer can hook up things like motion sensor activated doors, water sensor traps, etc. \nYou can also create your own sub from scratch or edit existing ones. I have not gone deep into this aspect of the game but it is really nice that the mechanics offer this level of freedom.\n\n- Gameplay loop (campaign) of freedom to take on missions of your choice, go wherever within explained and defined world limits, upgrade or modify submarine, crew, etc, are all an amazing joy!\n\n- The sense of progression is deeply satisfying.\n\n- Game world makes me wonder about the lore thanks to different unique factions. It seems they also interact with each other as you move about the world and are influenced by your actions too with your mission choices. I will know this better as I get deeper into the campaign. \n\n\nNot recommended for below reasons :(\n\n- If you have a lot of fear for deep dark waters + horror elements.\n\n- The immersion factor of fearing for your life can be a bit much. Although once you understand the mechanics, the fear factor greatly diminishes.\n\n- Bit of a learning curve at first to understand how things work as it can feel like a lot of information thrown your way. It feels rather intuitive as you go through the tutorial and play some easy missions. \n\nOverall score if I had to give it: 9.5/10 (subjective to my perspective and biases)",

Nor does it even let you re-dock to a station without instantly failing every mission you've started. Insane that a submarine crew sandbox literally does not give you this freedom.\r\n\r\nAbsolute non existent QOL. No dedicated hotkeys for specific crew members, no default hotkey for dropping items, no hotkey for opening doors forcing you to manually click every paper thin door, ladders are incredibly inconsistent on whether you're gonna step off on the floor you want or just plummet down the shaft and break your legs. AI crew do not listen to orders at all, that mechanic manning the periscope will not fix the leak that is about to crush him no matter how many times you set his maintenance priority to the max even when yelling into his ear from two feet away.\r\n\r\nFor some reason decided to make every character physics driven so everyone flops around like the incredible crash dummies devolving combat down to who gets stun locked first. That separatist with a revolver will just ragdoll your torso completely preventing you from fighting back in any capacity.\r\n\r\nThe Sub hulls and components are made from wet tissues and will breach or breakdown by merely looking at them wrong, a single mudraptor in a blind spot will completely kill you. The really want you to carry everything all the time because everything happens so fast you will not have the time to collect your survival gear or medical supplies when you need them. There is no reason to not always be in your diving suit but they dont let you take off the helmet so you just tie it to your ankles instead.\r\n\r\nA really cool game ruined by people who have no fucking clue what they're doing and should have just kept playing Space Station 13 instead.",

The devs need to move to something better they can build off off because this game is stagnating at best and the player base is becoming toxic AF, the only way to enjoy this game anymore is with friends and that is a stretch.",

      "review": "No idea how this has so many positive reviews.\r\n\r\nCampaign is a joke with no manual saving at all, constantly forcing you to do the same busy work over and over again every mission and sit through the same 5 minutes of nothing as you travel to your destination. Nor does it even let you re-dock to a station without instantly failing every mission you've started. Insane that a submarine crew sandbox literally does not give you this freedom.\r\n\r\nAbsolute non existent QOL. No dedicated hotkeys for specific crew members, no default hotkey for dropping items, no hotkey for opening doors forcing you to manually click every paper thin door, ladders are incredibly inconsistent on whether you're gonna step off on the floor you want or just plummet down the shaft and break your legs. AI crew do not listen to orders at all, that mechanic manning the periscope will not fix the leak that is about to crush him no matter how many times you set his maintenance priority to the max even when yelling into his ear from two feet away.\r\n\r\nFor some reason decided to make every character physics driven so everyone flops around like the incredible crash dummies devolving combat down to who gets stun locked first. That separatist with a revolver will just ragdoll your torso completely preventing you from fighting back in any capacity.\r\n\r\nThe Sub hulls and components are made from wet tissues and will breach or breakdown by merely looking at them wrong, a single mudraptor in a blind spot will completely kill you. The really want you to carry everything all the time because everything happens so fast you will not have the time to collect your survival gear or medical supplies when you need them. There is no reason to not always be in your diving suit but they dont let you take off the helmet so you just tie it to your ankles instead.\r\n\r\nA really cool game ruined by people who have no fucking clue what they're doing and should have just kept playing Space Station 13 instead.",

And that lasted 8hrs...and that was 8 hours too long for a $40 game, sorry. \n\nThere's nothing at all that grabs you about this game. Not the visuals, game play, weapons, exploration...nothing. it's just as ugly as it seems in trailers. The weird \"pinwheel\" movement is so bad.....like so, so bad. EVERYTHING has a rag-doll feel. Exploration...of what? Dark caves underwater with nothing to do in the caves? That's not fun. Ohh...maybe you get too far in and get lost because your light sucks. Or maybe you 'll drown because your oxygen runs out. You literally  just drive a sub until you get attacked and breached. Then die. \n\nI'm not having any fun with this drowning simulator that has ZERO instructions, ZERO focus or direction and ZERO lore. I'll leave you with this...ask yourself if you'd give 8 playing hours to any other $40.00 game of waiting for it to finally get going. Waiting for something to happen. I'm quite sure that answer is NO.",
