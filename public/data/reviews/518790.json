Getting all achievements took me roughly 400–500 hours, if I remember correctly.\nThe devs are still actively improving the game, and they even removed the old impossible achievements. So completionists can actually get everything now.\n\nIf you enjoy beautiful open worlds and don’t mind a bit of a learning curve, this one is an easy recommendation.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3011703981",

When entering any of the maps, whether it is Medved - Taiga, Vurhonga Savannah or perhaps Silver Ridge Peaks or any other map. While playing on any map, it doesn't matter if you are in a dense snowy forest, in an open meadow, on top of a mountain or hill.\nThe game, with the help of surrounding sounds of nature, animals and other things, makes you imagine that you are really in that place. From time to time, you also realise which is your best weapon, lure and other tools for the best catch.\n\nRealistically, although I have not spent much time in this game, I would recommend it to everyone,  as the game really allows for a lot.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                 ;D",

      "review": "3/5\n\nI always had a thing for hunting games ever since I was a child simply because of how relaxing they can be. Hunter: Call of the Wild is no exception. It's a good hunting game, but there are things I don't like about it.\n\nPlaying Hunter: CotW, as a base game, feels like playing a barebone demo of the Hunter. I absolutely dislike how so many essential features that should have been there need to be bought as DLCs. Good thing is that the game is often discounted. But, even then, I feel like dogs, quads and equipment like tents should simply be there in the base game. For me, the game got really fun only when I bought myself those things and a DLC with new, more powerful rifles. I appreciate how only one person has to own the map DLC in order for people to play it in multiplayer.\n\nMaps, both base and paid ones, are good and I really like the sceneries, as well as the variety of biomes. You can easily immerse yourself in the nature, and just walking around and observing the animal life by itself feels great. Sound effects are also pretty good. Hunting feels realistic, by the way animals make shelter or go out drinking at specific timeframes, but one thing I think could be better are the animal animations. Animations on animals are really weird once they hear gunfire or once they get shot. I understand that they're supposed to be agitated but the animations are really unnatural. Draw distance is also something I find really annoying, and that goes both for objects and animals. You often spot an animal and after zooming in on it you lose sight because a random rock spawns in-between. Animals also disappear beyond a certain distance and it kind of breaks the immersion, as observing is one of the main factors in this game.\nDogs as companions are pretty bugged and often get stuck in random terrain with no option to respawn them.\n\nWhat I must mention, this game being just over 100GB is insane. I understand that by now there have been a ton of reservoirs released, but make it so players can check which one they want to have downloaded on their devices in order to save space.\n\nOverall, it's a fun and relaxing experience. Once you get your first diamond trophies you really get addicted to hunting for more. And you have an option to play with friends which can really be fun.",

The landscapes are stunning, the animal behavior feels alive, and there’s a real sense of peace in simply walking through the woods, spotting tracks, and watching wildlife in its natural habitat.\n\nThat said, there are a couple of drawbacks:\n\nAnimal Draw Distance: Animals only appear once you’re within a certain range, which breaks the immersion. It’s unfortunate because the long-distance views are gorgeous, and seeing wildlife far off would make it even more realistic.\n\n Wind Mechanics: The wind feels inconsistent and unpredictable, which can be frustrating when you’re trying to track or observe carefully.\n\nDespite those issues, the game offers an incredible experience for players like me who value the journey over the hunt. Whether you’re here to track, observe, or simply wander through breathtaking environments, Call of the Wild delivers a unique kind of relaxation and immersion.",

I myself have never been particularly interested in hunting until this year and gained interest in HCOTW. What I did not realize is just how much about hunting I could learn from this game (Animal anatomy and shot placement, biomes in which these animals live, what animals actually sound like, fur patterns, hunting techniques, etc.). The game is constantly updating and upgrading its systems to make animals look, sound and feel more realistic. My favorite feature is the TRURAC system which generates unique antlers/racks/horns on each animal loaded into a map that ensures every animal to drop will be special in its own way. Whether that be a whitetail with a gnarly drop tine rack, or a bull moose with a giant paddle on one side, and a dinky antler on the other, it adds character to each animal you cross.\r\n\r\nThe maps are gorgeous, hands down. I find myself taking screenshots of the view in this game almost equal to the animals I've claimed. From maps like the Yukon Delta in Alaska which have you hunting in gorgeous tundra plains, chalk with vibrant bushes that can quickly be covered in a snow storm. Maybe you want to hunt the Sundarpatan hunting reserve in Nepal, hunting tiger's in lush forests riddles with gorgeous flowers, before hiking up into the Himalayan's for Tahr. If bird hunting is your thing, they have maps that are packed with 10+ species of bird such as varied grouse species, pheasants, turkey, goose, duck, the list goes on. The game gets a new map every 6 months adding new animals, and locations to hunt as well!\r\n\r\nMultiplayer is a good time too for the most part. There are individuals that mod their games and bring their mods into multiplayer servers which can ruin the experience. That is nothing a quick server hop cant fix. I have personally met a few individuals in servers that I have come to call friends and still boot up to go hunt with frequently. Its a great community of individuals who are friendly, helpful, and just want that big trophy animal just like you.\r\n\r\nThe biggest gripe from many about this game is the DLC's. They have DLC for everything, (Maps, guns, equipment, lodges, etc.) While I too believe that a lot of items they have listed as DLC should just be in the game already, the Dev's are very active with the community and vocal about getting some of these DLC's just added to the game (ATV's, Dogs, Tents and Hunting stands) which is refreshing. Outside of this though, there are plenty of websites and other locations you can purchase these DLC's for LOADS cheaper (Humble Bundle is the best IMO).\r\n\r\nAll in all, if you are looking for a good game to turn the brain off, or to learn about hunting before you go out into the real world to try, you wont find a better experience that theHunter: Call of the Wild. I look forward to seeing y'all out there, and best of luck on your hunt!",

      "review": "This game is one of my favorites and one of the few recurring games that I consistently boot up. I've been playing since 2017 (on Xbox first, then Steam) and have seen the massive changes, updates, bug fixes, and care that the devs have for COTW and it impresses me.\n\nThe positives of my experience in COTW:\n• The gameplay is solid, albeit hard to get used to at first if you're someone who's only played arcade-y hunting sims before, and is just in depth enough to reward patience and skill without driving away a majority of people who can't grasp the mechanics without putting in a thousand hours. \n• The variation in animals, reserves, weapons, and more keeps me hooked and gives me the ability to switch species if I get too frustrated or bored with one. \n• The newer, more fantastical Great Ones look amazing and something I'd be proud to point out within my own lodge to visitors. I have yet to get a great one but I look forward to filling my hunting lodge with more epic trophies! \n• Dangerous species like the Tiger and Wolves really gave me a thrill like no other. I love being able to hunt things normally frowned upon or hard to hunt in real life. It's a game after all!\n• I appreciate the fact you can visit maps in multiplayer that you don't own the DLC for as it's a great way to try out maps before purchasing them.\n• The multi-mounts. They just look incredible! I'd love to see more for other species in the future, but what we have is so varied and interesting.\n\nThe only negatives I have with this game:\n• The immense amount of DLC and the price you'd have to pay to unlock it all. I understand it to a point because upkeeping an almost decade-old game isn't cheap, of course, but it's intimidated many of my friends away from the game.\n• The buggy nature of multiplayer. I used to love hunting side-by-side with my husband, but now animals spook instantly once they get within 200m of our hunting stands... I'd do anything to get online stability back so me and my husband could hunt once more and I have optimistic faith this will be addressed later on, according to recent updates from the devs. \n• Lack of customizability of themes, placements, and plaques/mounts for lodges. I want a lodge that looks like the Spring Creek Manor, but with a different layout. Sadly, you can't change the size/placement of trophy mounts, leading to funny looking tiny deer on big plaque and empty spaces because I just don't want something that big in that spot right there. A lodge should be a reflection of my style and preferences in animals and hunting interests in all respects and I believe it could be done!\n\nOverall, I recommend this game for anyone who are either casual sim players or fully invested in hunting subculture. Don't be intimidated by the DLCs, as there's plenty to do on the maps given to you before you'll feel the need to get new ones! This game is all about slowing down and patience, or if it's your thing you can go all in and get strategic with your hunting strategies. There's something for everyone and collecting them all is a challenge that keeps many coming back for more. \nI wish nothing but the best for the devs and this game that's given me so many memorable moments <3",

      "review": "游戏是好游戏，值得一玩，不过不买DLC你会很坐牢。一些非常恶心且急需优化的小细节破坏了我的游戏体验，所以我没办法给好评，什么时候官方优化了这些问题我就改成好评：\n\n1.商店UI使用体验极其糟糕，为什么每次购买子弹限制10发？就不能让玩家输入自己想买的数量吗？为什么枪械和弹药关联性这么糟糕？每次我需要给自己的枪补充弹药时，我必须在商店里面翻找很长时间，就不能直接把对应的枪械和弹药做在一个页面里面吗？\n\n2.仓库UI使用体验糟糕，缺少搜索功能，当玩家拥有几十把武器之后，你很难快速找到自己想要拿出来的那一把。\n\n3.取消河狸砍树砸毁玩家部署的建筑设定，这个设定完全打破了我的沉浸感，为什么河狸能在育空河谷砍树？这个保护区甚至没有河狸这个物种！有一次它甚至就在我眼前发生，刚刚部署了我的三脚架，然后我根本没有看到河狸，树也没有倒下，只是该死的系统弹出提示直接把我部署的建筑收回了仓库！\n\n4.部分动物的建模非常粗糙，和同类物种存在显著差距，比如夸特罗保护区的伊比利亚狼，又比如蒂阿瓦罗的梅花鹿，精细程度简直不像是同一个游戏里的动物。\n\nThis is a great game and well worth playing, but if you don't buy the DLC, you'll have a very tough experience. A few extremely annoying minor details that urgently need optimization have ruined my gameplay experience, so I cannot give a positive review. I will change it to a positive review once the developers address these issues:\n\n1. The Store UI is terrible to use. Why is the bullet purchase limit always 10 rounds? Can't you just let the player enter the quantity they want to buy? Why is the association between firearms and ammunition so poor? Every time I need to resupply my gun, I have to scroll through the store for a long time. Can't you just put the corresponding firearm and its matching ammunition on the same page?\n2. The Storage/Inventory UI is poor. It lacks a search function. When a player owns dozens of weapons, it is very difficult to quickly find the one they want to take out.\n3. Remove the setting that allows beavers to fell trees and destroy player-deployed structures. This mechanic completely breaks my immersion. Why are beavers able to fell trees in the Yukon Valley? This reserve doesn't even feature beavers as a species! It even happened right in front of me once: I had just deployed my tripod stand, but I never saw a beaver, the tree didn't actually fall, and the damn system just popped up a notification and returned my deployed structure to the warehouse!\n4. The models for some animals are very crude and show a significant quality gap compared to their counterparts. For example, the Iberian Wolf in the Cuatro Colinas reserve and the Sika Deer in Te Awaroa—the level of detail makes them look like they don't even belong in the same game.",

      "review": "I would really like to give this game a thumbs up, because this game has moments where you genuinely feel like part of a living ecosystem. You walk through the early morning fog, hear the distant call of a deer, and the entire experience feels almost meditative. Unfortunately, the moment you progress into the endgame and encounter the Great One grind mechanic, that atmosphere completely dissolves. What begins as a hunting game slowly turns into systematic map resetting and mechanical herd elimination. Not because it’s enjoyable, but because the game has no other meaningful way to reward your time.\n\nYes... The Great One is not the pinnacle of hunting mastery. It is merely the outcome of statistics. It does not matter how skilled you are, all that matters is how many times you repeat the same action. In practice, this is not hunting. It is an endless loop of teleporting from tent to tent, skipping time forward, and repeatedly shooting the same spot at a lake. The immersive hunting experience turns into a logistics routine. You are just resetting the world and waiting for RNG to finally give in.\n\nIt feels like a mechanic imported from an entirely different genre more fitting for titles like Diablo, Path of Exile, WoW or Lineage II, where spending hundreds of hours farming for a rare drop is part of the core identity of the game. The difference is that those games are built around that grind and openly embrace it. But this presents itself as a hunting game. In this context, the grind doesn’t feel like a challenge. It feels like a design flaw. A system that punishes players for trying to play authentically and forces them into repetitive behavior that goes against the spirit of the genre.\n\nAnd that is the real disappointment. There should be a better way. It should not be the result of how efficiently you can teleport around a lake. I think that this mechanic needs to be reworked so rare animals can be somehow discovered through organic gameplay rather than pure statistical repetition (And NO. I do not accept a 0.00001% chance as meaningful game design). Until that happens, this will stand as a symbol of how a visually stunning and atmospheric game can undermine itself by replacing immersion with routine.\n\n... or maybe this is exactly what it’s meant to be... a cunning way to turn a peaceful hunting game into a hamster wheel, keeping players chained to repetitive tasks just for the sake of retention? ;)",

It's a very pretty game, surely a continuation of what we had before but better, right??\n\nI can't even describe my disgust at how predatory this game is with its paid DLC, it's so shameless that I feel bad for anyone who laps it up without any reference. The fact the difficulty curve in the beginning is so great that you want to spend an extra 20$ just to start enjoying the game is obsurd.",

Force us to buy DLC maps when they should be free to download after the initial buying of the game.  I will not invest 500 buck into a game about shooting deer on medium quality maps.  Nope.  Fun to waste time on though if you can get around not having many maps to play for free.  :(",

Player movement is painfully slow, characters refuse to shut up, cars everywhere yet the only thing you can drive is locked behind a dlc - which is just one example of their predatory practices, they're anti-modding, they collect all your data while screaming \"PRIVACY!\", and you got users that defend these practices. You can play this game with your steam account but they will pester you for it. Long story short, i demanded a refund pretty quickly. If you want a good hunting game, try Way of the Hunter.

      "review": "游戏是好游戏，值得一玩，不过不买DLC你会很坐牢。一些非常恶心且急需优化的小细节破坏了我的游戏体验，所以我没办法给好评，什么时候官方优化了这些问题我就改成好评：\n\n1.商店UI使用体验极其糟糕，为什么每次购买子弹限制10发？就不能让玩家输入自己想买的数量吗？为什么枪械和弹药关联性这么糟糕？每次我需要给自己的枪补充弹药时，我必须在商店里面翻找很长时间，就不能直接把对应的枪械和弹药做在一个页面里面吗？\n\n2.仓库UI使用体验糟糕，缺少搜索功能，当玩家拥有几十把武器之后，你很难快速找到自己想要拿出来的那一把。\n\n3.取消河狸砍树砸毁玩家部署的建筑设定，这个设定完全打破了我的沉浸感，为什么河狸能在育空河谷砍树？这个保护区甚至没有河狸这个物种！有一次它甚至就在我眼前发生，刚刚部署了我的三脚架，然后我根本没有看到河狸，树也没有倒下，只是该死的系统弹出提示直接把我部署的建筑收回了仓库！\n\n4.部分动物的建模非常粗糙，和同类物种存在显著差距，比如夸特罗保护区的伊比利亚狼，又比如蒂阿瓦罗的梅花鹿，精细程度简直不像是同一个游戏里的动物。\n\nThis is a great game and well worth playing, but if you don't buy the DLC, you'll have a very tough experience. A few extremely annoying minor details that urgently need optimization have ruined my gameplay experience, so I cannot give a positive review. I will change it to a positive review once the developers address these issues:\n\n1. The Store UI is terrible to use. Why is the bullet purchase limit always 10 rounds? Can't you just let the player enter the quantity they want to buy? Why is the association between firearms and ammunition so poor? Every time I need to resupply my gun, I have to scroll through the store for a long time. Can't you just put the corresponding firearm and its matching ammunition on the same page?\n2. The Storage/Inventory UI is poor. It lacks a search function. When a player owns dozens of weapons, it is very difficult to quickly find the one they want to take out.\n3. Remove the setting that allows beavers to fell trees and destroy player-deployed structures. This mechanic completely breaks my immersion. Why are beavers able to fell trees in the Yukon Valley? This reserve doesn't even feature beavers as a species! It even happened right in front of me once: I had just deployed my tripod stand, but I never saw a beaver, the tree didn't actually fall, and the damn system just popped up a notification and returned my deployed structure to the warehouse!\n4. The models for some animals are very crude and show a significant quality gap compared to their counterparts. For example, the Iberian Wolf in the Cuatro Colinas reserve and the Sika Deer in Te Awaroa—the level of detail makes them look like they don't even belong in the same game.",

      "review": "This is probably one of the better hunting games I've ever seen; sadly, the amount of bugs prevents me from recommending this game to anyone looking for a good hunting experience. \nthis game is relatively cheap and the DLCs are also quite affordable ( if you're not looking to buy every single one  its almost 300 euro ) the bugs and glitches are gonna give you a head ache and as far as im aware the devs dont really bother or cant fix these bugs as some were in the game for a longer time. the game looks stunning you can definitely forget that you're even playing a game. This game definitely has a learning curve when you start playing. The main game arsenal is kinda lacking in my opinion. You don't really have that many options and grinding for the items is painful and takes a long time. all tho the game is playable with out DLC you're gonna get bored very fast if you're not looking to grind for rare animal skins \n\nList of things I enjoy about this game:\nYou don't need the map DLC to join it on multiplayer.\ngood soundtracks\nfun map(s) to explore\nextremely beautiful \n\n\nList of my problems with this game:\nThe animals are bugged and glitchy. \nMultiplayer is completely fucked. It barely works.\nlots of hackers \ntoo many DLCs; most of them should have been a free update instead of a DLC.\nextremely grindy if you're looking to collect rare animal skins\na lot of walking, I mean A LOT A LOT of walking\n\nin short i would probably wait for a sale to buy this game or just skip it all together if youre not sure if hunting games are for you its just to buggy to exuse the price of the game and the prioritisation of DLCs instead of fixing  bugs/ multiplayer is nodicable \n\nvery disapointing :/",

I can get in and out of cabins and ATVs, but nothing fixes it. This bug is clearly not hidden from the developers, given how often it’s discussed on forums like Reddit.\nSolution? None, except restarting the game or returning to the main menu and loading back in.\n\nIt’s been eight years.

Without it, you're stuck walking everywhere, even to objectives placed far across the map.\nThe experience quickly turns into a slow-paced hiking simulator. You're constantly trekking long distances on foot, and it drags the gameplay down to the point where it feels less like exploration and more like a walking chore.\nHonestly, I can’t recommend this game anymore. It pushes you toward areas you can’t realistically reach without the vehicle, and the core experience suffers because of it",
