After playing this I finally understand why people like this masterpiece so much, the attention to detail, the physics, the mud, all of it is in some ways better than Snowrunner.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying that Snowrunner is bad, but considering that Snowrunner is the third game in the series and didn't carry over some of the best features its older brother Mudrunner is kinda wild.\r\n\r\nFor starters in Mudrunners truck frames can bend and the suspension feels more realistic. Then there are the small details like wires attached to semi-trailers and different models for same addons depending on the trucks land of origin (russian and american vehicles have different models for fuel tanks and etc).\r\nBut most importantly then the main thing in both games, the mud, just behaves more realistically in Mudrunner. Like everywhere you go the mud is soft but not unrealistically deep and pieces of mud actually gets stuck to your tires and affects the way your vehicle drives.\r\n\r\nAll those negative reviews that say \"this game is too hard\" or \"get stuck everywhere\" are just BS, now I don't want to be disrespectful but just get better and learn the game, use some commonsense and don't just drive into a ditch with your little scout, you have to plan ahead and drive carefully (just because the road is shorter doesn't mean that it's the better way).\r\nThis game is supposed to be slow because OFFROAD IS SLOW.\r\n\r\nGotta keep in mind that the visuals are not the best but good enough and especially amazing when you consider that the entire game with the American Wilds DLC is UNDER 2 GIGS. That is FR nothing, for comparison 20 minutes of recording with your phones main camera takes about the same space.",

It has what it takes to be awesome game, but there is not enough to be done with its mechanics, which are physics BASED and NOT simulation. \r\n2. Ground effect is awesome at first, but quickly gets annoying when 95% of maps are 1m deep mud trenches. unfortunately out planet is not 95% 1m deep, wet mud and trucks are actually much better at dealing with it than within game. its really annoying to be moving 4 km/h for an hour because game is just unreasonably difficult. Artificially annoying.\r\n3. I wouldn't  complain if there was anything to do with those mechanics in game, other than to traverse low-poly terrain, which is suprisingly not ugly, and delivering logs to lumber mill. it gets really boring. \r\n4. Variety of trucks keeps it fun, but ultimately, they all work the same. For my playtine, i travelled with 10 little cars and 20 big trucks. They do drive differently, but all are equally ineffective in the only one job they have - traverse mud. Each one suffers from the same drawbacks and each one does equally bad. \r\n5. Why dafuq do you make everything a deep mud,devs? thinking people do not leave raods to be muddy when they use it for work. i know, because i work in consctrucion company. All maps are the same - no infrastructure whatsoever, and buildings but into most obscure and stupid places, which have absolutely no meaning for good operational efficiency. This irks me the most. outpost and its connections are there for a reason, not just 'because its a game, duh'.",

Am I just supposed to drive to the same muddy pile of logs that is identical on every map 100 times and deliver lumber at 5mph? I'm good on that. You get stuck in cervices all the time, theres no pedestrians, no other cars, no weather, no animals, nothing to unlock or look forward to, cant work on your truck, crappy user interface, the maps just feel depressing and empty, there's obviously no storyline or anything like Death Stranding has to keep you invested, you cant buy a garage, hire drivers and manage it like in American Truck Simulator..

      "review": "[h2]Игра для аутистов. Семьдесят часов наиграл за одно дыхание[/h2]\n\n\n\n\n[h3]Геймплей и его разнообразие[/h3]\n\nРазнообразие крайне страдает. Всё что увидите на одних из доступных карт при первом запуске игры — это будет продолжатся на всех картах. Основная задача на всех картах: загрузить грузовик брёвнами и разгрузить их на лесопилке. Побочные: открыть все вышки, разблокировать все заспавниные машинки на карте и разблокировать гаражи, что абсолютно не обязательно. Можно сыграть за одну звезду на карте, чтобы показаться крутым типа [spoiler](Звёзды — доступные очки при выборе транспорта в начале игры на карте.)[/spoiler]. Это ВСЁ, что дал разработчик и разработчики из текущей студии Runner игр.\nЛадно, что с игровым процессом? Ну, если хотите жёстко гнать по грязи, рпешить (гы) и выбирать очень нестандартные пути с точки А до точки Б — игра не даст вам ничего. Гнать на любом транспорте = зарыть себя в грязь не заметив этого, подскочить на камне и перевернуться, разбиться от веточки/камня, также физика не рассчитана на большую скорость, сразу легковая машина/тяжёлый грузовик начнёт туда-сюда вести и подпрыгивать на неровностях дороги. Разогнать свою детскую фантазию тоже не выйдет, очень мало всего. Нестандартные пути бессмысленные, потому что почему-то разраб решил добавить туда грязь чуть не из болота, ėбучįę камни и поваленные деревья да блyąдb побольше чтоб точно не прошёл или потратил вдове больше времени даже на самом крутом грузовике из постера игры. Создать себе челендж таким образом? Ну меня скорее бесило, что больше половины моих новых маршрутов больше проблем создавали и не получал удовольствие от процесса или когда проходил [i]этот[/i] участок карты.\nВ этой игре нельзя торопиться никак. Если это грунтовка или оффрод — не гони, даже на трассе нельзя. Контента очень мало и его разнообразие тоже. В этой игре нужно просто (уверен?) жать на педаль и не торопило ехать до точки Б; следя за баласом грузовика чтобы не перевернулся; следя за колёсами, чтобы не зарыться в грязи или не застрять в камнях/деревьях; следя за количеством бензина [spoiler](на симуляторе актуально это)[/spoiler], чтобы хотя бы добраться до гаража или заправки чтобы не заглохнуть по пути до лесопилки.\n\n\n\n[h3]Графика, оптимизация и арт дизайн[/h3]\n\nКрасиво, хорошо пойдёт на любом железе, [spoiler](на GTX 1650 при 2560х1600 хотелось бы 160+ фпса((( )[/spoiler], но качество теней от окружения, 2D крест на крест деревья и камни с расстояния десяти метров и подгрузка их в 3D перед носом, низкополигональная грязь и мыльные текстуры кусков грязи на колёсах, размер карты в 1км² и видимая его грань в упор в 2017 — это какой-то полный пį3дęц. Простительно для инди игры из 2014-ого, но для переиздания из 2017-ого от студии с издателем — нет. Правда иногда бывает нормально и не подгружается перед носом лоды и тени не в разрешении 128х128. Но несмотря на это бывают очень красивые кадры, что хочется всё время жать кнопку скриншота из-за фотореалистичного арт дизайна, тумана, цветокора и других эффектов и мелочей.\n\n\n\n[h3]Жалкая судьба игры[/h3]\n\nЖаль издатель мразь полная, которая из [b]Spintires[/b] превратила в конвейерную игровую серию, про машинки размазывающие грязь под колёсами.\nВ [b]MudRunner'е[/b] есть плюсы и минусы по сравнению с [b]Spintires[/b]. Обоих не так много и не такие критичные, чтобы была тряска: [i]«Искать ли мне где-то [b]Spintires[/b] или просто взять и купить [b]MudRunner[/b] напрямую в Стиме [spoiler]([b]Spintires[/b] больше не доступен в Стиме из-за дырявых авторских прав)[/spoiler]»[/i]\nБрать эту игру только по скидке, вместе с длс, вполне нормальная цена за неё. За полную цену брать её... ээээ зачем?? Подожди до очередного скидочного скама от жирного и заплатишь лишь 20% от полной стоимости.\nЕсли бы я увидел это в день релиза и имев ранее [b]Spintires[/b] в своей библиотеке игр, в нынешнем возрасте, я бы вернул деньги или не покупал и дальше играл бы в [b]Крутящиеколёса[/b].\nНегативчик поставил за повторную продажу одной и той же игры за Х2 наценку не предлагая особо ничего нового, иногда кажется что [b]Spintires[/b] имеет больше разнообразного контента чем [b]MudRunner[/b].\n\nP.S. Вес всей игры со всеми длс в 1,4 Гб убил\n\n2 — P.S. 6ЛЯDb. КАКИМ НАДО БЫТЬ ДOЛ6ОĖ6ОM, ЧТОБЫ ПРИВЯЗКА К СТИМУ БЫЛА ОБЯЗАТЕЛЬНАЯ В СИНГЛЕ.
