Even though it doesn't respect traditional rules like Dora, Seat/Prevalent Wind.  And even though it seems to have even more Yaku than usual... there's something satisfying about the ridiculously high scores you can achieve with truly cursed hands by picking your figurines and relics right.\n\nAfter a long day of getting schooled in Mahjong Soul and Riichi City, sometimes you just want to win...  On one hand, it's kinda sad taking it out on these cute waifus and lolis, but on the other hand - it's about damn time I won.

The game quickly drifts away from traditional Mahjong anyway: just like how Balatro stops feeling like real poker once you start stacking modifiers.\r\n\r\nThe art direction is fantastic (it’s tagged as “sexual content” but there’s nothing explicit), and the game is insanely addictive (did I say it's a Balatro-like ? :-) )\r\n\r\nThe character roster is crazy, just like the relics and the dolls.

I would only tell you this to understand how the game work, pick a character and look at the recommended hands. If you know riichi mahjong you have way more hands available than regular riichi mahjong (a bit like how you can make 5 of a kind in balatro).\r\nSo be sure to try a lot of stuff and if you're curious there is the entire list of hands to look at.\r\n\r\nThat's what really makes me like the game, the huge number of hands you can make alongside the big roster of characters, making every run feel different (unless you look specifically for the same combinations every time).\r\n\r\nCharacters lean toward specific patterns but you can disregard that and play what you get if you're experienced enough. One might favour full flush, another all triplets, the other use tile calls to score higher, etc but that doesn't mean you can't change how you play if you feel like it.\r\n\r\nThis is in part because of the Figurines but also because of the Spirits, both mechanics putting the rogue in roguelite. I won't detail them all but I really like the way these changes the deck of tiles and how it increases your score.\r\n\r\nEnemies are real enemies, it's not just you trying to attain a specific score to go to the next stage, often the enemies are making you adjust how you play your hands because they got a skill to harass you or a passive forcing you to play something you wouldn't otherwise. It can be hard but it feels rewarding to win against an enemy you have bad affinity with.\r\n\r\nThe game is great and I won't hide it, one major downside is the translation that feels unpolished at times. Beside that I never had a crash and bugs are fixed quickly by the devs.\r\n\r\nPlease try it if you're even slightly curious, the game has its flaws but once you are slightly vibing with it you'll be hooked.",

It was something I've wanted to try some day and when I saw this game get comparisons to Balatro I decided to take the opportunity and learn. For those who have never learned Mahjong like me, this game has a great tutorial on how to play normal Mahjong before introducing rules for its Demonic version.\n\nAfter about 11 hours of playing this game in the past several days yup I'm officially hooked.\n\nOn the surface this game looks shallow and has a bunch of anime chicks that would make any girl jealous. But when you play the game and plunge into the depths of the strategy behind tile swaps, discards, tributes and relic selection, its got a whole lot more to offer underneath.\n\nEverything is pretty well polished I would say. I'm finding it hard to list any improvements I could make while writing this review but may come back to it later after I get some more runs and hours in.\n\nIf you're still reading this review, get the game. It's easily one of tbe best sub $10 games I've ever played. In the world of roguelike deckbuilders it does to Mahjong what Dungeons & Degenerate Gamblers did to blackjack and what Balatro did to Texas Holdem Poker. Just endless hours of fun you can count on when you want to rack your brain for a bit and get a bit of adrenaline pumping from scoring big numbers. Added benefit: no real money need be lost when you lose\n\nIf I could have a few suggestions for the devs or developers, maybe add some more characters to add variety, like creatures and men. Also the song on the menu is really good. We need the ability to choose some different tracks to listen to (if its not already there). Lastly, an online PvP mode would be amazing for this game or like a draft mode where you can draft tiles to your deck would be cool and add even more replayability.\n\nThanks for making this game! I can see myself playing it for many more hours to come",

If you don't know mahjong it seems really confusing at first, but it is actually really easy to learn, so you can play this even if you never played Mahjong before.\n\nBasically the goal is to get a pairs and sets. A set is either a 3 of a kind, or 3 in a row of the same suit(so for example bamboo is a suit, 1, 2, 3 of a bamboo is a set). You always have 13 tiles in your hand, so each turn you draw some tiles and you can swap them freely with the tiles in your hand, then your opponent has a chance to draw from those left over tiles. If you use your oppenent's tiles it has to make a set, and they are locked in so you can't change your mind later.\n\nYou are always one tile short of making your last set/pair. When you have everything else you declare you are ready and then basically just draw tiles for that missing piece of the set. Every time you get one of them, you score points. The number of times you can score is capped  but can be changed with items and stuff. You get extra bonus points for special stuff, like having all of the sets be the same suit, or having a straight going across your entire hand. Though don't worry too much about that starting out. Just remember you need to get duplicates of tiles and ones that are in order. There are advanced patterns, but you can learn those as you go.",

Every character has their strengths and weaknesses and everyone has their own way to make them shine if you're lucky enough to get them where you need to be.  The farther you get, the more broken the hands become but in the later difficulties you need that kind of power.\n\nOn the technical side of things, the one thing in this build that I'm not a fan of currently is the AI voice used for English or at least I'm almost certain of it being the case.  It's as simple as changing the options in audio but I can certain criticize its inclusion.  It would just be better without it, even if it is a placeholder.\n\nOverall though, with that stated, it doesn't detract from the entire experience.  It's obvious that this game has a lot to go but this is the game that Aotenjo and the like would want to be that are trying to be the next big Balatro or deck-builder clone in the tile arena.

The animations and music keep everything flowing and fun. \r\n\r\nBefore I bought, it was hard to find this info but the entire game's text can be in English, and it looks like more voice acting will be in English as well. The onboarding is a little rough if this is your first time playing Mahjong but with so many unique hands, you may want to scroll though them and get a feel for what exists. \r\n\r\nI think it was a good choice to have the first character be focused on building full flushes and currently on a strange 7 pairs character -- they all have their gimmicks and seem diverse enough.

On one hand, it's kinda sad taking it out on these cute waifus and lolis, but on the other hand - it's about damn time I won.

I would only tell you this to understand how the game work, pick a character and look at the recommended hands. If you know riichi mahjong you have way more hands available than regular riichi mahjong (a bit like how you can make 5 of a kind in balatro).\r\nSo be sure to try a lot of stuff and if you're curious there is the entire list of hands to look at.\r\n\r\nThat's what really makes me like the game, the huge number of hands you can make alongside the big roster of characters, making every run feel different (unless you look specifically for the same combinations every time).\r\n\r\nCharacters lean toward specific patterns but you can disregard that and play what you get if you're experienced enough. One might favour full flush, another all triplets, the other use tile calls to score higher, etc but that doesn't mean you can't change how you play if you feel like it.\r\n\r\nThis is in part because of the Figurines but also because of the Spirits, both mechanics putting the rogue in roguelite. I won't detail them all but I really like the way these changes the deck of tiles and how it increases your score.\r\n\r\nEnemies are real enemies, it's not just you trying to attain a specific score to go to the next stage, often the enemies are making you adjust how you play your hands because they got a skill to harass you or a passive forcing you to play something you wouldn't otherwise. It can be hard but it feels rewarding to win against an enemy you have bad affinity with.\r\n\r\nThe game is great and I won't hide it, one major downside is the translation that feels unpolished at times. Beside that I never had a crash and bugs are fixed quickly by the devs.\r\n\r\nPlease try it if you're even slightly curious, the game has its flaws but once you are slightly vibing with it you'll be hooked.",

It was something I've wanted to try some day and when I saw this game get comparisons to Balatro I decided to take the opportunity and learn. For those who have never learned Mahjong like me, this game has a great tutorial on how to play normal Mahjong before introducing rules for its Demonic version.\n\nAfter about 11 hours of playing this game in the past several days yup I'm officially hooked.\n\nOn the surface this game looks shallow and has a bunch of anime chicks that would make any girl jealous. But when you play the game and plunge into the depths of the strategy behind tile swaps, discards, tributes and relic selection, its got a whole lot more to offer underneath.\n\nEverything is pretty well polished I would say. I'm finding it hard to list any improvements I could make while writing this review but may come back to it later after I get some more runs and hours in.\n\nIf you're still reading this review, get the game. It's easily one of tbe best sub $10 games I've ever played. In the world of roguelike deckbuilders it does to Mahjong what Dungeons & Degenerate Gamblers did to blackjack and what Balatro did to Texas Holdem Poker. Just endless hours of fun you can count on when you want to rack your brain for a bit and get a bit of adrenaline pumping from scoring big numbers. Added benefit: no real money need be lost when you lose\n\nIf I could have a few suggestions for the devs or developers, maybe add some more characters to add variety, like creatures and men. Also the song on the menu is really good. We need the ability to choose some different tracks to listen to (if its not already there). Lastly, an online PvP mode would be amazing for this game or like a draft mode where you can draft tiles to your deck would be cool and add even more replayability.\n\nThanks for making this game!

      "review": "Demonic Mahjong is another game that follows the steps of Balatro but instead of simply going for the same gambling roguelike idea, it pushes the formula forward by creating a new experience while staying true to the core of what made Balatro so enjoyable.\n\nInstead of poker, you're playing Chinese Mahjong. Much like Balatro, you don't have to know Mahjong to play this game but being familiar with it certainly helps as the skill floor of Mahjong is a bit higher and this game makes it worse with the sheer amount of mechanics and different hand combinations.\n\nInstead of facing a faceless enemy and trying to beat a specific score, here you're facing different opponents, each with their own playstyles and tools to hinder you. Not only that but the score to beat is not set in stone, it is based on much the opponent can score themselves, making each encounter far more interesting overall.\n\nThis game also offers a wider variety of builds. Unlike decks in Balatro, here you get to pick your own character and each character favors a playstyle or hands they wanna work towards to. For example, the starting character aims for a specific symbol so the favored hand combinations are about having tiles of the same symbol. My personal favorite character aims for pairs, you get the idea.\nYour characters also different skills you can activate while in a match to give you a hand on getting the combinations you need.\n\nBUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!\n\nYou have a variety of items that gives you permanent buffs and consumables, some of them can be pretty damn busted so the game really encourages you to break the charts and get scores up to the millions (as you can see in the store page). Oh, I almost forgot that you ALSO have tile modifiers, you can increase their score value, change their numbers, symbols and add other effects much like you can do to cards in Balatro.\n\nHowever, while the core gameplay of the game is pretty much perfect imo, the game is not free of a general lack of polish.\nAnimations are rough around the edges, some characters don't even have facial animations, the VA is lackluster and doesn't match the animations, audio balance is all over the place, there are still some text errors that can be found and the description of items can be very confusing.\nNot a deal breaker for me but I know this lack of polish and \"clunkiness\" may diminish your experience and make the game less enjoyable so be wary of that.\n\nOverall, great game that improves and does something unique with the Balatro formula.",

This game is like Balatro with Chinese element, Mahjong, and it is much better than Balatro, there are multiple elements to enhance a run: \nWithin a match: tribute, character skill\nInside a run: figurine, relic, tiles(2 different enhancement).\nOutside a run: talent, character level\n\nFor each run, player can select a character to assist your run, their character skill will greatly affect how you modify tiles, get what relic, figurine during the run, so it is important, and player can permanent upgrade character to increase the character strength.\n\nFigurine is like jokers in Balatro, however, you can disable them by putting some of them in the storage, so you are able to change your build dynamically to deal with different enemy.\n\nRelic is something that permanent affect this run, they are weaker than figurine, but they do not have slot limitation, so keep collect those good for your run.\n\nTiles have 2 different way to enhance, ghost and plating, similar to Balatro, but it is more fun and more strategy due to the a lot of patterns can be fulfill within the same time, so it is important to make use of both elements.\n\nThe game system is well balanced, there are some figurine quite strong when have a right character skills, rarity is not everything, with good strategy, and a bit luck, can won most of the enemy. And difficulty options are made so good, easy mode is really easy to complete, while each level is start to require more from the user, need to make use of different elements to win a game.\n\nThe game system is very user-friendly, user can play even without no Mahjong knowledge, it got a short tutorial introduce the basic Mahjong gameplay, and the basic difficulty level can treated as a introduction for the entire game mechanics. The game also provide guides on different characters' special ability, and which patterns have higher fan, the game separate different patterns with filters, which is beginner friendly. \n\nOnce your tiles can form a pattern for \"Hu\", the game also tells you how many fans will get for tiles you can \"Hu\", and corresponding number of tiles left that not yet draw. Therefore user don't have to calculate fans, checking tiles left, only focus on the game itself, which is make a pattern with higher fan, and \"Hu\" as much as possible within a match.\n\nTo sum up, I really recommend playing this game due to its good design on those elements to enhance a run, good difficulty slope and the game system is user-friendly for beginners.\n\np.s. the character also quite cute, music is also good",

If you don't know mahjong it seems really confusing at first, but it is actually really easy to learn, so you can play this even if you never played Mahjong before.\n\nBasically the goal is to get a pairs and sets. A set is either a 3 of a kind, or 3 in a row of the same suit(so for example bamboo is a suit, 1, 2, 3 of a bamboo is a set). You always have 13 tiles in your hand, so each turn you draw some tiles and you can swap them freely with the tiles in your hand, then your opponent has a chance to draw from those left over tiles. If you use your oppenent's tiles it has to make a set, and they are locked in so you can't change your mind later.\n\nYou are always one tile short of making your last set/pair. When you have everything else you declare you are ready and then basically just draw tiles for that missing piece of the set. Every time you get one of them, you score points. The number of times you can score is capped  but can be changed with items and stuff. You get extra bonus points for special stuff, like having all of the sets be the same suit, or having a straight going across your entire hand. Though don't worry too much about that starting out.

      "review": "I'm torn. The concept seems brilliant, Mahjong / Balatro / Slay the Spire, there is a lot of potential here. But I'm disappointed with the execution and gameplay balance, as they end up promoting boring, trivial strategies far too much for each run to feel unique.\n\nThe game is loosely based on the Riichi ruleset, which makes it approachable. Of course, there are various exceptions that make the game work in the context of two players, like you also draw four tiles at a time and discard four. There is also a giant collection of fun yaku, such as dragons-only chitoitsu or 13 copies of the same tile, which are fun to build. It's fun when you get them for the first time, but afterwards all the game has to offer are just ever-increasing points multipliers.\n\nI've played six different characters (intended to promote completely different playstyles) across five difficulty levels, and not once found the intended playstyle worthwhile. Sticking to [spoiler]tsuiisou + suuankou + daisangen/daisuushii[/spoiler] is a much safer bet, as they easily [spoiler]combine into multi-yakumans. If you pay even a little attention to the choice of items & relics on each run, you can also reliably score what this game calls a \"tenhou\" but is actually a double riichi (a one-turn-kill, in a way)[/spoiler].\n\nThis approach removed the need for any strategic mindset in my runs. But there's more:\n\n[list]\n [*]There is little reason to defend at all. No only furiten does not apply, but also the game does not end on a ron, so you don't need to win first.

      "review": "I'm torn. The concept seems brilliant, Mahjong / Balatro / Slay the Spire, there is a lot of potential here. But I'm disappointed with the execution and gameplay balance, as they end up promoting boring, trivial strategies far too much for each run to feel unique.\n\nThe game is loosely based on the Riichi ruleset, which makes it approachable. Of course, there are various exceptions that make the game work in the context of two players, like you also draw four tiles at a time and discard four. There is also a giant collection of fun yaku, such as dragons-only chitoitsu or 13 copies of the same tile, which are fun to build. It's fun when you get them for the first time, but afterwards all the game has to offer are just ever-increasing points multipliers.\n\nI've played six different characters (intended to promote completely different playstyles) across five difficulty levels, and not once found the intended playstyle worthwhile. Sticking to [spoiler]tsuiisou + suuankou + daisangen/daisuushii[/spoiler] is a much safer bet, as they easily [spoiler]combine into multi-yakumans. If you pay even a little attention to the choice of items & relics on each run, you can also reliably score what this game calls a \"tenhou\" but is actually a double riichi (a one-turn-kill, in a way)[/spoiler].\n\nThis approach removed the need for any strategic mindset in my runs. But there's more:\n\n[list]\n [*]There is little reason to defend at all. No only furiten does not apply, but also the game does not end on a ron, so you don't need to win first. Just focus on scoring lots of points and you can pretty much ignore the opponent.\n [*]There is no dora to cause round-to-round asymmetries.\n [*]Harder waits don't offer greater rewards. Suuankou tanki is worth as much as a regular suuankou. Why bother gambling like a jackass then? There is no fu either, so even on simpler hands it never pays off to play something irregular.\n [*]Opponents come with their unique skills which I'm supposed to watch out for, but only very few matter at all, and none can stop me from just collecting honors.\n [*]The game consistently offers to little or too much control over tile modifiers (which you accumulate throughout each run).
