Начинаешь с банального тапинга, но очень быстро открываешь кучу улучшений, престижей и новых механик.\n\nГрафика пиксельная, но приятная глазу, а музыка ненавязчивая и хорошо подходит к игровому процессу. Что действительно цепляет – это ощущение постоянного прогресса. Даже когда кажется, что достиг потолка, всегда есть возможность улучшить что-то ещё, открыть новое умение или перейти на следующий уровень сложности.\n\nРегулярные обновления с новым контентом поддерживают интерес к игре на долгое время. Большой плюс – это активное и дружелюбное сообщество, всегда готовое помочь советом.\n\nМинусы? Пожалуй, иногда бывает ощутим гринд, и некоторые механики не сразу становятся понятными. Но в целом, Idle Slayer – это отличный выбор для тех, кто ищет ненавязчивую, но затягивающую игру, в которой можно расслабиться и наблюдать за ростом своей могущественной армии одного героя.

I have at the time of posting this 46 hours play time (just on Steam, not including the mobile app) and I don't even have half of the achievements which makes me believe I'm not even half way through the entire game. definitely recommend this game if you like idle games. if idle games aren't your forte then this game could still be fun for you as while it's open it's like an automatic 2D side scroller where you still control your character.",

Plus, making decisions that “might” slow you down adds a philosophical layer—sometimes being dumb is the smartest move. 10/10, I’ve never looked this good while grinding monsters.",

Every upgrade feels like it matters, and there’s always something new for me to unlock. What I really love is that the game doesn’t force ads onto you; anything that shows an ad is completely optional and doesn’t hold back your progress if you don’t do it. It’s one of those games you can leave running and check back on, or sit down and actively play for a while and still feel rewarded either way. It’s super addictive, relaxing, and keeps surprising me even after all this time. Highly recommend if you enjoy idle games with depth and no pressure.",

I had originally played this game in 2019 to get all of the achievements but then Plab (The dev) just kept adding new achievements, and new equipment requiring you to spend more time which once you reach a certain point and think you have done it all boom heres more achievements. There is 3 minigames which seems like a lot for an idle game. It’s super grindy for an idle game especially early game because of all the quests. You end up having to play actively a lot just to progress which is ok for a degen like me but for 90% of the player base, they will quit before even getting the spear (an upgrade) and too much stuff is locked behind achievements, and some of them are rng to get. To be able to get to the endgame you have to complete quest bundles which can be done idle but the giant quests feel slow.\n\nThe positives: The game is very casual if you want it to be. The game is fun to play if you have adhd or hyper fixation. The game is chill to have in the background but you still have to actively be playing. The game is fair for free to play players requiring you to do daily quests, yeah thats about it.\n\nThe negatives: I would not recommend the game for the story/community. This feels like its meant to be a singleplayer experience and once you experience an ascension. IT IS VERY REPETITIVE. The game is being updated every few months and the new updates impact the endgame requiring more unnecessary ultra ascensions (Restarting the game but you keep some upgrades) making achievement hunters like me feel forced to play. I also don't like how rng equipment can be which is optional but it doesn't feel optional when trying to min max. Plab if you read this pls stop adding steam achievements.\n\nHow I would improve the experience would be making minigames always give an equipment chest. Auto jump so instead of having to actively play I can actually have the game open and do minigames on my own time without having to wait for one to show up. Give more uses for divinity points I have at least 10k+ and I can't really use them on my endgame gear without having it too high levelled. I made an mid-game build and still have leftover divinity. Make ultra ascension quests faster. They should not be the original value or at least give me some upgrades that lowers the quests so I can get back to where I am faster. Remove grapple run it sucks.\n\nThe dev isn’t a fan of mods/scripts which for an idle game doesn't make any sense to spend time on. You can get jewels (the premium currency) by doing daily missions which I can appreciate. But yes it is pay to skip if you don't have patience. There is more I could talk about but I want to keep this review shortish. Play it if you want but do not attempt to 100% unless you are crazy.",

It requires active play for a lot of it, it has these irritating challenge levels through portals. The challenge levels are the same levels every time... To the point that I just avoid the portals now.\n\nIt tried to foist some kind of story on me, which was just a ton of unskippable dialogue. Game, I can read quickly, I don't need this slow text, let people skip it.\n\nYou need to gather souls to get the prestige bonus, they're insanely slow...\nEverything in this game, just feels so god damn slow.\n\nAnd there's a reason for that.\n\nYou'll see an asterisk by free up there. That's because this is a freemium game. I first saw this game on mobile and had even less interest in it then. This game has a TON of microtransactions, the most expensive pack of gems being over 70 quid. So the cost for a new AAA game, to get gems on this crappy mobile game? \"Free\"\nPersonally, I don't fall for these anymore, I used to a bit, but grew out of it. Thankfully. But there are a lot of people that fall victim to these games and they're designed to prey specifically on these people. \n\nDo not buy this. I don't only recommend against it, I strongly recommend against even trying this. Especially if you're the kind of person that is prey for that kind of monetisation.\n\nI recommend against providing developers like this any profit for these predatory monetisation systems.\n\nFinally... most games that are freemium... are at least fun for the beginning. To give you a taste of how amazing it is when you have the microtransactions... This one isn't. It's boring all the time. It starts off grindy.\nYou can buy all the best upgrades for gold making.... it won't matter, you're still not getting very many souls, so you can't get the prestige bonuses.\nNeed to get rubies for a quest?

      "review": "Why do you keep add active gameplay stuff and among other things those activities have miserable rewards in coins and souls?\n\nThe reason why we play this game its because it plays itself and the only thing we need to do is (was) to buy upgrades. \nNOW when i open the game i get spammed with all those active gameplay mini-games, spammed all the time that i dont want to open the game anymore. \n\nYes, i know you can disable mini-games, but they are mandatory to complete daily and sometimes weelky quests. \nSo what should i do, spend divinity points to constantly swap between divinities to enable and disable them everyday when a quest to complete a minigame appears? Its insane.\n\nThose minigames are enjoyable for some hours. but as you can see i have 1574 hours right now and its exhausting making those minigames over and over again whenever i open the game. \nThey are too much frequent and give too poor rewards. \n\nAlso, in all my hours i managed to get only a few excellent gear items and they are not even among the best stats options right there. \nEverything is becoming so exhausting.\n\nThe end game right now is:\n- spend point in the perfect stone of time build with 32 points on idle and pretty much the rest on hope. \n- close the game\n- wait hours/days\n- open the game\n- claim everything\n- upgrade if you can\n- close the game\n- repeat\n\nthis is it right now. \nAnd when you keep the game opened, while for example watching a movie to complete daily and weekly quests, those mini-games are spammed over and over again requiring your attention to complete them or die to close and let the character running. And i repeat, they are mandatory, not only to complete quests but because they [strike] drop [/strike] should drop excellent gear.\n\nAnd yet another active minigame has been added when you are like spiderman destroing blocks to do it in time (completed all of them under 2m 10s and claimed all rewards in 3 tries), and now i get that minigame spammed among others.\n\nNow, if i leave the review like this looks like a complain and nothing else. But i do complain because i [strike] love [/strike] loved this game and i dont like the direction it is taking. \nSo this is what, according to me, should be done to make it better:\n- Remove daily and weekly quests that requires to complete active gameplay minigames\n- Chance to get excellent + bonus gears should be higher a little. I don't want it to be super easy to obtain, but i dont want either to play 1600 hours and only got 10 excellent gear items including double ones and gear without options.\n- Balance the active gameplay with the passive gameplay. Right now playing active is not rewarding at all. I dont want the passive gameplay to be debuffed but i want the active to be buffed. Every activity i do in active gameplay even with changed stones of time are much less rewarding than closing the game and let it sit there for days with 32 points in stone of idle. I remember there was a period where active gameplay was enjoyable, you could have stack bonuses then when a minigame (much more rare at that time) like the chest with mimics one appeared you could have obtain A LOT to boost your game. Happened to me only once back then and i calculated i saved more than 30 days of active \"normal \" gameplay. It was cool and rewarding. Since the stone of idle is the best way to progress, things like that haven't happened to me anymore.\nHonestly i would \"merge\" the past active gameplay with the idle gameplay we got today. So it is rewarding both when the game is closed and when you open it to do weekly and daily quests.\n\nLast thing. I do 1400fps with v-sync on (that uncap the fps in this game) with my rtx 5080 but yet, when i spam arrows with wind dash and parallel shot skill from bow it drops to 240fps. That's clearly an optimization issue that should be fixed. In my old laptop with gtx1650 it goes from 200+fps to even 12fps under the same conditions.",

They demand a very valuable resource - time.  So I believe in judging these games very critically.\r\n\r\nProgress is made by inches.  I am not new to the genre so I am used to very slow progression.  But the inches this game makes are few and far in between.  I cant think of a single upgrade alone that made me feel like I made a ton of progress.  Despite idle being in the name the amount of progress you make while doing anything idle is laughable.  And the most egregious, and a big part why this review is negative, is there are very long grinds for rewards that give nothing.  Yes, nothing.\r\n\r\nKill 3000+ of a specific enemy to evolve it into a different color.  You get nothing extra, at least anything that is noticeable, from these newly colored enemies.  And there are several of these grinds.  Kill X Y times to get nothing except the ability to go back and kill the newly colored monster even more times for likely nothing.  It's very rare I have had an idle game give me a task to complete where the reward is actually nothing.  A total disrespect of time, which as I stated, is a valuable resource this game is demanding.\r\n\r\nIt wouldn't be so bad if it pulled this trick a few times.  But it's an ongoing gimmick.  I don't want to harp on this issue much longer.  But it's a slap in the face to ask folks to perform multi day lasting tasks for nothing.\r\n\r\nThere is something called a \"super\" ascension where you do nearly a full reset to unlock more branches to the ascension tree.  I really wanted to wait before I posted my review until I done one of these.  I wanted to see if there was anything new that would drastically increase progress in the early game.  To see how disrespectful the game could be.  But even at nearly 100 hours in a feel like I am pretty far off from this.  And I don't know how much more of the game I am willing to grind out.  I am at a weird wall where the game is asking me to kill 10,000 things for an upgrade that I know won't make a bit of difference and everything on the ascension tree that would be a meaningful upgrade demands a resource that would take me multiple days.  And when I say meaningful I also mean marginal.  This part wasn't really to complain but just say where I am at with the game and that I won't likely reach my goals.\r\n\r\nAnd while I may seem like I am complaining about how grindy the progression is that really is not the case.  I have hundreds of thousands of hours in the genre over many games.  I am no stranger to it.  But the amount of very grind heavy tasks the game asks you to do for 0 reward in comparison to it's contemporaries is horrifying.",

I had originally played this game in 2019 to get all of the achievements but then Plab (The dev) just kept adding new achievements, and new equipment requiring you to spend more time which once you reach a certain point and think you have done it all boom heres more achievements. There is 3 minigames which seems like a lot for an idle game. It’s super grindy for an idle game especially early game because of all the quests. You end up having to play actively a lot just to progress which is ok for a degen like me but for 90% of the player base, they will quit before even getting the spear (an upgrade) and too much stuff is locked behind achievements, and some of them are rng to get. To be able to get to the endgame you have to complete quest bundles which can be done idle but the giant quests feel slow.\n\nThe positives: The game is very casual if you want it to be. The game is fun to play if you have adhd or hyper fixation. The game is chill to have in the background but you still have to actively be playing. The game is fair for free to play players requiring you to do daily quests, yeah thats about it.\n\nThe negatives: I would not recommend the game for the story/community. This feels like its meant to be a singleplayer experience and once you experience an ascension. IT IS VERY REPETITIVE. The game is being updated every few months and the new updates impact the endgame requiring more unnecessary ultra ascensions (Restarting the game but you keep some upgrades) making achievement hunters like me feel forced to play. I also don't like how rng equipment can be which is optional but it doesn't feel optional when trying to min max. Plab if you read this pls stop adding steam achievements.\n\nHow I would improve the experience would be making minigames always give an equipment chest. Auto jump so instead of having to actively play I can actually have the game open and do minigames on my own time without having to wait for one to show up. Give more uses for divinity points I have at least 10k+ and I can't really use them on my endgame gear without having it too high levelled. I made an mid-game build and still have leftover divinity. Make ultra ascension quests faster. They should not be the original value or at least give me some upgrades that lowers the quests so I can get back to where I am faster. Remove grapple run it sucks.\n\nThe dev isn’t a fan of mods/scripts which for an idle game doesn't make any sense to spend time on. You can get jewels (the premium currency) by doing daily missions which I can appreciate. But yes it is pay to skip if you don't have patience. There is more I could talk about but I want to keep this review shortish. Play it if you want but do not attempt to 100% unless you are crazy.",

Doesn't matter if you complete it, Pablo will just hit you with even more achievements instead of making another game. Don't waste your time on it, it's completely false advertising. \n\nI'm too many hours and achievements deep to stop now. Don't make the same mistake I did. Go play: Kiwi Clicker, Cornerpond, Idle Waters, How To Train Your C*ck or Desktop Cat Cafe.

It requires active play for a lot of it, it has these irritating challenge levels through portals. The challenge levels are the same levels every time... To the point that I just avoid the portals now.\n\nIt tried to foist some kind of story on me, which was just a ton of unskippable dialogue. Game, I can read quickly, I don't need this slow text, let people skip it.\n\nYou need to gather souls to get the prestige bonus, they're insanely slow...\nEverything in this game, just feels so god damn slow.\n\nAnd there's a reason for that.\n\nYou'll see an asterisk by free up there. That's because this is a freemium game. I first saw this game on mobile and had even less interest in it then. This game has a TON of microtransactions, the most expensive pack of gems being over 70 quid. So the cost for a new AAA game, to get gems on this crappy mobile game? \"Free\"\nPersonally, I don't fall for these anymore, I used to a bit, but grew out of it. Thankfully. But there are a lot of people that fall victim to these games and they're designed to prey specifically on these people. \n\nDo not buy this. I don't only recommend against it, I strongly recommend against even trying this. Especially if you're the kind of person that is prey for that kind of monetisation.\n\nI recommend against providing developers like this any profit for these predatory monetisation systems.\n\nFinally... most games that are freemium... are at least fun for the beginning. To give you a taste of how amazing it is when you have the microtransactions... This one isn't. It's boring all the time. It starts off grindy.\nYou can buy all the best upgrades for gold making.... it won't matter, you're still not getting very many souls, so you can't get the prestige bonuses.\nNeed to get rubies for a quest? Good luck, it's going to take you about a week. Definitely take the correct path through the tree, else maybe two weeks.\n\nDon't play this game, waste your time elsewhere.",

      "review": "Why do you keep add active gameplay stuff and among other things those activities have miserable rewards in coins and souls?\n\nThe reason why we play this game its because it plays itself and the only thing we need to do is (was) to buy upgrades. \nNOW when i open the game i get spammed with all those active gameplay mini-games, spammed all the time that i dont want to open the game anymore. \n\nYes, i know you can disable mini-games, but they are mandatory to complete daily and sometimes weelky quests. \nSo what should i do, spend divinity points to constantly swap between divinities to enable and disable them everyday when a quest to complete a minigame appears? Its insane.\n\nThose minigames are enjoyable for some hours. but as you can see i have 1574 hours right now and its exhausting making those minigames over and over again whenever i open the game. \nThey are too much frequent and give too poor rewards. \n\nAlso, in all my hours i managed to get only a few excellent gear items and they are not even among the best stats options right there. \nEverything is becoming so exhausting.\n\nThe end game right now is:\n- spend point in the perfect stone of time build with 32 points on idle and pretty much the rest on hope. \n- close the game\n- wait hours/days\n- open the game\n- claim everything\n- upgrade if you can\n- close the game\n- repeat\n\nthis is it right now. \nAnd when you keep the game opened, while for example watching a movie to complete daily and weekly quests, those mini-games are spammed over and over again requiring your attention to complete them or die to close and let the character running. And i repeat, they are mandatory, not only to complete quests but because they [strike] drop [/strike] should drop excellent gear.\n\nAnd yet another active minigame has been added when you are like spiderman destroing blocks to do it in time (completed all of them under 2m 10s and claimed all rewards in 3 tries), and now i get that minigame spammed among others.\n\nNow, if i leave the review like this looks like a complain and nothing else. But i do complain because i [strike] love [/strike] loved this game and i dont like the direction it is taking. \nSo this is what, according to me, should be done to make it better:\n- Remove daily and weekly quests that requires to complete active gameplay minigames\n- Chance to get excellent + bonus gears should be higher a little. I don't want it to be super easy to obtain, but i dont want either to play 1600 hours and only got 10 excellent gear items including double ones and gear without options.\n- Balance the active gameplay with the passive gameplay. Right now playing active is not rewarding at all. I dont want the passive gameplay to be debuffed but i want the active to be buffed. Every activity i do in active gameplay even with changed stones of time are much less rewarding than closing the game and let it sit there for days with 32 points in stone of idle. I remember there was a period where active gameplay was enjoyable, you could have stack bonuses then when a minigame (much more rare at that time) like the chest with mimics one appeared you could have obtain A LOT to boost your game. Happened to me only once back then and i calculated i saved more than 30 days of active \"normal \" gameplay. It was cool and rewarding. Since the stone of idle is the best way to progress, things like that haven't happened to me anymore.\nHonestly i would \"merge\" the past active gameplay with the idle gameplay we got today. So it is rewarding both when the game is closed and when you open it to do weekly and daily quests.\n\nLast thing. I do 1400fps with v-sync on (that uncap the fps in this game) with my rtx 5080 but yet, when i spam arrows with wind dash and parallel shot skill from bow it drops to 240fps. That's clearly an optimization issue that should be fixed. In my old laptop with gtx1650 it goes from 200+fps to even 12fps under the same conditions.",

They demand a very valuable resource - time.  So I believe in judging these games very critically.\r\n\r\nProgress is made by inches.  I am not new to the genre so I am used to very slow progression.  But the inches this game makes are few and far in between.  I cant think of a single upgrade alone that made me feel like I made a ton of progress.  Despite idle being in the name the amount of progress you make while doing anything idle is laughable.  And the most egregious, and a big part why this review is negative, is there are very long grinds for rewards that give nothing.  Yes, nothing.\r\n\r\nKill 3000+ of a specific enemy to evolve it into a different color.  You get nothing extra, at least anything that is noticeable, from these newly colored enemies.  And there are several of these grinds.  Kill X Y times to get nothing except the ability to go back and kill the newly colored monster even more times for likely nothing.  It's very rare I have had an idle game give me a task to complete where the reward is actually nothing.  A total disrespect of time, which as I stated, is a valuable resource this game is demanding.\r\n\r\nIt wouldn't be so bad if it pulled this trick a few times.  But it's an ongoing gimmick.  I don't want to harp on this issue much longer.  But it's a slap in the face to ask folks to perform multi day lasting tasks for nothing.\r\n\r\nThere is something called a \"super\" ascension where you do nearly a full reset to unlock more branches to the ascension tree.  I really wanted to wait before I posted my review until I done one of these.  I wanted to see if there was anything new that would drastically increase progress in the early game.  To see how disrespectful the game could be.  But even at nearly 100 hours in a feel like I am pretty far off from this.  And I don't know how much more of the game I am willing to grind out.  I am at a weird wall where the game is asking me to kill 10,000 things for an upgrade that I know won't make a bit of difference and everything on the ascension tree that would be a meaningful upgrade demands a resource that would take me multiple days.  And when I say meaningful I also mean marginal.  This part wasn't really to complain but just say where I am at with the game and that I won't likely reach my goals.\r\n\r\nAnd while I may seem like I am complaining about how grindy the progression is that really is not the case.  I have hundreds of thousands of hours in the genre over many games.  I am no stranger to it.  But the amount of very grind heavy tasks the game asks you to do for 0 reward in comparison to it's contemporaries is horrifying.",

      "review": "[h1]Review after 100%[/h1]\n\nHot take but after 2500 hours I don't recommend this game. I had originally played this game in 2019 to get all of the achievements but then Plab (The dev) just kept adding new achievements, and new equipment requiring you to spend more time which once you reach a certain point and think you have done it all boom heres more achievements. There is 3 minigames which seems like a lot for an idle game. It’s super grindy for an idle game especially early game because of all the quests. You end up having to play actively a lot just to progress which is ok for a degen like me but for 90% of the player base, they will quit before even getting the spear (an upgrade) and too much stuff is locked behind achievements, and some of them are rng to get. To be able to get to the endgame you have to complete quest bundles which can be done idle but the giant quests feel slow.\n\nThe positives: The game is very casual if you want it to be. The game is fun to play if you have adhd or hyper fixation. The game is chill to have in the background but you still have to actively be playing. The game is fair for free to play players requiring you to do daily quests, yeah thats about it.\n\nThe negatives: I would not recommend the game for the story/community. This feels like its meant to be a singleplayer experience and once you experience an ascension. IT IS VERY REPETITIVE. The game is being updated every few months and the new updates impact the endgame requiring more unnecessary ultra ascensions (Restarting the game but you keep some upgrades) making achievement hunters like me feel forced to play. I also don't like how rng equipment can be which is optional but it doesn't feel optional when trying to min max. Plab if you read this pls stop adding steam achievements.\n\nHow I would improve the experience would be making minigames always give an equipment chest. Auto jump so instead of having to actively play I can actually have the game open and do minigames on my own time without having to wait for one to show up. Give more uses for divinity points I have at least 10k+ and I can't really use them on my endgame gear without having it too high levelled. I made an mid-game build and still have leftover divinity. Make ultra ascension quests faster. They should not be the original value or at least give me some upgrades that lowers the quests so I can get back to where I am faster. Remove grapple run it sucks.\n\nThe dev isn’t a fan of mods/scripts which for an idle game doesn't make any sense to spend time on. You can get jewels (the premium currency) by doing daily missions which I can appreciate. But yes it is pay to skip if you don't have patience. There is more I could talk about but I want to keep this review shortish. Play it if you want but do not attempt to 100% unless you are crazy.",

This game requires just as much time and involvement as any other non-idle game, coming close to the same time investment as frigon MMO's, and it is designed in a way were you either spend a literal year playing it, or cough up $60+ for a freemium currency to skip most of it. Doesn't matter if you complete it, Pablo will just hit you with even more achievements instead of making another game. Don't waste your time on it, it's completely false advertising. \n\nI'm too many hours and achievements deep to stop now. Don't make the same mistake I did. Go play: Kiwi Clicker, Cornerpond, Idle Waters, How To Train Your C*ck or Desktop Cat Cafe. There's more I haven't named, but these games will respect your time and wont lie to you about their idle nature like this one does. Kiwi is a bit involved, but it doesn't overstay its welcome like this hot garbage. It'll take you a month to complete that, not \"a year+ whatever the dev tacks on by the time you get there\".\n\nMake another game, Pablo. This is a bloated mess.",

      "review": "I want to recommend this... I mean it's technically free*, it's hard to recommend against it.\n\nBut it just feels so grindy. It requires active play for a lot of it, it has these irritating challenge levels through portals. The challenge levels are the same levels every time... To the point that I just avoid the portals now.\n\nIt tried to foist some kind of story on me, which was just a ton of unskippable dialogue. Game, I can read quickly, I don't need this slow text, let people skip it.\n\nYou need to gather souls to get the prestige bonus, they're insanely slow...\nEverything in this game, just feels so god damn slow.\n\nAnd there's a reason for that.\n\nYou'll see an asterisk by free up there. That's because this is a freemium game. I first saw this game on mobile and had even less interest in it then. This game has a TON of microtransactions, the most expensive pack of gems being over 70 quid. So the cost for a new AAA game, to get gems on this crappy mobile game? \"Free\"\nPersonally, I don't fall for these anymore, I used to a bit, but grew out of it. Thankfully. But there are a lot of people that fall victim to these games and they're designed to prey specifically on these people. \n\nDo not buy this. I don't only recommend against it, I strongly recommend against even trying this. Especially if you're the kind of person that is prey for that kind of monetisation.\n\nI recommend against providing developers like this any profit for these predatory monetisation systems.\n\nFinally... most games that are freemium... are at least fun for the beginning. To give you a taste of how amazing it is when you have the microtransactions... This one isn't. It's boring all the time. It starts off grindy.\nYou can buy all the best upgrades for gold making.... it won't matter, you're still not getting very many souls, so you can't get the prestige bonuses.\nNeed to get rubies for a quest? Good luck, it's going to take you about a week. Definitely take the correct path through the tree, else maybe two weeks.\n\nDon't play this game, waste your time elsewhere.",

There's just only so many times I can look at the same exact bee and same exact worm before I lose my mind. I did look it up and saw all the enemies in the game, but there's still just not many enemy types at all when you consider all this game is, is looking at a slow line of enemies and clicking stuff constantly to level up your stuff to kill said enemies. I love the concept, but don't like the game. Maybe if we're lucky they'll make an Idle Slayer 2 with a crap ton of enemies since games with a crap ton of enemies are becoming more popular now.

      "review": "Why do you keep add active gameplay stuff and among other things those activities have miserable rewards in coins and souls?\n\nThe reason why we play this game its because it plays itself and the only thing we need to do is (was) to buy upgrades. \nNOW when i open the game i get spammed with all those active gameplay mini-games, spammed all the time that i dont want to open the game anymore. \n\nYes, i know you can disable mini-games, but they are mandatory to complete daily and sometimes weelky quests. \nSo what should i do, spend divinity points to constantly swap between divinities to enable and disable them everyday when a quest to complete a minigame appears? Its insane.\n\nThose minigames are enjoyable for some hours. but as you can see i have 1574 hours right now and its exhausting making those minigames over and over again whenever i open the game. \nThey are too much frequent and give too poor rewards. \n\nAlso, in all my hours i managed to get only a few excellent gear items and they are not even among the best stats options right there. \nEverything is becoming so exhausting.\n\nThe end game right now is:\n- spend point in the perfect stone of time build with 32 points on idle and pretty much the rest on hope. \n- close the game\n- wait hours/days\n- open the game\n- claim everything\n- upgrade if you can\n- close the game\n- repeat\n\nthis is it right now. \nAnd when you keep the game opened, while for example watching a movie to complete daily and weekly quests, those mini-games are spammed over and over again requiring your attention to complete them or die to close and let the character running. And i repeat, they are mandatory, not only to complete quests but because they [strike] drop [/strike] should drop excellent gear.\n\nAnd yet another active minigame has been added when you are like spiderman destroing blocks to do it in time (completed all of them under 2m 10s and claimed all rewards in 3 tries), and now i get that minigame spammed among others.\n\nNow, if i leave the review like this looks like a complain and nothing else. But i do complain because i [strike] love [/strike] loved this game and i dont like the direction it is taking. \nSo this is what, according to me, should be done to make it better:\n- Remove daily and weekly quests that requires to complete active gameplay minigames\n- Chance to get excellent + bonus gears should be higher a little. I don't want it to be super easy to obtain, but i dont want either to play 1600 hours and only got 10 excellent gear items including double ones and gear without options.\n- Balance the active gameplay with the passive gameplay. Right now playing active is not rewarding at all. I dont want the passive gameplay to be debuffed but i want the active to be buffed. Every activity i do in active gameplay even with changed stones of time are much less rewarding than closing the game and let it sit there for days with 32 points in stone of idle. I remember there was a period where active gameplay was enjoyable, you could have stack bonuses then when a minigame (much more rare at that time) like the chest with mimics one appeared you could have obtain A LOT to boost your game. Happened to me only once back then and i calculated i saved more than 30 days of active \"normal \" gameplay. It was cool and rewarding. Since the stone of idle is the best way to progress, things like that haven't happened to me anymore.\nHonestly i would \"merge\" the past active gameplay with the idle gameplay we got today. So it is rewarding both when the game is closed and when you open it to do weekly and daily quests.\n\nLast thing. I do 1400fps with v-sync on (that uncap the fps in this game) with my rtx 5080 but yet, when i spam arrows with wind dash and parallel shot skill from bow it drops to 240fps. That's clearly an optimization issue that should be fixed. In my old laptop with gtx1650 it goes from 200+fps to even 12fps under the same conditions.",
