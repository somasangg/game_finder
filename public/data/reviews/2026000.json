It combines elements from Final Fantasy Tactics (battles, jobs), Darkest Dungeon (perma-death, dungeon structure), D&D (skill trees, skill checks), and, dare I say, does so flawlessly. I've wanted a great, deep guild management game for a while now and this game hit the nail on the head. Since I'm an old man, I really love the Flash game-style graphics. It feels like you found a Newgrounds game that actually had the resources to make a brilliant product. This game is definitely worth your money.",

      "review": "Scratches an XCOM-but-as-a-fantasy-rougelite sort of itch, 35 hours deep and still mid-level (Though i wander off and do housework and cook sometimes). I'm having lots of fun working if it's possible to imbalance the game significantly by over-leveraging character development variances but also becoming quite fond of the members of the 5 parties I have rolling around righting wrongs all over the place. \n\nSo far gameplay complexity and combat scale is grand enough, standard turn based strategic combat grid encounters, short and snappy, with exploration and opportunities to rest between with a home base to develop alongside your characters with the loot you bring home. Positive so far but higher level is where these sorts of systems start to creak so if I remember to I will circle back and update once I have got that far. Be wary of the odd encounter that is there to keep you humble. Usually it is a random encounter which just happens to exploit a gap in your party skill mix somehow and can quickly lead to the death of a poorly positioned light or medium armoured party member. This game does not mess about with punishing leaving any individual overexposed and vulnerable. If it can kill someone it will. It will even swarm to a vulnerable threat over closer targets. I do it all the time to the enemy so I actually respect that. \n\nBase developments is fun but chat interactions are somehow painful, the timing windows of the click through's to proceed and how long before they appear or something like that is the root. I just know the bit of me that hates having unresolved alerts hates the bit of me that wants to refuse to engage in npc interaction chat at all unless it seems like it will drive the plot forwards. \n\nHas a neat longer mission structure mechanic where groups of characters head out to complete a task for a few days and are unavailable for combat during their absence. Benefits of completing these include XP, loot, specific abilities, etc.\n\nNow, the demand for a space bar press now and then can annoy. Despite being a completely mouse driven game it now and then asks for exclusively key input. I know I could probably mess with settings for this but it seems so clunky and unneeded and somehow interrupts your flow so much. Not sure why this has frustrated me so. I didn't realise it was bothering me that much until I started typing about it. \n\nI'm really not a huge fan of the art style, I am here for something which puts me in mind of the 4th edition of a very, very famous ttrpg. The style just jars a bit and makes me feel like I am playing a Delicious in Dungeon licence. It works perfectly well at achieving what it sets out to do, just not my thing.\n\nSo a very fun, tactical turn and grid based combat game that has more in common with a ttrpg like D&D than it does the aforementioned XCOM, and because it does that well I am willing to put up with some clunky design choices and art which doesn't work for me. Overall this is pretty high praise as I can be really fussy, if I can be bothered to stick around for a bit under a week of work despite the annoyances it is probably a very good game. Going back to play it now.",

      "review": "I just beat the game and I think this game was amazing! I enjoyed making my own party members a lot. However I do wish the game had more customization options as we can already change the color of the eyes and hair along with what the style of both are. But yet, I wish that we could at least change the clothing color of the character too since a lot of my adventurers looked silly with the mismatching colors. Also in the game some accessories actually appear on your character, so I think it would have been nice to have some sort of vanity wardrobe kind of system where we could add them on to our character without granting them the effects of the coresponding accessory. I enjoyed the game play a ton, yet when it came to auto-battling I was a bit baffled about how my party fought so stupidly while the enemy fought so strategically. I know that auto-battle is a luxury and that people want a challenge, but I wish that our party actually made better choices while it was on. The maps were fun and all and I really did enjoy the side quests. Now I don't have any problems with the recruitable special characters, but once you got them they felt flat and bland. I feel like the game was heavily benefit if they all got their own unique story quest line like (Spoiler alert) Ferdinand the talking sword's quest line. As once you get them they just sit in your party accept for one exception which was (Spoiler) Misasa. I really think it would have been nicer if they were included more in the story or as I said before get their own quest line. Also I know that the developer said they wouldn't add mods and all, but I think it also would be nice if we could import our own sprites for hair, faces, clothes, etc. as we can already do that with the portraits. Sort of like a character maker.",

      "review": "Our Adventurer Guild does a lot of things right, with some annoyances along the way. However, a lot of these annoyances can be easily mitigated thanks to the dev's foresight in allowing you to customize a variety of options, both in and out of game.\n\n1) Lots of classes - it's pretty standard fare, especially if you're familiar with pen and paper RPGs. Warriors, defenders, mages, clerics, paladins, so on. There are single-purpose classes as well as hybrids (arcane knights, bards, paladins), plus higher tier versions of the base classes that unlock new abilities and increase stat growth. I'm not going to get into how useful each class is, because there's too many factors that affect this - difficulty settings, your luck in getting \"good\" adventurers from the tavern, so on. I will say, I found all the classes useful in some capacity - either for stat growth or actual combat ability. I wish that you could create your own mix of abilities from various classes (skill points invested in skills that aren't shared between classes when you re-class an adventurer are refunded, and those skills removed), but I suppose the hybrids do this to some degree.\n\n2) There's plenty of unlocking you can do with the guild itself - new and better facilities that allow equipment upgrades, mood management for your adventurers, so on. It does take a while to get to a fully unlocked guild, and these upgrades are generally gated by your guild's renown level (which, generally, is gated by completing certain story missions).\n\n3) Characters. You're going to be managing lots of adventurers - recruiting, training, organizing into parties, equipping, managing their mood, so on. If you're playing the game without any adjustments or customization - just purely vanilla - you're at the mercy of RNGesus, pure and simple. The difference between acquiring a band of average adventurers with mediocre growths and talents with one mega-talented adventurer with incredible talents and growths is overwhelming. The dev was clearly aware of this and so provided a host of ways for you to get around this if you wanted - you can edit .ini files, you can adjust in-game sliders, you can savescum stat growth rolls (you even get 1 free reroll per level up if you want to try for better rolls). There's even an optional 'scouting' system that lets you create custom adventurers with a point-buy system (for a pretty hefty fee, of course).\n\n4) I think the art style is charming. It has a unified aesthetic, allows some character customization, and even shows the weapons your characters have equipped on their combat models. The facial expressions on the characters are pretty great, too. I don't understand why people complain about this in their reviews when you can clearly see them on the store page. If you're that much of a graphics slut then move on and play something else.\n\n5) RNG in general. You're going to get angry at the RNG at some point, I'm sure. That's just how chance works, at times. But if you don't like it, you have a plethora of ways to adjust it until you're satisfied. I personally really like the Bravery system - adventurers can expend a rolling resource - Bravery Points - to increase hit chance, take extra actions, reroll failed skill checks. It helps mitigate the RNG and, with judicious use, can allow you to survive otherwise incredibly punishing encounters.\n\n6) Combat. Generally it's enjoyable, but I have a few complaints here since you spend so much time engaged in it: a) All battle maps seem to be the same size; b) generally the most efficient way of dealing with any combat is to just delay for a turn or two, wait for the enemies to approach, then take them down. This changes a bit as enemies get increased movement ranges and abilities that basically hit you anywhere on the map, which is an annoyance in and of itself; c) boss battles almost always boil down to 'Kill the boss before his infinite adds overwhelm you'. The Bravery system, mentioned above, goes a long way to ensuring the combat is enjoyable.\n\nOverall, the dev did a great job. Our Adventurer Guild is an amazing one-man piece of work that, due to the gameplay and the customization options provided, is sure to scratch a tactical itch many of us have been feeling since the PS1.",

These traits could lead you to different events, humor moments, unique event result, class compatibility, advantage/disadvantage, lover pairing compatibility and many more. You decide how you progress with the story, which quest to do, event choice, who you are going to recruit, which class your adventurer should be working on (starting class can be changed) or do scouting to customize what kind of adventurer you want, party members, and many more. There are some ideas I want to try on New Game+ later with the party mix and character traits later. I think the customization on adventurers, difficulty, different approach to play, and DLC give replay value. For example: I want to make pure monk party on next game, I want solo every quest on highest difficulty, I want to build a character that OHKO everything, I want to recreate adventurer party from certain anime, etc.\r\n\r\nThe plot is really interesting, you have to start from nothing, rebuild the guild's reputation, search trainers, solve the mystery of the former guild master's death.",

I played at a fast pace and focused on story quests, and it took me 30 hours to beat the game. If you play at a moderate pace and do more side quests, it'll probably take 50-100h to beat it. There's enough content drip-fed throughout the game that I don't think I would've gotten bored even if I took it at a slower pace. \n\nI know it's a great game because after I started it, I played it 5 days in a row until I beat it. I felt sad after finishing it, and I hadn't gotten bored of the mechanics yet. This is the first RPG I've actually finished in ages. The game started out a bit slow for the first few hours, but I'm glad I kept playing. I look forward to whatever other games the creator makes. I can tell that the creator put a lot of passion into this game.\n\nI really enjoyed the combat system. There are tons of ways you can build each individual character, tons of different character combos you can put in a party, and tons of different strategies you can run.\n\nThere are a lot of rough edges like simple graphics, some minor translation errors, and a UI that can be clunky. However, none of these significantly impacted my enjoyment of the game, and I think these mishaps can be forgiven because the game was made by a single dev with limited resources. Personally, I think the graphics are actually pretty good if I consider that single dev made all of this.\n\nOne point of feedback I have is that the non-boss combat encounters get repetitive quite quickly, because they aren't challenging and take a fair amount of time to play through. The boss encounters were almost all quite fun.\n\nAnother point of feedback is that there's not much to do after your party is strong enough to do after the final story quests. Afterwards, the only combat you can do are either side quests or the Wizard King DLC. Side quests stop scaling in difficulty at the end of the game and aren't challenging anymore. The Wizard King Tower is challenging combat-wise, and I find it somewhat fun, but it doesn't feel nearly as rewarding as the main game because it's solely combat and there's minimal story progression or new things to be unlocked.

      "review": "A wonderful game. While it may look like it has limited options, any little tweek, any little trait of your adventurers, all of it changes the feel of your teams noticable.\r\n\r\nBuilding your adventurers and the parties they fight in is the best part to me personally. Have a well balanced group with typical tank, heal, dps? Go right ahead. Want a group of spearfighters that all combo attack to wittle down big enemies with a thousand cuts? Sure! A full support team with a single damage dealer stacked to the high heavens with buffs? Let them be the hero! Go for a street gang beating up your enemies with just fists? Also valid. Or go 'oops all mages' but take good care of the living nuke you just sent out into danger.\r\n\r\nThe combat can be a bit repetitive at times, but is far from bad, especially with how the different biomes encourage different approaches.\r\n\r\nDespite some rough english here and there, the overall writing is really well done, the characters are likeable and both side stories as well as mainstory are quite enjoyable to read through.\r\n\r\nArt is subjective obviously, but I really like the entire design a lot too.\r\n\r\nThis little gem offers great enjoyment for a single playthrough, but also a lot of good fun with new game+ or just a new run with different choices altogether.\r\n\r\nI can't praise the work of this developer enough. Our Adventurer Guild is a great indie title. If what you see wakes any interest at all, give it a try, it's definitely worth it.",

But I enjoy the classes, and the gameplay loop. With some polish in writing, some tweaks to how the city management works and, of course, a major art overhaul, I'd reckon this is the kind of game which would actually benefit a bunch from a sequel.

      "review": "[h1] XCOM: Fantasy Unknown[/h1]\nFor me this game became a surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one! \nMain goal of qualitative game design is to provide proper experience to player, and this game does this 100% well. Most of things you imagine guild master and adventurers does — you’ll go through in this game, and all ingame systems synergize pretty well. Most important is: you’re enjoying process of playing it, bcs every time this game knows how to pleasantly surprise you.\n\n[h2] Gameplay of \"Our Adventurer Guild\" contains 3 layers: [/h2]\n[olist]\n    [*][b] Hub[/b]. There you can talk with staff of the adventurer guild (works same as Normandia in ME, camp in DA or BG3, Ebon Hawk in Kotor etc). You can hire adventurers, edit their appearance, level up them, create own builds of adventurers and their party, solve their problems and do things that improves their relationships. You can ask blacksmith to create equipment, alchemist to make potions and priest to heal your party with their very painful magic. Also, every ingame day there is a chance of random generated events to happen. \nAfter you done all your staff, you pick party of adventurers (4-6 people) and choose adventure mission from list. After doing that you’re going on next layer;  \n    [*][b] Adventure map[/b]. Maps are procedurally generated and has different bioms and goals to finish mission (for example: pick up 6 volcanic ores, explore 80% of map, defeat boss dragon etc). On adventure map you can find resources, fight hostile armies, manage the camp when your party needs rest, explore randomly generated events that can make huge impact even outside current adventure etc. When your adventurers meet hostile army, you’re going on the next layer;\n    [*][b] Tactical arena[/b]. It works like in “Heroes of might and magic”, but with altitude levels, bushes that can hide your adventurers and other interactive objects. There are a huge variations to make different builds of same classes, for example: Your priest can be focused on heal, or on buffs, or on damaging undead and demons. You’ll don’t have enough skill points to chose all skills, so you must choose what you want and try different builds on different adventurers and try to combine party you’ll enjoy to play the most. Also, all your characters are mortal in battles, so try to do all possible for them to survive.\n[/olist]\n[h2] Strong sides of the game: [/h2]\n[list]\n    [*] Variations of builds. You can create awesome synergize between your adventurers squad;\n    [*] Tactic battles. It creates tension bcs cost of mistake is your adventurer live, but at same time mesmerizing possibilities in combining skills of your adventurers;\n    [*] Quality of text. At first glance it looks pretty simple, but story is really interesting. Great balance of drama and humor. Characters and their motivation are believable, conflicts written pretty well, and storylines (main story line and side stories) are interesting to watch and enjoyable to play;\n    [*] Game Desing of big story battles is great, especially the final mission;\n    [*] Random generated events are made really well;\n[/list]\n[h2] Things I really want to see in sequel/DLC: [/h2]\n[list]\n    [*] Possibility to hire adventurers from different fantasy races (elfes, dwarfs, drows etc, not human only) will be fine addition;\n    [*] More classes and types of weapons (dual swords, hummers, maces etc);\n    [*] QoL thing: Pls, add function to go back in dialogues (like it is done in most of Visual Novels) to have posstibility to read part of diague you missed by missclick; Accidentally skipped few dialogs so I really felt iack of this function;\n    [*] Pls, make bind “create camp” [N] on other button. I missclicked with map [M] I guess hundreds of time;\n    [*] Make more conventional options for NG+ (for example: possibility to choose number of points for new characters’ traits, make higher chances for characters to be in romantic relationshinps etc). I know, some of this options you can fix via hex editor, but possibility to do it via in game options is something game really needs;\n    [*]Third slot for artifact, that unlocks for adventurer on 12-16 levels. In early game it can break balance too much, but it’s must have in late game for completing desired builds; \n    [*]Fast results of battle with possibility to replay in late game will be fine addition. It's better than trying to elude battles only bcs you’re gone on adventure to find ore for star sword sidequest, and don’t to waste time on filler battles with 12 ghosts.\n[/list]\n\nStill, if I understood correctly — game was done only by single person. If so — impressive job! I enjoyed this game a lot! Good luck in future projects!",

      "review": "Genuinely one of the biggest surprises I've had in gaming in as long as I can remember.  Somehow a single guy made one of the best SRPGs in years.  This is the type of indie game that needs to be supported.\n\nYou play as a guild master of a simple adventurer's guild down on its luck, and try to reclaim your former glory while also finding out dark secrets regarding the former guild master's (and your best friend) mysterious death.  A pretty interesting story that keeps you interested throughout the game even if its a very simplistic \"good vs evil\" story.  The characters are also all entertaining and well fleshed out.\n\nThe gameplay is very deep.  There are essentially two major phases to the game, the \"management sim\" aspect where you manage your guild by caring for your adventurers.  This is setup as a list of menus around your base where you can hire/train/equip/heal and organize your adventurers.  You also unlock different features in the base throughout the game's story.  The game almost NEVER stops drip feeding you things to upgrade and unlock.  It's part of what makes it so great.  It doesn't run out of steam.\n\nThe adventurers themselves are basically your RPG party members.  They have a stat sheet that will remind a lot of people of fire emblem and each of those stats affects their functional battle stats in various different ways.  Each time they level up, there's a percentage chance that stat will increase.  This increase varies WILDLY between different adventurers based on what traits they have.  Each one is randomly generated in the hiring menu.  You'll never get sick of looking through the hiring menu whenever it refreshes with new adventurers looking for interesting combinations that can make very powerful characters.  This combination of randomly generated traits and the stat growth system make character building so interesting.  I should probably mention there's also a \"class\" or \"job\" system for all these characters.  Each class has very unique stats and skills that make none of them redundant - they all have a different purpose and fulfill them masterfully.  With the DLC release that added a couple extra classes there are a LOT of different character archetypes that you can mix and match now.  \n\nThe combination of different classes plus the limited character deployment in each mission requires you to have a wide variety of characters that do different things.  Each mission you do with adventurers also applies a mood debuff on them or injuries that penalize their max health if they took damage that force you to rotate through multiple characters and teams.  The teams themselves can even be customized to have unique relationships within themselves and with other teams.  The fun never stops!  \n\nThat's a tiny little view of the management aspect of the game, the other parts of the game don't slouch either.  Each mission you undertake is displayed almost like a board game where you move your \"piece\" (your adventurer party) around a grid through a small randomly generated dungeon.  You can interact with resources to collect things, and there are roaming monster parties that will hunt you down to initiate combat. You can also run into randomly generated events that can give your party members unique and powerful traits or curses.  Part of the fun of the game is rolling with the punches, I HIGHLY recommend playing with the iron man setting on so you can't save scum.\n\nCombat takes place in a grid style turn based strategy RPG.  If you've played tactics ogre you'll be right at home here, it's very very similar from that aspect.  One of the biggest differences from tactics ogre is that every character in the combat has a chance to go each turn, the order is just separated by their speed or \"initiative\" value.  The gameplay here is pretty garden variety (more characters through cells to do things to the enemies), but has enough to chew on to keep you entertained.  The big payoff is seeing your adventurers growing and becoming strong to the point where they can do absurd things in combat like delete an entire enemy combat group alone in a single turn.  There's a lot to explore, and because the game continues to unlock new weapons, armor, items, classes, etc throughout the game you're continually unlocking new interesting things to do in combat.\n\nAbout the only downside of the game, is the art style is kind of scuffed and the music and sound fx are generic.  The art style does grow on you a little.\n\nI've never reviewed any game on steam, but this game surprised me and gave me such great joy that I had to make it the first.  I recommend the game to any fan of SRPGs or management sims, you WILL NOT be disappointed.",

I really like the management of the adventurers, the guild, and the game flow. It is relatively simple, with a lot of options for customization. The story is good, and there is a clear line of progression. The ability to field multiple adventure parties is pretty awesome. I was a bit frustrated at first at the length of time for healing, until I realized the point of it was to vary your parties, and to level up multiple rather than focusing on just one. After a couple brutal deaths from unexpected occurrences, I realized the importance of leveling more people. Managing moods actually seems to help promote multiple groups as well. \r\nThis game features a guild management system, where you manage an adventure guild with multiple parties. Combat is strategic squad based with initiative system. There is a good variety of things to do, and the gameplay loop is pretty fun. You can make this as difficult as you want, and it can definitely be brutal. \r\n\r\nI look forward to your sequel. As much fun/time as I've spent in this game, buying that will be a given.",

You’re not just commanding a party; you’re running an entire guild filled with personalities, flaws, and ambitions. Every decision matters, and the consequences hit harder than you’d expect.\n\nCombat is simple to learn but deeply tactical. Positioning, morale, and timing make every fight feel intense, and the Bravery system adds real tension. Losing a mission stings, but it always feels fair.\n\nThe real magic comes from the small moments. Adventurers argue, grow, get injured, and sometimes never come back. Those stories make every run memorable. The art and music tie it all together with a warm but bittersweet tone.\n\nIf you like tactical RPGs that make you care about your team and think before every move, this game is worth your time.",

It combines elements from Final Fantasy Tactics (battles, jobs), Darkest Dungeon (perma-death, dungeon structure), D&D (skill trees, skill checks), and, dare I say, does so flawlessly. I've wanted a great, deep guild management game for a while now and this game hit the nail on the head. Since I'm an old man, I really love the Flash game-style graphics. It feels like you found a Newgrounds game that actually had the resources to make a brilliant product. This game is definitely worth your money.",

      "review": "Scratches an XCOM-but-as-a-fantasy-rougelite sort of itch, 35 hours deep and still mid-level (Though i wander off and do housework and cook sometimes). I'm having lots of fun working if it's possible to imbalance the game significantly by over-leveraging character development variances but also becoming quite fond of the members of the 5 parties I have rolling around righting wrongs all over the place. \n\nSo far gameplay complexity and combat scale is grand enough, standard turn based strategic combat grid encounters, short and snappy, with exploration and opportunities to rest between with a home base to develop alongside your characters with the loot you bring home. Positive so far but higher level is where these sorts of systems start to creak so if I remember to I will circle back and update once I have got that far. Be wary of the odd encounter that is there to keep you humble. Usually it is a random encounter which just happens to exploit a gap in your party skill mix somehow and can quickly lead to the death of a poorly positioned light or medium armoured party member. This game does not mess about with punishing leaving any individual overexposed and vulnerable. If it can kill someone it will. It will even swarm to a vulnerable threat over closer targets. I do it all the time to the enemy so I actually respect that. \n\nBase developments is fun but chat interactions are somehow painful, the timing windows of the click through's to proceed and how long before they appear or something like that is the root. I just know the bit of me that hates having unresolved alerts hates the bit of me that wants to refuse to engage in npc interaction chat at all unless it seems like it will drive the plot forwards. \n\nHas a neat longer mission structure mechanic where groups of characters head out to complete a task for a few days and are unavailable for combat during their absence. Benefits of completing these include XP, loot, specific abilities, etc.\n\nNow, the demand for a space bar press now and then can annoy. Despite being a completely mouse driven game it now and then asks for exclusively key input. I know I could probably mess with settings for this but it seems so clunky and unneeded and somehow interrupts your flow so much. Not sure why this has frustrated me so. I didn't realise it was bothering me that much until I started typing about it. \n\nI'm really not a huge fan of the art style, I am here for something which puts me in mind of the 4th edition of a very, very famous ttrpg. The style just jars a bit and makes me feel like I am playing a Delicious in Dungeon licence. It works perfectly well at achieving what it sets out to do, just not my thing.\n\nSo a very fun, tactical turn and grid based combat game that has more in common with a ttrpg like D&D than it does the aforementioned XCOM, and because it does that well I am willing to put up with some clunky design choices and art which doesn't work for me. Overall this is pretty high praise as I can be really fussy, if I can be bothered to stick around for a bit under a week of work despite the annoyances it is probably a very good game. Going back to play it now.",

However I do wish the game had more customization options as we can already change the color of the eyes and hair along with what the style of both are. But yet, I wish that we could at least change the clothing color of the character too since a lot of my adventurers looked silly with the mismatching colors. Also in the game some accessories actually appear on your character, so I think it would have been nice to have some sort of vanity wardrobe kind of system where we could add them on to our character without granting them the effects of the coresponding accessory. I enjoyed the game play a ton, yet when it came to auto-battling I was a bit baffled about how my party fought so stupidly while the enemy fought so strategically. I know that auto-battle is a luxury and that people want a challenge, but I wish that our party actually made better choices while it was on. The maps were fun and all and I really did enjoy the side quests. Now I don't have any problems with the recruitable special characters, but once you got them they felt flat and bland. I feel like the game was heavily benefit if they all got their own unique story quest line like (Spoiler alert) Ferdinand the talking sword's quest line. As once you get them they just sit in your party accept for one exception which was (Spoiler) Misasa. I really think it would have been nicer if they were included more in the story or as I said before get their own quest line. Also I know that the developer said they wouldn't add mods and all, but I think it also would be nice if we could import our own sprites for hair, faces, clothes, etc. as we can already do that with the portraits.

Weapons get their own skins. The little stuff done right. \n\nScouting: \nMaking your own people is tight. If you don't, it is a massive difficulty modifier. Horrible rng work. Afraid of fire mages, scarred tanks, blind archers, etc. Stars in the wrong places. A warrior with stars in int and wis... But starts with 1 int and wis, dumb and magically deaf. MmmKkkAaaYyy... Then, early in the game you get hit with a \"trouble on the roads modifier\" which wipes out your entire list of recruits. And even with scouting... I edited the .ini file to get a bit more control over the experience. The base amount of points allotted doesn't really let you make a character. Just the bare bones idea of one. But, the base game gives you the tools to adjust it where needed. So this goes into the positive category. \n\nItems:\nImma sucker for good item work. The items in this game are extremely fun and impactful, without being necessary. My only problem here is that a lot of items are in the wrong tier. Like you'll get access to items and be like \"man this would have been useful 30 weeks ago... oh well... sell.\"\n\n\"Relationships\":\nGay. Literally.

I mean, THIS, is actually the game. You will either start a full turn away from your enemies, or within your ENEMIES movement. But you, the player, will never be able to melee them turn 1... In a game where you'll lose access to your adventures for weeks if they get a fucking paper cut. All of the systems in play fight each other in a race to the bottom. It is unique. I will give it that. Each fight begins with 4 to 6 space bars. Followed by actually playing the game, just with -30% initiative. Why did the dev think this was necessary... No fucking clue.\n\nMoody bunch of Bitches:\nMood in this game is a absolute joke. Gets maimed to death, shot, shaken twice and bled like a pig, poisoned, burned, frozen, electrocuted, stabbed, shot again, and their soul was raped by demons. 0 effect on mood. Completes a \"challenging\" mission (any regular mission. Auto-Missions give a -5), -10 mood for 5 days(?)... For winning... No fuck that, FOR DOING THEIR JOB!!! THAT YOU ARE PAYING THEM FOR! And they can't use the tavern by themselves. They don't know how to buy beers unless you do it for them. Gets called short, -10 mood for 8 days(?). An adventurer can be anally probed by a flaming demon fist, 0 mood change. AND it costs 10(?) Scouting points to give your character the short \"buff\"... Wow. It is bad. \n\n50 ways to lower your mood by playing the game well. Not to mention having 1 sadist on your team can injure 10 adventures and have them all lose 10 relationship at least once a week. And sadist costs like 20 scouting points. No mood buffs for being huge. No mood buffs for force healing a \"likes pain\". It only matters if it works against the player. Poor game design for the artificial difficulty spike. 2000$ to improve it by 20 for 3 days(?), 200$ +1 day to raise it by 20 for 3 days. Vacay which is like 40 points for like...5 days. But they are out of service a full week. Or you can pay them (Levelx5) gold for a +5 buff for 3 days. It is awful, and way too micro for something so stupid. \n\nThe classes:\nRough stuff. I will say this, they are very distinct. They are full of useless crap. And even the stuff that is useful is only useful \"if\". Which means that every class needs to be built one way... Which is a very quick way to piss me off. Why spend time giving morons the illusion of choice? Wasting everyone's damn time trying to figure out what isn't dog shit.\n\nThe guild:\nI don't respect the narrative enough to avoid spoilers. So like. Your guild was besieged the night before you start the game. And you literally have to build it from the ground up. After it allegedly being huge and impressive. You don't even have beds. Like, games gotta tutorial, but... like damn. Building shit you should already have takes like 12 days. No way to build things faster. Just sitting there. Waiting. There is A LOT of waiting in this game. WAY too much dead time.\n\nThe enemies:\nBleh. Poor choices everywhere. Again, with how the combat plays out and it's implications. It's just anti player. Like, it isn't difficult. It never seeks to actively challenge the player. All it does is restrict the player. Until you are bringing the same party to every fight, which plays out exactly the same. Every. Single. Time. Like, one of the guides first sentence is \"Every leader needs to be a bard, and every bard leader needs the same 3 traits.\" And they are not wrong. Bards get leader boosts. No one else does. Just one class. Like it was designed to be the only option. More illusion of choice. Like I get that you don't have an imagination, but why am I being punished for mine?\n\nParty augmentations of team training:\nI thought this was a joke at first. Like they'd show you all the bad stuff first. Then you'd unlock the \"good\"(usable) stuff later in the game. Like classes. But, uh, no. You really have to spend like 10,000 gold and like 90 days for your party to benefit from a team training that \"increases the block of all of your units by 3.\" And requires 6 units with sword and shield in 1 party.\".... Rrriiiggghhhttt... Again, there is like 20 options... But like 4 usable ones and just a endless ocean of trash. \n\nDa Stohwie:\nWow... WOW. Wwwooowww...

I sent like almost a hundred F1 reports to the dev when I first bought it like a year ago, and was relentlessly ignored. So I don't feel bad about this at all. It seems like people REALLY like this game. And I can sort of see why... But, dude... It is a bad game. Like... You can get the entirety of Darkest Dungeon 1 for 8$!!! battle brothers has mods and cost the same. Portals of Phereon is 'free'. The world we live in is insane.

Waiting simulator.\n\nImma say da nice stuff first:\n\nCharacter creation is fine:\nDecent amount of variety considering end game roster size. Color sliders. Outfit changes with class. Weapons get their own skins. The little stuff done right. \n\nScouting: \nMaking your own people is tight. If you don't, it is a massive difficulty modifier. Horrible rng work. Afraid of fire mages, scarred tanks, blind archers, etc. Stars in the wrong places. A warrior with stars in int and wis... But starts with 1 int and wis, dumb and magically deaf. MmmKkkAaaYyy... Then, early in the game you get hit with a \"trouble on the roads modifier\" which wipes out your entire list of recruits. And even with scouting... I edited the .ini file to get a bit more control over the experience. The base amount of points allotted doesn't really let you make a character. Just the bare bones idea of one. But, the base game gives you the tools to adjust it where needed. So this goes into the positive category. \n\nItems:\nImma sucker for good item work. The items in this game are extremely fun and impactful, without being necessary. My only problem here is that a lot of items are in the wrong tier. Like you'll get access to items and be like \"man this would have been useful 30 weeks ago... oh well... sell.\"\n\n\"Relationships\":\nGay. Literally. Didn't really feel the need to put this in, but the game did. Along with the MC being androgynous... I don't think it is malicious, I think it is just weird for the sake of it. But let's take our focus off which holes are being fucked and move it onto whoms holes are being fucked. I like the idea. Synergy grows with proximity etc. Drama between polarized characters. Buffs to chain attack. Clean. I'm like 50 days in though... And I still can't interact with this mechanic in any way except the option to pay 2000 gold for 2 people to get 20 relation... Which is 40% of what is needed to be friends. +5 for completing a mission together. -2 for talking to each other, which looks like it can trigger 3 times a day. \n\nAnd then like a 1% chance for lovers once \"friends\" hit... And it is random. Which I get. People gunna do them... But it frustratingly takes a lot outta a perfectly good system when someone on your A team starts banging a rando that they haven't been on a mission since the begging of the game and whom we were planning to let go, instead of the 6'7 280 lb STACKED chad millionaire that I have had them on 12 lunch dates with. \n\nWow this game actually sucks:\n\nThe combat:\nWow this game actually sucks. I mean, THIS, is actually the game. You will either start a full turn away from your enemies, or within your ENEMIES movement. But you, the player, will never be able to melee them turn 1... In a game where you'll lose access to your adventures for weeks if they get a fucking paper cut. All of the systems in play fight each other in a race to the bottom. It is unique. I will give it that. Each fight begins with 4 to 6 space bars. Followed by actually playing the game, just with -30% initiative. Why did the dev think this was necessary... No fucking clue.\n\nMoody bunch of Bitches:\nMood in this game is a absolute joke. Gets maimed to death, shot, shaken twice and bled like a pig, poisoned, burned, frozen, electrocuted, stabbed, shot again, and their soul was raped by demons. 0 effect on mood. Completes a \"challenging\" mission (any regular mission. Auto-Missions give a -5), -10 mood for 5 days(?)... For winning... No fuck that, FOR DOING THEIR JOB!!! THAT YOU ARE PAYING THEM FOR! And they can't use the tavern by themselves. They don't know how to buy beers unless you do it for them. Gets called short, -10 mood for 8 days(?). An adventurer can be anally probed by a flaming demon fist, 0 mood change. AND it costs 10(?) Scouting points to give your character the short \"buff\"... Wow. It is bad. \n\n50 ways to lower your mood by playing the game well. Not to mention having 1 sadist on your team can injure 10 adventures and have them all lose 10 relationship at least once a week. And sadist costs like 20 scouting points. No mood buffs for being huge. No mood buffs for force healing a \"likes pain\". It only matters if it works against the player. Poor game design for the artificial difficulty spike. 2000$ to improve it by 20 for 3 days(?), 200$ +1 day to raise it by 20 for 3 days. Vacay which is like 40 points for like...5 days. But they are out of service a full week. Or you can pay them (Levelx5) gold for a +5 buff for 3 days. It is awful, and way too micro for something so stupid. \n\nThe classes:\nRough stuff. I will say this, they are very distinct. They are full of useless crap. And even the stuff that is useful is only useful \"if\". Which means that every class needs to be built one way... Which is a very quick way to piss me off. Why spend time giving morons the illusion of choice? Wasting everyone's damn time trying to figure out what isn't dog shit.\n\nThe guild:\nI don't respect the narrative enough to avoid spoilers. So like. Your guild was besieged the night before you start the game. And you literally have to build it from the ground up. After it allegedly being huge and impressive. You don't even have beds. Like, games gotta tutorial, but... like damn. Building shit you should already have takes like 12 days. No way to build things faster. Just sitting there. Waiting. There is A LOT of waiting in this game. WAY too much dead time.\n\nThe enemies:\nBleh. Poor choices everywhere. Again, with how the combat plays out and it's implications. It's just anti player. Like, it isn't difficult. It never seeks to actively challenge the player. All it does is restrict the player. Until you are bringing the same party to every fight, which plays out exactly the same. Every. Single. Time. Like, one of the guides first sentence is \"Every leader needs to be a bard, and every bard leader needs the same 3 traits.\" And they are not wrong. Bards get leader boosts. No one else does. Just one class. Like it was designed to be the only option. More illusion of choice. Like I get that you don't have an imagination, but why am I being punished for mine?\n\nParty augmentations of team training:\nI thought this was a joke at first. Like they'd show you all the bad stuff first. Then you'd unlock the \"good\"(usable) stuff later in the game. Like classes. But, uh, no. You really have to spend like 10,000 gold and like 90 days for your party to benefit from a team training that \"increases the block of all of your units by 3.\" And requires 6 units with sword and shield in 1 party.\".... Rrriiiggghhhttt... Again, there is like 20 options... But like 4 usable ones and just a endless ocean of trash. \n\nDa Stohwie:\nWow... WOW. Wwwooowww... You can tell this person has written a TON of fanfic. Whew... I'm sorry. I need a minute. \n\n...\n\nDamn. Okay. It isn't 'bad'... Per se. But it is ugly as all hell. It is basically a parody, of a parody, of a parody of a cartoon adventure game. Stuffed with as much ORIGINAL CHARACTER DON'T STEAL energy as they could fist into the game. \"Quirky\" characters... everywhere... All of em. If y-you know, you know.... You know... I can't... I can't... Let's move on. \n\nFinish!\nUmm... Idk.. Imma definitely finish the game at some point. Will I ever play it again... Idk. It is still getting updates.

Waiting simulator.\n\nImma say da nice stuff first:\n\nCharacter creation is fine:\nDecent amount of variety considering end game roster size. Color sliders. Outfit changes with class. Weapons get their own skins. The little stuff done right. \n\nScouting: \nMaking your own people is tight. If you don't, it is a massive difficulty modifier. Horrible rng work. Afraid of fire mages, scarred tanks, blind archers, etc. Stars in the wrong places. A warrior with stars in int and wis... But starts with 1 int and wis, dumb and magically deaf. MmmKkkAaaYyy... Then, early in the game you get hit with a \"trouble on the roads modifier\" which wipes out your entire list of recruits. And even with scouting... I edited the .ini file to get a bit more control over the experience. The base amount of points allotted doesn't really let you make a character. Just the bare bones idea of one. But, the base game gives you the tools to adjust it where needed. So this goes into the positive category. \n\nItems:\nImma sucker for good item work. The items in this game are extremely fun and impactful, without being necessary. My only problem here is that a lot of items are in the wrong tier. Like you'll get access to items and be like \"man this would have been useful 30 weeks ago... oh well... sell.\"\n\n\"Relationships\":\nGay. Literally. Didn't really feel the need to put this in, but the game did. Along with the MC being androgynous... I don't think it is malicious, I think it is just weird for the sake of it. But let's take our focus off which holes are being fucked and move it onto whoms holes are being fucked. I like the idea. Synergy grows with proximity etc. Drama between polarized characters. Buffs to chain attack. Clean. I'm like 50 days in though... And I still can't interact with this mechanic in any way except the option to pay 2000 gold for 2 people to get 20 relation... Which is 40% of what is needed to be friends. +5 for completing a mission together. -2 for talking to each other, which looks like it can trigger 3 times a day. \n\nAnd then like a 1% chance for lovers once \"friends\" hit... And it is random. Which I get. People gunna do them... But it frustratingly takes a lot outta a perfectly good system when someone on your A team starts banging a rando that they haven't been on a mission since the begging of the game and whom we were planning to let go, instead of the 6'7 280 lb STACKED chad millionaire that I have had them on 12 lunch dates with. \n\nWow this game actually sucks:\n\nThe combat:\nWow this game actually sucks. I mean, THIS, is actually the game. You will either start a full turn away from your enemies, or within your ENEMIES movement. But you, the player, will never be able to melee them turn 1... In a game where you'll lose access to your adventures for weeks if they get a fucking paper cut. All of the systems in play fight each other in a race to the bottom. It is unique. I will give it that. Each fight begins with 4 to 6 space bars. Followed by actually playing the game, just with -30% initiative. Why did the dev think this was necessary... No fucking clue.\n\nMoody bunch of Bitches:\nMood in this game is a absolute joke. Gets maimed to death, shot, shaken twice and bled like a pig, poisoned, burned, frozen, electrocuted, stabbed, shot again, and their soul was raped by demons. 0 effect on mood. Completes a \"challenging\" mission (any regular mission. Auto-Missions give a -5), -10 mood for 5 days(?)... For winning... No fuck that, FOR DOING THEIR JOB!!! THAT YOU ARE PAYING THEM FOR! And they can't use the tavern by themselves. They don't know how to buy beers unless you do it for them. Gets called short, -10 mood for 8 days(?). An adventurer can be anally probed by a flaming demon fist, 0 mood change. AND it costs 10(?) Scouting points to give your character the short \"buff\"... Wow. It is bad. \n\n50 ways to lower your mood by playing the game well. Not to mention having 1 sadist on your team can injure 10 adventures and have them all lose 10 relationship at least once a week. And sadist costs like 20 scouting points. No mood buffs for being huge. No mood buffs for force healing a \"likes pain\". It only matters if it works against the player. Poor game design for the artificial difficulty spike. 2000$ to improve it by 20 for 3 days(?), 200$ +1 day to raise it by 20 for 3 days. Vacay which is like 40 points for like...5 days. But they are out of service a full week. Or you can pay them (Levelx5) gold for a +5 buff for 3 days. It is awful, and way too micro for something so stupid. \n\nThe classes:\nRough stuff. I will say this, they are very distinct. They are full of useless crap. And even the stuff that is useful is only useful \"if\". Which means that every class needs to be built one way... Which is a very quick way to piss me off. Why spend time giving morons the illusion of choice? Wasting everyone's damn time trying to figure out what isn't dog shit.\n\nThe guild:\nI don't respect the narrative enough to avoid spoilers. So like. Your guild was besieged the night before you start the game. And you literally have to build it from the ground up. After it allegedly being huge and impressive. You don't even have beds. Like, games gotta tutorial, but... like damn. Building shit you should already have takes like 12 days. No way to build things faster. Just sitting there. Waiting. There is A LOT of waiting in this game. WAY too much dead time.\n\nThe enemies:\nBleh. Poor choices everywhere. Again, with how the combat plays out and it's implications. It's just anti player. Like, it isn't difficult. It never seeks to actively challenge the player. All it does is restrict the player. Until you are bringing the same party to every fight, which plays out exactly the same. Every. Single. Time. Like, one of the guides first sentence is \"Every leader needs to be a bard, and every bard leader needs the same 3 traits.\" And they are not wrong. Bards get leader boosts. No one else does. Just one class. Like it was designed to be the only option. More illusion of choice. Like I get that you don't have an imagination, but why am I being punished for mine?\n\nParty augmentations of team training:\nI thought this was a joke at first. Like they'd show you all the bad stuff first. Then you'd unlock the \"good\"(usable) stuff later in the game. Like classes. But, uh, no. You really have to spend like 10,000 gold and like 90 days for your party to benefit from a team training that \"increases the block of all of your units by 3.\" And requires 6 units with sword and shield in 1 party.\".... Rrriiiggghhhttt... Again, there is like 20 options... But like 4 usable ones and just a endless ocean of trash. \n\nDa Stohwie:\nWow... WOW. Wwwooowww... You can tell this person has written a TON of fanfic. Whew... I'm sorry. I need a minute. \n\n...\n\nDamn. Okay. It isn't 'bad'... Per se. But it is ugly as all hell. It is basically a parody, of a parody, of a parody of a cartoon adventure game. Stuffed with as much ORIGINAL CHARACTER DON'T STEAL energy as they could fist into the game. \"Quirky\" characters... everywhere... All of em. If y-you know, you know.... You know... I can't... I can't... Let's move on. \n\nFinish!\nUmm... Idk.. Imma definitely finish the game at some point. Will I ever play it again... Idk. It is still getting updates. I sent like almost a hundred F1 reports to the dev when I first bought it like a year ago, and was relentlessly ignored. So I don't feel bad about this at all. It seems like people REALLY like this game. And I can sort of see why... But, dude... It is a bad game. Like... You can get the entirety of Darkest Dungeon 1 for 8$!!! battle brothers has mods and cost the same. Portals of Phereon is 'free'. The world we live in is insane. Overwhelmingly positive, for a wait to bang your head, head banging simulator. Wild.",

      "review": "I'm not going to recommend this game, but I am probably going to say a bunch of nice things about it. Like a 4/10. Idk. It gets impossibly stale, very quickly. The pacing is awful. Waiting simulator.\n\nImma say da nice stuff first:\n\nCharacter creation is fine:\nDecent amount of variety considering end game roster size. Color sliders. Outfit changes with class. Weapons get their own skins. The little stuff done right. \n\nScouting: \nMaking your own people is tight. If you don't, it is a massive difficulty modifier. Horrible rng work. Afraid of fire mages, scarred tanks, blind archers, etc. Stars in the wrong places. A warrior with stars in int and wis... But starts with 1 int and wis, dumb and magically deaf. MmmKkkAaaYyy... Then, early in the game you get hit with a \"trouble on the roads modifier\" which wipes out your entire list of recruits. And even with scouting... I edited the .ini file to get a bit more control over the experience. The base amount of points allotted doesn't really let you make a character. Just the bare bones idea of one. But, the base game gives you the tools to adjust it where needed. So this goes into the positive category. \n\nItems:\nImma sucker for good item work. The items in this game are extremely fun and impactful, without being necessary. My only problem here is that a lot of items are in the wrong tier. Like you'll get access to items and be like \"man this would have been useful 30 weeks ago... oh well... sell.\"\n\n\"Relationships\":\nGay. Literally. Didn't really feel the need to put this in, but the game did. Along with the MC being androgynous... I don't think it is malicious, I think it is just weird for the sake of it. But let's take our focus off which holes are being fucked and move it onto whoms holes are being fucked. I like the idea. Synergy grows with proximity etc. Drama between polarized characters. Buffs to chain attack. Clean. I'm like 50 days in though... And I still can't interact with this mechanic in any way except the option to pay 2000 gold for 2 people to get 20 relation... Which is 40% of what is needed to be friends. +5 for completing a mission together. -2 for talking to each other, which looks like it can trigger 3 times a day. \n\nAnd then like a 1% chance for lovers once \"friends\" hit... And it is random. Which I get. People gunna do them... But it frustratingly takes a lot outta a perfectly good system when someone on your A team starts banging a rando that they haven't been on a mission since the begging of the game and whom we were planning to let go, instead of the 6'7 280 lb STACKED chad millionaire that I have had them on 12 lunch dates with. \n\nWow this game actually sucks:\n\nThe combat:\nWow this game actually sucks. I mean, THIS, is actually the game. You will either start a full turn away from your enemies, or within your ENEMIES movement. But you, the player, will never be able to melee them turn 1... In a game where you'll lose access to your adventures for weeks if they get a fucking paper cut. All of the systems in play fight each other in a race to the bottom. It is unique. I will give it that. Each fight begins with 4 to 6 space bars. Followed by actually playing the game, just with -30% initiative. Why did the dev think this was necessary... No fucking clue.\n\nMoody bunch of Bitches:\nMood in this game is a absolute joke. Gets maimed to death, shot, shaken twice and bled like a pig, poisoned, burned, frozen, electrocuted, stabbed, shot again, and their soul was raped by demons. 0 effect on mood. Completes a \"challenging\" mission (any regular mission. Auto-Missions give a -5), -10 mood for 5 days(?)... For winning... No fuck that, FOR DOING THEIR JOB!!! THAT YOU ARE PAYING THEM FOR! And they can't use the tavern by themselves. They don't know how to buy beers unless you do it for them. Gets called short, -10 mood for 8 days(?). An adventurer can be anally probed by a flaming demon fist, 0 mood change. AND it costs 10(?) Scouting points to give your character the short \"buff\"... Wow. It is bad. \n\n50 ways to lower your mood by playing the game well. Not to mention having 1 sadist on your team can injure 10 adventures and have them all lose 10 relationship at least once a week. And sadist costs like 20 scouting points. No mood buffs for being huge. No mood buffs for force healing a \"likes pain\". It only matters if it works against the player. Poor game design for the artificial difficulty spike. 2000$ to improve it by 20 for 3 days(?), 200$ +1 day to raise it by 20 for 3 days. Vacay which is like 40 points for like...5 days. But they are out of service a full week. Or you can pay them (Levelx5) gold for a +5 buff for 3 days. It is awful, and way too micro for something so stupid. \n\nThe classes:\nRough stuff. I will say this, they are very distinct. They are full of useless crap. And even the stuff that is useful is only useful \"if\". Which means that every class needs to be built one way... Which is a very quick way to piss me off. Why spend time giving morons the illusion of choice? Wasting everyone's damn time trying to figure out what isn't dog shit.\n\nThe guild:\nI don't respect the narrative enough to avoid spoilers. So like. Your guild was besieged the night before you start the game. And you literally have to build it from the ground up. After it allegedly being huge and impressive. You don't even have beds. Like, games gotta tutorial, but... like damn. Building shit you should already have takes like 12 days. No way to build things faster. Just sitting there. Waiting. There is A LOT of waiting in this game. WAY too much dead time.\n\nThe enemies:\nBleh. Poor choices everywhere. Again, with how the combat plays out and it's implications. It's just anti player. Like, it isn't difficult. It never seeks to actively challenge the player. All it does is restrict the player. Until you are bringing the same party to every fight, which plays out exactly the same. Every. Single. Time. Like, one of the guides first sentence is \"Every leader needs to be a bard, and every bard leader needs the same 3 traits.\" And they are not wrong. Bards get leader boosts. No one else does. Just one class. Like it was designed to be the only option. More illusion of choice. Like I get that you don't have an imagination, but why am I being punished for mine?\n\nParty augmentations of team training:\nI thought this was a joke at first. Like they'd show you all the bad stuff first. Then you'd unlock the \"good\"(usable) stuff later in the game. Like classes. But, uh, no. You really have to spend like 10,000 gold and like 90 days for your party to benefit from a team training that \"increases the block of all of your units by 3.\" And requires 6 units with sword and shield in 1 party.\".... Rrriiiggghhhttt... Again, there is like 20 options... But like 4 usable ones and just a endless ocean of trash. \n\nDa Stohwie:\nWow... WOW. Wwwooowww... You can tell this person has written a TON of fanfic. Whew... I'm sorry. I need a minute. \n\n...\n\nDamn. Okay. It isn't 'bad'... Per se. But it is ugly as all hell. It is basically a parody, of a parody, of a parody of a cartoon adventure game. Stuffed with as much ORIGINAL CHARACTER DON'T STEAL energy as they could fist into the game. \"Quirky\" characters... everywhere... All of em. If y-you know, you know.... You know... I can't... I can't... Let's move on. \n\nFinish!\nUmm... Idk.. Imma definitely finish the game at some point. Will I ever play it again... Idk. It is still getting updates. I sent like almost a hundred F1 reports to the dev when I first bought it like a year ago, and was relentlessly ignored. So I don't feel bad about this at all. It seems like people REALLY like this game. And I can sort of see why... But, dude... It is a bad game. Like... You can get the entirety of Darkest Dungeon 1 for 8$!!! battle brothers has mods and cost the same. Portals of Phereon is 'free'. The world we live in is insane. Overwhelmingly positive, for a wait to bang your head, head banging simulator. Wild.",

In fact, I wonder if this developer (among others) has taken the wrong lesson away from the success of something like Nubby's Number Factory -- that game has awful art and people loved it anyway, yes, but the awful art in that case is an artistic choice that contributes to a cohesive aesthetic, rather than an excuse to direct effort elsewhere when making the game.\n\nAnyway, back to the topic of judging book covers, I really wanted to give the game a fair chance, and in terms of gameplay, it's not bad. It borrows elements of Final Fantasy Tactics, Darkest Dungeon, and Wildermyth (particularly having a roster of randomized heroes who go through emergent stories), though it might be more accurate to say the game attempts to imitate a tabletop RPG experience like D&D or Pathfinder. This especially comes across with skill checks, which are rolled with an animated d20 Baldur's Gate style, but the influence can also be seen in the grid-based combat, the hero level progression, and even the combat appearance of the heroes and enemies as little tabletop miniatures.\n\nWhile the gameplay is reminiscent of D&D, the writing is reminiscent of a D&D session played by a gaggle of teenage boys, with all the storytelling prowess and maturity that implies. It's quite bad, showing off effort on par with what was put into the art.

If this game was really excellent and put its own spin on tried-and-true mechanics, I could probably stick with it. As it was, though, I felt like the game wasn't doing anything particularly novel -- I ultimately decided I wasn't excited about doing a gameloop I was already intimately familiar with using a new crop of mediocre-at-best content.

Afraid of fire mages, scarred tanks, blind archers, etc. Stars in the wrong places. A warrior with stars in int and wis... But starts with 1 int and wis, dumb and magically deaf. MmmKkkAaaYyy... Then, early in the game you get hit with a \"trouble on the roads modifier\" which wipes out your entire list of recruits. And even with scouting... I edited the .ini file to get a bit more control over the experience. The base amount of points allotted doesn't really let you make a character. Just the bare bones idea of one. But, the base game gives you the tools to adjust it where needed. So this goes into the positive category. \n\nItems:\nImma sucker for good item work. The items in this game are extremely fun and impactful, without being necessary. My only problem here is that a lot of items are in the wrong tier. Like you'll get access to items and be like \"man this would have been useful 30 weeks ago... oh well... sell.\"\n\n\"Relationships\":\nGay. Literally. Didn't really feel the need to put this in, but the game did. Along with the MC being androgynous... I don't think it is malicious, I think it is just weird for the sake of it. But let's take our focus off which holes are being fucked and move it onto whoms holes are being fucked. I like the idea. Synergy grows with proximity etc. Drama between polarized characters. Buffs to chain attack. Clean. I'm like 50 days in though... And I still can't interact with this mechanic in any way except the option to pay 2000 gold for 2 people to get 20 relation... Which is 40% of what is needed to be friends. +5 for completing a mission together. -2 for talking to each other, which looks like it can trigger 3 times a day. \n\nAnd then like a 1% chance for lovers once \"friends\" hit... And it is random. Which I get. People gunna do them... But it frustratingly takes a lot outta a perfectly good system when someone on your A team starts banging a rando that they haven't been on a mission since the begging of the game and whom we were planning to let go, instead of the 6'7 280 lb STACKED chad millionaire that I have had them on 12 lunch dates with. \n\nWow this game actually sucks:\n\nThe combat:\nWow this game actually sucks. I mean, THIS, is actually the game. You will either start a full turn away from your enemies, or within your ENEMIES movement. But you, the player, will never be able to melee them turn 1... In a game where you'll lose access to your adventures for weeks if they get a fucking paper cut. All of the systems in play fight each other in a race to the bottom. It is unique. I will give it that. Each fight begins with 4 to 6 space bars. Followed by actually playing the game, just with -30% initiative. Why did the dev think this was necessary... No fucking clue.\n\nMoody bunch of Bitches:\nMood in this game is a absolute joke. Gets maimed to death, shot, shaken twice and bled like a pig, poisoned, burned, frozen, electrocuted, stabbed, shot again, and their soul was raped by demons. 0 effect on mood. Completes a \"challenging\" mission (any regular mission. Auto-Missions give a -5), -10 mood for 5 days(?)... For winning... No fuck that, FOR DOING THEIR JOB!!! THAT YOU ARE PAYING THEM FOR! And they can't use the tavern by themselves. They don't know how to buy beers unless you do it for them. Gets called short, -10 mood for 8 days(?). An adventurer can be anally probed by a flaming demon fist, 0 mood change. AND it costs 10(?) Scouting points to give your character the short \"buff\"... Wow. It is bad. \n\n50 ways to lower your mood by playing the game well. Not to mention having 1 sadist on your team can injure 10 adventures and have them all lose 10 relationship at least once a week. And sadist costs like 20 scouting points. No mood buffs for being huge. No mood buffs for force healing a \"likes pain\". It only matters if it works against the player. Poor game design for the artificial difficulty spike. 2000$ to improve it by 20 for 3 days(?), 200$ +1 day to raise it by 20 for 3 days. Vacay which is like 40 points for like...5 days. But they are out of service a full week. Or you can pay them (Levelx5) gold for a +5 buff for 3 days. It is awful, and way too micro for something so stupid. \n\nThe classes:\nRough stuff. I will say this, they are very distinct. They are full of useless crap. And even the stuff that is useful is only useful \"if\". Which means that every class needs to be built one way... Which is a very quick way to piss me off. Why spend time giving morons the illusion of choice? Wasting everyone's damn time trying to figure out what isn't dog shit.\n\nThe guild:\nI don't respect the narrative enough to avoid spoilers. So like. Your guild was besieged the night before you start the game. And you literally have to build it from the ground up. After it allegedly being huge and impressive. You don't even have beds. Like, games gotta tutorial, but... like damn. Building shit you should already have takes like 12 days. No way to build things faster. Just sitting there. Waiting. There is A LOT of waiting in this game. WAY too much dead time.\n\nThe enemies:\nBleh. Poor choices everywhere. Again, with how the combat plays out and it's implications. It's just anti player. Like, it isn't difficult. It never seeks to actively challenge the player. All it does is restrict the player. Until you are bringing the same party to every fight, which plays out exactly the same. Every. Single. Time. Like, one of the guides first sentence is \"Every leader needs to be a bard, and every bard leader needs the same 3 traits.\" And they are not wrong. Bards get leader boosts. No one else does. Just one class. Like it was designed to be the only option. More illusion of choice. Like I get that you don't have an imagination, but why am I being punished for mine?\n\nParty augmentations of team training:\nI thought this was a joke at first. Like they'd show you all the bad stuff first. Then you'd unlock the \"good\"(usable) stuff later in the game. Like classes. But, uh, no. You really have to spend like 10,000 gold and like 90 days for your party to benefit from a team training that \"increases the block of all of your units by 3.\" And requires 6 units with sword and shield in 1 party.\".... Rrriiiggghhhttt... Again, there is like 20 options... But like 4 usable ones and just a endless ocean of trash. \n\nDa Stohwie:\nWow... WOW. Wwwooowww... You can tell this person has written a TON of fanfic. Whew... I'm sorry. I need a minute. \n\n...\n\nDamn. Okay. It isn't 'bad'... Per se. But it is ugly as all hell. It is basically a parody, of a parody, of a parody of a cartoon adventure game. Stuffed with as much ORIGINAL CHARACTER DON'T STEAL energy as they could fist into the game. \"Quirky\" characters... everywhere... All of em. If y-you know, you know.... You know... I can't... I can't... Let's move on. \n\nFinish!\nUmm... Idk.. Imma definitely finish the game at some point. Will I ever play it again... Idk. It is still getting updates. I sent like almost a hundred F1 reports to the dev when I first bought it like a year ago, and was relentlessly ignored. So I don't feel bad about this at all. It seems like people REALLY like this game. And I can sort of see why... But, dude... It is a bad game. Like... You can get the entirety of Darkest Dungeon 1 for 8$!!! battle brothers has mods and cost the same. Portals of Phereon is 'free'. The world we live in is insane. Overwhelmingly positive, for a wait to bang your head, head banging simulator. Wild.",

In fact, I wonder if this developer (among others) has taken the wrong lesson away from the success of something like Nubby's Number Factory -- that game has awful art and people loved it anyway, yes, but the awful art in that case is an artistic choice that contributes to a cohesive aesthetic, rather than an excuse to direct effort elsewhere when making the game.\n\nAnyway, back to the topic of judging book covers, I really wanted to give the game a fair chance, and in terms of gameplay, it's not bad. It borrows elements of Final Fantasy Tactics, Darkest Dungeon, and Wildermyth (particularly having a roster of randomized heroes who go through emergent stories), though it might be more accurate to say the game attempts to imitate a tabletop RPG experience like D&D or Pathfinder. This especially comes across with skill checks, which are rolled with an animated d20 Baldur's Gate style, but the influence can also be seen in the grid-based combat, the hero level progression, and even the combat appearance of the heroes and enemies as little tabletop miniatures.\n\nWhile the gameplay is reminiscent of D&D, the writing is reminiscent of a D&D session played by a gaggle of teenage boys, with all the storytelling prowess and maturity that implies.

If this game was really excellent and put its own spin on tried-and-true mechanics, I could probably stick with it.

In a game where you'll lose access to your adventures for weeks if they get a fucking paper cut. All of the systems in play fight each other in a race to the bottom. It is unique. I will give it that. Each fight begins with 4 to 6 space bars. Followed by actually playing the game, just with -30% initiative. Why did the dev think this was necessary... No fucking clue.\n\nMoody bunch of Bitches:\nMood in this game is a absolute joke. Gets maimed to death, shot, shaken twice and bled like a pig, poisoned, burned, frozen, electrocuted, stabbed, shot again, and their soul was raped by demons. 0 effect on mood. Completes a \"challenging\" mission (any regular mission. Auto-Missions give a -5), -10 mood for 5 days(?)... For winning... No fuck that, FOR DOING THEIR JOB!!! THAT YOU ARE PAYING THEM FOR! And they can't use the tavern by themselves. They don't know how to buy beers unless you do it for them. Gets called short, -10 mood for 8 days(?). An adventurer can be anally probed by a flaming demon fist, 0 mood change. AND it costs 10(?) Scouting points to give your character the short \"buff\"... Wow. It is bad. \n\n50 ways to lower your mood by playing the game well. Not to mention having 1 sadist on your team can injure 10 adventures and have them all lose 10 relationship at least once a week. And sadist costs like 20 scouting points. No mood buffs for being huge. No mood buffs for force healing a \"likes pain\". It only matters if it works against the player. Poor game design for the artificial difficulty spike. 2000$ to improve it by 20 for 3 days(?), 200$ +1 day to raise it by 20 for 3 days. Vacay which is like 40 points for like...5 days. But they are out of service a full week. Or you can pay them (Levelx5) gold for a +5 buff for 3 days. It is awful, and way too micro for something so stupid. \n\nThe classes:\nRough stuff. I will say this, they are very distinct. They are full of useless crap. And even the stuff that is useful is only useful \"if\". Which means that every class needs to be built one way... Which is a very quick way to piss me off. Why spend time giving morons the illusion of choice? Wasting everyone's damn time trying to figure out what isn't dog shit.\n\nThe guild:\nI don't respect the narrative enough to avoid spoilers. So like. Your guild was besieged the night before you start the game. And you literally have to build it from the ground up. After it allegedly being huge and impressive. You don't even have beds. Like, games gotta tutorial, but... like damn. Building shit you should already have takes like 12 days. No way to build things faster. Just sitting there. Waiting. There is A LOT of waiting in this game. WAY too much dead time.\n\nThe enemies:\nBleh. Poor choices everywhere. Again, with how the combat plays out and it's implications. It's just anti player. Like, it isn't difficult. It never seeks to actively challenge the player. All it does is restrict the player. Until you are bringing the same party to every fight, which plays out exactly the same. Every. Single. Time. Like, one of the guides first sentence is \"Every leader needs to be a bard, and every bard leader needs the same 3 traits.\" And they are not wrong. Bards get leader boosts. No one else does. Just one class. Like it was designed to be the only option. More illusion of choice. Like I get that you don't have an imagination, but why am I being punished for mine?\n\nParty augmentations of team training:\nI thought this was a joke at first. Like they'd show you all the bad stuff first. Then you'd unlock the \"good\"(usable) stuff later in the game. Like classes. But, uh, no. You really have to spend like 10,000 gold and like 90 days for your party to benefit from a team training that \"increases the block of all of your units by 3.\" And requires 6 units with sword and shield in 1 party.\".... Rrriiiggghhhttt... Again, there is like 20 options... But like 4 usable ones and just a endless ocean of trash. \n\nDa Stohwie:\nWow... WOW. Wwwooowww... You can tell this person has written a TON of fanfic. Whew... I'm sorry. I need a minute. \n\n...\n\nDamn. Okay. It isn't 'bad'... Per se. But it is ugly as all hell. It is basically a parody, of a parody, of a parody of a cartoon adventure game. Stuffed with as much ORIGINAL CHARACTER DON'T STEAL energy as they could fist into the game. \"Quirky\" characters... everywhere... All of em. If y-you know, you know.... You know... I can't... I can't... Let's move on. \n\nFinish!\nUmm... Idk.. Imma definitely finish the game at some point. Will I ever play it again... Idk. It is still getting updates. I sent like almost a hundred F1 reports to the dev when I first bought it like a year ago, and was relentlessly ignored. So I don't feel bad about this at all. It seems like people REALLY like this game. And I can sort of see why... But, dude... It is a bad game. Like... You can get the entirety of Darkest Dungeon 1 for 8$!!! battle brothers has mods and cost the same. Portals of Phereon is 'free'. The world we live in is insane. Overwhelmingly positive, for a wait to bang your head, head banging simulator. Wild.",

      "review": "They say you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, and this game's cover is hideous -- from the bad anime art (squashed heads on huge bodies) to the assets that look like they were sourced from some royalty free folder, it's clear that the developer did not consider presentation a high priority. In fact, I wonder if this developer (among others) has taken the wrong lesson away from the success of something like Nubby's Number Factory -- that game has awful art and people loved it anyway, yes, but the awful art in that case is an artistic choice that contributes to a cohesive aesthetic, rather than an excuse to direct effort elsewhere when making the game.\n\nAnyway, back to the topic of judging book covers, I really wanted to give the game a fair chance, and in terms of gameplay, it's not bad. It borrows elements of Final Fantasy Tactics, Darkest Dungeon, and Wildermyth (particularly having a roster of randomized heroes who go through emergent stories), though it might be more accurate to say the game attempts to imitate a tabletop RPG experience like D&D or Pathfinder. This especially comes across with skill checks, which are rolled with an animated d20 Baldur's Gate style, but the influence can also be seen in the grid-based combat, the hero level progression, and even the combat appearance of the heroes and enemies as little tabletop miniatures.\n\nWhile the gameplay is reminiscent of D&D, the writing is reminiscent of a D&D session played by a gaggle of teenage boys, with all the storytelling prowess and maturity that implies. It's quite bad, showing off effort on par with what was put into the art. If you don't mind extreme silliness and a plethora of unfunny jokes (or if that's the sort of vibe you like at your D&D table), you may be able to look past this and get enjoyment out of this game. I could not, especially since I couldn't help but compare the game to the likes of Darkest Dungeon and Wildermyth, which both have phenomenal writing (not to mention great art).\n\nIn the end, the most damning thing about Our Adventurer Guild wasn't the art, nor was it the writing, at least not by themselves. If this game was really excellent and put its own spin on tried-and-true mechanics, I could probably stick with it. As it was, though, I felt like the game wasn't doing anything particularly novel -- I ultimately decided I wasn't excited about doing a gameloop I was already intimately familiar with using a new crop of mediocre-at-best content. (If you're debating playing this game and haven't tried Wildermyth, do yourself a favor and try Wildermyth. It's a million times better than this.)",
