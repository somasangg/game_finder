The other issue is this game is notorious with servers getting ddosed constantly, it has come to a point where community members are not even surprised by this, multiple discord servers have emojis or memes around ddosing. Also if you're on any continent other than Europe, then good luck trying to find someone to play with, the game is mostly played by europeans more specifically german ppl.\n\nApart from servers being quite bad, the other thing to mention is how the people \"running\" the game seem to have no clue how to grow the game and expand it's community (or they're just lazy), ever since the steam release in 2020 this game has been slowly dropping in active players, you would think having this kind of a influx of players upon steam release would help you grow the community, but no. Somehow none of the each gamemodes communites have done any major changes or have done anything at all really to make this game more popular which is sad, this game is almost perfect for creative people and sweaty players alike, to refuse to try making any unique content whether it being events or youtube content/streaming just confuses me.\n\nAs of writing this I have ~1.5k hours of playtime across different clients including the steam one.\nTo sum up my experience inside of the game and the community: I don't regret playing this game and meeting people, I regret staying around for too long.",

It personally makes the experience borderline insufferable.\n\nOn a positive note, as mentioned before, the gameplay is very exciting and fun. Skin creation is pretty fun in its own right, especially when it comes to experimenting with the picture and trying to see how far apart the face assets are so that it doesn't seem like they're overlapping or far apart. I do feel that the skin template should have a grid of some sort to make editing the sprites a bit easier.\n\nThis does not mean that I'll stop playing the game. I'll still continue playing, since I have a personal record on the tutorial level that I want to beat, and many servers to explore.",

Somehow none of the each gamemodes communites have done any major changes or have done anything at all really to make this game more popular which is sad, this game is almost perfect for creative people and sweaty players alike, to refuse to try making any unique content whether it being events or youtube content/streaming just confuses me.\n\nAs of writing this I have ~1.5k hours of playtime across different clients including the steam one.\nTo sum up my experience inside of the game and the community: I don't regret playing this game and meeting people, I regret staying around for too long.",
