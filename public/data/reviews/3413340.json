      "review": "app is very buggy, a bunch of ass ai wallpapers, not very much good casual ones (in the anime side of things) Basically only use this if you have a wallpaper downloaded. the music bar system is cool, but u have to subscribe to it again if you close the app and reopen. Sometimes when i closed the app and reopen the wallpaper i had turns white, making me resubscribe to it. Its supposed to run in the background but when i close the app it just shuts off completely (i checked settings) This app has potential to be better, fix the bugs, optimize it more and anyone could enjoy it. Bocchi rain wallpaper is the best one!",
