      "review": "It’s come a long way over the years, but it’s way too big of a franchise to suffer from major bugs like it does.\r\n\r\n\r\nI haven’t played the Madden franchise since 2007-2008—where does the time go? I loved Tecmo Super Bowl as a kid, and Madden was innovative in switching to a “vertical” view but had issues with passing and other game features in early versions. It went on sale for about $10 (sad that this has become an annual release that disappears instead of letting me buy them from 2 years ago for $5, as I would buy them all that way).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Positives\r\n-The moves they have now are awesome. You can throw with precision, tuck and run, throw the ball away, catch for completion or for YAC, run the option, and make many changes at the line of scrimmage. It’s amazing how much it’s evolved if you just wait a long time between purchases. I really like the feel once I got the hang of the controls, and they let you practice in a variety of ways to get used to them.\r\n\r\n-They have settings so you can play a whole game in a reasonable amount of time so it doesn’t feel arcade-y. Specifically, they have a setting that runs the clock down to 15 seconds, so I can pick a play and then it transfers to the line at a reasonable time loss. It allows you to get realistic scores and yardage with a full game. I love it. I’m able to get about 450 yards per game and 30-odd points just like a good team in real life with those settings.\r\n\r\n-The amount of detail in the modes is impressive. Salaries, salary caps, coaching changes, even new stadiums. I automated some of the settings because I was indifferent, but the level of detail is fun.\r\n\r\n-The last time I played Madden, it felt like there was a rubber-banding effect (meaning if you were doing well, you’d fumble; if you were doing poorly, they’d throw an interception to you). In this game, I found that they are decently close but it feels more like the ebbs and flows of a real game vs. rubber-banding. For example, I rarely seem to be able to stop the opposing offense on the first drive, making it seem like they’re going to score 42 points on me…but then they get a 3-and-out next time or make progress and then get stuck with a field goal. The interceptions only come from bad passes, and the fumbles come from sacks or hard hits. It feels much more realistic. It’s taught me to be patient and be okay with punting or being down early, as I can always figure out what strategy will work and win. But it doesn’t just hand you a win on normal modes—it is based on what strategy works against their game plan. I know that the best players find ways to throw bombs and get their receivers open or whatever, but I like playing it the regular way and feeling like a real game, which it does decently enough.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Negatives\r\n-Many of the modes don’t work. It’s the primary reason for my negative review, as I can’t recommend a game where entire game modes are unplayable. For example, when you play the DB practice, the QB never throws the ball and so you get a gold every time. I tried playing the career mode, but it wouldn’t throw me the ball and so I couldn’t get a good score even coming out of the combine. It’s just wild that entire mini-games just don’t work at all as intended and this game has been out for over a year and makes billions of dollars for EA.\r\n\r\n-To do the game planning and maximize your experience points, you have to play the same mini-games over and over, which get old through 17 weeks (and, if you have 2 in the same position, that’s 34 times). I automated it, but then it automates all of it. I just don’t want to have to play the mini-games over and over.\r\n\r\n-The kicking is kind of stuck within a range of what is possible. Kickers are hitting 60+ yarders in real life, but I could barely hit a 50-yarder with one of the greatest kickers of all time, Chris Boswell, hitting the power almost perfectly at max. Similarly, punts nearly always go about 40 yards, and the kickoff is pretty much kick and return to the 24-35. In real life, they have these new squib strategies and such, but you’re pretty much stuck kicking to the 1-2 if you want to prevent decent field position.\r\n\r\n-I’m not a fan of the modern game pass system for games like this where it’s bloated with crap. I just want to play the game. Fortunately, I can just go into Franchise mode and play, but there’s a lot of stuff in here that probably takes up a lot of space and creates a lot of “noise” on the interface.\r\n\r\n-Not EA’s fault, but I tried making real-life trades in the game to get my roster close to the current one, and the game basically laughed at me. :) Just shows you how flawed the rating system is for players (not a criticism of EA; just trying to rate players down to a specific number is difficult).\r\n\r\n-While it’s not rubber-banding (because you don’t magically fumble when you’re up), the opponent generally becomes phenomenal if you’re up by more than 10 points. Wide-open receivers, one-play TD drives in 20 seconds, etc. All but one time I got up by a lot did the opponent not just start throwing ~20-yard plays to wide-open receivers every down or two.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, I appreciated being able to play this game during the NFL season to fill in the gaps when my teams were on a bye week or when they lost so I could win with them in a virtual setting. While I can’t recommend that someone buys a game with plenty of things that don’t work for anything close to full price, I think the game overall has evolved over the years to become realistic, engaging, and a lot of fun.",

      "review": "I really wanted to like this game, but it's impossible. It's only an arcade game, even in franchise mode, which makes it impossible to play if you just want to call the plays, because you can't get your QB to pass the ball unless you do it yourself. If you want your QB to just operate independently of you with the controller or keyboard doing it all... then you are in for a huge disappointment.\r\n\r\nRatings like throwing under pressure are totally meaningless. I actually drafted and developed a QB who ended up with a 99 overall rating and a 99 Awareness rating, but any time he  dropped back to pass he'd just stand there like an Easter Island statue and wait to get sacked, and half the time he'd fumble when he got sacked. \r\n\r\nThere was one game in which in 6 passing attempts my QB had 1 completion and 5 sacks before I just gave up. He won't scramble; he won't throw the ball away. He just stands there, waiting to get sacked like some junior varsity high school kid who freezes up and goes deer-in-the-headlights.\r\n\r\nSince you can't pass, you have to run. And then the computer player just stacks 8 guys in the box and does run blitzes every play, and there goes your ability to run. So... you end up with a quarterback who can't pass and running backs who end up getting stuffed at the line of scrimmage every play.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, the computer quarterbacks will scramble out of the pocket and run for big gains, or throw the ball away before taking the sack, or throw for completions... it's just ridiculous. If you aren't going to play this like an arcade game -- if you want to immerse yourself in the strategy of play calling, then see the results without actually having to pretend to be the player yourself --  then forget it. It's just a kids' game.\r\n\r\nNow, if you want to \"SuperSim\" your games, then your players will turn in OK statistical performances. I actually managed to SuperSim my way to a Super Bowl win once, although it took several seasons to build a team to do that. But... what's the fun of not being able to watch your players play? It's boring.\r\n\r\nOh, and if you want to try to overcome the \"QB who got drafted from Catatonic State\" syndrome by relying on your franchise staff to do things like upgrade your player abilities like pass blocking or receiver route running.... that' won't work, either. The game will just suddenly \"retire\" your offensive or defensive coordinator, or both of them at the same time, once you've finally gotten them to the point where they can maybe make a difference, and then you get to start all over again.\r\n\r\nAnd don't get me started on how many times I've watched my cover-3 or cover-4 defenses get completely burned by computer deep passes to the right, no DB within 20 yards of the receiver. This usually happens at least once a game, often more than once.\r\n\r\nMadden 25 is just a glitchy, silly arcade game that offers nothing for the wannabe football strategist.

I know that the best players find ways to throw bombs and get their receivers open or whatever, but I like playing it the regular way and feeling like a real game, which it does decently enough.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Negatives\r\n-Many of the modes don’t work. It’s the primary reason for my negative review, as I can’t recommend a game where entire game modes are unplayable. For example, when you play the DB practice, the QB never throws the ball and so you get a gold every time. I tried playing the career mode, but it wouldn’t throw me the ball and so I couldn’t get a good score even coming out of the combine. It’s just wild that entire mini-games just don’t work at all as intended and this game has been out for over a year and makes billions of dollars for EA.\r\n\r\n-To do the game planning and maximize your experience points, you have to play the same mini-games over and over, which get old through 17 weeks (and, if you have 2 in the same position, that’s 34 times). I automated it, but then it automates all of it. I just don’t want to have to play the mini-games over and over.\r\n\r\n-The kicking is kind of stuck within a range of what is possible. Kickers are hitting 60+ yarders in real life, but I could barely hit a 50-yarder with one of the greatest kickers of all time, Chris Boswell, hitting the power almost perfectly at max. Similarly, punts nearly always go about 40 yards, and the kickoff is pretty much kick and return to the 24-35. In real life, they have these new squib strategies and such, but you’re pretty much stuck kicking to the 1-2 if you want to prevent decent field position.\r\n\r\n-I’m not a fan of the modern game pass system for games like this where it’s bloated with crap. I just want to play the game. Fortunately, I can just go into Franchise mode and play, but there’s a lot of stuff in here that probably takes up a lot of space and creates a lot of “noise” on the interface.\r\n\r\n-Not EA’s fault, but I tried making real-life trades in the game to get my roster close to the current one, and the game basically laughed at me. :) Just shows you how flawed the rating system is for players (not a criticism of EA; just trying to rate players down to a specific number is difficult).\r\n\r\n-While it’s not rubber-banding (because you don’t magically fumble when you’re up), the opponent generally becomes phenomenal if you’re up by more than 10 points. Wide-open receivers, one-play TD drives in 20 seconds, etc. All but one time I got up by a lot did the opponent not just start throwing ~20-yard plays to wide-open receivers every down or two.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, I appreciated being able to play this game during the NFL season to fill in the gaps when my teams were on a bye week or when they lost so I could win with them in a virtual setting. While I can’t recommend that someone buys a game with plenty of things that don’t work for anything close to full price, I think the game overall has evolved over the years to become realistic, engaging, and a lot of fun.",

Filled with spam for the latest and greatest microtransactions. Music ranges from forgettable to garbage.

Gridiron football translates better to video games than most other sports, which makes the state of this franchise even more pathetic and painful.",

Also when i play CB i literally cant control my player at the start of some plays. I have all forms of defensive  assist turned off. It makes no sense and this happens in Superstar as well as franchise and only for CB. EA always doing something dumb im sure itll be better now that a private company owns it.

Faces? Think of a face thats been stripped of everything, and rendered down. The faces look like someone went in blender, made the blandest face morph with no texture, and gave it some functions to move.\n\n2. Superstar mode? Forget it. It has no sound, just text unless you're in a game, then you might hear the commentators that piss me off or a million damn helmets clacking together. There's also a neat little glitch that when you're in the top ten draft projections when you get all the interview questions right, you become a late 1st rounder. Better late than top ten right?\n\n3. Franchise mode. Ever wanted to coach or manage an existing NFL team with all their OVR and everything still intact without a game deciding to nerf them immediately? Well, not in this game! Whenever you pick a team with well... a good OVR in this mode, Madden nerfs them massively! Say goodbye to the OVR you think you would get and say hello to a team with an OVR of a wet tea bag!

However, the fact the kernel level anticheat is the sole reason we can't play on SteamDeck is ridiculous and that part remains true. There is no workaround.\n\nHow to use DualSense:\n\n1. Install on Steam, launch and connect the game to your library on EA App. Close the game when you reach the menu.\n\n2. Disable SteamInput for Madden 25 through Steam's controller settings. It will display that your controller is not compatible on the game page in your Steam library.\n\n3. Launch EA App and launch Madden 25 through the EA App, with your controller still connected. Steam must be running in the background with SteamInput disabled. DualSense should work at this point, but if you're still having issues then:\n\n4. In Madden 25 disable keyboard/mouse inputs and/or set controller as default input. You may need to fully unplug your keyboard/mouse from your PC while playing to trigger this according to some forums, but this step was not necessary for me personally.\n\nBecome football.",
