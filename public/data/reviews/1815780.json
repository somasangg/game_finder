If anybody at steam or at the Asphalt Legends team can help i will be very pleased for some help because so far when i have tried to chat with support NO BODY enters the chat and i am left to dismay. I am running Paid for security and VPNs to try to stop it from happening but I cant seem to shake the problem. My controller is in A1 shape and should last 20 more years. Its a GameSir controller.

The game does usually have some way of telling you how to what to do next but sometimes you just hit a wall and have to stop your current line of progression and just go do something else.\r\n\r\nIt is also filled to the brim with microtransactions and that's fair as the game is free, however they certainly don't miss a chance to shove it in your face. While it is possible to progress without buying anything, pvp isn't very fun as even if you spend hours grinding for better cars someone can just spend some money and get them instantly.\r\n\r\nDespite this game's flaws I still enjoy it, the visuals are quite nice and mechanics are simple to understand but hard to master. As the game size is not too big and it is free, it is a nice game you can easily play with friends, as they now have privates races you can choose a map then invite people to.\r\n\r\nAlso I have far more hours on this game then is shown on steam as I ported my progress from my old laptop.",

Not to mentioned with multiple pass with most of the pass are expensive, including the recent Spotlight Pass. I hope they need to balance it out as a f2p players, especially for newbie who want to try at least progressing the career without any barrier.\n\nOverall as a player that already played in the earlier Asphalt games, this game is fun to play due to Unite update with cross-play, friends and private races.

The game offers a vast selection of real-world, licensed cars to collect, along with a comprehensive Career mode that can keep free-to-play players engaged for many hours. For players who can resist the aggressive monetization, the early and mid-game progression, coupled with regular new content and events, delivers a compelling, pick-up-and-play arcade fix.\n\nHowever, the game's greatest asset is inextricably linked to its most significant drawback: an aggressive, mobile-centric free-to-play model that severely limits progression. Overwhelming \"pay-to-win\" structure, noting that access to top-tier cars, crucial for competitive multiplayer and high-level seasonal events, is locked behind substantial time sinks or prohibitively expensive microtransactions. Beyond the sheer cost, the game employs restrictive systems, such as individual car fuel tanks, which impose wait times between races, and low blueprint drop rates, resulting in a repetitive and frustrating progression that does not respect the player's time.",

      "review": "There aren't many ways to go about Asphalt Legends : you'll either have to spend a lot of money, or a lot of time (ideally both) to get anywhere. If you do, you'll find in Asphalt Legends a very fun arcade racer, with tons of car blueprints to collect, cars to upgrade, and players of all levels to play against.\nBuilding your garage however, will be a long and arduous journey. So I thought I'd take you through mine, as an example !\n\n[i] Hour 3 : [/i] After playing a few races, the first impressions are very positive. Visually, what matters looks nice : the cars are detailed, the tracks are colorful and easy to follow, and there are lots of shiny effects and particles everywhere. It's a lot more basic if you look out of bounds, but you shouldn't have time for that because the game picks up speed right away.\nThe driving feels good as well, even if the first cars are obviously a little slow, but the game quickly lets you try out some of the higher class ones. So you get into the swing of things, try the different modes, cars, and all of a sudden... You can't play anymore, you have to wait ! That's the nature of the Free-to-Play model.\nBetween the tickets required to race, the gas in your cars that needs time to refill, the shop refreshes... Unless you want to use real money to keep playing right away, you'll have to wait a few hours. Annoying, but expected.\n\n[i] Hour 80 : [/i] I just got my first S class car ! Don't expect too much from it though, because like most cars you're given for free, it's bad. But it's an S car, which allows you to compete in new events.\nAfter spending some more time driving, the gameplay that seemed simplistic and intuitive at first now proves to be surprinsingly technical and demanding. Knowledge of the tracks, which type of nitro to use in what situation, when to go for stunts, how to get the best out of your cars depending on their stats... This brings some finesse to an otherwise very arcade game !\n\n[i] Hour 120 : [/i] Playing around in the extensive career mode, you'll earn a decent number of cars, parts, and currencies of all sorts. You'll also hone your skills against the AI while learning the tracks and how the game works. What it won't prepare you for though, is how aggressive the multiplayer will feel in comparison.\nI finally gave it a real shot and managed to reach Platinum ranks thanks to the weekly free cars, but this was rough. While the AI, harmless, will be taken down at the slightest touch, human players will not hesitate to send you flying at the first opportunity. And despite the time invested, I was nowhere close to having the cars required to play in higher divisions, so I had to rely on the aforementioned free cars.\nThe game lets you use a new one at every rank you climb, that changes every 2 weeks or so. This makes the ranked mode accessible to more people, but only up to a point : if the car of the week is bad or can't compete with the others in the category, that's as high as you'll climb !\n\n[i] Hour 150 : [/i] Several of those underwhelming cars in ranked multiplayer in a row, too many events I couldn't participate in... The realization sets in : I'll never own all cars.\nI knew that, but as a \"newer\" player, many activities will be inaccessible to you. Locked behind paywalls, car requirements or arbitrary ranks, it can feel frustrating. This also highlights the fact that the game is an absolute grindfest and does not value your time. It's still fun, but maybe a break is in order.\n\n[i] Hour 250 : [/i] Would you look at that, I finished my first festival !! A little bit of luck on the cars that were needed, a few lucky drops and enough money in the bank : I reached the end of the event ! Not that the rewards were much better, but it's nice to be able to partake all the way.\nAnd it's this plethora of activities that's probably the best part of Asphalt Legends : there is always something to do. Whether it's playing in multiplayer, career, daily missions, events, festivals, Grand Prix or the brand new Gauntlet mode (a competition of very short races over a week), the game will keep you busy. And I'm sure more is coming !\nNot all those modes are equally accessible, and it always revolves around car races and blueprint collecting, but if it's something you enjoy, the game could be what you sink your free time in for quite a while.\n\n[i] Hour 55712 : [/i] The year is 2075. I'm close to completing my car collection, only a few still escape my grasp. I've run out of tickets for the day, but I'll try again tomorrow. Oh, and I still have to do my multiplayer dailies, I should get on that. It's only the 4 of us playing online now : Liam, Mike, myself, and Kevin when the nurse says he can play. I fear he may never complete his collection, poor Kevin isn't doing too hot these days...\nBut this was a life well lived ! For my next one, I'm thinking of maybe trying to play more than one game. With Asphalt Legends out of the way, I'll have more time.\n\nThere you have it ! That was my experience as a Free-to-Play player with way too much time on his hands.\nAsphalt Legends is a very fun arcade racer that looks nice and feels good to play. There is a lot to do, a lot to collect, and players to play with at all times. But it will cost you... Reaching the higher leagues or even fully upgrading any car is a massive grind that will not respect your time. Do not give Asphalt Legends your life, or the game will take it and run away with it. Don't let that happen.\nConsidering all of this, I'll give it a [b] 7[/b]. I really enjoy the game, but because of its Free-to-Play model, the time cost will be way too high for most players.",

The graphics are consistently top-tier, and the sense of speed is unmatched especially when you hit that perfect ramp and chain a barrel roll into a takedown. The soundtrack always gets my adrenaline pumping, and the constant updates with new events and hypercars keep things fresh.

      "review": "Asphalt Legends (formerly known as Asphalt 9 before it went through more rebrands than a crypto startup) is a free-to-play arcade racer where you:\r\n\r\n* Hold down the throttle\r\n* Hit nitro at the exact right frame\r\n* Do a 480° barrel roll off a truck\r\n* And somehow only get 3rd place because someone in a Koenigsegg sneezed on the finish line faster than you.\r\n\r\nYou’re not here for “realistic racing.”\r\nYou’re here for **630 km/h sideways wall-grinding with fireworks**.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Pros\r\n\r\n* **Actually free** to download and play on Steam, with a full single-player career, events, and multiplayer. No “demo” nonsense, just instant nitro addiction.\r\n* It looks absurdly good for something that started as a mobile game: shiny reflections, pretty cities, and more lens flare than a JJ Abrams movie.\r\n* TouchDrive autopilot lets casual players vibe by just picking routes and timing nitro, while sweaty people can turn it off and pretend this is an eSport.\r\n* Big car roster: hypercars, supercars, concept stuff—basically everything you’ll never afford in real life, but you *can* smash into a wall at Mach 2 here.\r\n* Short races (1–2 minutes), so it’s perfect for “one more quick run” which is a lie you will tell yourself for hours.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Cons\r\n\r\n* Progression is held together by **blueprints, fuel systems, and timers**—like someone turned “racing” into a spreadsheet about waiting.\r\n* Some cars might as well be myths:\r\n\r\n  * “Yes, you *can* get it free!”\r\n  * Also yes: in 2037.\r\n* Multiplayer is less “clean racing” and more “who can body-slam each other into low orbit first.”\r\n* You will absolutely lose to someone on autopilot using TouchDrive while you’re manually driving like your license is on the line.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Peak Asphalt Legends Moments\r\n\r\n* Perfect nitro line, double barrel roll, flawless drift… and then you clip a wall 0.01 seconds before the finish and drop from 1st to 6th.\r\n* Unlocking a new car you’ve been grinding weeks for, taking it out once, and realizing it handles like a wet fridge with rockets.\r\n* Joining multiplayer, getting immediately murdered by a guy who uses you as a brake in every corner.\r\n* Telling yourself you won’t spend money, then seeing a pack with your dream car staring at you like “hey.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n8/10\r\nAn aggressively shiny, gloriously dumb arcade racer with legit fun handling buried under mobile-style grind and FOMO.\r\n\r\nWould yeet a million-dollar hypercar sideways off a ramp, miss the perfect nitro timing, and still queue up another race again.",

I have ZERO desire to play on the ipad i hate touchdrive and using my ipad to turn. I am incredibly upset i basically ruined my whole account for a weekend of collecting stuff. Instead of 10 free full gas refills a day and x6 coins after races, I will have to wait or pay for gas.\n\nThe worst part is there is ZERO disclaimer that this will happen, if I had seen a disclaimer i would have never done this. Hopefully we as steam players can bring awareness to this issue and have them fix our accounts. In the last few days i have seen this happen to 8 other people. Our whole game ruined.",

Many. Microtransactions. Car packs, every hololive decal (except for one) costs money, battle passes, super expensive passes just for boosted daily rewards (why)\n\n3) Progress comes down to luck. The way you earn cars in this game is via blueprints (aka gacha), and it can take hundreds just to get a single stage of a car. Some of these cars are extremely limited, and also required to progress in the career!!!!\n\n4) The AI in Career. Even if I massively exceed the recommended rating, I can still lose because either a) The opponents rubber banded me so hard or b) I'm required to run a D class car against cars I can find in B and A class.\n\n5) Currencies. Trade Tokens, Tokens, Coins, Event Tickets, Gauntlet Points, Car Keys, Blueprints, Overclock Tokens, there's probably some I missing, that's how bad this is.\n\n6) How in the hell do you take some of these corners, seriously.

But there is always an offer to get those missing ones from the shop) \r\n- where, once you get a couple of cars to somewhat competitive levels, then next month(season) you have no guarantee that those will be in the multiplayer pool to choose from (but don't worry, new cars are here for you chase from scratch)\r\n- where you get better rewards, and easier achievable, where you have better cars (no rewards for skill)\r\n- with one of the worst designed driving game tracks\r\n- with, hands down, the worst camera views in a driving game\r\n- where fellow players proudly announce on reddit that they have finally maxxed out car X after 4-5 years\r\n- without any game support (getting generic reply to one of my three ticket after 3 months does not claster as game support)\r\n- against bots (found mentiones of well known still active accounts after being reported +4 years ago)\r\n- where developers leave shop offer traps that only make you drain your resources (time, tokens or coins)\r\n- designed for mobile users (people that just click icons on the screen and do not control tracktion of the car which is automated)\r\n- that is a gotcha game with extremely predatory behaviours by Gameloft developer (nicknamed 'Greedloft' by the community)\r\n- with extremely toxic behaviour in multiplayer (on top of game crashes and lags)\r\n- where you feel like chasing your own tail\r\n- where you are the product",

      "review": "[b]Not Recommended (👎)\nPlaytime: about 12 hours[/b]\n\nAt first, Asphalt: Legends blew me away — beautiful graphics, satisfying driving, and that feeling of pure speed. The early stages make you think it’s all about skill: tight drifting, perfect nitros, learning every corner by heart.\n\nBut then... the walls hit. Hard.\n\nAfter a certain point, no matter how well you drive, the AI opponents simply outpace you. You’re stuck racing with underpowered cars, while the game expects you to magically find the required “blueprints” to upgrade your ride — which barely ever drop, unless, of course, you buy them.\n\nEven worse, you end up racing your beginner car against Ferraris that fly like jets. You ram them off the road, and they’re instantly back in front of you like nothing happened. Skill doesn’t matter anymore — only your wallet, or maybe luck.\n\nAnd when you finally want to keep playing? → “Sorry, your fuel tank is empty. Wait an hour or pay up.”\nIt’s a shame, because the core driving is amazing. But the experience slowly turns from exciting to exhausting.\n\nNevertheless, here’s my final rating:\n\n🚀 [b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]\n◾ Good graphics and sense of speed\n◾ Fun arcade driving and flashy action\n◾ Tons of cars to unlock (in theory)\n\n😕 [b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]\n◾ Progression completely locked behind rare blueprints (and paywalls)\n◾ AI becomes absurdly faster than you — even with perfect runs\n◾ Constant “fuel timers” that stop you from playing\n◾ Free customization at first, but then everything’s paywalled\n◾ Tons of grind, very little reward\n\n💬 It starts as a racing game — and ends as a shopping simulator.\nIf you value fair competition or real progression, don’t waste your time here.",

The game relies heavily on flashy visuals and over-the-top effects, but the core racing mechanics feel unpolished and repetitive. Controls are slippery and inconsistent, making it difficult to execute even basic manoeuvres reliably.\n\nThe progression system is grind-heavy, and unlocking new cars or upgrades feels artificially slow. You spend more time waiting or replaying the same tracks than actually enjoying the races. AI opponents are either too predictable or unfairly aggressive, leading to frequent frustration rather than genuine challenge.\n\nWhile the graphics are flashy, they can’t mask the lack of variety in tracks, events, or gameplay modes. Multiplayer is limited and often unbalanced, with little incentive to stick around once the novelty wears off.\n\nAsphalt Legends has potential as a casual arcade racer, but in practice it’s frustrating, repetitive, and overly reliant on spectacle rather than skill or fun.\n\nFinal Rating: 3.9 / 10\n\nUnpolished controls, grind-heavy progression, and repetitive gameplay make this more frustrating than entertaining.",

Many. Microtransactions. Car packs, every hololive decal (except for one) costs money, battle passes, super expensive passes just for boosted daily rewards (why)\n\n3) Progress comes down to luck. The way you earn cars in this game is via blueprints (aka gacha), and it can take hundreds just to get a single stage of a car. Some of these cars are extremely limited, and also required to progress in the career!!!!\n\n4) The AI in Career. Even if I massively exceed the recommended rating, I can still lose because either a) The opponents rubber banded me so hard or b) I'm required to run a D class car against cars I can find in B and A class.\n\n5) Currencies. Trade Tokens, Tokens, Coins, Event Tickets, Gauntlet Points, Car Keys, Blueprints, Overclock Tokens, there's probably some I missing, that's how bad this is.\n\n6) How in the hell do you take some of these corners, seriously.

I'm 200 BST over  the recommended and I am struggling to maintain 100mph because psycho's with badges are impossible to shake even blasting them with shockwaves and spins.\r\n\r\nGreat game until the garbage mission type killed my enjoyment.",

      "review": "[b]Not Recommended (👎)\nPlaytime: about 12 hours[/b]\n\nAt first, Asphalt: Legends blew me away — beautiful graphics, satisfying driving, and that feeling of pure speed. The early stages make you think it’s all about skill: tight drifting, perfect nitros, learning every corner by heart.\n\nBut then... the walls hit. Hard.\n\nAfter a certain point, no matter how well you drive, the AI opponents simply outpace you. You’re stuck racing with underpowered cars, while the game expects you to magically find the required “blueprints” to upgrade your ride — which barely ever drop, unless, of course, you buy them.\n\nEven worse, you end up racing your beginner car against Ferraris that fly like jets. You ram them off the road, and they’re instantly back in front of you like nothing happened. Skill doesn’t matter anymore — only your wallet, or maybe luck.\n\nAnd when you finally want to keep playing? → “Sorry, your fuel tank is empty. Wait an hour or pay up.”\nIt’s a shame, because the core driving is amazing. But the experience slowly turns from exciting to exhausting.\n\nNevertheless, here’s my final rating:\n\n🚀 [b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]\n◾ Good graphics and sense of speed\n◾ Fun arcade driving and flashy action\n◾ Tons of cars to unlock (in theory)\n\n😕 [b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]\n◾ Progression completely locked behind rare blueprints (and paywalls)\n◾ AI becomes absurdly faster than you — even with perfect runs\n◾ Constant “fuel timers” that stop you from playing\n◾ Free customization at first, but then everything’s paywalled\n◾ Tons of grind, very little reward\n\n💬 It starts as a racing game — and ends as a shopping simulator.\nIf you value fair competition or real progression, don’t waste your time here.",

      "review": "Asphalt Legends promises fast-paced racing thrills, but in reality it’s a frustrating and shallow experience. The game relies heavily on flashy visuals and over-the-top effects, but the core racing mechanics feel unpolished and repetitive. Controls are slippery and inconsistent, making it difficult to execute even basic manoeuvres reliably.\n\nThe progression system is grind-heavy, and unlocking new cars or upgrades feels artificially slow. You spend more time waiting or replaying the same tracks than actually enjoying the races. AI opponents are either too predictable or unfairly aggressive, leading to frequent frustration rather than genuine challenge.\n\nWhile the graphics are flashy, they can’t mask the lack of variety in tracks, events, or gameplay modes. Multiplayer is limited and often unbalanced, with little incentive to stick around once the novelty wears off.\n\nAsphalt Legends has potential as a casual arcade racer, but in practice it’s frustrating, repetitive, and overly reliant on spectacle rather than skill or fun.\n\nFinal Rating: 3.9 / 10\n\nUnpolished controls, grind-heavy progression, and repetitive gameplay make this more frustrating than entertaining.",

Devs don't seem to care much about it. \r\nThe only ones talking in the Steam forum are the players, devs never interact with players. They do seem to monitor the threads though, when game braking bugs are mentioned several times, it's like they get fixed. But not a word. Think of that what you will. \r\nYou find out early on that skill doesn't matter. Money does.. someone said there are three ways to do this: you pay your way, you grind for years or you don't play - there's truth to that statement. \r\nIt IS fun to race and it's a beautiful game, just don't expect to get far without paying for it with real money.
