      "review": "After putting in 150+ hours with FC 24, I can say this entry genuinely hooked me. The gameplay feels more responsive than recent titles, and the new animations make passes, shots, and tackles feel smoother and more realistic. It’s easy to drop in for “just one match” and suddenly realize you’ve been playing for hours.\r\n\r\nCareer Mode and Ultimate Team both have solid depth this year. Building squads, developing players, and experimenting with tactics kept things engaging way longer than I expected. Even when the game gets frustrating (as all football games do), the moment-to-moment action is fun enough to pull you right back in.\r\n\r\nIf you’re into football games, FC 24 is absolutely worth the time — clearly, I spent more than enough hours to prove it.",

      "review": "I mainly enjoy playing Manager Mode, and after spending 320 hours on this game, what I liked most was signing my favorite players, developing the club I love, and leading them to trophies. That whole journey and story was really fun. However, there were a few drawbacks I noticed in Manager Mode. For example, I often saw my strikers suddenly stop in front of goal instead of finishing the chance, and players frequently ignored the tactical instructions I gave them, which was frustrating at times. I was also a bit disappointed that as the years went by in-game, I couldn’t see some of the players still playing in 2025 and 2026.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my time with this game, and as someone who has loved football for a long time and played Manager Mode for many years, I would give it a 7 out of 10 if 10 is a perfect score. With this, I’m saying goodbye and moving on to 26, where I’m excited to start a new Manager Mode, build a fresh squad, and create another fun journey. I’m grateful I was able to play this game for so long, and even though this is a farewell, I’m already looking forward to what’s next in 26.",

Regardless of what some others might say, I feel as if the gameplay has improved to a point where it's base level is perfectly good. It has enough control for you to feel as though you're having an effect on the game, but it's invariables and physics are dynamic enough for unpredictable things to happen. It genuinely feels good to play.\n\nUnfortunately, despite all of this, Electronic Arts continue their tradition of being as hostile as they possibly can towards the people who actually purchase their games. The PC version isn't only poorly optimised, but forces you to install an additional EA program on your computer, which will automatically start when you run the game on Steam. EA Sports FC will then go through a routine comprised of making sure your version of the game is legitimate and constantly trying to connect you to the internet. This whole thing makes loading the game up an unenjoyable experience.\n\nSometimes the game won't start at all. Sometimes it will start but freeze trying to connect you to the internet. Sometimes you will encounter a splash screen within the load-up trying to up-sell you to their newest version of the game. This is often all done with you fighting the noticeable lag on the menus. If you manage to get through all of that, you may encounter a “double controller” glitch which makes you unable to progress to actually play a game. \n\nThis is also all happening under the hood of EA unnecessarily releasing a game every year. Every year, each version of the game becomes redundant. What was once a single-player game continues to have features stripped away in aid of trying to force it's players to interact with it's online market and gambling.\n\nAll of this is to say that the game itself is fun. It is enjoyable. It's football. It should be simple. But ultimately, it's about whether you want to pay for a game made by such an anti-consumer company like EA.",

Regardless of what some others might say, I feel as if the gameplay has improved to a point where it's base level is perfectly good. It has enough control for you to feel as though you're having an effect on the game, but it's invariables and physics are dynamic enough for unpredictable things to happen. It genuinely feels good to play.\n\nUnfortunately, despite all of this, Electronic Arts continue their tradition of being as hostile as they possibly can towards the people who actually purchase their games. The PC version isn't only poorly optimised, but forces you to install an additional EA program on your computer, which will automatically start when you run the game on Steam. EA Sports FC will then go through a routine comprised of making sure your version of the game is legitimate and constantly trying to connect you to the internet. This whole thing makes loading the game up an unenjoyable experience.\n\nSometimes the game won't start at all. Sometimes it will start but freeze trying to connect you to the internet. Sometimes you will encounter a splash screen within the load-up trying to up-sell you to their newest version of the game. This is often all done with you fighting the noticeable lag on the menus. If you manage to get through all of that, you may encounter a “double controller” glitch which makes you unable to progress to actually play a game. \n\nThis is also all happening under the hood of EA unnecessarily releasing a game every year. Every year, each version of the game becomes redundant. What was once a single-player game continues to have features stripped away in aid of trying to force it's players to interact with it's online market and gambling.\n\nAll of this is to say that the game itself is fun.
