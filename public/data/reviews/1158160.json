      "review": "Coral Island is a wonderfully charming and relaxing farming sim that truly captures the spirit of island life. The game combines cozy farming, engaging town relationships, and satisfying exploration in a way that keeps you coming back every day. The art style is vibrant and full of personality, and the island itself feels alive thanks to its diverse environments, wildlife, and beautifully designed characters.\r\n\r\nWhat really stands out is how much there is to do without ever feeling overwhelming. Farming, diving, restoring coral reefs, mining, decorating, befriending villagers, and uncovering the island’s deeper mysteries all blend together naturally. The progression feels rewarding, and the steady updates from the developers show real dedication and passion for improving the game.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy laid-back life sims with heart, stunning visuals, and a sense of adventure, Coral Island is absolutely worth your time. It’s one of those games that makes it easy to lose track of hours in the best possible way. Highly recommended!",

I've tried to get into stuff like Stardew Valley, but they just didn't *click* with me. I don't know what it is about this game in particular, but it's genuinely addicting to play. I'm so addicted. The story is great, character's stories are entertaining, and something about farming/collecting trash in the ocean is so peaceful. \n\n[strike] Only downside that comes to mind is no auto-save. I get that it's trying to be \"immersive\" and whatnot, but if there's any crash (only happened once so far) or if I have to leave the house, I'm either stuck leaving the game open until I get back or forced to redo everything I did that day. [/strike] \n\n**I saw the roadmap for future updates and saw they plan to add manual save! So, for now, my point still stands. But I'm SO happy they plan to add it in the future!! \n\nLast but not least, let us romance Axel and Senja!!! 😡😡",

There are also bugs that need fixing.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that the devs are adding to the game. What was promised is being delivered. Bugs are being dealt with.

Like other reviewers said, it excels at providing diversification and challenge, without overwhelming you or making you feel like you must grind to master skills.

Nearly all of this is a common staple for this type of game, but it does it very well - controls are smooth and intuitive.\n\nAnd while optics to me aren't a main concern, I do take note when they are impressive.

It art is lovely and the music is a vibe even after the unhinged number of hours I’ve put into this game. \n\nI’ve been playing since it was Early Access and it just keeps getting better with every update. And the devs keep updating! Even after all this time they are constantly working on their roadmap, making sure those who backed the game and supported its earl phases get what they paid for. And their Discord is amazing too.\n\nThere is so much to do in game, so much to learn about the island and the people living there. And a ton of side areas to explore. Helping restore the island and ocean was really rewarding and never felt like too much of a grind, especially if you upgraded your tools. There is also a bunch of stuff to catch, grow and find. It’s taken me a while to compete all of the collections for various story parts and I enjoyed all of it (except getting that last fossil), I adore the character art, it makes it incredibly hard to choose someone to marry. And everyone has different outfits for the seasons! \n\nCombat in the mines can be turned off so you can play his game as cosy as you like. And you never feel super rushed to compete things, it’s not really a game that encourages min-maxing either. Once you reach a certain point, money is kind of useless, so it’s more about the experiences and relaxing than freaking out because you didn’t plant a certain crop on a certain day. \n\nA lot of people compare it to SDV… and yeah, I get it. SDV was my first dive into a farming sim game and I checked it out because so many people talked about it like it was the greatest thing since sliced bread, and it was fun, but it felt overhyped. \nHonestly, Coral Island is what I wanted from SDV but never got. It scratched an itch that SDV left behind, and for that reason it would be the farming game I recommend to people over SDV.",

Though, sometimes it seems a bit grindy due to needing money (of course lol) and certain items ,like the most common fish I needed for an errand and never caught :’(. But I love that it never locks you to do anything specific (or at least I haven’t gotten that far, so I am not sure about further in the game), so you can really choose to do whatever you want. And the quests, I’m a sucker for quests, feels like they keep me in the loop but do not lock me into trying to do this one thing, I can quite freely decide what I complete and when. \n\nThe only downside I see in it, is that I wish there was more dialogue and connection build up with the NPC’s. I noticed that you can only answer to them when you’re in scenes with them. When I started playing at least, the things they talked about seemed quite random and not really personal, the only way you can build the friendship is by listening to what they have to say every day or gifting them stuff, doing errands. So I kinda miss the fact that we could exchange a few words here and there. And their character and personality is mostly shown in the events you have with the townies. \n\nI love to pickup my handheld and unwind after a long day at work. I truly recommend this game if you like quests, the farming gameplay, exploration and don’t mind a bit of grind sometimes. I think it’s a great game.",

My wife and I picked this up for some casual multiplayer fun, and we ended up sinking dozens of hours into it.\n\nWhat sets this game apart is the incredible combination of coziness and depth. It’s the kind of game you can settle into with a hot drink and just blissfully potter around in, yet there is so much to unlock, craft, and explore that you always feel like you’re making progress. Honestly, the amount of content already packed in here makes it feel complete—like a 1.0 release that’s been polished for years. Even so, the moment-to-moment gameplay is so satisfying that I find myself constantly hoping the developers are planning more updates, because I simply want more of this world!\n\nThe world-building is top-notch, especially the characters. It's not just a collection of static NPCs; you meet a genuinely wide variety of people, each with their own distinct personalities and backstories. Interacting with them is a huge reward in itself and makes the community aspect of the game feel rich and lived-in.\n\nFinally, the presentation is just gorgeous. The graphics are really cool—they strike the perfect balance between charming aesthetics and clear functionality. Every area is a pleasure to look at. We’ve still got so much to uncover, and I can’t wait to dive back in and keep exploring every nook and cranny. If you're looking for a low-stress, high-reward game with fantastic multiplayer, you need this in your library.",

Seeing characters who look like me and share similar stories, and seeing cultural elements like the jiangshi or pocong decor during the Halloween festival was honestly refreshing.\n\nBut the game also has moments where it feels unfinished. It often opens with noticeable lag that only smooths out later in the in-game day, which suggests optimisation issues. Character models don’t blink, which is something I can personally overlook, but it definitely breaks immersion for some players. Essential mechanics aren’t explained in-game (e.g., ranching and the need for temperature lights), forcing players to rely on the Wiki. Some placeholders remain, like the painting above Nina’s bed when you interact with it. And a few scenes (such as Jim and Sunny’s conversation) contain obvious grammatical and formatting errors, such as missing periods, stray capitalisation and missing spaces, which simply shouldn’t appear in a final release.\n\nOn a minor note, certain plot lines also feel under-explained. The spreading vines around Pufferfish HQ never seemed to get a proper explanation. I also wouldn’t have known Karen had campaign cutscenes if I hadn’t gone digging online. An easy fix is if Karen has her entry in the relationship panel. I don't mind have secret cutscenes but it felt like the Pufferfish plot was supposed to have a stronger focus in the overall story.",

      "review": "⭐ Coral Island Review ⭐\n\n[b]Title: Three Years Later: Beautiful, Buggy, and Still Unfinished 💔[/b]\n\nHours played: 328\n\n🌿 [b]INTRODUCTION: WHY THIS REVIEW EXISTS[/b] 🌿\nThere is a lot I truly like about this game: the graphics, the warmth of the community, the way the townspeople treat each other, the emphasis on nature, and the gentle care for animals. Those values are beautiful, and I love seeing them represented and supported.\n\nI play Coral Island because I genuinely enjoy it, and I have held off writing this review because I hate being unfair. I see the promise, I see the potential. We all did, which is why the game blew past its Kickstarter goals.\n\n🧭 [b]WHERE DEVELOPMENT STANDS AFTER THREE YEARS[/b] 🧭\nIt has been three years, and after roughly 20 million dollars in reported gross revenue, it is time those promises became real.\n\nThree years later, these are the most visible cracks:\n\n* The underwater and merfolk content remain skeletal, teased but not realized. 🧜♀️❌\n\n* The core gameplay loop stays grind heavy, with little meaningful evolution. ⛏️\n\n* Furniture and clothing variety are still limited for a game of this scope. 🪑\n\n* And the bugs persist, reported for months with inconsistent fixes. 🐛🧐\n\nMany design templates are [i]still[/i] placeholders. Clothing colors often fail to match previews, and some furniture pieces do not scale correctly once placed. Much of the catalog feels kitsch or gimmicky, more novelty than livable design. Entire decor sets, such as the East Asian theme, have lacked floor and wall patterns for over two years.\n\nThese may seem small, but small cracks define how a studio treats completion. This is not an early-access title anymore. Stairway promised broad diversity, with each promise becoming a new subsystem scaled across multiple platforms. Ambition is fine, but the fact that it has taken this long, [i]and will likely take longer,[/i] to fix basics is [b]hard[/b] to respect. These accumulated issues reflect a lack of follow-through more than a lack of talent.\n\nWhether it is life-sim customization, underwater dynamics, the mermaid interactions featured on the cover, or even core farming systems, content remains missing or broken. Despite the time and funding, you still cannot even sit in the game outside of certain cutscenes.\n\nAt thirty dollars, Coral Island is marketed as a full release, yet still plays like early access. By rights, it should be listed as such, but Stairway will not make that admission, because doing so would expose the gap between presentation and reality. That is not a small oversight; it is a matter of honesty. 📢\n\nThe studio communicates with warmth, color, and charm, and I appreciate that. But the contrast between that tone and the game’s state can make fair criticism feel unwelcome. Those who question progress are often painted as impatient or unkind.\n\nI am patient. I am understanding.\nI simply do not understand. \n\nThe studio also needs to fulfill its remaining Kickstarter promises and address the dialogue system, which often feels flat, repetitive, or half-implemented. These may sound like polish points, but they define immersion — and for many backers, they were part of what was [i]paid for.[/i]\n\n[b]Coral Island needs to start matching its ideals with execution.[/b] 🔨\n\n⚖️ [b]GOODWILL VS. ACCOUNTABILITY[/b] ⚖️\nThere is a lot of goodwill toward this project, and that is justified. But goodwill is not a shield against accountability.\n\nDevelopers have often spoken about wanting to put Indonesia on the map in global game development, which makes the stagnation more disappointing. Many players genuinely wanted to see that success story fulfilled, [i]and still do.[/i]\n\nAt this stage, Coral Island is not a small indie struggling for survival. With about 20 million dollars in revenue, three years of development, and over 50 staff, it is a mid-tier production with the resources to deliver consistent progress. The “small team, big dream” argument no longer applies.\n\nComparable life sims such as Stardew Valley, My Time at Portia, and My Time at Sandrock achieved broader feature coverage or faster iteration with similar or smaller teams. The bottleneck here appears managerial, not technical.\n\nThat does not make the studio malicious or exploitative. They seem over-ambitious, under-structured, and perhaps too protective of their cozy-indie identity, chasing perfection within self-imposed bottlenecks.\n\n🪞 [b]THE “INDIE” LABEL AND INDUSTRY LANGUAGE[/b] 🪞\nStairway describes itself as an indie studio. That is not untrue. They began that way and remain independent, but the term has stretched. “Indie” now covers everything from solo creators to mid-sized teams with investors and marketing budgets, which Stairway has. They are trying to stay true to their spirit, and I respect that.\n\nHowever, we need better language, because small teams with heart and shoestring budgets — what many still think of as “indie” (and have additional tolerance and patience for) — are not this. WinterSpring, Acute Owl Studio, and Yaldi Games fall more in line with that definition.\n\nThe cozy, community-driven indie identity should represent sincerity and care, not serve as a marketing shield for stagnation or slow delivery. When studios use that tone to soften accountability, they risk the trust that built this genre.\n\n⏳ [b]PLAYER EXPERIENCE: “POTENTIAL PAUSED”[/b] ⏳\nI waited, and kept waiting, so I would not have to write this review. I still get moments of joy here, but also boredom, the sense of [i]potential paused.[/i]\n\nI have played through Coral Island three separate times. Each run halts the same way: the grind builds, progress stalls, and I end up waiting for patches or expansions that never quite land. By the time new content arrives, I have forgotten where I was and what I was doing. I start over, only for the loop to repeat.\n\nThat is what I mean by potential paused. Everything feels [i]almost[/i] ready to bloom yet remains fallow. Coral Island has so much worth loving, and that makes the lack of progress even harder to watch.\n\n💬 [b]FINAL THOUGHTS[/b] 💬\n💡 TL;DR: 328 hours in, Coral Island is still beautiful yet buggy, grind heavy, and half-finished. With around 20 million dollars in revenue and over 50 staff, Stairway Games has outgrown the indie label it hides behind. Strip the polish and see the grain; what remains does not stand up to the light of day in terms of feature completion and polish.\n\nI am not angry. I am sad. I love this game, and so do many of us. The problem is that Coral Island has been so close for far too long. The gap between what was promised and what we have needs to be bridged.\n\nCoral Island remains a beautiful idea. It just deserves to [i]finally become the game we all believed it could be.[/i] 🕊️\n\nIf you buy it right now, can you play it? [b]Yes.[/b] I do, and others do too. But the game hits a plateau, and waiting years for basic updates is disheartening. If you want to support the team, buy them a coffee; they will need the caffeine for the work ahead. The gesture still helps, [b]but hold off on buying the full game if what you want is a [u]completed[/u] one.[/b]",

Records of this affecting people goes back 2 years in some places, you would think it would have been sorted by now. so sadly I gave this review a thumbs down.",

      "review": "Prior to the patch that added multiplayer game play, this game was a lot of fun.  I have just over 700 hours in the game, managed to build my farm up quite a bit (nearly S-tier in all achievement categories), and nearly completed all achievements.  Unfortunately, after the new patch, crashing has become an issue, and the fact that you cannot save the game (it only saves once per day, after each day is completed), I have lost progress every time I turn the game on.  Until it is playable again, I will not be playing Coral Island, and I recommend that if you haven't purchased it, but are thinking about it, that you wait until the game crashing is fixed.  I have sent in a few of my crash logs to the developers.\n\nUp to this point, the game developers have been very active about acknowledging and fixing bugs in a timely manner; however, the game crashing has been affecting many users now for more than a few weeks - myself included.  \n\nWhen the game was working, it was a lot of fun!  Once the game crashing is fixed, I will return to the game.\n\nEDIT: Nov. 23/2025\nI stepped away from the game for a few weeks, and jumped back in yesterday to see if the game was working properly.  I played for almost 3 hours - the game did not crash, and I completed several days (between 15 and 20, sorry, I'm not sure how many it was exactly).  I noticed the number of complaints about crashing are down (not completely eliminated) since mid-October in the Coral Island Discord channel.  Additionally, there has been an update to the game (Nov. 2/25), which addressed several issues, including some that were known to be related to crashing.  I'll continue to play daily, and give another review in a week.\n\nAs I said in my original review, I really enjoyed this game before the recent multiplayer/romance update.  I hope I can get back to that.  On a positive note - yesterday was fun!  I'll continue to play daily, and give another review in a week.\n\nEdit: Nov. 29/2025\nI enjoyed this week.  There was no crashing, and other than a few frame rate drops on my farm (which is quite big, and drops have always occurred), the game ran very smoothly.  I'll play another week, and if this continues, I will recommend the game to other players.",

      "review": "Coral Island is heavily inspired by Stardew Valley. It doesn't revolutionize the genre or add anything new, but as a farm sim, it offers a good experience. However, even though I generally like the game, it still feels incomplete in many aspects, which prevents me from recommending it in its current state.\r\n\r\nThe Good\r\n\r\n-It has a unique identity. It’s inspired by Javanese culture, which is quite refreshing considering that over 90% of games on the market draw inspiration from the typical Japanese, Chinese, European, or American cultures.\r\n\r\n-The Community Center and Museum are well-designed. They consistently give you rewards as you collect items, complete altars, and achieve goals until the town reaches its coveted \"S\" rating.\r\n\r\n-There's sufficient information within the game itself, mainly from the map and the sturdy computer, so I haven't had to constantly exit the game to look for information on a wiki.\r\n\r\n-There are plenty of characters to interact with, and what's most interesting is that as your relationship grows, each heart event connects to the others, telling a small  story.\r\n\r\n-It needs a bit more polish, but I appreciate the existence of automation machines for farming, ranching, and artisan machines. This allows you to focus on other tasks.\r\n\r\n-There are many decorative structures available. Any creative player will really enjoy designing their farms.\r\n\r\n-Storage is universal, which is very convenient when crafting.\r\n\r\nThe Bad\r\n\r\nThe game is currently unstable. There are frequent reports of game crashes and quite annoying sound bugs.\r\n\r\n-The game should had a manual or auto-save option even before the 1.0 release. Having to repeat an entire day's progress, especially after a crash, is very frustrating.\r\n\r\n-The \"hanging out\" activity is terrible. Not only does ignoring it prevent relationship progress, but it also wastes two in-game hours that could be spent on other activities. And it doesn't matter which destination you choose; the character will agree to go anywhere, and you'll just get the generic \"the relationship is growing\" message.\r\n\r\n-In these types of games with large maps, shortcuts or fast travel points that you can unlock early are always appreciated. However, in this game it takes almost the entire first year to access these, by which point you're practically fed up with walking everywhere.\r\n\r\n-It makes no sense to have cooking recipes \"locked\" after a certain heart event with a character or by watching a cooking show, when you can cook manually. With a little common sense, you can deduce simple ingredients (ice cream, fresh salad, grilled fish, etc.) or just check the wiki directly.\r\n\r\n-I'd say the vast majority of the skills you get from leveling up your masteries are useless. Instead of a fixed bonus, they give you laughable probabilities (5% chance to critical strike, 5% chance to obtain double item, 1% chance to drop rare resource, etc.). You don't get the feeling that your character is actually skillful, because you're constantly gambling on chances.\r\n\r\n- It's not a major issue, but the game needs to implement an indicator for every item shipped/purchased. It's incredibly tedious to have to resort to an external spreadsheet with a checklist of what I've obtained and what I'm missing.\r\n\r\n-I feel the underwater farm is poorly implemented: there is very little space to build, the house is tiny and can barely be decorated, the underwater barns are huge and two of them practically take up a third of the space, and except for the auto-petter and the temperature machine, no other equipment can be used underwater.\r\n\r\nThe Worst\r\n\r\n-There is nothing I hate more than developers releasing unfinished content, as it adds little or nothing to the gameplay: a tattoo shop that doesn't do tattoos; children who are basically dolls you can't interact with; cellar space that exists but isn't \"available yet\"; the underwater house being non-upgradable; ocean crops not being usable in cooking recipes or artisan goods; building relationships with two factions (Giants and Merfolks) but having no festivals or activities with them, etc.\r\n\r\n-Maintaining a clean environment and picking up trash is a noble act in real life, but it's a terribly boring chore. I don't understand the developers' vision to make us believe that picking up trash in the game is fun. Want scrap and glass? Pick up trash. Want to catch some nice fish? Oh no, half of what I got is trash. Want to gather resources in the ocean? Pick up trash. Need treasure chests and fossils for the museum? Pick up trash. The townsfolk love their city but constantly throw trash in the ocean. Half the trash is used tires, but there isn't a single vehicle on the town, thinking in this nonsense it's driving me crazy.\r\n\r\n-Once you establish your farming plots and crafting machines and have a good cash flow, the game  ends. There is no compelling late-game content that encourages you to keep playing. You end up swimming in millions with nothing interesting to spend it on, except for super expensive outfits purely for \"bragging rights.\"\r\n\r\n-Completionists like me will hate this point: the only way to get the \"Fashion Guru\" achievement, if you didn't get it before August 21, 2025, is to buy the developers' second game, which \"rewards\" you with an exclusive outfit that is, of course, counted towards the achievement. While no one is forced to do this, I think it's a very dirty move to expect me to spend $5 on another game (which is also incomplete and in Early Access, by the way).\r\n\r\nI will be keeping an eye on new updates because the game has a lot of potential and I hope they fix many of those issues and spark my interest in starting a second playthrough.",

I'm glad the devs stuck to their vision with it. However, this game was released in an unfinished state. I'm not sure why, but it was released unfinished. I took a long break before it was released because the bugs were too many to deal with, Saw it was released, but didn't have time to play for a while. Came back, just a few days ago actually, and I'm still seeing it has bugs. I can't even play more than 2-4 in game days without it randomly crashing. And it's extremely frustrating to play a full day, make a lot of progress, and then it crashes right before you can save it (since it only saves at the end of the day). That has happened to me MULTIPLE times. Apparently, the bugs cropped up because they are trying to add multiplayer. I get people want that, but when the FULL game isn't even finished, why are you trying to add multiplayer??? Now, the game has a crashing issue (along with other issues that I'm, thankfully, not experiencing) and turns a relaxing game into a headache. Especially because it crashes or freezes and then I have to restart my whole computer.\r\n\r\nAnd I really want to like this game, I've got loads of time in it and have been playing since early access, but with it's current issues and unfinished state, I can't recommend it.

I haven't noticed any really glaring bugs, except for losing treasure chests and resources that just sit there in the landscape permanently, forever inaccessible. And I thoroughly enjoyed the game right up until recently. I'm now in Autumn, Year 2.  I finally cleared the caves, and my reward is...okay, now I have to get through another year or so of grinding farming and fishing so I can finally gain access to a locked area so I can find a missing giant. *sigh* I finally got some great agricultural products to display at the harvest festival, but it is becoming obvious that I will always lose miserably to my single opponent - a coarse, narcissistic, ugly guy from another town. I finally cleared the ocean, and my reward is...okay, now I have to farm for the mermaid people, too. *sigh*  More grinding for no real reason. Basically, this is an attempt to clone Stardew Valley and make the graphics superior and add some different challenges. I appreciate that the bugs and fishes are more accurate than in SDV and that there is an underwater component, because I love the ocean, and I appreciate the free fast-travel stuff, but I have to say that that is about all that I see that improves on Stardew Valley. The interpersonal \"events\" are out of order, there are far too many NPCs, the mechanics are too complicated and hard to learn without resorting to asking people on the Internet for hints, and the gameplay is wayyy too grindy with too little reward. Also, once you clear the ocean of its toxins and trash, guess what? The townspeople will continue to litter trash all over it.

      "review": "TL;DR: I’ve enjoyed my time with the game and appreciate how it brings Asian cultures to the global stage, but it still needs proper developer playthroughs and more thorough testing before it can genuinely justify a full-price tag.\n\nI was genuinely delighted by the large cast of Asian characters, especially compared to Stardew Valley, which features charming but predominantly white characters. Seeing characters who look like me and share similar stories, and seeing cultural elements like the jiangshi or pocong decor during the Halloween festival was honestly refreshing.\n\nBut the game also has moments where it feels unfinished. It often opens with noticeable lag that only smooths out later in the in-game day, which suggests optimisation issues. Character models don’t blink, which is something I can personally overlook, but it definitely breaks immersion for some players. Essential mechanics aren’t explained in-game (e.g., ranching and the need for temperature lights), forcing players to rely on the Wiki. Some placeholders remain, like the painting above Nina’s bed when you interact with it. And a few scenes (such as Jim and Sunny’s conversation) contain obvious grammatical and formatting errors, such as missing periods, stray capitalisation and missing spaces, which simply shouldn’t appear in a final release.\n\nOn a minor note, certain plot lines also feel under-explained. The spreading vines around Pufferfish HQ never seemed to get a proper explanation. I also wouldn’t have known Karen had campaign cutscenes if I hadn’t gone digging online. An easy fix is if Karen has her entry in the relationship panel. I don't mind have secret cutscenes but it felt like the Pufferfish plot was supposed to have a stronger focus in the overall story.",

Reiterating the point that this game should still be labelled early access, not full release.\n\nEDIT 28/10/25: Patch 1242 is still the live patch and the issues around the fishing noises and the black market remain outstanding. It's a good game, but labelling it finished and complete and charging $45 AUD for it is a bit disingenuous; it's still an early access title.",

      "review": "⭐ Coral Island Review ⭐\n\n[b]Title: Three Years Later: Beautiful, Buggy, and Still Unfinished 💔[/b]\n\nHours played: 328\n\n🌿 [b]INTRODUCTION: WHY THIS REVIEW EXISTS[/b] 🌿\nThere is a lot I truly like about this game: the graphics, the warmth of the community, the way the townspeople treat each other, the emphasis on nature, and the gentle care for animals. Those values are beautiful, and I love seeing them represented and supported.\n\nI play Coral Island because I genuinely enjoy it, and I have held off writing this review because I hate being unfair. I see the promise, I see the potential. We all did, which is why the game blew past its Kickstarter goals.\n\n🧭 [b]WHERE DEVELOPMENT STANDS AFTER THREE YEARS[/b] 🧭\nIt has been three years, and after roughly 20 million dollars in reported gross revenue, it is time those promises became real.\n\nThree years later, these are the most visible cracks:\n\n* The underwater and merfolk content remain skeletal, teased but not realized. 🧜♀️❌\n\n* The core gameplay loop stays grind heavy, with little meaningful evolution. ⛏️\n\n* Furniture and clothing variety are still limited for a game of this scope. 🪑\n\n* And the bugs persist, reported for months with inconsistent fixes. 🐛🧐\n\nMany design templates are [i]still[/i] placeholders. Clothing colors often fail to match previews, and some furniture pieces do not scale correctly once placed. Much of the catalog feels kitsch or gimmicky, more novelty than livable design. Entire decor sets, such as the East Asian theme, have lacked floor and wall patterns for over two years.\n\nThese may seem small, but small cracks define how a studio treats completion. This is not an early-access title anymore. Stairway promised broad diversity, with each promise becoming a new subsystem scaled across multiple platforms. Ambition is fine, but the fact that it has taken this long, [i]and will likely take longer,[/i] to fix basics is [b]hard[/b] to respect. These accumulated issues reflect a lack of follow-through more than a lack of talent.\n\nWhether it is life-sim customization, underwater dynamics, the mermaid interactions featured on the cover, or even core farming systems, content remains missing or broken. Despite the time and funding, you still cannot even sit in the game outside of certain cutscenes.\n\nAt thirty dollars, Coral Island is marketed as a full release, yet still plays like early access. By rights, it should be listed as such, but Stairway will not make that admission, because doing so would expose the gap between presentation and reality. That is not a small oversight; it is a matter of honesty. 📢\n\nThe studio communicates with warmth, color, and charm, and I appreciate that. But the contrast between that tone and the game’s state can make fair criticism feel unwelcome. Those who question progress are often painted as impatient or unkind.\n\nI am patient. I am understanding.\nI simply do not understand. \n\nThe studio also needs to fulfill its remaining Kickstarter promises and address the dialogue system, which often feels flat, repetitive, or half-implemented. These may sound like polish points, but they define immersion — and for many backers, they were part of what was [i]paid for.[/i]\n\n[b]Coral Island needs to start matching its ideals with execution.[/b] 🔨\n\n⚖️ [b]GOODWILL VS. ACCOUNTABILITY[/b] ⚖️\nThere is a lot of goodwill toward this project, and that is justified. But goodwill is not a shield against accountability.\n\nDevelopers have often spoken about wanting to put Indonesia on the map in global game development, which makes the stagnation more disappointing. Many players genuinely wanted to see that success story fulfilled, [i]and still do.[/i]\n\nAt this stage, Coral Island is not a small indie struggling for survival. With about 20 million dollars in revenue, three years of development, and over 50 staff, it is a mid-tier production with the resources to deliver consistent progress. The “small team, big dream” argument no longer applies.\n\nComparable life sims such as Stardew Valley, My Time at Portia, and My Time at Sandrock achieved broader feature coverage or faster iteration with similar or smaller teams. The bottleneck here appears managerial, not technical.\n\nThat does not make the studio malicious or exploitative. They seem over-ambitious, under-structured, and perhaps too protective of their cozy-indie identity, chasing perfection within self-imposed bottlenecks.\n\n🪞 [b]THE “INDIE” LABEL AND INDUSTRY LANGUAGE[/b] 🪞\nStairway describes itself as an indie studio. That is not untrue. They began that way and remain independent, but the term has stretched. “Indie” now covers everything from solo creators to mid-sized teams with investors and marketing budgets, which Stairway has. They are trying to stay true to their spirit, and I respect that.\n\nHowever, we need better language, because small teams with heart and shoestring budgets — what many still think of as “indie” (and have additional tolerance and patience for) — are not this. WinterSpring, Acute Owl Studio, and Yaldi Games fall more in line with that definition.\n\nThe cozy, community-driven indie identity should represent sincerity and care, not serve as a marketing shield for stagnation or slow delivery. When studios use that tone to soften accountability, they risk the trust that built this genre.\n\n⏳ [b]PLAYER EXPERIENCE: “POTENTIAL PAUSED”[/b] ⏳\nI waited, and kept waiting, so I would not have to write this review. I still get moments of joy here, but also boredom, the sense of [i]potential paused.[/i]\n\nI have played through Coral Island three separate times. Each run halts the same way: the grind builds, progress stalls, and I end up waiting for patches or expansions that never quite land. By the time new content arrives, I have forgotten where I was and what I was doing. I start over, only for the loop to repeat.\n\nThat is what I mean by potential paused. Everything feels [i]almost[/i] ready to bloom yet remains fallow. Coral Island has so much worth loving, and that makes the lack of progress even harder to watch.\n\n💬 [b]FINAL THOUGHTS[/b] 💬\n💡 TL;DR: 328 hours in, Coral Island is still beautiful yet buggy, grind heavy, and half-finished. With around 20 million dollars in revenue and over 50 staff, Stairway Games has outgrown the indie label it hides behind. Strip the polish and see the grain; what remains does not stand up to the light of day in terms of feature completion and polish.\n\nI am not angry. I am sad. I love this game, and so do many of us. The problem is that Coral Island has been so close for far too long. The gap between what was promised and what we have needs to be bridged.\n\nCoral Island remains a beautiful idea. It just deserves to [i]finally become the game we all believed it could be.[/i] 🕊️\n\nIf you buy it right now, can you play it? [b]Yes.[/b] I do, and others do too. But the game hits a plateau, and waiting years for basic updates is disheartening. If you want to support the team, buy them a coffee; they will need the caffeine for the work ahead. The gesture still helps, [b]but hold off on buying the full game if what you want is a [u]completed[/u] one.[/b]",

The game randomly(seemingly randomly) throws an error when it tries to save, and you have to manually restore a backed up save file and lose any progress between the backup and when you quit the game, which feels really bad and eats away at your motivation to play the game, wondering if it will happen again and mess with your progress, I was only 5 game days in when it happened. Records of this affecting people goes back 2 years in some places, you would think it would have been sorted by now. so sadly I gave this review a thumbs down.",

      "review": "Prior to the patch that added multiplayer game play, this game was a lot of fun.  I have just over 700 hours in the game, managed to build my farm up quite a bit (nearly S-tier in all achievement categories), and nearly completed all achievements.  Unfortunately, after the new patch, crashing has become an issue, and the fact that you cannot save the game (it only saves once per day, after each day is completed), I have lost progress every time I turn the game on.  Until it is playable again, I will not be playing Coral Island, and I recommend that if you haven't purchased it, but are thinking about it, that you wait until the game crashing is fixed.  I have sent in a few of my crash logs to the developers.\n\nUp to this point, the game developers have been very active about acknowledging and fixing bugs in a timely manner; however, the game crashing has been affecting many users now for more than a few weeks - myself included.  \n\nWhen the game was working, it was a lot of fun!  Once the game crashing is fixed, I will return to the game.\n\nEDIT: Nov. 23/2025\nI stepped away from the game for a few weeks, and jumped back in yesterday to see if the game was working properly.  I played for almost 3 hours - the game did not crash, and I completed several days (between 15 and 20, sorry, I'm not sure how many it was exactly).  I noticed the number of complaints about crashing are down (not completely eliminated) since mid-October in the Coral Island Discord channel.  Additionally, there has been an update to the game (Nov. 2/25), which addressed several issues, including some that were known to be related to crashing.  I'll continue to play daily, and give another review in a week.\n\nAs I said in my original review, I really enjoyed this game before the recent multiplayer/romance update.  I hope I can get back to that.  On a positive note - yesterday was fun!  I'll continue to play daily, and give another review in a week.\n\nEdit: Nov. 29/2025\nI enjoyed this week.  There was no crashing, and other than a few frame rate drops on my farm (which is quite big, and drops have always occurred), the game ran very smoothly.  I'll play another week, and if this continues, I will recommend the game to other players.",

      "review": "Coral Island is heavily inspired by Stardew Valley. It doesn't revolutionize the genre or add anything new, but as a farm sim, it offers a good experience. However, even though I generally like the game, it still feels incomplete in many aspects, which prevents me from recommending it in its current state.\r\n\r\nThe Good\r\n\r\n-It has a unique identity. It’s inspired by Javanese culture, which is quite refreshing considering that over 90% of games on the market draw inspiration from the typical Japanese, Chinese, European, or American cultures.\r\n\r\n-The Community Center and Museum are well-designed. They consistently give you rewards as you collect items, complete altars, and achieve goals until the town reaches its coveted \"S\" rating.\r\n\r\n-There's sufficient information within the game itself, mainly from the map and the sturdy computer, so I haven't had to constantly exit the game to look for information on a wiki.\r\n\r\n-There are plenty of characters to interact with, and what's most interesting is that as your relationship grows, each heart event connects to the others, telling a small  story.\r\n\r\n-It needs a bit more polish, but I appreciate the existence of automation machines for farming, ranching, and artisan machines. This allows you to focus on other tasks.\r\n\r\n-There are many decorative structures available. Any creative player will really enjoy designing their farms.\r\n\r\n-Storage is universal, which is very convenient when crafting.\r\n\r\nThe Bad\r\n\r\nThe game is currently unstable. There are frequent reports of game crashes and quite annoying sound bugs.\r\n\r\n-The game should had a manual or auto-save option even before the 1.0 release. Having to repeat an entire day's progress, especially after a crash, is very frustrating.\r\n\r\n-The \"hanging out\" activity is terrible. Not only does ignoring it prevent relationship progress, but it also wastes two in-game hours that could be spent on other activities. And it doesn't matter which destination you choose; the character will agree to go anywhere, and you'll just get the generic \"the relationship is growing\" message.\r\n\r\n-In these types of games with large maps, shortcuts or fast travel points that you can unlock early are always appreciated. However, in this game it takes almost the entire first year to access these, by which point you're practically fed up with walking everywhere.\r\n\r\n-It makes no sense to have cooking recipes \"locked\" after a certain heart event with a character or by watching a cooking show, when you can cook manually. With a little common sense, you can deduce simple ingredients (ice cream, fresh salad, grilled fish, etc.) or just check the wiki directly.\r\n\r\n-I'd say the vast majority of the skills you get from leveling up your masteries are useless. Instead of a fixed bonus, they give you laughable probabilities (5% chance to critical strike, 5% chance to obtain double item, 1% chance to drop rare resource, etc.). You don't get the feeling that your character is actually skillful, because you're constantly gambling on chances.\r\n\r\n- It's not a major issue, but the game needs to implement an indicator for every item shipped/purchased. It's incredibly tedious to have to resort to an external spreadsheet with a checklist of what I've obtained and what I'm missing.\r\n\r\n-I feel the underwater farm is poorly implemented: there is very little space to build, the house is tiny and can barely be decorated, the underwater barns are huge and two of them practically take up a third of the space, and except for the auto-petter and the temperature machine, no other equipment can be used underwater.\r\n\r\nThe Worst\r\n\r\n-There is nothing I hate more than developers releasing unfinished content, as it adds little or nothing to the gameplay: a tattoo shop that doesn't do tattoos; children who are basically dolls you can't interact with; cellar space that exists but isn't \"available yet\"; the underwater house being non-upgradable; ocean crops not being usable in cooking recipes or artisan goods; building relationships with two factions (Giants and Merfolks) but having no festivals or activities with them, etc.\r\n\r\n-Maintaining a clean environment and picking up trash is a noble act in real life, but it's a terribly boring chore. I don't understand the developers' vision to make us believe that picking up trash in the game is fun. Want scrap and glass? Pick up trash. Want to catch some nice fish? Oh no, half of what I got is trash. Want to gather resources in the ocean? Pick up trash. Need treasure chests and fossils for the museum? Pick up trash. The townsfolk love their city but constantly throw trash in the ocean. Half the trash is used tires, but there isn't a single vehicle on the town, thinking in this nonsense it's driving me crazy.\r\n\r\n-Once you establish your farming plots and crafting machines and have a good cash flow, the game  ends. There is no compelling late-game content that encourages you to keep playing. You end up swimming in millions with nothing interesting to spend it on, except for super expensive outfits purely for \"bragging rights.\"\r\n\r\n-Completionists like me will hate this point: the only way to get the \"Fashion Guru\" achievement, if you didn't get it before August 21, 2025, is to buy the developers' second game, which \"rewards\" you with an exclusive outfit that is, of course, counted towards the achievement. While no one is forced to do this, I think it's a very dirty move to expect me to spend $5 on another game (which is also incomplete and in Early Access, by the way).\r\n\r\nI will be keeping an eye on new updates because the game has a lot of potential and I hope they fix many of those issues and spark my interest in starting a second playthrough.",
