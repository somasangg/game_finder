This version I like better due to being able to play with others through steam remote play, which allows people to play with you even if they do not own the game. From what I have heard from others the game plays well with minimal lag as I am the one who hosts the game. Would recommend when on sale or have a group of friends each pitch in for one copy so one person can own the game and everyone can play. Looking forward to Ultimate Sheep Raccoon if that also supports remote play and plays as well or better than the original.",
