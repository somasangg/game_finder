This game, [i]Bloob's Adventure Idle,[/i] is like if Tarn Adams of DF fame decided to create an idle grindy crafty game.  Dev starts game with huge to-do list to start and keeps thinking of stuff to throw in, releases game soon after it's in a playable state, eternal early access.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are Bloob, a creature resembling a [i]Dragon Quest[/i] slime, who woke up one day with very little memory of who or what you are, but with an intense drive to go train up in various skills.  Despite the fact that you are not exactly humanoid, these skills are the usual RPG ones and take standard human equipment.  Your slimeball form can craft and shoot arrows, mine and forge, and wear standard human armor.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two play modes to choose, Normal and Turbo, and you can't switch once you start your game.  Turbo runs the game at 10x speed.  The mere fact that the game has this option should tell you just what you are in for.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou start in or near a small town with a shop and a few basic crafting stations stashed in various buildings.\r\n\r\nThe world map is a tad confusing at first, as if the dev just kept throwing in new features, and some resource/enemy locations are not all that intuitive.  At certain zoom levels, it's a bit hard to tell what's what, but tooltips help.\r\n\r\nFortunately, there are several auto-move features built in.  A list of what all you can do in most skills is available with just a click or two, and you can click on that item in the skill UI to automatically go to it.  Some skills have handy shortcut buttons to take you to its crafting station.  There are a couple handy teleport buttons around the small world map in the upper right corner, and some more teleport spells available once you start crafting runes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe skills you can do are all interconnected to one degree or another.  There's the basic fighting skills of melee, magic, and ranged.  Each has weapons that can be crafted from harvested materials.  Magic also requires runic slates that must be crafted and then imbued at an altar with a specific rune.  Each style has its own armor that gives penalties for the other two styles.\r\n\r\nCombat damage is healed with food, which can be cooked.  Right now, the food recipes are just simply cooked meat or fish.  However, the dev is said to be working on a farming skill that will allow you to cook vegetarian meals.\r\n\r\nFood right now can be stolen from stalls or harvested from animals.  Besides killing animals for standard combat xp, food animals can be fished up or tracked and trapped.\r\n\r\nHerbology creates potions for various buffs.  Herbs are foraged.  Even the vials have to be crafted from glass made from sand from mined sandstone, and then filled with well water in another crafting move.\r\n\r\nThen there are the several support skills.  Wood can be cut for weapons and used to make fires.  You can craft urns and sacrifice the bones of your fallen enemies for Devotion points that can be used for temporary buffs.\r\n\r\nBeastmastery is about killing instead of taming, and is based on bounties for kill quests.  Points earned here can be redeemed at the Beastmaster for resource packs, extra inventory slots, and some upgrades.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou earn XP in each skill as you use them.  Reaching level 100 in a skill allows you to prestige it.  This sends you back to the beginning, but with a nice boost to XP earning.  Prestiging craft skills allows for a chance at an instant craft.  Magic and Range combat prestige gives a chance at a free cast/shot.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the more interesting skills to prestige is Dexterity.  This isn't a dodge stat.  It's simply run speed.  Leveling up Dexterity increases your speed.\r\n\r\nThere's not yet an offline task XP earning mechanic, so instead, you gain hours spent offline.  These hours are put into a bank for you to spend at double time and 3x speeds.\r\n\r\nThis bank begins at an already generous 36 hours.  At 3x speed, you can spend twelve hours at that speed.  At default speeds, you'll be wanted to speed things up a bit, so this bank comes in quite handy.\r\n\r\nPrestiging Dexterity adds to base run speed and increases the bank for the hours you get to spend at extra speed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe game runs well in the background.  However, early on, and after prestiging a skill, you'll have to babysit the game.  Inventory slots have infinite stacks, so running out of room for a product isn't a problem so long as you have a slot free.  But you'll have a limited number of slots at first and will need to either sell some items or offload them into a bank (more like a large vault).\r\n\r\nYour bank/vault slots are limited in number but also infinite in stacks.  You buy more slots with the gold you earn, mostly from selling loot and crafted items.\r\n\r\nAnother reason to babysit the game is to catch when you run out of ammo or imbued slates or crafting materials.  Or, you know, die.  Fortunately, you instantly respawn in the central town and have infinite lives.\r\n\r\nIf you're AFK for a while, the game recently added a feature that adds time spent not earning XP back into the banked hours for extra speed.  So you don't have to be too obsessive about checking the game.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a cool, fun game, and extremely cheap compared to the many hours you might put into it.  It's best played in long spurts, like while you're working on something.  Levels are earned fairly quickly, especially at 3x speed or in Turbo mode.\r\n\r\nBut you can also chip away at it a few minutes at a time.  Even the combat skills that require you to make ammo, Range and Magic, don't feel too much of a chore to level up, especially since you're leveling up the crafting skills as you make more ammo.\r\n\r\nIf you aren't afraid of committing to a game for the next decade of your life, come play as Bloob!",

Going from one task to another is easy, however, each can quickly become complex. X requires Y which requires Z and suddenly you find yourself needing A and B! Each skill is intertwined with another requiring the player to engage and rely on more than one to boost another! if you find that overwhelming, no worries! Bloob can simply stick to one task and store away the resources for another day. You create your Bloob's journey.\n\nIf you're looking for an Runescape-esque game with a little goober running around, collecting resources at your whim for your arbitrary goal, this is it. With colorful designs, customization, and befitting sound effects/music, there is much to enjoy about Bloobs Idle Adventure. 10/10 would Bloob again.",

      "review": "TL;DR Give it a shot, it's free! It's a delightful idle game, but definitely slow to progress and with no* offline progression.\r\n\r\n*- OK let's start with that caveat. To be technical, the big innovation for Bloobs Adventure Idle is that all of your progression is almost sort of offline-gated: Time spent offline or fully AFK (IE, doing nothing) produces Banked Time. You can spend this ~1:1 to double the game's tickrate, or ~3:1 to triple it. So for 16 hours spent offline, you can spend 8 hours online going much faster. This is neat! It enforces a cap to offline 'gains', and it's got a good cadence. The downside is that the multipliers, 2x and 3x, are WAY too slow. This game is glacial to the point of self-parody on 1x, and even at 3x it's kinda grindy.\r\n\r\nOK on with the bulk of the actual review: Bloobs is great! It's Runescape minus all of the worst parts but plus a few new worst parts (looking at you, Beastmastery balancing and Trapping progression) in an act of equivalent exchange. The art is cute, the developer is constantly on the ball and keeping things updated, and the diversity of skills is really fun to mess around with. At time of writing the first new skill since I started playing just got added today, Homesteading, a sort of combo player housing / Farming deal, and it's very slick.\r\n\r\nMy advice if you're gonna try the game? Don't bother with non-melee combat for anything progression related, just come back and grind Magic and Ranged later. Do Beastmastery as often as possible when you are fighting for stuff, and ideally get Auto Beastmaster early and then grind the 5 point missions: Anything seemingly higher-value is actually much lower value due to higher kill requirements and bad KPM, even with improved gear.\r\n\r\nRegardless, it's free and absolutely worth trying out.",

I never played RuneScape in the past (which this is similar to), but I have played a good number of idle games and I like this one perhaps the most.\n\nIt doesn't punish you for turning it off, you instead get banked time which doubles or triples your speed, but I would suggest always just doubling speed. If you have a normal sleep schedule, you'll basically always be playing at 2x speed. It's awesome.\n\nThe game is a little bit confusing but I honestly enjoyed trying to figure out the stuff that confused me. The 'how to play' bit isn't really that in-depth, but again, this was oddly a positive for me.\n\nThe achievements aren't that hard, they just need time, which is perfect for a mostly idle game.\n\nThe only thing I really want to see change is some sort of visual change in Bloob to show what armour the lil guy is wearing. I can see that being a pain in the ass for the dev though, but still, it'd add more depth and be more rewarding to see him wearing what I've spent time crafting for him.\n\nAlso, more skills would be cool, but that will never not be true. Some ideas for that, swimming (to gain access to distant islands or, like, underwater dungeons), diving (or breathe holding, hand in hand with swimming), flying (gain access to flying islands. would be a lot of work since it would need said flying islands), scavenging (you just find random stuff). Basically, if you add more content to fill in the space between level 200 and level 1000, I would suggest doing it by adding new types of areas that have new types of skills.\n\nSo all in all, I greatly recommend this if you are even remotely interested in idle games.

Magic and Range combat prestige gives a chance at a free cast/shot.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the more interesting skills to prestige is Dexterity.  This isn't a dodge stat.  It's simply run speed.  Leveling up Dexterity increases your speed.\r\n\r\nThere's not yet an offline task XP earning mechanic, so instead, you gain hours spent offline.  These hours are put into a bank for you to spend at double time and 3x speeds.\r\n\r\nThis bank begins at an already generous 36 hours.  At 3x speed, you can spend twelve hours at that speed.  At default speeds, you'll be wanted to speed things up a bit, so this bank comes in quite handy.\r\n\r\nPrestiging Dexterity adds to base run speed and increases the bank for the hours you get to spend at extra speed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe game runs well in the background.  However, early on, and after prestiging a skill, you'll have to babysit the game.  Inventory slots have infinite stacks, so running out of room for a product isn't a problem so long as you have a slot free.  But you'll have a limited number of slots at first and will need to either sell some items or offload them into a bank (more like a large vault).\r\n\r\nYour bank/vault slots are limited in number but also infinite in stacks.  You buy more slots with the gold you earn, mostly from selling loot and crafted items.\r\n\r\nAnother reason to babysit the game is to catch when you run out of ammo or imbued slates or crafting materials.  Or, you know, die.  Fortunately, you instantly respawn in the central town and have infinite lives.\r\n\r\nIf you're AFK for a while, the game recently added a feature that adds time spent not earning XP back into the banked hours for extra speed.  So you don't have to be too obsessive about checking the game.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a cool, fun game, and extremely cheap compared to the many hours you might put into it.  It's best played in long spurts, like while you're working on something.  Levels are earned fairly quickly, especially at 3x speed or in Turbo mode.\r\n\r\nBut you can also chip away at it a few minutes at a time.  Even the combat skills that require you to make ammo, Range and Magic, don't feel too much of a chore to level up, especially since you're leveling up the crafting skills as you make more ammo.\r\n\r\nIf you aren't afraid of committing to a game for the next decade of your life, come play as Bloob!",

      "review": "TL;DR Give it a shot, it's free! It's a delightful idle game, but definitely slow to progress and with no* offline progression.\r\n\r\n*- OK let's start with that caveat. To be technical, the big innovation for Bloobs Adventure Idle is that all of your progression is almost sort of offline-gated: Time spent offline or fully AFK (IE, doing nothing) produces Banked Time. You can spend this ~1:1 to double the game's tickrate, or ~3:1 to triple it. So for 16 hours spent offline, you can spend 8 hours online going much faster. This is neat! It enforces a cap to offline 'gains', and it's got a good cadence. The downside is that the multipliers, 2x and 3x, are WAY too slow. This game is glacial to the point of self-parody on 1x, and even at 3x it's kinda grindy.\r\n\r\nOK on with the bulk of the actual review: Bloobs is great! It's Runescape minus all of the worst parts but plus a few new worst parts (looking at you, Beastmastery balancing and Trapping progression) in an act of equivalent exchange. The art is cute, the developer is constantly on the ball and keeping things updated, and the diversity of skills is really fun to mess around with. At time of writing the first new skill since I started playing just got added today, Homesteading, a sort of combo player housing / Farming deal, and it's very slick.\r\n\r\nMy advice if you're gonna try the game? Don't bother with non-melee combat for anything progression related, just come back and grind Magic and Ranged later. Do Beastmastery as often as possible when you are fighting for stuff, and ideally get Auto Beastmaster early and then grind the 5 point missions: Anything seemingly higher-value is actually much lower value due to higher kill requirements and bad KPM, even with improved gear.\r\n\r\nRegardless, it's free and absolutely worth trying out.",

The distinct lack of punishment for not having the game running, or not catching something right as the smithing queue ends.\n\nThe game has 2 primary layer to prevent the \"OMG IM MISSING EXP\" feeling that you get from RuneScape. \n\nThe first is a starting \"AFK\" timer of 36 hours (this can be further increased to 96 hours with game play - NOT pay to win.) This timer starts after 5 minutes of inactivity, or when the game is closed. This time can be redeemed at 100% via a \"double the speed\" mechanic.\n\nThe second is, after prestiging most skills once, an \"auto-[skill]\" system. This allows you to fully afk a skill when time just doesn't allow more intricate game play.\n\nHighly recommend for anyone craving RuneScape like gameplay, without the time commitments.",

I would rate it a 8/10 or something, but i think with a few changes it could easily be a way better game through some seeming simple quality of life [a] the settings menu should have more options for user's to control the experience such as changing notification volume and how the 'auto' systems work [b] speaking of 'auto' systems, i think they could use another look because sometimes they're a bit clunky. a good example is potions and invocations, it's very easy to forget to switch potions/invos so I often find myself not using them. I think it might be worth looking into the 'auto' systems and basically having a whole section of the settings menu dedicated to management of auto systems like setting loadouts for potions/invos (kind of like how melvor implements potions) [c] does auto teleports even work? seems like when i turn it on my bloob still walks everywhere. I'm sure an experienced player can remember all teleports and do well to use them wisely, but i don't know as a new player I sometimes don't worry about it and let my guy walk to destination [d] it might help if the game messages stayed on the screen longer such as having a toggle-able chatbox where they print out and you can read it going back in time by scrolling & maybe filter it in certain ways like only showing the 1st actions in a chain of actions [e] might be nice to have some quests that teach systems of the game that aren't obvious. i guess what i mean is that it's relatively simple to start skilling and combat and stuff but i often find myself never being curious about npc's or anything in the world that's outside of the skilling interfaces because the natural way most players will start playing is by realizing they can click things in the skilling menus to initiate doing that action or at least head to the place to do it. I'm still planning to play a lot and progress, but some people might be turned off by lack of quests/narrative and some of these other quality of life things i mentioned above. overall really fun game though, I have it running all day while working and during leisure time",

      "review": "Simply the best Idle Game I have ever played.\r\n\r\nIt combines RuneScape levelling, with endless QoL features to make the Idle game aspect work alongside it really well. The balance of interaction and idling in this game is fantastic, and makes progression feel more personal knowing theres no wrong path to take in your Bloobs Adventure.\r\nOne of the neat features included is called [b]Banked Time[/b], saving any time away from the game, weather closed or AFK, and being able to use that time as a 2x or 3x Speed boost that can be toggled on to help catch up on lost time.\r\n\r\nThe art style, sound design and overall pacing of the game is charming and makes the whole world of your Bloobs feel alive and engaged with the details you come across. \r\n\r\nCombat in Bloobs will reward you for being prepared long term, along with combining other skills to improve your stats. Everything feels connected amongst your Bloobs Idle World and you will find many skills compliment each other to help levelling faster. Some skills will feel slow to begin with but the snowball effect eventually takes over and feels very satisfying when you plan everything out perfectly to get that one skill to that certain level.\r\n\r\nFinally the Dev is just a straight up fantastic bloke, constantly working on the game to bring out updates and fixes that any Bloobs come across, always open to ideas and listening for feedback. A one man army indeed. \r\nWith there being a new skill coming out very soon, along with the huge amount of content already available, you should definitely give this one a go.",

      "review": "This game is great. I never played RuneScape in the past (which this is similar to), but I have played a good number of idle games and I like this one perhaps the most.\n\nIt doesn't punish you for turning it off, you instead get banked time which doubles or triples your speed, but I would suggest always just doubling speed. If you have a normal sleep schedule, you'll basically always be playing at 2x speed. It's awesome.\n\nThe game is a little bit confusing but I honestly enjoyed trying to figure out the stuff that confused me. The 'how to play' bit isn't really that in-depth, but again, this was oddly a positive for me.\n\nThe achievements aren't that hard, they just need time, which is perfect for a mostly idle game.\n\nThe only thing I really want to see change is some sort of visual change in Bloob to show what armour the lil guy is wearing. I can see that being a pain in the ass for the dev though, but still, it'd add more depth and be more rewarding to see him wearing what I've spent time crafting for him.\n\nAlso, more skills would be cool, but that will never not be true. Some ideas for that, swimming (to gain access to distant islands or, like, underwater dungeons), diving (or breathe holding, hand in hand with swimming), flying (gain access to flying islands. would be a lot of work since it would need said flying islands), scavenging (you just find random stuff). Basically, if you add more content to fill in the space between level 200 and level 1000, I would suggest doing it by adding new types of areas that have new types of skills.\n\nSo all in all, I greatly recommend this if you are even remotely interested in idle games. It's among the best.",

It makes progression feel very fun no matter what I'm doing instead of the stress that something like Melvor can induce where I'm looking at one thing I want to do but then taking 10 steps back to stack as many bonuses as possible first.

      "review": "[h1]Idle Grindy Crafty Fun![/h1]\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay, I'm just gonna warn you right away:  You will spend thousands and [b][i]THOUSANDS[/i][/b] of hours in this game.\r\n\r\nSeriously.\r\n\r\nI'm posting at a thousand hours in, and I've barely made a dent in the content the dev already has in (content up to level 200), and he plans on extending content up to freaking level 1000!\r\n\r\n[i]Dwarf Fortress[/i] fans can relate.  This game, [i]Bloob's Adventure Idle,[/i] is like if Tarn Adams of DF fame decided to create an idle grindy crafty game.  Dev starts game with huge to-do list to start and keeps thinking of stuff to throw in, releases game soon after it's in a playable state, eternal early access.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are Bloob, a creature resembling a [i]Dragon Quest[/i] slime, who woke up one day with very little memory of who or what you are, but with an intense drive to go train up in various skills.  Despite the fact that you are not exactly humanoid, these skills are the usual RPG ones and take standard human equipment.  Your slimeball form can craft and shoot arrows, mine and forge, and wear standard human armor.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two play modes to choose, Normal and Turbo, and you can't switch once you start your game.  Turbo runs the game at 10x speed.  The mere fact that the game has this option should tell you just what you are in for.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou start in or near a small town with a shop and a few basic crafting stations stashed in various buildings.\r\n\r\nThe world map is a tad confusing at first, as if the dev just kept throwing in new features, and some resource/enemy locations are not all that intuitive.  At certain zoom levels, it's a bit hard to tell what's what, but tooltips help.\r\n\r\nFortunately, there are several auto-move features built in.  A list of what all you can do in most skills is available with just a click or two, and you can click on that item in the skill UI to automatically go to it.  Some skills have handy shortcut buttons to take you to its crafting station.  There are a couple handy teleport buttons around the small world map in the upper right corner, and some more teleport spells available once you start crafting runes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe skills you can do are all interconnected to one degree or another.  There's the basic fighting skills of melee, magic, and ranged.  Each has weapons that can be crafted from harvested materials.  Magic also requires runic slates that must be crafted and then imbued at an altar with a specific rune.  Each style has its own armor that gives penalties for the other two styles.\r\n\r\nCombat damage is healed with food, which can be cooked.  Right now, the food recipes are just simply cooked meat or fish.  However, the dev is said to be working on a farming skill that will allow you to cook vegetarian meals.\r\n\r\nFood right now can be stolen from stalls or harvested from animals.  Besides killing animals for standard combat xp, food animals can be fished up or tracked and trapped.\r\n\r\nHerbology creates potions for various buffs.  Herbs are foraged.  Even the vials have to be crafted from glass made from sand from mined sandstone, and then filled with well water in another crafting move.\r\n\r\nThen there are the several support skills.  Wood can be cut for weapons and used to make fires.  You can craft urns and sacrifice the bones of your fallen enemies for Devotion points that can be used for temporary buffs.\r\n\r\nBeastmastery is about killing instead of taming, and is based on bounties for kill quests.  Points earned here can be redeemed at the Beastmaster for resource packs, extra inventory slots, and some upgrades.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou earn XP in each skill as you use them.  Reaching level 100 in a skill allows you to prestige it.  This sends you back to the beginning, but with a nice boost to XP earning.  Prestiging craft skills allows for a chance at an instant craft.  Magic and Range combat prestige gives a chance at a free cast/shot.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the more interesting skills to prestige is Dexterity.  This isn't a dodge stat.  It's simply run speed.  Leveling up Dexterity increases your speed.\r\n\r\nThere's not yet an offline task XP earning mechanic, so instead, you gain hours spent offline.  These hours are put into a bank for you to spend at double time and 3x speeds.\r\n\r\nThis bank begins at an already generous 36 hours.  At 3x speed, you can spend twelve hours at that speed.  At default speeds, you'll be wanted to speed things up a bit, so this bank comes in quite handy.\r\n\r\nPrestiging Dexterity adds to base run speed and increases the bank for the hours you get to spend at extra speed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe game runs well in the background.  However, early on, and after prestiging a skill, you'll have to babysit the game.  Inventory slots have infinite stacks, so running out of room for a product isn't a problem so long as you have a slot free.  But you'll have a limited number of slots at first and will need to either sell some items or offload them into a bank (more like a large vault).\r\n\r\nYour bank/vault slots are limited in number but also infinite in stacks.  You buy more slots with the gold you earn, mostly from selling loot and crafted items.\r\n\r\nAnother reason to babysit the game is to catch when you run out of ammo or imbued slates or crafting materials.  Or, you know, die.  Fortunately, you instantly respawn in the central town and have infinite lives.\r\n\r\nIf you're AFK for a while, the game recently added a feature that adds time spent not earning XP back into the banked hours for extra speed.  So you don't have to be too obsessive about checking the game.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a cool, fun game, and extremely cheap compared to the many hours you might put into it.  It's best played in long spurts, like while you're working on something.  Levels are earned fairly quickly, especially at 3x speed or in Turbo mode.\r\n\r\nBut you can also chip away at it a few minutes at a time.  Even the combat skills that require you to make ammo, Range and Magic, don't feel too much of a chore to level up, especially since you're leveling up the crafting skills as you make more ammo.\r\n\r\nIf you aren't afraid of committing to a game for the next decade of your life, come play as Bloob!",

      "review": "TL;DR Give it a shot, it's free! It's a delightful idle game, but definitely slow to progress and with no* offline progression.\r\n\r\n*- OK let's start with that caveat. To be technical, the big innovation for Bloobs Adventure Idle is that all of your progression is almost sort of offline-gated: Time spent offline or fully AFK (IE, doing nothing) produces Banked Time. You can spend this ~1:1 to double the game's tickrate, or ~3:1 to triple it. So for 16 hours spent offline, you can spend 8 hours online going much faster. This is neat! It enforces a cap to offline 'gains', and it's got a good cadence. The downside is that the multipliers, 2x and 3x, are WAY too slow. This game is glacial to the point of self-parody on 1x, and even at 3x it's kinda grindy.\r\n\r\nOK on with the bulk of the actual review: Bloobs is great! It's Runescape minus all of the worst parts but plus a few new worst parts (looking at you, Beastmastery balancing and Trapping progression) in an act of equivalent exchange. The art is cute, the developer is constantly on the ball and keeping things updated, and the diversity of skills is really fun to mess around with. At time of writing the first new skill since I started playing just got added today, Homesteading, a sort of combo player housing / Farming deal, and it's very slick.\r\n\r\nMy advice if you're gonna try the game? Don't bother with non-melee combat for anything progression related, just come back and grind Magic and Ranged later. Do Beastmastery as often as possible when you are fighting for stuff, and ideally get Auto Beastmaster early and then grind the 5 point missions: Anything seemingly higher-value is actually much lower value due to higher kill requirements and bad KPM, even with improved gear.\r\n\r\nRegardless, it's free and absolutely worth trying out.",

This game is lacking in that department making skill act more island instead of one greater whole. One great example is combat side of the game feeling like it does barly anything. The worse bosses just feel completly useless with very little reward for the effort.\n\nThe other is the lack non-skilling activity no minigame no quest or any real new mechanic is unlocked at any point of progresion making the game feel very monotonal.\n\nThe progresion in general is very linear with very few alternate skilling method dosn't help this issue.\n\nConclusion :\nThe game is in a decent base state but lack in some critical area draging the experince down if steam had a mixed review button that i would put\n\nFor the dev continue the good work i do this review not to drag down the game but to hopfuly improve it you seem to truly care and for that i can only be hopful for the future of the game",

      "review": "Very straight forward, but also very boring. You essentially have around 30 different skills that all follow the same mechanic. Level up to get access to tasks that reward more xp to get more xp. No new mechanics unlock, the prestige system is basically just an increase to xp gain, which, without new mechanics just doesnt make it exciting. There is no story, no variety, just the same leveling format over and over again.",
