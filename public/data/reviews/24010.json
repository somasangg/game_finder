You literally gonna push the lever and it gonna start like a rocket or something.\n\nThe audio is catastrophic. Nothing is muffling the sound, it gonna burst your ears not only because it's loud as hell, the audio itself is bad and it should never be taken for a price.\n\nThe performence of this game is a bad joke. Graphics looks disgusting, TSW:2 lags way less with way prettier graphics, also the game constantly crashes.\n\nEven in basic missions there are places without markings of speed limits (especially on switches) and I am not even mentioning missings of the signs on the paths\n\nPrice for DLCs is a tragicommedy, no need to comment that\n\nWho let Steam to keep this game ?",

I have a pretty decent gaming laptop all things considered, and it can handle a lot of poorly optimized games, but THIS ANCIENT GAME, that is only a year younger than I am, is the most unstable, poorly optimized game I've ever played. Even on DX12 with the lowest graphics settings possible, I was getting CONSTANT out-of-memory crashes. I don't know how you guys at Dovetail sleep at night knowing that you keep pushing this 16-year-old sloppily optimized crash-fest of a game like it's one of the greatest things since sliced bread.",

It seems they just change the opening picture and the year. There you go, there's your update.\n\nMy grand kids don't ever ask to play this. I have tried numerous times to figure it out, but I end up in frustration. When driving, almost every time, it says my scenario failed, but gives no reason why. Was I speeding? I don't think so. Too slow? I don't think so. Didn't allow enough time for passengers? I followed the timer. Well, then what was it? I have no idea. Once you get out on open track, the game is boring. I would give this 1 star out of 5. There is no point to this game.",

And then in most other games you can still download free mods that doesn't require purchasing existing DLCs.\n\nAside from that, the game looks dated, yet stutters a lot on the first run.\n\nI thought the game was relatively cheap just because it is just dated, hoping there is decent amount of content in there. Turns out that's not the case. If you just want to try it anyway, I'd suggest trying the subscription plan instead, at least those have more content, and then buy the full game if you like it.",
