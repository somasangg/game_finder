I like this game a lot it's a pretty cute idle fisher, although I wish for late-game there were some more updates in regards to mouse shop / potion spawn rate. I spent two weeks waiting for a Legendary Potion to spawn so I could have a chance at 100%ing this game. Two. Weeks. For three dollars this is more than worth it!",

You do need to be a little bit more hands on with it in the beginning to be able to catch some of the rarer fish but once you spend some time with the game you can just leave it running in the back with limited intervention. \r\n\r\nI give the game a 6.5/10. If there was a bit more features i'd consider raising the score but it functions as a serviceable cosy and simple idle fishing game",
