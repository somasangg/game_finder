My main complaint is the drop % of the event personas. I personally think they are way too low; when in majority of cases, you probably won't use them or break the typical meta. The Animations are good and pretty well done and they've gotten better over the years, that's for sure. \n\nAll 'n all. I'll admit I put maybe too much money into this game, but I only bought something like 2 to 4 times a month total so it's not that big of a deal for me. I dunno. If they every raise the % rate of the event personas then maybe I'll come back.\n\nIf you're bored and want to look at pretty good character models and adult animations to unlock in time, go for it. It's really not a bad game for what it is, honestly. And the Devs do update it regularly. And looking back at what the game was when I first started; a ton has changed. \n\nI'll recommend the game because I think it's good when you look at it as it should be.

My main complaint is the drop % of the event personas. I personally think they are way too low; when in majority of cases, you probably won't use them or break the typical meta. The Animations are good and pretty well done and they've gotten better over the years, that's for sure. \n\nAll 'n all. I'll admit I put maybe too much money into this game, but I only bought something like 2 to 4 times a month total so it's not that big of a deal for me. I dunno. If they every raise the % rate of the event personas then maybe I'll come back.\n\nIf you're bored and want to look at pretty good character models and adult animations to unlock in time, go for it. It's really not a bad game for what it is, honestly. And the Devs do update it regularly. And looking back at what the game was when I first started; a ton has changed. \n\nI'll recommend the game because I think it's good when you look at it as it should be. But don't go in thinking that it's a eye popping ground breaking product. Fair warning. It is still a simple Mobile game with Hentai elements included.",

Pay for fast process or wait is up to you, because if you can complete events it gives you the ability to buy material to upgrade your character, which can't be gotten from other sources but only by buying with real money. Sometimes the game just gives those as gifts.\n\nAfter your team is stable, daily routine takes less than ten minutes. Only update days take more. So this game respects your time more than any ga-cha game I ever played, even SFW ones. PVP is optional. You may try PVP for more free rewards, but the game does not force you to do so.\n\nYou may pick a low-price monthly pass for the long run. It's worth.\n\nP.S.

Kind of exactly what I wanted to find, hope it continues to improve, and if I had one major recommendation... it would be to make leveling a little easier to progress with the story. I see some have commented that the game is too hard if you aren't at the recommended level. I've consistently fought against higher levels, but I was careful with how I utilized my rewards to strengthen my girls. 100% would recommend to someone looking for some adult gaming.",
