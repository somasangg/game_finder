After facing the horrible reality of this game, I have noticed my hairline slowly, but steadily, marching backward.\n\nHours went by, my sorrowful companions fell one by one, and I replaced them only with new witnesses to the carnage that awaited them in the deeper parts of the ruined chasms. As these poor souls fell into despair, their anguish became mine, for I had made the mistake of entering this microcosm not as a nihilist, but as an altruist.\n\nNow, I wake each day with a bald, marked-up skull and shadows below my eyes.

It's a balancing act wherein the worse a game in this genre is balanced, the more awful the experience becomes. Well, not only did they nail a roguelike, they nailed a roguelike base-builder.\n\nNailing one is worthy of praise, but two? I'm not surprised that even after the release of the second game in this series, the first is still going strong and receiving updates.\n\n✅ Art style: Unique and reminiscent of dark Fantasy comics.\n✅ Replay Value: Impossibly good.\n✅ MTX: the only \"microtransactions\" in DD are well priced DLC that expand the game.\n✅ Difficulty: Punishing but flexible.\n✅ Sound Design: Excellent, both in music and SFX\n✅ Gameplay: The loop for this game is superb for the genre.\n\n(A note on MTX: the DLC for Butchers Circus and the Musketeer Character are FREE, thereby adding a free character type and Multiplayer free of charge post-release)\n\nHonestly I struggle to find anything bad to say about the game. I think my one criticism is that the difficulty is a bit crunchy. It wouldn't hurt to add some softer dungeons to get a run moving so it doesn't feel like you're fighting entropy itself when you first start the game lol.\n\nEven lower difficulties suffer from a harsh launch into delving. Regardless, that's my only true gripe with the game.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough. Anyone who is a fan of Newgrounds inspired Casual Base builder games or Dark Fantasy dungeon delving should snatch this up. It's worth it at full price but goes on sale often enough that it should be in far more libraries than it currently is.",

      "review": "I initially picked this game up because I thought the artstyle was cool and gritty. Now 100 hours later I understand that this game is not some hero's journey where the game tries to appear challenging through spongy enemies and terrible dialogue. No, this game makes it ABUNDANTLY clear that the odds are stacked against you by ripping away your precious heroes permanently when it so feels. It does not matter how leveled they are or what gear you give them to improve, there is ALWAYS a chance that your heroes die. \r\n\r\nAlthough the challenge of this game is immense, I do find that it is fair. Yes the enemies hit very hard, but if you build your characters out properly, you can hit them back just as hard if not harder. For example, if there is an enemy that completely negates 80% of damage taken, some heroes have skills that fully punch right through that for full damage, every time. Darkest Dungeon very much rewards smart tactics (unless the random dice rolls don't land in your favor). \r\n\r\nDarkest Dungeon also focuses in on the concept of risk/reward. For anyone considering buying the game, there is a torch that you can keep lit, and it grants you a myriad of bonuses. It's presented as this beacon of hope for your heroes lore-wise. However, you do not have to keep this torch lit. If you let it go out, the fights get harder, which put your heroes in danger, but you also get significantly more rewards for doing so. \r\n\r\nThere is so much that this game has to offer, and I am honestly shocked that I had not heard of it before I bought it myself. I genuinely have not been challenged by a game this much since the first time I played Dark Souls. I love this game with all my heart. If there is anyone out there that is unsure if this game will be worth the money, let me assure you beyond a shadow of a doubt that it is.",

I played the game in Stygian the hardest difficulty.\n\nI get that the point of this game and Stygian is to be the hardest possible it could be, but even the hardest difficulty must be fair. For example, I finished Metro Exodus Best Ending with Ranger Hardcore difficulty and it's a pretty balanced difficulty for me, since the enemies are greater in intelligence, but they still have the same limitations of the player.\n\nOn the other hand, Darkest Dungeon Stygian Difficulty just lazily buffed the enemies HP, buffed the enemies attack, and add 1 new simple feature which is death limits. No shame to the developer, but for a game that glazed itself to be the \"darkest\", it could at least try to be more creative in making the enemies harder instead of just increasing the enemies stats with no thoughts behind it.\n\nI was hoping for a more mental gymnastic game like Metro Exodus Ranger Hardcore, not just this silly RNG stuff.\n\nBefore any of you accuse me of not using any tactics, I used up every single tactics I could develop from what the game teaches you:\n1) I made sure my light levels at the highest level possible in every single battle.\n2) I made sure my team composition is as balanced and using their full personal preference as possible. Even if the team I got were fully RNG.\n3) I made sure all the items I bring for my adventure is sufficient and befit every single situation as if I'm Goblin Slayer. Even having trinkets based on my team composition.\n4) I made sure all my actions in battle are calculated.\n\nAfter using all of that, I've used up all of the skills I could find as a beginner of Darkest Dungeon, but an experienced player at challenging game in general. Yet, it's not enough and still comes down to pure luck.\n\nEven Fear & Hunger at least have the common sense of rewarding the players for having in-game knowledge of what to do. Maybe this game is just not for me, or maybe some of the negative steam reviews are right.\n\nAlthough, I can see why people would love this game.\nIf you are one of those people who love this game, congratulations, you found the right game for you.\n\nIf you are one of those people who don't like this game for certain reasons, that's fine, you could choose whether you want to complain about the game or not, but don't linger too long, and just move on to find something else for you.\n\nPersonally, I left this negative review, because I spent money to purchase this game, and I was left disappointed.\n\nIf you ask why I don't just check reviews and playthrough of this game instead of going in blind. It's because I love uncovering the game inside and out without any public opinions to deter my own judgement. After all, the best thing in life for me is seeing something for the first time, to feel and experience it for myself. For examples, Metro Exodus and Don't Escape: 4 Days to Survive pleasantly surprised me. However, it seems my luck had ran out with this game, which is pretty poetic considering that my main problem with this game is that it's luck-heavy.\n\nAnyhow, I hope whoever is reading this has a good day, and I'm sorry for leaving this negative review.",

      "review": "I definitely have a bit of a love hate relationship with this game.  First off, the classes and combat are really well designed. I'm not a big Lovecraft fan, but the themes are extremely well done and fit the game amazingly well. The game studio's name \"Red Hook\" is actually a Lovecraft reference itself, so you know these guys are really passionate about the material.\n\nThe turn-based combat system is great. Character position matters. Abilities can only be used in certain positions making for lots of possible team compositions based on what classes you choose and what positions you put them in.  Positioning also creates a lot of frustrations though, since several enemies will move your characters around and surprise mechanics may completely shuffle your team out of order at the start of combat.  An S tier team comp when in an exact order can easily become an F tier team when shuffled at the start of combat, causing you to lose a few early turns to fix your order or continue with it sub-optimally.  It's important to consider that and have some flexibility in your team for when you inevitably get moved or shuffled around.\n\nThe game really punishes you for lack of game knowledge, which is why the game is most difficult at the start and when playing blind without guides.  All the bosses have a mechanic that you need to understand and build your team around.  Not being prepared for it will often cause things to go south pretty quickly.  Earlier difficulties are a little more forgiving though, so it's up to you to quickly formulate ideas for an optimal strategy and remember to bring a good set-up when you take on the more difficult variations of those bosses later.  \n\nMy biggest gripe with the game is just that there is a lot of repetition.  You'll enter the same dungeons, fight the same kinds of monsters, fight increasingly difficult variations of bosses and then eventually take on the darkest dungeon.  Your characters and teams will die as you learn through a bit of trial and error to develop your game knowledge.  That's all fine, but having to re-level characters again, going through the same minimally randomized dungeons, just starts to feel like too much of a grind after a while, and not always particularly fun.\n\nWith all that being said, I still enjoyed the game overall.  If you like difficult turn-based games, then it's definitely worth playing through a run.",

Once you start figuring things out, every little victory feels super rewarding.\n\nThe dungeons really test your planning skills - building a solid team takes some thought, since each class has its own strengths, weaknesses, and quirks. It can be brutal, but it’s also very satisfying when your strategy pays off.\n\nThere are also a bunch of cool mods on the Workshop, though it’s worth checking if they’re still up to date. Some are a bit outdated (probably because of Darkest Dungeon 2, but there’s still plenty of great stuff out there.\n\nOverall: Definitely worth playing and easy to recommend. If you’ve got a few bucks to spare and enjoy a challenge, give it a shot - you won’t regret it.\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n_____Deutsch_____\n\nNach rund 7 Stunden Spielzeit kann ich sagen: Dieses Spiel war auf jeden Fall keine Fehlinvestition.\nDer Artstyle ist düster, aber wunderschön, und obwohl das Spiel stellenweise ziemlich hart sein kann, ist genau das der Reiz daran. Sobald man die Mechaniken etwas verstanden hat, fühlt sich jeder kleine Erfolg richtig gut an.\n\nDie Dungeons verlangen einiges an Planung - gerade bei der Teamzusammenstellung sollte man auf die Stärken, Schwächen und Eigenheiten der einzelnen Klassen achten. Es kann manchmal brutal sein, aber wenn die Strategie aufgeht, ist das Gefühl einfach großartig.\n\nAußerdem gibt es im Workshop viele coole Mods, bei denen man allerdings schauen sollte, ob sie noch aktuell sind. Einige sind etwas veraltet (wahrscheinlich wegen Darkest Dungeon 2, aber trotzdem findet man dort eine Menge spannender Inhalte.\n\nFazit: Definitiv empfehlenswert und absolut spielenswert!

      "review": "Edit: I originally said this game wasn't worth buying, due to the explanation I explained below. I thought about and I realized that it was a game I got on sale for like 3$. Even if I think the game design suffers a large fundamental flaw, I do like the game and enjoyed it. I just think its not the game for me. I like punishing games, but not when it all come down luck determining if you do well and skill is so limited that one turn can ruin everything. So I guess 5/10. Like the idea and enjoyed playing it, but don't think I want to keep playing it anymore, considering it would take forever to get back to where I was and can loose it all regardless of what I do.\n\nGame is really fun, and I have enjoyed a good bit for the very cheap price I got it. I am having to leave a bad review over its game structure. I understand if a game needs to be punishing for a challenge but it just gets so ridiculous at the later game that its annoying. First you get to level up your characters to prepare for future challenges, with lvl 6 being the highest difficulty and lvl for characters. Once you lvl a hero beyond lvl 2 and 4, you lock them out of the easier difficulties. So I had lvl 6 characters pile up while trying to complete the medium difficulty missions and it just turned into a grind. You get new people that can rarely start at lvl 3, but normally 0-2, then run easy missions that are kinda boring  once you've done them a lot until they have a chance at the side quest, often needing to cycle missions to reduce stress. Then you run the side quest, have an easy prelude then just the maximum bs against the boss. I used an event to bring my lvl 6 dream team against one of these, and I don't know how I was supposed to do it otherwise, it was one of those where a crit saved my party, despite feeling like I played it well. It was the hag and one of her few moves is incapacitate a hero and steal its life, every single time anyone takes a turn. I freed my heroes and pounded the hag, but she got everyone to half health then chained crits on two heroes. I decided to attack instead of heal and I got really lucky. The real issue I think is the high difficulties at 5&6. A lot of the early game bosses, just turn into common enemies. Lvl 6 heroes can handle them, but the sheer volume is insane. I admit I'm writing this review after loosing my dream team in an instant, but I think its inevitable no matter the situation, which is where I think punishing you goes too far, and it frustrating for a game where you need to commit so much to each hero. Like in dark souls, if you play well, you don't get punished, and I think that is where game developers miss often in good difficult games.\n\nI should have known that mission was doomed when I thought I'm safe unless a necromancer spawns and that happened right after I left the room I was in. I patched everyone up and had to deal with several more of the like, especially this sailor that deals massive stress damage and is tough and can be guarded by tanks. I had a full health squad with higher stress than I liked but I was pass halfway through the mission. One turn later, my lvl 6 healer was dead from every enemy attacking her sequentially. I retreated, to escape and used my last bonfire. The healer had the thing to prevents ambushes so I risked it. My plague doctor gets a heart attack cause he's sad at the bonfire and an ambush starts, another previous mini boss. I somehow escape that, then one by one everyone in my party dies of heart attacks. There isn't any good way to deal with stress, all you can do is have a character or two always spam low impact stress reduction actions instead of fighting and starting with 0 stress and bonfires, which I did. It was a lvl 5 mission, where most my heroes that have died passed similarly with no modifiers to make it harder. \n\nA lot of this is just I'm upset, but if I can loose everything in one turn, with deathblow protection and decent strategy, it turns into a game of intense extended rng. I'm not really building my characters, just giving them better rolls and hoping the enemies don't gang crit my entire team every single turn",

      "review": "This game is very fun. I love the challenge that it brings as you progress further along into the story even though sometimes you can get really unlucky and lose some of your favorite heroes, but that's what makes the game so good. The game does a great job at creating a sense of peril when you get into a tough fight, sometimes you are forced to abandon a quest because of fights not going your way, or running into a boss fight unexpectedly at a bad time like the collector, thing from the stars, etc. The best thing this game does is force you to make tough decisions, these decisions aren't just limited to the combat either. You have to make all kinds of decisions about whether you want to spend gold on your heroes by upgrading them or curing them of illness or getting rid of annoying quirks or whether you just want to dismiss them altogether to save yourself the hassle. You also get to decide what kind of build you want to have on your heroes and what kinds of comps you want to take into the differing dungeons. This game does a great job of providing a problem and giving you tons of ways to solve it and that freedom to choose is what makes the game so interesting and creates a great gameplay loop. I have over 200 hours in this game and I still haven't tried every build and every class in the game yet, I still haven't tried using certain trinkets and haven't finished the DLCs but I always get super into this game for awhile and then stop playing for a year or so but I always come back. The best part about this game is that when it goes on sale it is 10000000% worth the price because it's super cheap for one, but you also get a ridiculous amount of value for the amount of fun you have. Just a warning ahead of time for new players, you WILL get to a point in the game where RNG just goes the worst way possible for you. You will run into bosses at the worst possible time, you will get hit with multiple crits and lose a hero before you can heal them, you'll forget to change a skill out or forget to bring certain supplies, etc. The key to this game is patience and not getting too upset about things not going your way. That being said, enjoy the times where everything is going right an capitalize on it. Definitely get this game if you have the money and are looking for something new to play, I would recommend waiting for a sale, totally worth I promise.",

It's not easy and failure is expected, and I appreciate that in a game's design when it's up front. \n\nHowever, this is not a game that respects your time or a particularly large amount of freedom of choice.

It's impossible to reduce the chance of defeat to zero :/\nTwo hits from the Pig king, two stuns from Wilbur, while you can't escape the fight – you lose your entire team and top accessories for the Reserve and the Prince. Even though the accessories were chosen based on the enemies' weaknesses and the best for their heroes.\nAfter such a defeat, completing the game in 86 weeks is unrealistic. Because you'll have to recruit and re-level the same characters to level six and get top accessories. There's simply no time for that. 86 is barely enough to complete the game without a single defeat (18 bosses + about 36 raids to prepare locations + time for quests in the Darkest Dungeon + time to level all characters to level six...). Autosave is limited to one slot. There's no way to rewind time. Such a poor setup for random game...\nThe bottom line: a loss of about 50 hours due to a critical failure.\nHow shitty it was to find out that the skill in this game doesn't work after 80 hours!!\n\nSo, for those planning to beat the game on the hardest difficulty, even if you assemble the best team with the best accessories against the Boss Pig, there's about a 10% chance you'll have to start the game over ;)\n\nAlso, the player isn't given a bestiary of bosses upon completion, so a newbie will never know what kind of enemy awaits them. Ignorance is death! Either memorize the stats and replay the game, or sit with the WIKI on your lap.\n\nSpoiler!!!: the best tactic for winning is to perform namaz or pray for the dice to land on the right side.

You got a constant feeling while you playing that AI just cheats in every possible way to keep the difficulty level high. Is not a matter of skills or timing, nor stats or class. No matter what will be you choices, the AI will ALWAYS have better tools to overcome the odd, even with multiple debuff and prots for your characters, things weird will happen. \r\n\r\nI understand that is probably part of the game and generally speaking I like games with a steep difficulty curve, but, only when I feel it's fair, congruent and logic, not coded to work around the situation in favor of the AI \"no matter how\". \r\n\r\nThat feeling is something I can't remove, it's always present and is a little annoying.",

Hmm.\n\nI've spent a lot of time and energy with this game, trying to do what it asks of me: build up a roster of flawed but powerful heroes; acquire the trinkets and estate upgrades necessary to attack the dungeons; work my way through the bosses to the Darkest Dungeon to finally complete it. It's not easy and failure is expected, and I appreciate that in a game's design when it's up front. \n\nHowever, this is not a game that respects your time or a particularly large amount of freedom of choice. There are better hero classes than others, there are trinkets you'll never use despite them being Legendary, and there are fights that your party are completely over-tuned for yet you lose because of dungeon balance. It's the last problem, fundamentally, that I take issue with. \n\nIn the early and mid game it's possible to maintain heroes, the estate, and to progress without too much difficulty, although the game balance really fights you at each turn. It's not an enjoyable experience, and don't get me wrong, I like a challenge and I like having to made trade-offs. Darkest Dungeon's approach to this isn't fun though, certainly not beyond mid-game. It becomes a chore, a grind, and it feels like the higher level dungeons and monsters weren't tuned properly. The game goes from being challenging (with not much in the way of reward either) to being frustrating and incredibly disrespectful of your time invested.\n\nI could go on but to be honest, I don't want to. I don't want to play this game anymore. I've tried so hard and so many times to complete it and it just feels like I'm fighting the wrong numbers that were entered into the monster stat blocks. There's no satisfaction anymore and I honestly feel like I'm wasting my time. There are better designed, more fun, and definitely less frustratingly unfair turn-based games like Darkest Dungeon.

Autosave is limited to one slot. There's no way to rewind time.

If I farm, get strong and allocate skills/upgrades in a smart way that shit is on me, I BUILT THAT SHIT and the game decision is to tell me \"no fam, you can't bring those mfs here, they too nonchalant\".\nTHATS BULLSHIT, IDK WHAT YALL MASOCHIST THINK, THATS BULLSHIT.\nSo if you enjoy being fucked constantly because yes, then go ahead and play it, but if a game punishes me for being strategic and smart, then fuck off. \nAlso, being jumped while camping is the worst mechanic I've ever seen, period.\nFuck this game, fuck yall masochist, and fuck these stupid ass mechanics.",

You can (and will) loose many champions. BUT in my humble opinion it actually takes the concept to far. More often than not you will loose without the opportunity to prevent it. This leads to the necessity to repeatedly grind to train new champions meaning you have to invest a lot of time. This is the case for the easiest difficulty setting! \r\nTo make matters worse, the last dungeon you need to beat will even take away the ability to retreat and save  all of your champions so after 40+ hours sunk into this game you will lose most of you champions and essentially start over.",

There doesn't actually seem to be all that much to the gameplay itself and success and failure can feel like a complete flip of the coin.  The game absolutely oozes style and atmosphere but that can only carry it so far before your session can become an exercise in relief that you made it through or frustration that the RNG resulted in your party getting rolled and wasting your time.  There are some things you can learn for your next run but the RNG ensures that whether or not you can actually put that knowledge to use is another story.  If you enjoy trial and error and have lots of free time, you might enjoy it.  If your time is more limited and you use games as a bit of escape, you probably want to pass here.

I have restarted this game half a dozen times because when it calls itself \"unforgiving\" thats code for God himself will use RNG as proof of his existence to give you the absolute worst outcome feasibly possible. There is literally no amount of micromanageMENT (hi) that will spare your entire squad being wiped from what would otherwise be an easy combat. Attack? miss literally 9 times in a row...no that is not a joke. Try to debuff? once again miss. But dont worry the enemy will land every attack on you and drive your characters insane so they will do more damage to eachother or cutting their own wrists like an emo girl whos mother doesnt understand her than they can on a pack of rabid mutts. But hey at least you can always back out right? thats how gambling works where you realize the fates are lubing up the strap on you can nope the fuck out...right? fuck no youll fail to flee an encounter several times so your squad is wiped and you're stuck trying to decide how to proceed when your best characters are worm food, the rest are drowning in mental health issues and diseases and oh ye youre fucking broke...the only feasible solution if you are as blessed as myself is to simply treat recruits like revolving slave labor to be tormented until theyre killed or thrown away like a cheap abused condom in order to grind enough resources to level up all of your facilities...what a fun game",

There is quite a bit of strategy involved in who to bring, and what skills to equip them with. The issue is that this game absolutely does not respect your time. \n\nYou'll spend many many hours grinding up characters on apprentice level, only to repeat the same missions and combats over and over on veteran, and then finally champion. There are very minor additions and tweaks to enemy parties on the higher level dungeons, but ultimately the game is a repetitive slog that turns boring long before you're even close to finishing a single playthrough.",
