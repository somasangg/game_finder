Although, the limit for airplanes is very limited. I believe that it's intended for you to buy \"add on\" airplanes from special sites and your desired liveries and such. Also, you should install at least the North America DLC or any other map expansion DLC, else you will be completely covered by boundaries, making the gameplay a bit annoying. This game does require higher graphic cards, and I'm struggling to pull 40 FPS on medium graphics with my NVIDIA 3050 haha (its still so worth it in my opinion). If you wish to have a bigger variety of airplanes (specifically airliners), maybe go for MSFS if your targeting such. MSFS doesn't (in my opinion) have such amazing graphics nor physics as X-Plane 12 does. Overall, I do recommend buying this game 👍",

There were many features and functions in the actual plane that are inop or aren't even there....

      "review": "X-Plane 12 is Lego, while MSFS (2020) is Playmobil - let me explain;\n\nBoth are - by now - excellent Simulator Platforms that excel in their own way. Both have their benefits and downsides, both are well supported by mods, tools, and utilities. And most importantly, both can be serious fun. But X-Plane is snappy, direct and honest, and much like the Lego Brick on the floor it can hurt and annoy you. MSFS on the other hand delivers a smooth surface, with excellent and bold visuals out of the box, and makes up for what it lacks in depth, even with 3rd party software already considered. \n\nI don't want to take sides, I can enjoy both and I was annoyed by both, and frankly - I spent way too much money on both. But I (again) feel more at home within X-Plane 12 than I do with MSFS or even MSFS 2024. Simply because behind the wall of firstly overwhelming functionality, everything is logical, structured, and functional to me. No lack of feature has to hide behind a fancy UI mask - it's unappologetic in good ways as much as in bad ways. And I respect that. \n\nFunnily enough, after the mess XP12 was in its early access to me, I've sworn to settle down with MSFS, then after a year of release I bought 2024 and was equally disappointed, which again drew me back to XP12, as my MSFS install was already deleted. And likelihood of going full circle once more is definitely given. \n\nSo, if you're\n* not afraid of basic UI's with high functionality,\n* keen to mod your experience to your liking,\n* accept longer development times in exchange for actual feedback driven improvements,\n* and accept a little less graphical fidelity over a little more depth, \nI can recommend XP12 to you. \n\nIf any one of the above seems odd to you, you'll most likely have more fun in MSFS - and that's said without any sort of elitist note, because it's completely fine.",

The flight dynamics and systems modeling make it useful for practicing procedures.\n\nThat said, there are some bugs that can be annoying. For example, if you select an approach just to practice landings, especially an ILS approach, the aircraft often spawns at an unrealistic vertical speed. It will pitch down, descend at >2500 fpm, and end up below the glideslope, which makes it tricky to set up properly.\n\nI understand the limitations of the sim, I  give it a positive review.",

Ветер, дождь, да даже неровности на ВПП… Все это влияет на поведение самолета ДО/В течении/ПОСЛЕ полета\nВторая причина моды, ты буквально из этого симулятора может сделать идеальную игру под себя, модификаций много и я думаю если люди которые увлекаются самолетами точно найдут здесь что-то свое, и у каждого игра будет выглядит индивидуально в этом и есть вся суть Xplane12\nНу и третья причина это уже на вкус и цвет, но тут до безумия удобное управление плюс чувствуется отклик самолета(в MSFS у меня с этим были лютые проблемы)\n\nВ общем я думаю в этом симуляторе я еще надолго зависну, ну и если все таки остался вопрос что взять MSFS или Xplane12 я бы порекомендовал второй вариант, но опять же на вкус и цвет, если хочешь смотреть на красоты за бортом, то первый вариант, если ты ищешь хороший авиасим, то тебе в Xplane12\n\n\n!!!Исключительно мое мнение!!!",

      "review": "I've been flying X-Plane since XP9. Look in all reality there has always been a comparative between MS Flight sim and X-Plane since the start but IMO X-plane has a lot of Pros and perhaps maybe few cons. The biggest thing is that you need to know before purchasing whether you're trying to fly for the Enhancement of Graphics, or if you're looking for something more realistic and less \"Arcade\" X-Plane offers ALOT of realistic aerodynamic/aircraft Physics and it is by far THE Most accurate of all. Take for instance an ILS approach here vs MSFS. X-Plane mimics the small movement input that you'd experience in a real world situation. MSFS unless you have Extreme weather, ANY PLANE FEELS LEGIT LIKE A LASER BEAM TO THE RUNWAY. This is maybe the reason why Xplane has a professional version that accredited flight school use rather than just using MSFS. Surely if we talk about graphics, the Cloud engine on MSFS makes it seem like it surpasses XP12 but in al reality, I would challenge that XP12 is really not that far behind. Ground texture sure, MSFS is great at using GMAP in order to generate buildings and  structures but if you take a step back and look at the big picture, this is where you determine whether youre flight just for the arcade aspect of it or for the realism of the sim. I Hope this helps you guys choosing the sim of preference. Enjoy it!",

I am a Certified Flight Instructor (fixed wing) and Commercial Helicopter student and I used X-Plane 10 to earn my Private Pilot's license back in 2009 and I'm using it again to hone my skills as a commercial helicopter pilot (along with many lessons with a CFI of course). X-Plane is the BEST platform for honing actual flight skills for VFR and IFR training!",

So I ended up trying the X-plane 12 demo and was impressed by the fps that I was getting and just the overall stability of the game in general. Having reached my limits with Msfs, I decided to buy X-plane 12 and I have zero regrets. It does what it is advertised to do as a product and by doing so makes my sim flying experience far less annoying when the game just works.",
