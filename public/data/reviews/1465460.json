      "review": "Great work on the game, came back to it after a year or so, much more polished and offers a very complete experience at the moment. Would recommend to anyone who likes base building games managing resources and surviving enemy waves. Some caveats are that the game is not completely finished, there are some bugs with bridges that prevent certain events such as military and merchant to not activate because they are stuck on the other side of the bridge. Given that the game can be played on the world map allowing players to pick from any place to start, i imagine there is a lot of work that needs to be done but very playable state right now.\n\nI do have, however, a few suggestions for the game mechanics wise:\n1. allow for worker locking for every building ex: lock my barns to be 18/18 so when i select 0 on the general managing tab, they do not get removed so i dont need to micromanage as much for specific high priority production that i would never want out, same thing with all the other production buildings as well as kindergarden, hospitals, etc. \n2. allow priority for building and scavenging mechanics so players can be more specific in managing buildings and scavenging without having to micromanage too much.\n3. allow a guard feature for squads where they can protect a certain object, ex: when recovering damaged cars they move slow so other squads can guard them. perhaps add a field repair kit for cars, maybe this will be too strong for the game mechanics wise so this is more dependent on game balance.\n4. similar to suggestion 1, when i hover over a specific area such as farming, add the option to display more details, how many are on farming, how many are on barns, how how many are planting trees, how many are in the planting tree building etc. (maybe not by default, but add the option so players can use this later, toggle to display more detail by default with the option to change this in the settings to toggle to display basic info\n5. more options available for when selecting multiple squads to act. Ex: which squad goes in first, second, third, etc when clearing out buildings, help with lairs clearing and enable drive in sync, faster cars will drive together with the slower car\n6. outline pathing for guards, which route they have to take to reach the towers so players can place the towers so that guards don't go outside the base and swim across water to go in\n7. lategame, add a function to manage where citizens can come home before the night arrives, there is a common problem i find when i get to the ultra late game that citizens are going very far to break apart buildings for resources and they die on the way back because its too far away (same thing with building proxy walls)\n8. add the options to area select broken or damaged buildings and repair only those buildings in addition to the repair all option only (late game when i have same wall type close and far away from base i want the ones closer to my base to be repaired first)\n9. add a supply of metal other than buildings and natural resources, this is the only thing preventing a self sustaining base, which is good to add from a player perspective, we can feel we \"conquered an area\" fully\n\nfor devs: these suggestions are ordered as close to importance to my personal game experience as possible, the game is still in development but it is already looking much better than before and a game that i would recommend in the current state. despite this, there are many optimisations that could be done for player experience from a resource management perspective that would solve a lot of micromanaging problems that players may encounter when having a bigger population. this is the only reason why i would not be too motivated to keep replaying different maps because the micromanaging late game is too tiresome but necessary when playing on harder difficulties",

Nothing builds confidence like turning your real life neighborhood into a fortified stronghold and realizing you should’ve invested in castle walls years ago (I can still invest in one but its expensive so I would rather invest in those bunkers like in this game).\r\n\r\nFast forward to the latest expansion: laws, machine guns, new stuff to micromanage. My favorite, high emphasis on machine guns on cars. Nothing says “civilization is back, baby” like mowing down infected and gunning them with my platoon of machine gunners.\r\n\r\nI really hope the devs keep pumping out more content, because this game is becoming a certified post-apocalyptic classic like Frostpunk in the future. For now, it’s casually and dangerously fun to the point of playing hours on end in one city playthrough.",

While it can get a little frantic at times, you can speed up or pause time, allowing you to react to situations a little more tactically.\n\nIt's big draw is the ability to pick any part of the world to defend and reoccupy.  So you can pick your hometown, defend grandma's house, or whatever strikes your fancy.  However, not all areas have the resources or density required for a successful run.\n\nThat said, there are some bugs and quirks, but the devs have been working on as well as adding new content at the time of this review.  Since the game is in Early Access, any of that could change - but as it stands, it is a fun casual survival base-builder to burn a few hours here and there.  It's a little more intense than a 'cozy' game, but lacks that 'just one more turn' mania you get from the big hitters in the 4X realm.",

The appeal of being able to build defenses in your neighborhood in a rebuilding at the end of a zombie apocalypse is really fun, but I wish there was more variety in the RTS base-building mechanics, otherwise it feels like the early game all plays the exact same. Perhaps more choices in the way the early game progress, and making the city exploration slightly more meaningful? Right now it's really just where the resources are located. \n\nThe pacing is a bit slow, there are periods where your waiting for stuff to happen and your pressing the fast forward through slow bits, (like any good city builder). But then it has moments of a lot of action all at once when a zombie horde or raiders come at you. \n\nIt encourages risk taking to cut the tedium, but then the risks can end up being rewarding, like stumbling across wandering refugees right outside of the 3 government buildings your scavenging weapons and bodyarmor from, but then to get it all back you have to carefully cut through where the zombie hordes at your local walmart have a lair and the apartment complex that your stoner buddy lives at down the road are now a raider den, so you have to take a long way right around the corner from where you used to walk to school. \n\nIt does feel really fun to be able to strategize around areas you see every day or have history in. Although for gameplay purposes the time ticks way faster than reality, so 1 hr in game = just a couple minutes, this leads to a weird feeling where you send your team out on a scavenge mission down the road and the in-game clock tells you it's taken them 6 hours to get there, and you know you could walk there in an hour at longest right now. But nonetheless it's the start of something really cool, and I hope this turns into something even more fun to play in the future with even larger portions of the city playable at once.",

      "review": "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ “One of the most addictive post-apocalyptic city-rebuilding games I’ve ever played.”\n\nAfter spending dozens of hours in Infection Free Zone, I can confidently say this is one of the most satisfying blends of city management, tactical survival, and real-world mapping I’ve played in years. If you’re into strategy, base-building, and that constant adrenaline of trying to hold off the night, this game delivers hard.\n\n🗺️ Your City, Your Battlefield\n\nOne of the game’s strongest features is the ability to generate the world from actual real-world map data. I started by rebuilding my own hometown, and there is something incredibly immersive—and honestly a bit eerie—about defending streets and buildings you know in real life. You immediately start strategizing based on familiar terrain:\n\n“This avenue is wide; perfect for a chokepoint.”\n\n“This school is spacious; I’ll convert it into my main headquarters.”\n\nThis mechanic alone gives the game insane replay value.\n\n🏗️ The Base-Building Loop Is Addictive\n\nYou take over abandoned buildings, transform them into workshops, armories, farms, research centers, and safe houses. Every structure feels meaningful. When your food drops or your ammo runs low, you feel it — and every upgrade feels like survival earned, not given.\n\nThe resource system is tight but fair. The game constantly pushes you to expand, scavenge, and take risks.\n\n🌙 The Nighttime Tension Is Real\n\nIf you haven’t played yet: do not underestimate the nights.\nEvery single night is a small survival story of its own.\n\nYour scouts don’t make it back on time. A horde appears on a blind corner. Your defensive wall is almost finished — almost. Suddenly you’re rerouting your security squads, shutting down unnecessary buildings, and praying your barricades hold.\n\nIt’s that perfect blend of panic and strategy that keeps you hooked.\n\n⚔️ Combat Is Tactical and Satisfying\n\nCombat isn’t point-and-click chaos — it’s tactical squad-based management.\nYou choose:\n\nhow many people to arm,\n\nwhat weapons they carry,\n\nwhen to retreat,\n\nand when to push into infected zones.\n\nLosing a trained squad hurts — not because the game punishes you unfairly, but because every loss feels personal.\n\n🚗 Vehicles Are Game-Changers\n\nOnce you unlock and repair cars, the entire gameplay pace shifts. Suddenly your scouts can move farther, your looting runs become safer, and your tactical options multiply. Upgrading vehicles into armored beasts is extremely satisfying.\n\n🎵 Atmosphere and Sound Design\n\nThe sound of distant infected, the tension of the night alarms, the calm during base expansion — all of it works together perfectly to immerse you. The soundtrack is subtle but really sets the tone.\n\n🐞 Bugs? Sure. But Nothing Game-Breaking.\n\nAfter many hours, I did encounter:\n\noccasional pathfinding quirks,\n\nsmall hitches with squad assignments,\n\nand the need to re-issue some movement commands.\n\nBut honestly, for a game of this scale, it runs surprisingly well, and updates keep improving things.\n\n💬 Final Verdict\n\nIf you love survival strategy titles like They Are Billions, Project Zomboid (base-building aspect), RimWorld (emergent stories), or City-builders with pressure, this game is absolutely worth your time.\n\nIt’s brutal, atmospheric, endlessly replayable, and genuinely unique.\nA personal favorite of 2024 and a game I keep coming back to.",

      "review": "I would like to state that it is in early access and things could change!!!\nfirst the things i like/love. I love the game design and that it just scratches that itch of resource management and town builder like game. Another thing i like about this game is you dont just get to have a resource node that has infinite resources for you to collect. something else that caught my eye was worker management for large scale construction or deconstruction projects it took a large amount of people that only could work during the day which made it feel like i needed to put large amounts of people to get it done asap because of the hordes and waves of zombies on certain night. final thing i really enjoy about the game is that it tells a story from a different when then just first person or third person you it lets you organize large amounts of groups to find things out (like the scientists for the vaccine. One more thing i particularly love about this is everything is craftable when researched and unlocked by building no more rng for wanting certain things\nNow some gripes i have with it please note i do know this game is in early access\nresource collecting is slow like even when 205/205 people are working on scavenging it takes a long time (note i know there is travel time for the scavengers but even while they are at the area i need them to be it takes a long time)\nalright i know i said i like this part about the game but when needing metal and or bricks and you build the scrapyard or the clay pit it feels like they should provide more than they do and in this game i know a 1000 metal is a lot but when i need to make ammo and fix fences or gates it gets burned through quickly\nnow the big one i didnt really wanna mention is at some point you make \"the perfect settlement\" and nothing needs improving and it makes you wanna put the game down honestly dont know how to fix it \nnow it is an amazing game and anyone that likes resource management and people management mixed with like 7 days to die kinda would love this game\nP.S love the fact you can select the area you live in to try and make a settlement",

      "review": "The concept of the game is made with quality. It’s a perfect game for the Tower Defense and base-building genre. I hope the game will continue to improve and get updates. There are no real downsides to the game itself, since the overall concept is done perfectly. But I do have a few suggestions that could make the game even better:\n\n1. Add the ability to build infinite resource mines for a more casual experience.\nRight now, the metal resources on the map run out and it becomes impossible to gather them anymore. As a result, after some time it becomes unplayable. Bricks are currently produced through a special building, but after a while its production reserves run out and the building stops working - and you can’t demolish it. It would be great to have a system like in Banished, where you can make it so the resources in those buildings don’t run out. Many players would probably enjoy that option. After all, the main goal of any game is to have fun and adding this feature would only expand the game’s audience.\n\n2. Make it so that eventually the game forces you to lose to massive zombie hordes.\nRight now, by the end of the game you already have a powerful base, and although the zombie hordes become stronger, they still don’t pose much of a threat. It would be great if surviving became harder and harder over time. That way there would be a real goal - to build a strong base and push your limits. At the moment, once you have a powerful base, there’s simply nothing to do since there’s no real danger anymore.\n\n3. More content additions.\nI’ll just leave this point for adding more content - things like more types of food, weapons, defensive structures, etc. Of course, the developers will know best what can be added without breaking the balance.\n\n4. Add more functionality for workers.\nFor example, it would be great if certain workers assigned to specific tasks could automatically head home at a set time. Sometimes workers are dismantling a building far from the base and finish work late in the evening, when zombies are already appearing. They have to walk a long way back, and often get killed on the way. It would help if workers avoided that situation automatically.\n\n5. Fix the bandit AI.\nIt’s strange to see a group of five bandits armed with knives charging straight into the base, getting shot dozens of times and dying instantly. Bandit attacks should feel more organized and large-scale.\n\n6. Random events.\nIt would be really interesting to add random events that can happen to your base - for example, a riot, disease outbreak, bad harvest season, supply drop, and so on. That would make the gameplay more varied and less repetitive.",

Its core idea — rebuilding civilization amid a zombie apocalypse — becomes even more captivating thanks to the ability to establish your own infection-free zone in your hometown, using real-world geographical data. This feature gives the game a unique sense of realism and emotional connection, allowing you to imagine your familiar streets and landmarks turning into the last bastion of human life.\n\nThe gameplay blends resource management, base building, tactical strategy, and defense in a smooth and engaging way. Every decision — from managing food and energy to protecting civilians and expanding your territory — directly impacts your community’s survival. The realistic AI behavior of the infected, combined with day-night cycles and dynamic weather, adds a thrilling layer of authenticity.\n\nThe game’s atmosphere is enhanced by excellent sound design and visuals that convey both the despair and determination of rebuilding civilization. It strikes a perfect balance between the tension of survival and the satisfaction of strategic urban planning.\n\n👉 Verdict:\nInfection Free Zone is an outstanding and highly recommended game for fans of strategy, simulation, and survival genres. It allows you to imagine and design humanity’s final refuge right where it all began — in your own city — making each playthrough personal, intense, and deeply engaging.\n\n🎮 Score: 9.5/10 — Realistic, challenging, and addictive.",

      "review": "I'm about 30 Hours into my play-through. If I had to give it a brutally honest review, I would say that this Game/Early Access is around a 3.8 out of 5. There are multiple critiques that I can make about it; However, there are also multiple things that I think are really well done. \n\nStarting with the pros. \n1. You can literally set up home base in your home. You can play anywhere in the world, which makes the game dynamic. The story is linear, so you will always be playing the same storyline; however, you can replay it in different iconic locations all across the globe. \n\n2. Vehicle customization. \nYou are able to deck out any ride that you find around the map, as long as you have the vehicle workshop built. If you want to Mad Max an armored APC, go right ahead! \n\n3. The Storyline. \nI really enjoy games that have a great story that will suck you in. At first, the game was a little slow, and I thought that I wasn't going to like it. However, once I found Miller, I got sucked right in, and I haven't been able to stop playing these last few days. \n\nHonorable Mentions.\nI played the 911 Operator game. It was a nice touch from the devs to have the character be the same voice actor from that game, voice this game's main character. And the subtle Easter Egg, pointing to that when talking to Miller.  \n\nNow, let's go over the cons. \n1. Resource Scarcity.\nResources are plentiful right at the beginning of the game; however, just like real life, after a while, they dwindle to nothing. My community is around 500 people, and it's hard to keep food on the table. I've had to activate the console command and add food to the HQ multiple times because there is nothing left around me. The same goes for materials. Yes, the trader comes around once in a while, but he doesn't have nearly enough food/materials that I need for my community. Especially when you start building fortified objects. \n\n2. NPCs don't disappear.\nOnce an NPC is spawned/created, you are not able to delete said NPC. For example, I was messing around with the console and spawned a **** ton of Military units. Those units are still on my map today because there is no delete item (whether it be squads or vehicles) command in the console. Which leads me to number three, \n\n3. Cluttered map. \nI am currently on the Find the Purifier's Leader mission. I wanted to just search for him, instead of trying to triangulate the signal. It has currently been 10 days (in-game) since I received the objective. I've sent squads out to every sector around me and still have yet to find him. There are currently about 30 vehicles outside my walls that are broken down from the firefights. I know that I am able to disassemble vehicles for materials; however, I would like to keep some for my squads. I really would like to see a garage added to the game. One that you are able to store vehicles in and pull them out at will, when needed. When you get too many vehicles in one area, it glitches the game and says that they are parked in another part of the map when, in all actuality, they are right where your squad is. \n\nAll in all, it's a decent game; it definitely needs some overhaul. But if you can look past all the bugs and glitches, it really isn't that bad of a game. Like I said, it's the only game I've been playing for the last few days. \n\n(Dev's, if you see this PLEASE add a garage, or even a delete command in the console. That is honestly my number one critique. That is the reason why I wrote this whole thing, so hopefully you implement something along the lines of it. Good work, Keep Going!)",

But such is the way with early-access projects, hopefully the devs will continue to flesh things out and add some much needed depth to this \"zombie\"-survival, post-apocaliptic city builder. The way the infected can smash their fleshy bodies against reinforced walls and actually win against the walls like they are made of sand instead of shredding their own flesh and bone against the wall's uncaring surface is particularly egregious and something the devs seem loath to address since it threatens to upset the current game balance. For people who will not be bothered by some of the silly things this game does for the sake of making a good challenge, they'll probably really like Infection Free Zone, and I would suggest they give it a try despite my \"negative\" review.\n\nEDIT, in response to the dev comment:\n\nI would not wish for my zone to be unreachable by the infected. That was not the point I was trying to make. I was pointing out the absurdity of the wall system and how stupidly unrealistic it is.\n\nWhy have so many different wall technologies, including brick-walls (which traditionally need demolition equipment ranging from sledgehammers to explosives depending on the thickness) available by default?

Unfortunately the execution of the game is not very good. My main issue with the game is that it turns tedious quite quickly. And it feels off in a lot of aspects.\n\nGenerally you start the game with a couple of survivors where most are workers and you'll turn some into fighters/explorers. The workers are active from around 7am to 6pm and then they go back inside and will not do anything. The explorer/fighter team(s) however can be active around the clock. They don't need sleep and they heal up over time if they get injured. Still you can keep them going around the clock and the only thing stopping you from doing that would be zombies running around during the night (and attacking your safety area).\n\nThe gameplay initially is ok. You go out and try to find urgently needed resources (more and better weapons, protection, medicine, food and some other things. So scavenging early on is more about finding the few specialized buildings where you have specific resources in higher numbers. Use those materials to make my scavenging team better while the workers just try to collect what ever they can find and build some shabby defenses and shelters for survival.\n\nOnce you have the basics set up it then it basically turns into a search for more stuff gridwise (select 10 houses to exlore and then wait). Once you find cars the scavenging aspect will be faster.\n\nThe base building will always be an ongoing process as it is always about new building and more of them. The problem with that is that it is a painfully slow process and messy in terms of menus and handling. Overall you make a plan for defenses, shelter and production and then you just wait while you click through some occasional minor story lines and instruct the scavenger team to go to the next grid.\n\nAfter a while it then also includes areas outside your central map. Unfortunately the exploration also becomes very tedious. You end up just a hand ful of items you get with every search. Rarely are there any surprises. The story is not engaging enough to keep me invested. You have the typical troped that are being played out,\n\nIt's a bit of a shame...",

But such is the way with early-access projects, hopefully the devs will continue to flesh things out and add some much needed depth to this \"zombie\"-survival, post-apocaliptic city builder. The way the infected can smash their fleshy bodies against reinforced walls and actually win against the walls like they are made of sand instead of shredding their own flesh and bone against the wall's uncaring surface is particularly egregious and something the devs seem loath to address since it threatens to upset the current game balance. For people who will not be bothered by some of the silly things this game does for the sake of making a good challenge, they'll probably really like Infection Free Zone, and I would suggest they give it a try despite my \"negative\" review.\n\nEDIT, in response to the dev comment:\n\nI would not wish for my zone to be unreachable by the infected. That was not the point I was trying to make. I was pointing out the absurdity of the wall system and how stupidly unrealistic it is.\n\nWhy have so many different wall technologies, including brick-walls (which traditionally need demolition equipment ranging from sledgehammers to explosives depending on the thickness) available by default? Then why allow the player to research an even-better variation, and then also research a way to reinforce them to make them even stronger? That’s a lot of focus on something that does not behave like its real-world counterparts. \n\nDon’t put something called “the ultimate sword of slaying,” that requires several tiers of research to both unlock then max-out, into your game, only to have it break after swinging it once or twice in combat.

But such is the way with early-access projects, hopefully the devs will continue to flesh things out and add some much needed depth to this \"zombie\"-survival, post-apocaliptic city builder. The way the infected can smash their fleshy bodies against reinforced walls and actually win against the walls like they are made of sand instead of shredding their own flesh and bone against the wall's uncaring surface is particularly egregious and something the devs seem loath to address since it threatens to upset the current game balance. For people who will not be bothered by some of the silly things this game does for the sake of making a good challenge, they'll probably really like Infection Free Zone, and I would suggest they give it a try despite my \"negative\" review.\n\nEDIT, in response to the dev comment:\n\nI would not wish for my zone to be unreachable by the infected. That was not the point I was trying to make. I was pointing out the absurdity of the wall system and how stupidly unrealistic it is.\n\nWhy have so many different wall technologies, including brick-walls (which traditionally need demolition equipment ranging from sledgehammers to explosives depending on the thickness) available by default? Then why allow the player to research an even-better variation, and then also research a way to reinforce them to make them even stronger? That’s a lot of focus on something that does not behave like its real-world counterparts. \n\nDon’t put something called “the ultimate sword of slaying,” that requires several tiers of research to both unlock then max-out, into your game, only to have it break after swinging it once or twice in combat. That’s gonna raise eyebrows and not in a good way. So don’t put silly and annoying things in your game and then expect people to not comment on how silly and annoying it is. \n\nJust have the scrap-metal walls be the “best” wall type.

The random encounters you experience are the most challenging parts, but unfortunately you are usually ill-prepared, but if you reload the last save in order to prepare, the encounter will occur in a different random spot ensuring that you're going to get screwed a bit.

Hard to put a finger on it exactly, but it feels clunky. For instance you have to constantly pause the game then give specific orders to each squad, press play, pause it again 3 seconds later and do the same thing. \r\n\r\nSkill menus & tech trees need to be expanded. Game needs more polish (the 2 previous games I mentioned at the top of this review are both much more polished.) It would be cool if once you adapt a building it looks significantly different.
