The community is smaller which means most top players know each other or the teams they go against while in game. I do think that is a pretty cool thing within this game and the movement and gunplay doesn't feel all to awful. \n\n\nCONS: \n\nLOTS of bots in Normal/Ranked\n\nDevelopers seem to not being showing much effort and show little no to sign of listening to community input even when they are the few that ARE on the game.\n\nCompetition is non existent until diamond+",

The removal of the jetpack movement and feeling like it's focusing on trying to copy Apex.\n\nJetpacks were fun, and unique but they were so unbalanced and I understand why they had to go. The removal of vehicles I don't agree with but I hope the devs will bring them back. The game IS fun and the focus now is on heroes with abilities as well as finding \"buddies\" around the map that do unique things.\n\nI have fun a lot in this game. It's really well made, no bugs, amazing art style and responsive gameplay. I hope people give it a solid try. The more players it gets the better it will be. Don't write it off because people complain it's not the same as release.\n\nThe only thing I will moan about is devs please stop focusing on first person! This game was awesome in third person and still is and the skins are so well made! Give third person mode more attention than first please!",

Today, I currently own a Stem Deck and I m sick and tired of how the devs handles this game. I tried to give the amount of unneeded changes a pass, because what they added I did liked and didn't mind. I didn't care that it turned to a \"Apex clone\" no longer being a unique game that it was before, because I can't play Apex Legends. I didn't care about the redesigns, because while I do miss the old ones, I think the new ones are good and love the new characters. But after this update... The controller layouts doesn't work and I had to use a different proton just to play a damn match without it crashing! If there is on thing that I will NEVER give a pass, is that the devs doesn't give a DAMN about optimization! This game went from \"Verified\" to \"Playable\" on Steam Deck and to those who owns one, that is a major red flag! And crimson of no controller layouts can function! Not even community layouts can help you! They simply don't understand that if you want people to play the game, then it needs to be playable not just for Steam Deck users, but to everyone! They only want to change the game and add content instead of fixing the main issue that thy refuse to do so for years! Stop giving us stuff that we never asked for and start giving us stuff that we NEED! If you want us to care about this game, then start caring about US!!! This game will die not because we no longer like it, but because you refused to save it! Update: Well I guess most of this review no longer valid, because Lynix players are being banned...

Many of the features that made the game fun have been removed, and the new changes have only made the overall experience worse. What was once an exciting and engaging game has now become frustrating and difficult to enjoy. I truly hope the developers reconsider their decisions and work to restore the quality the game once had.",

The microtransactions are a joke because it forces you to pay to \"rent\" a skin, which is absolute shite. Abilities are often laughable since they don't do what is advertised in a meaningful way mid-match. Skill based matchmaking is non-existent and the bots are all elite snipers. It's hard to get an enjoyable match with a \"just right\" challenge because often times, you're pitted against COD League sweats when you do get real players with a bot for a teammate.

Today, I currently own a Stem Deck and I m sick and tired of how the devs handles this game. I tried to give the amount of unneeded changes a pass, because what they added I did liked and didn't mind. I didn't care that it turned to a \"Apex clone\" no longer being a unique game that it was before, because I can't play Apex Legends. I didn't care about the redesigns, because while I do miss the old ones, I think the new ones are good and love the new characters. But after this update... The controller layouts doesn't work and I had to use a different proton just to play a damn match without it crashing! If there is on thing that I will NEVER give a pass, is that the devs doesn't give a DAMN about optimization! This game went from \"Verified\" to \"Playable\" on Steam Deck and to those who owns one, that is a major red flag! And crimson of no controller layouts can function! Not even community layouts can help you! They simply don't understand that if you want people to play the game, then it needs to be playable not just for Steam Deck users, but to everyone! They only want to change the game and add content instead of fixing the main issue that thy refuse to do so for years! Stop giving us stuff that we never asked for and start giving us stuff that we NEED! If you want us to care about this game, then start caring about US!!! This game will die not because we no longer like it, but because you refused to save it! Update: Well I guess most of this review no longer valid, because Lynix players are being banned... Thanks for making me care and now upset even more.",
