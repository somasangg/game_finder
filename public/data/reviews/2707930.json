The gameplay is THE best, if not one of the best, I've experienced for these types of farming/adventure sim life. My favorite aspect is that you DON'T have to go to \"sleep\" - so you can keep progressing with that extra bit of time! I find that timing of the crops that you take care of works well with the time you can take to go adventuring and completing the world quests. It's also a fun discovery game as you unravel the mysteries of the world as well as your own history. Highly recommend!",

There are temples built around some forgiving platforming too. I tried to whizz through the main quest line, but they slipped a friendship requirement in there. You have to shower the night elves with daily gifts to befriend them, or buy them cheap chocolates for some goofy flirting.\r\n\r\nIt’s not particularly social. The maps are large and with only 25 players to a server you rarely walk by another person. At best someone might point out a rare spawn in all chat. They really need a hangout spot if they want me to spend money. Speaking of, all the microtransactions are purely cosmetic. Free updates and no subscription plans. Perhaps the most generous free to play game I've ever played.",

But once you get passed that whether it’s by watching YouTube videos on tips or just figuring it out yourself the game has this perfect loop of content and I find collecting materials and building my housing area so much fun! The aspect of multiplayer adds a lot of fun to the game, it’s funny to read people’s drama in the chat as well as cooperate with others to get more materials or tackle harder events, also the cooking mini game being extremely coop friendly is great! \nThe ability to request items and gift requested items to people is also great and people are very kind with fulfilling requests in the game :) \n\nDefinitely a big recommend to people who enjoy farming sims!",

      "review": "Started playing this game because I just needed something casual and calming to play, definitely didn't think I'd love it to the extent I do! This game has been so healing, I love the characters and the world, it's so full of personality and I love exploring and collecting items as well as working on my own housing plot little by little! The game is not hard and quite simple to pick up, plus the directions and missions are straightforward and don't have you running around too much without reason. \r\nMy favorite part so far has been the ranching! I really love finding new traits that my animals can have! I've been trying to get cool looking bumbles. I also really enjoy that there's not a big fighting focus, it's mostly hunting and using the resources of the land wisely, although it is nice that if you accidentally sell something you'll need in the future (like I have many, many, many times lol), it's pretty easy to go out into the world for awhile and look around for what you need.\r\n\r\nThe Money Spending:\r\nYou CAN play completely for free, as of the time I'm writing this, you would only need to use money to buy decorative and aesthetic items like clothing, pets, tool skins, etc. My only gripe with the game is that it does feel like even though these aren't necessary, it definitely is one of those things where you'll probably want to spend at least like $20 for a nice outfit or a little companion that hangs out with you. That being said, I personally think it's worth spending a little bit of money for something that makes me happy, especially when the base game, story-line, and world are free to play. \r\nI'm not sure how long they'll keep the single purchases since I see a lot of games going on subscription based payment plans, but for the time being I really appreciate the one time purchases for the cool items instead of a monthly charge (not counting Zeki's loyalty club in this because it is completely optional). It gives people more freedom to play casually, even if it's just in and out every couple days. You won't feel forced to buy anything......but you might really want to.\r\n\r\nI'm so excited to see what they add to this game in the future!!!",

The big things that I love are definitely the amount of customization you can do to your homestead. I love the dialogue between you and the NPCs, their backstories fit the character design and are well thought out. I like the main story of the game, it’s something different and keeps you on your toes- guessing what will happen next, I love the aspect of how the devs clearly want you to create community and be apart of it. All the people I meet and talk to are super generous and kind and I love the atmosphere of being able to play a cozy game and not have to deal with toxicity.\n\nSome small reasons would be things like the tool wheel- easy, simple and has all you need. I love all the different skills, it’s fun to level up each one to unlock new things. I like that there’s an overall home menu where you can easily access your entire plot and rearrange things the way you want to. \n\nI could keep going.

The devs clearly know how to build a world that draws you in and the art style is one of my recent favorites.\n\nBut..... the cosmetics store is a real drag on the overall experience.\n\nTo be fair, they do release new outfits regularly, so a year from now the catalog will probably feel much more robust. My frustration isn’t about the quantity but the pricing strategy. The current price points are wildly high for a cozy game, with full outfits often landing in the $25–$40 range.\n\nI understand the free-to-play model and the need for S6 to generate revenue. I’ve even purchased a few items myself because I want to support a game I genuinely enjoy. But the pricing structure creates a barrier that pushes players away from the premium shop entirely. If I’m going to drop $30 on digital content, I’m more likely to just buy another cozy game outright.\n\nMore affordable cosmetics, or the option to buy pieces individually (tops, bottoms, accessories, etc.), would go a long way in driving engagement and sales. Lower entry points create more flexibility, more impulse buys, and a much more player-friendly experience.\n\nFinal thoughts / tldr: Great game. Fantastic potential. Just hoping the monetization strategy evolves to match the spirit of the cozy genre.",

      "review": "Palia is essentially a 3D Stardew Valley. I know, I know. EVERY cozy game is likened to Stardew Valley. The problem is most of them fall abysmally short. Real cozy gamers know that it's so much deeper than farming. Singularity 6 understands this too. Housing, furniture building, cooking, hunting, mining, fishing, bug collecting are just a few of the things you can do besides farming in this game. The game is completely supported off their cosmetic sales, which is a great model. I get cool looking outfit/environment, player power / gameplay is not disrupted, and this game remains free. Too many free-to-play games fall prey to the Runescape problem of having so little of the game available that you are strongarmed into buying a full version through a subscription. There's no subscription here though, just a free, amazing game with a community full of amazing people.\r\n\r\nThe really mind boggling thing to me was playing this game on PC for the first time. See, I first got this game on my Nintendo Switch prior to ever building a gaming PC. It doesn't run great on Switch, to no surprise because it is a primordial glass brick masquerading as a console. However, despite the terrible framerate and crashes on Switch, I still played on Switch for over 400 hours before building a PC and playing here instead. Palia really is THAT cozy game. And it's literally free so like... what are you waiting for?",

From the moment you arrive in its vibrant, welcoming world, you can tell this isn’t about high-stakes battles or frantic grinding. Instead, it’s about connection, creativity, and carving out your own pace in a beautifully crafted community.\n\nThe quests are interesting yet refreshingly manageable — engaging enough to keep you invested without ever feeling overwhelming. Whether you’re fishing at sunrise, foraging through lush forests, or chatting with your favorite NPCs, everything feels intentional and grounded in relaxation. There’s a genuine sense of freedom in progression — you can pursue goals however and whenever you like, and the game rewards that slower, more mindful playstyle.\n\nWhat makes Palia truly stand out is its variety of activities and the effortless way it weaves them together. Farming, cooking, decorating, exploring, and building friendships all feel meaningful and interconnected. Every element contributes to a feeling of home — a place you want to return to, not rush through.\n\nIf you love cozy games like Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, Rune Factory, or Spiritfarer, but wish for something a little more expansive and social, Palia is exactly that — a world that invites you to stay awhile, breathe, and just be.",

Such as the jump key which is assigned to the far right controller button, yet on switch it is the lower face button.  So now alternating between switch and PC is confusing.  Run button is another - bound to the top face button. WHY??  An \"industry standard\" has been pretty darn established at this point - clearly the Devs don't use controllers or don't play enough games to understand what is standard.  While I 1000% appreciate the game even HAS controller support, there is no excuse to half-ass the standard config AND lock people out of changing ALL keybinds.  Rant over.  Game seems good, but I can't play it without constantly thinking of how asinine this oversight is.  I know this is my own personal problem and I should get over it, but if no one ever speaks up, nothing will ever change.",

      "review": "This game is fantastic! I honestly can't believe it's free to play. There's no FOMO, no timegating, and no artificial scarcity. The only microtransaction that affects gameplay (as of December 2025) is the Founder's Pack courier pet, which lets you send 4 items to storage every 10 minutes. Late into the main questline, you can also earn a free courier pet which lets you send 4 items as well. With the amount of content the game provides for free, this is one of the few games where I feel good about buying cosmetics to support continued development.\n\nThe devs know how to make a cozy game. There's no threat of death or loss of resources. The inventory has a generous overflow system. There's very little competition between players for resources. Everything can be done at your own pace. Even tending to your garden, your plants will never die no matter how long you neglect them.\n\nThe villagers are fun and have unique personalities, even the ones I hate. There's tons of dialogue, including lines that reference quests you've done in the past and dialogue choices that you yourself have made. Gift giving feels natural as people tell you not only what they're in the need for but also what their friends or family might like as a gift.\n\nThe world feels fleshed out and fun to explore, with lots of hidden secrets. Quests are plentiful and fun. Progression has a good, satisfying pace. Mining and woodcutting are enjoyable for some mindless satisfaction. Fishing, hunting, and gardening are all fun and engaging. Cooking is engaging, but I think it needs some tweaks to feel better. Bug catching is a little lackluster in my opinion and could use a little more to make it stand out.\n\nThe animations are incredibly smooth (with some exceptions). The art style looks great. The animals are adorable! It's a visual feast.\n\nOne thing that feels like a bit of a miss is there's not a lot of encouragement to interact with other players. You do get a buff that grants potential double resources by partying up, but you have to be really close to each other to get the benefit. Other than that, there's not a lot of interaction I've seen besides people calling out rare resources in chat. In the future I'd like to see some systems that emphasize the MMO side of things a bit more.\n\nPalia is still in beta, so things are subject to change. And because it's in beta, there's lots of bugs, mostly visual or UI-related. But as it stands right now, this game provides an absurd amount of fun for free. I have high hopes for its future.\n\n[h1]My Rating: 4/5[/h1]",

At the time of writing, the pay-for-convenience isn't required to make the game playable (it's nothing like running speed or inventory space, for examples of other games' \"optional\" purchases that aren't). \n\nThere is no threat of character death/dying in the game. If you fall off an island in the sky, you just respawn on the edge. Nothing attacks you, and none of the puzzles do damage: you don't even have a health bar. The challenges are in the form of puzzles (some jumping puzzles, not all jumping puzzles) and grind. \n\nThe community wobbles between fantastic and really problematic. A lot of people are really nice. A minority of people participate by having self-imposed \"nice\" community rules that they won't explain to you, but they WILL shriek at you and insult you for breaking (when group activities spawn, you'd BETTER do it right according to them, or else).  The good news is, you can completely ignore them, and somebody will eventually explain what those other people are on about. The rules in question are reasonable, but the people trying to \"enforce\" them are...not, lol. \n\nFarming loop is very satisfying (but very limited), ranching currently sucks (my chickens are really cute tho), mining and foraging are a++++++++++++, grindy without being too grindy. Fishing is great. Cooking is...very active. Sometimes I like it, sometimes I just want to eat a stupid sandwich and wish there were a less time consuming option that wasn't drops in a bucket for my energy pool. Hunting is initially awesome but gets stupid and annoying pretty quickly. \n\nDecorating is good. Furniture doesn't take up space in your storage, and the crafting loop for it is enjoyable. You learn recipes by crafting other recipes in that pattern. Unfortunately there really isn't anything to DO with the furniture except use it or store it; you can't sell it or (as far as I know) give it away to other players. \n\nNPCs are only half a step above SDV NPCs in being fleshed out, but their tropes are fun and their quips are entertaining. Romances are questlines, and they're cute. Voice acting is consistent, from fair to good depending on the character, I haven't run into any bad voice acting at all. \n\nLore is reasonably good. MSQ is unlikely to offer any surprises, but it's entertaining. \n\nWorth playing, worth contributing to the operating costs by way of buying an overly expensive outfit or two if you have disposable income for video games. If nothing else, grab the starter pack and/or the founders pack once you're sure you're going to stick around and play to get your money's worth out of them.",

If you like mining all day, fishing all day, farming all day, weaving all day and daily quests. This game is for you.\r\n\r\nIf you're hear for a couple of hours this will be great but don't expect this to be anything long term unless you're the retired sort looking for some dailies to bring you some daily dopamine with none of the hassle.\r\n\r\nThe quests and story progression take so long and are not rewarding at all. When I say they take a long time I mean it takes them like 2 years to come up with 3 quests. \r\n\r\nBy this point the community is also dead. It's the same 20 whales that are content creators and some form of rotating new people that swing by and go \"TeeHee I've played this for 3 hours and this is great.\" \r\n\r\nFor the biggest Con/ Downside. \r\n\r\nThis game doesn't let you trade your actual items. I.e If you have a boat load of crops and you want to give some to a new person so they can begin trying to cook etc. There's no trading feature. They will let you trade useless plushies though. So go figure. \r\n\r\nYou can \"request\" items. Only 4 a day and here's the best part. It's an item you had to have already obtained. So. Lets say you need an emerald to complete a quest. Guess what. You better find your own. After you find one then you can request one. Or even better. You need some rice crop to complete a cooking endeavor. You need to have harvested it in order to request it. To which, you only get like 2. \r\n\r\nNow. If I can request an Epic item like a Ruby.

You just trade your items to your bin and get paid minimum coin. Then your coin kinda also just sits there because yeah. There's nothing to buy. \r\n\r\nCool concept. Baby's first MMO but I've seen more exciting ones on Roblox and I legit mean that. \r\nYou'll never Die in this game. There's no battle system. You can shoot a deer though, or an animal or two. No fall damage either. It's why I call it Baby's first MMO. \r\n\r\nNo real life economy, no battle, no damage to be taken, no real stamina gauge (Outside of \"faith\" and even then it just limits your Exp gain to which after a certain point no one cares because you don't have any Stats.)

      "review": "I don't typically make reviews and by no means am I a game creator or an expert. This review is mostly coming from the eyes of someone who fell in love with Palia and quickly grew to dislike it.\n\nI'll start it out pretty simple. I was fresh to Steam and got a little bored of the handful of games I had, so I searched for new games and saw Palia. To me, it just seemed like a 3D Stardew and when I popped in the game I got hooked by the customization and achievements. (Being a completionist is the death of me lmao) If you're someone that likes to 100% games or just spend hours doing activities like catching bugs, hunting things, and maybe even fishing then this game will most likely hook you like it did to me. I actually adored Palia for the first 300 hours of my gameplay. Not only did I have all this stuff to do, but there were also communities where I could connect with people. Very rarely did I run into rude/toxic players in the in-game community. \n\nNow this sounds fairly positive so far, right? Wrong. \n\nEventually, I joined their Discord server to get more regular updates - because that's what every lover of a game does. The big problem? There was absolutely no communication with the community at all. For a game that practically revolves around looting things you catch/hunt you would think they'd fix a bug where loot glitches into the sky/ground and you can't grab it, right? Again, WRONG. They've \"fixed\" it a few times and it consistently keeps coming back, not to mention the amount of times the games terrain makes bugs and huntables just straight up disapear. This might not seem like too much of a problem, but Palia has a rarity system. \n\nI'll use my experience as an example. There are epic bugs (currently the highest rarity of bug I believe) and you need both regular and star quality to get certain achievements. These bugs - namely Rainbow Tipped Butterfly and Fairy Mantis - can be a big pain to get. However, I got lucky. Or so I thought. I was just wandering around when I saw a star quality Fairy Mantis (The last bug I needed and one I spent a few hundred hours searching for). I caught it, and it glitched into the ground and I couldn't pick it up. I didn't find another one for about 200 hours of gameplay. \n\nIf that wasn't bad enough, early on in my playing of Palia (We'll say January of 2025) there weren't a lot of big updates much less a roadmap or any communication on what was going on. The most we got were premium store updates which rubbed a lot of people the wrong way - I wonder why? I will say that the one bonus of Palia is that it doesn't force boosts or lock things behind money which is surprising for a free game but anyways. A few months later, we got Elderwoods. Not only that, but we got a roadmap too! Things were actually looking good. That was until these updates actually came out. Yes, I'm talking about the new housing line and the ranching system. Now this might just be my personal opinion, but they overhyped it quite a bit. This led to a lot of players being disappointed by the limited choices with the new housing line (not to mention the price of it) and how dull the ranching system actually was.\n\nI would also like to stress just how horrible some of these achievements are. I have all but two achievements completed. The two I have left are: Pebble Plunderer (Get all pebbles and give them to Einar), and the Makeshift Collector (Obtain every makeshift item from waterlogged chests) Let's dive into Pebble Plunderer. Most of the pebbles you can find around the lands of Palia, except for the smooth pebble. For some godforsaken reason, that pebble can be obtained by random chance from oysters. I am not exaggerating when I say I've opened 2000 (maybe more) oysters and have not obtained one. There was speculation that it was bugged, but I don't believe it was ever confirmed. I disliked repetitive grinding, the only reason I could get through hunting/bug catching was because I was actively focusing on something. Running up and down the coast of Bahari for hours (Which by the way, when you step into the shallow water that is supposed to be fine, you drown. That bug has been around for months.) is not how I want to spend my gameplay. Now onto Waterlogged Chests. You can obtain these from fishing - again at random chance. Personally, I dislike fishing in games but I actually liked Palia's mechanic which is why I can sort of stand it. But again, we run into the problem of just standing there for hours and clicking away. \n\nNow I'm sure you could sit there and say \"But Pumpki, you don't need to do all of that!\" And you're 100% right, I don't. However, I have completed every quest, every board, and all of the relationships with the villagers (Which haven't been expanded in a hot minute) and like I said before, completionist. Again, I'd like to stress that I'm no game developer or expert - and some of this does come from a place of bias. But if you fall in love with a game and witness first hand just how horrible things are handled, it might rub you the wrong way too. \n\nThis isn't to say that Palia isn't a good game. Personally I think that it's a pretty good game with a lot of potential. Most of these issues can be chalked up to poor development and poor communication. That's also not to say that the whole dev team is bad, but if you spend enough time in the community you'll most likely see that there's huge room for improvement. \n\nI really did fall in love with the characters, the story, and the overall design of the game. And yes, I poured many many hours of my life into it. Do I regret it? Sort of. Palia isn't the worst game out there and for free it is pretty decent, but if you're looking for something to grow attached to long-term and watch the development blossom I strongly decide against it.\n\nTLDR: Palia is a decent game without paywalls and gives you plenty to do (If you're a completionist and like decorating/customization) but I strongly advise against growing attached or staying long-term due to the lack of communication between developers and their community (Worst I've seen so far) and the prioritization of mediocre updates over fixing long-term, sometimes game breaking bugs.",

I would love to keep playing this game, but would like to know what's happening with the story line. It's a flawed game mechanic and system to not be able to restart your character or create a new one. If I picked up where I left off, I'd be lost and would just uninstall the game. If you are someone who does not play any other games and will only be locked in on this one, then it's perfect for you. If you are someone who likes to game hop and play different things sometimes, I'd suggest waiting until they figure out the mechanics of restarting the game.",

      "review": "Palia starts out looking harmless and soft, but once you spend more time in it, the whole structure shows how little there actually is to do. The early moments feel fine, then the repetition creeps in, and it becomes obvious that the game leans on chores instead of anything that feels rewarding.\n\nProgression is the biggest problem. You gather materials, feed them into tasks, wait through long timers, build a room, and then the final result barely matters. Even the house building loop feels dull. Nothing in it gives any sense of payoff. After a while, the only reasonable question is why you would keep putting energy into something that refuses to give anything back.\n\nThe clothing situation makes the everyday experience worse. Every outfit that looks remotely cute requires real money. The free clothes look like leftovers. Character style should be a fun part of a game like this, but here it feels restricted unless you pay. That takes a lot of enjoyment out of the basic presentation of your character.\n\nNPC relationships never grow into anything interesting. You hand them gifts, watch a bar move, and end up with scenes that feel hollow. It is a friendship system without any real development. It does not matter how much time you put into it. The interpretation stays the same every time. It is just a loop.\n\nThe quests deserve their own separate analysis because they are boring as hell. They stretch out simple tasks into long sequences that feel like homework. I could not even finish them. Every objective felt like the same assignment copied and pasted into a new location. There is no momentum and no sense of progress, and the entire questline falls apart because of it.\n\nMoving around the world highlights even more problems. You travel long distances to reach areas that contain very little. Resource spawns appear inconsistent. Sometimes you end up standing in place waiting for something to appear again. It does not feel calm. It simply feels empty.\n\nWhen you put all these pieces into one conclusion, the problem becomes clear. Palia asks for time without giving any meaningful return. The world looks friendly at first glance, but the gameplay underneath feels flat and unrewarding. After enough hours, you stop trying to push the game forward because the answer becomes too obvious. There is no real point to keep going.",

He's basically useless unless you're trying to romance him or when you're talking to him at the start of the game. However once you're on the game for a bit, Jel (the tailor) because useless unless you're going to his shop to get premium clothing. I understand why they did that but you can also just access the clothing through the menu so i feel like they should have used Jel as a way to sell/buy fabric and/or use him as a way to get non premium clothing. Like basic outfits.\n\nI think this game is also still in development but it does get boring (to me) after a while which is why i only have 27.4 hours in this game.

It's partially that the pickaxe hit animation is strobe like and that I cannot disable it; that's my first cue that they don't really care about polishing the game. The next cue is the construction of the landscape and the spread of the foliage. Something's off here. It's a false world, I do understand that i am entering another \"world\", right? So why are they using foliage construction techniques from 2007? Are they trying to fool me into thinking it is low resolution for resource saving purposes? The game is cheapened by its own lackluster presentation. \n\nIt flaunted a world of creativity, and I see stiffness. The game fails to clarify whether or not my plot will be immediately shared with other players or not. I am thrust into the tutorial which isolates me and fails to build momentum as to why i might want to play the game or interact with other players. \n\n do not want to have to phase out to meet other players. That is my immediate first impression of the game, and I'm sorry, but that sticks with me after Blizzard and Jagex stole 20 years of my life. Are you gonna make me work like shit for minimal payoff? The answer seems like yes. \n\nThe game doesn't know who it wants to cater to. Are you gonna give this to your kids because you don't want to dish out money for a Disney product? Probably. Are you gonna teach them the way of the mills on the crafting farms? WHY? Why would I play this if there is no immediate payoff nor any quest that interests me? It wants me to get hooked to the characters themselves, as if I am in a visual fanfic from Road to El Dorado fans. I want to leave.\n\nBitch at me if you want for only getting 30 mins in, and my point is, you should have gotten me to other players or the point of the game by then, not tortured me like a child with builder quests to prove to me that you can do one step ahead of the unfinished Animal Crossing of the past. Don't force me to play two hours before I can see whether or not this is worth my time. I have better things to do than to look away from the garish design choices \"to be nice\".",

      "review": "In general, life sim games (farming, cooking, etc.) are among my favorite video game genres. While these games are typically more enjoyable in single-player mode, I decided to give Palia a try, and honestly, it’s been a largely disappointing experience. Here are the things that frustrated me the most:\n\n-Rather than a true life sim, Palia feels like a furniture-crafting simulator. About 95% of what you can craft is furniture.\n\n-The game’s core design imposes numerous limitations, forcing you to invest excessive time in nearly everything.\n\n-If the game is supposedly in “beta,” it shouldn’t bombard me with constant notifications to buy from the premium store.\n\n-You can’t freely grind and stockpile materials because the game caps your inventory. You’re limited to creating just eight measly chests, which can be upgraded to increase storage space. The most ridiculous part? Furniture storage is unlimited, so you could craft 100,000 chairs without issue.\n\n-If you planned to fill your property with crops, you’re out of luck. The game restricts you to purchasing a maximum of nine tiny garden soils. This leaves you with two choices: plant a little of everything and spend your time constantly watering crops and pulling weeds, or use a garden planner to figure out the most efficient crop layout.\n\n-Fabric and silk in the game are only used for crafting curtains and tablecloths for furniture. If you thought you could use them to make clothes, the game quickly informs you that clothing is only available for purchase with premium currency.\n\n-Hunting is incredibly dull. You spend dozens of hours chasing the same four creatures with their “variants”: a squirrel, a deer, a wolf, and a toad.\n\n-Cooking is by far the worst skill. It’s painfully slow to level up. Recipes serve only two purposes: boosting your Focus or acting as collectibles. If you thought you could make money from cooking, the economy is wildly unbalanced. Many recipes cost a fortune to make, yet you only recover about 20% of their value.\n\n-The introduction of the Ranching skill is equally awful. You can only level it up by petting animals, and it takes 17 real-world hours to progress. Seriously, what?!\n\n-The RNG is atrocious. Good luck trying to find a black pearl or a shiny pebble, which have less than a 1% drop rate. It can take weeks to gather the necessary resources.\n\n-My PC can handle triple-A games with ease, but with Palia, I’m forced to play on medium graphics settings and cap the FPS at 60 to avoid crashes. This speaks volumes about the game’s poor technical performance.\n\nI could go on about other things I disliked, but in short, Palia has been far from the cozy and relaxing experience it’s marketed to be.",

Bugs not getting fixed, 0 new content, Sure its free, yes they need to make money but there is making money to make a game and making a game that's just there to farm money off of cosmetics. If you don't buy cosmetics and you don't care about QOL and game breaking bugs interfering with your ability to play its great! i genuinly enjoyed some aspects of the game... but the more i played and the more broken content i ran into and the more i realized that multiple people were dumping thousands of dollars into cosmetics the more it killed the vibe. glad i didn't spend money on the game... if you spend 1000 dollars on cosmetics and the game is free, the game is 1000 dollars... which if a 3A company put out a game for 1000 then everyone would laugh...",

      "review": "This game technically offers co-op, but the experience is heavily restricted. My review focuses solely on the co-op aspect, and based on that, I can't recommend it. If you're planning to play solo, then absolutely, this game could be a great fit. But if your goal is to team up and enjoy the game together, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.\n\nI feel sad for this because I really wanted to enjoy this, it is enjoyable but it's more of a solo thing which is not for me.\n\nI will get into this a lot more below, first up the basics.\n\nGraphics: The game adopts a cartoon-style visual approach, clean, simple, and easy on the eyes. It runs exceptionally smoothly, and the graphics never detract from the experience. In fact, the art style feels charming and laid-back, creating a welcoming atmosphere. Elements like water and trees are nicely done, though the grass foliage is quite basic. Still, given how flawlessly it performs at max settings, it's a reasonable trade-off.\n\nAudio: The game features simple, relaxing, and calming sound design that complements the overall atmosphere well. While the music was a bit grating, I ended up turning it off, the rest of the audio is solid and fits the game's vibe nicely.\n\nControls: Full key rebinding is supported, and everything functions smoothly without issue. That said, the character controls can feel a bit off at times. especially during climbing, where he occasionally falls for no apparent reason. It’s frustrating when it happens, but aside from that, the controls are generally fine.\n\nGame-play and everything else after: The game is a free-to-play, open-world life sim with light farming elements, though \"open-world\" is a bit generous, as the map is fairly small and it forces you to load into other areas. It's hard to pin down exactly what genre it fits into. One thing’s for sure: you’ll spend the vast majority of your time running. I mean really running. It made me forget DayZ’s reputation as a running simulator, this game easily takes that crown. There are no mounts, vehicles, or fast-travel boards to get around, the fast travel to base or a town specific is limited and costs in game currencies. Movement is entirely on foot, and that’s the core game-play loop.\n\nYou do get a homestead, a private base you can build and expand. You can invite a friend to visit and even give them editor permissions, but their actions don’t affect your world, example granting editor etc and you need to build something for a mission, they do too, in you base only counts for you so you cannot work together to achieve the same common goal and have one base for both of you, which works when you play this game with a partner but this doesn’t do it that way. Co-op is limited to simply running around together. You can’t share quest progress (e.g., if a quest asks for five carrots, you both have to collect five individually), and while you can farm or mine side by side and both pick up resources, that’s about the extent of it. It’s not a true co-op experience, which is disappointing. My wife and I jumped in hoping to play collaboratively, but it ended up feeling like two solo games running in parallel. She enjoyed it to a certain point; I got bored because it’s mainly single player with added other people. \n\nIf you and your friend has the same mission, it doesn’t matter. You BOTH have to individually complete each action, regardless if it’s the same thing. There are many games that do this a lot better. If you both have the same quest, one person can run on and complete it all without needing both people… this game doesn’t do that. It’s solo with a friend to run around the world with. \n\nOn the free-to-play side, it’s fair. It gets you in the door, and while there’s a bit of FOMO with limited-time event items, everything is cosmetic, no pay-to-win, no stat boosts. That said, the cosmetics lean heavily toward feminine styles. Most outfits seem designed with female characters in mind, and masculine options are sparse. You can wear anything regardless of gender, but it’s not uncommon to see male characters in corsets in this game due to the way the skins are positioned. The game clearly caters more to a female audience, which is fine, it’s not a bad game by any means but there are males who would like to play and look the same but a male alternative. But the co-op is bare-bones, the grind is real, and the game-play loop just isn’t for me.\n\nThe game features a range of skills, from foraging and mining to chopping trees and even capturing creatures in a Pokémon-style system. The more you engage with these activities, the more XP you earn, levelling up to unlock better tools and capture gear but we found this to be very grinding, spending lots of time chopping trees to barely get a level. You start with basic materials like stone and gradually work your way up, though tools do require repairs over time. It’s a decent progression system, but the repetitive grind can wear thin.\n\nFor the solo experience it is an enjoyable relaxing life game with quests, LOTS of running and more running and then more running and chopping trees, solving little puzzles, falling off climbing with a full bar etc. it’s not bad for that. \n\nYou can fast travel back to your homestead which is good but this is limited to once every 15mins I believe, second you can fast travel around the map via billboards but this is not free, it costs 10 to 100 gold to fast travel using the boards. Considering I was still getting my head around and spending gold, it was useless to use. Couple this with the amount of running around, it makes fast travel to speak to someone, to fast travel to hand in, to fast travel to gather a very costly and not viable option.\n\nYou have a focus bar which you need to monitor throughout. It’s like stamina but for working is the only way to explain it. \n\nWould I recommend the game? It’s a shame Steam doesn’t offer a middle-ground rating, because this game would fit perfectly. If you're looking for a solo experience, absolutely give it a try—it's a cozy, relaxing game that delivers well on that front. But if you're hoping for meaningful co-op, be aware: you can run around together and collect items, but that’s where it ends. You can’t share quest progress or collaborate in any real way. Co-op here is essentially just walking side by side and based on that I am not recommending this game because my soul intention was co-op and it's let me down.",

If you like mining all day, fishing all day, farming all day, weaving all day and daily quests. This game is for you.\r\n\r\nIf you're hear for a couple of hours this will be great but don't expect this to be anything long term unless you're the retired sort looking for some dailies to bring you some daily dopamine with none of the hassle.\r\n\r\nThe quests and story progression take so long and are not rewarding at all. When I say they take a long time I mean it takes them like 2 years to come up with 3 quests. \r\n\r\nBy this point the community is also dead. It's the same 20 whales that are content creators and some form of rotating new people that swing by and go \"TeeHee I've played this for 3 hours and this is great.\" \r\n\r\nFor the biggest Con/ Downside. \r\n\r\nThis game doesn't let you trade your actual items. I.e If you have a boat load of crops and you want to give some to a new person so they can begin trying to cook etc. There's no trading feature. They will let you trade useless plushies though. So go figure. \r\n\r\nYou can \"request\" items. Only 4 a day and here's the best part. It's an item you had to have already obtained. So. Lets say you need an emerald to complete a quest. Guess what. You better find your own. After you find one then you can request one. Or even better. You need some rice crop to complete a cooking endeavor. You need to have harvested it in order to request it. To which, you only get like 2. \r\n\r\nNow. If I can request an Epic item like a Ruby. Or 3 pieces of wheat... and I only get 4 of these requests every 24 hours. Which one of these... do you think I'm going to request? \r\n\r\nThere's also no real economy. You just trade your items to your bin and get paid minimum coin. Then your coin kinda also just sits there because yeah. There's nothing to buy. \r\n\r\nCool concept. Baby's first MMO but I've seen more exciting ones on Roblox and I legit mean that. \r\nYou'll never Die in this game. There's no battle system. You can shoot a deer though, or an animal or two. No fall damage either. It's why I call it Baby's first MMO. \r\n\r\nNo real life economy, no battle, no damage to be taken, no real stamina gauge (Outside of \"faith\" and even then it just limits your Exp gain to which after a certain point no one cares because you don't have any Stats.)

You can't say anything in the discord because the community is glazing the ever-living heck out of the devs. I know they are working on it, but maybe work a bit less on releasing store content every 2 weeks, and instead focus on the main story.

They may also update you bit by bit about a side story of someone they know and you can help influence their decisions. I loved this, maybe my standards are just so low because many games don't handle dialogue this well but Palia does a great job on this front.\n\n[+++] [b]Community can be very kind[/b] but beware of the unexplained etiquette. There are some unexplained rules that, if not followed, will lead to you being blocked by other players for not knowing better. Being blocked means you won't be able to read when they call out a grove or flow tree or anything.\n\nSome of these hidden practices are cutting down the grove at 3am in order to give everyone time to arrive, and to call out silver/gold nodes when you stumble upon them.\n\nTo highlight how silly this is, I only found out about the 3am rules because I got curious and checked the Palia subreddit, otherwise I wouldn't have. I only came across 1 grove myself so I don't think I've been blocked yet, but if this is a reality then it's a disappointing one. Please do not assume everyone is a meanie.\n\nWith that out of the way, people are also supportive in different ways: they will donate requested items if you ask nicely in chat (no shame doing that), they will call out for silver/gold nodes so you can go mine them as well (provided they do not despawn before you do) and they will help you find gatherables around the area that you aren't familiar with, and for that they can take all my kudos.\n\n[h2] Things I like [/h2]\n\n[++] [b]There are community events that justify this game being online.[/b] I worded it like this because initially I thought this was a single player with a multiplayer layer in the background but as you progess you'll find out there are a few events that can happen in the various maps where it becomes useful to team up with other folks, be it with the grove, scattered flow trees or the flowers.\n\n[+] [b]Clothes are stylish on both body types.[/b] I get the feeling even if most of the clothes are catered towards female players, my avatar slays in the previews.

This additionally makes sure there is nothing to work towards for, as every cosmetic is an IAP, and you have to be content wih collecting plushies nobody will ever see.\n\n[h2] Things I HATE [/h2]\n\n[--] [b]Villagers who visit your lot will spawn underground[/b] and be invisible for you. Thankfully the game shows them in the compass or I wouldn't have found any of them! You can talk to them even if they're underground by walking near and pressing F.\n\n[---] [b]Watering can will stop working for no reason[/b] at all, even if it's full. It's happened to me once and I couldn't help watering a plant. The can just wouldn't pour water.\n\n[---] [b]Quest marks will sometimes point to a place you can't walk to[/b] manually, because you need to get there by other means (such as the hidden cave entrance). This was especially annoying with the Auni quest, where he asked me to go back to the cave he found previously but I didn't remember where it was. The quest pointed me to the direct location rather than the path I needed to take to get there, and so I had to ask in the chat instead.

This might happen but is not exclusive with the pirate quest where Auni and his brother only spawn in the Elderwoods.

(if the minuses weren't clear enough) The map can be so convoluted (especially Elderwood) and the pinned locations not appearing upset me to no end as I get lost or walk in circles trying to get somewhere. Most disappointing part is that I've read around that Singularity 6 has not been patching out bugs but they've been busy adding new premium clothes instead. This discourages me and makes me less likely to go throught the mud ignoring all the negative aspects.\n\nYou will enjoy the game until you visit Elderwood, after which the game will become an absolute bugfest.",

Glider should make you way faster, but it feels like it's the same speed.\n\nMining is tedious, because it takes 4 hits for a small rock to harvest 1 material and because spawn points are distributed across the entire map. Sometimes I ran around for 30-60 seconds just to find another rock which then had some different material or it was just a small rock with said 1 material.\n\nCooking mini games and thus leveling up cooking is monotonous.\n\nPuzzles are pushing buttons in order or sliding puzzles, my brain doesn't release any dopamine or any feeling of accomplishment.\n\nTemple of Gales is an absolute mess. It's a 3 hour mission of running back & forth (because of wonky climbing mechanism + terrible re-spawn points and certain events not being triggered in the order the game wants it).\n\nHarvesting requires you to log in every hour at xx:15, because that's when the server makes an update on all farms on all logged in players.\n\nTemple of Gales summed up many issues I have with this game.

When Infinity Nikki messed up their update a few months ago by being greedy I was first to say they should have done it like Palia, Palia knows how to make a free to play game. Well my opinion has now changed. We looked forward to the latest update with so much excitement until they decided to put the new animal husbandry behind a expensive paywall. You can breed your animals but if you want to show them to the world you have to pay a steep price.\n\nI do not have a issue to pay for a game, I have a very large library and I don't mind paying for a AAA title, but charging so much for a feature of the game, you might as well have put the entire part as a separate DLC which I could decide to buy if I wanted. Problem is Palia is showing greed which is going to hurt the game the same way it did Infinity Nikki. If their prices were lower, we would have already spent a lot more on the game but no thanks.\n\nWhy would I spend the same amount it costs me to buy Baldur's Gate 3 on a feature to showcase my animals, are you crazy!

It's like the single most inoffensive and uninspired fantasy world I've ever seen.\r\n\r\nY'know how, to communicate that we're in a different culture, sometimes fantasy characters will use different words for common terminology? They call days SUN ROTATIONS. The writing is incredibly sloppy and uninspired, the dialogue is not well worded or well paced, sounds like what someone that has ever only seen fantasy in parodies from cartoons thinks fantasy sounds like.\r\n\r\nEverybody is happy and cheerful, all of the NPCs are so violently generic, down to them having a set of voice lines they say when you enter or leave a conversation with them that turn them into walking archetypes. Literally just walking archetypes, there's absolutely nothing to them, no hints of actual characters anywhere. Their \"quirks\" are PAINFULLY engineered. The dude that constantly talks in gardening puns, took me a bit to even work up the courage to [b]go up to and talk to him[/b] to continue the quest.\r\n\r\nSomehow they managed to grab the generic fantasy trope and make a generic version of it. I've never seen a game this utterly empty, devoid of any vision or creativity. Like, it's such a cataclysmically uninspired flaming hot dung pile I actually recommend it just because no words I choose can possibly convey how utterly [b]無[/b]m it is. This is like if you grabbed all of the fantasy works ever published and took the geometric average. It's so inoffensive it actually gives me murderous intent, it makes me feel violent. The game is a few gigabytes and I feel like I need to personally apologize to each and every one of the electrons I've wasted by forcing them to flow to represent this sheer industrial distilled water of a fantasy work. My electric bill is gonna have to upcharge me to penalize me for wasting the matter field's time generating the electrons required to power my PC through this game.\r\n\r\nThis makes ChatGPT read like Tolkien. I could just run a bunch of generators in series and the output would be more coherent than this. \r\n\r\nBut even then, I actually do recommend this game! You should play this game, if anything, because words cannot actually convey properly how incredibly generic this game is. Luckily the game makes quick work of establishing its credentials so, you'll make quick work of your discovery process.\r\n\r\nPlay this game. Something this null only comes once in a lifetime.

I can't help but wonder why on earth this is multiplayer. Servers aren't cheap to run and the game just plays like a single player farming sim. Really should have an offline single-player mode at least. I don't understand why I have to wait in a queue of 500 players when the servers go down just to see other players on my screen. Chat is mainly empty, people just run past each other doing their own thing all the time, etc.\n\nIt feels more like the few multiplayer activities it does have exist to justify the mutliplayer aspect rather than existing because this game was built with multiplayer in mind. I just do not care to interact with the players around me because the game gives me no reason to.\n\nI'll guess the motivation was consistent monetisation? It genuinely confuses me. Honestly, I'd prefer a one-time purchase and a few DLC to buy. Even as someone who personally has spent a bit on mobile gacha and is currently subbed to an MMO, I can't justify spending my money on some really expensive cosmetics for a game that I don't even have a guarantee of permanently owning and won't have the emotional attachment of a highly active in-game community to.\n\nReally wish there was some actual combat. Not on the main maps, but maybe a dungeon or something. Or a further map? Solo or team PvE, bosses that give rare resources and need a team to take down, perhaps a ranking board for solo since it's live-service...just please give me something to do with other players if this is going to be permanently multiplayer.\n\nAlso, while I know this is in beta, having NPCs constantly sink through the floor, which has been happening for over a year now and still isn't fixed, sometimes just makes quests near unfinishable in its current state. Not great.\n\nOther bugs I encountered very frequently: \n\n-Random t-posing\n-Characters twitching\n-Real bad pop-ins literally at my character's feet with steady fps\n-My character randomly turning invisible\n-Weird lighting issues\n-Misaligned textures (edit)\n-Floating items including rock textures (edit)\n-Invisible NPCs (edit)\n\nAnd for the love of god [b] please add an actual mini map option, not just a nav bar at the top.

      "review": "CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!\r\n\r\nI started the game October 3rd 2025. At this point the game has been out for 2 years? It is now October 13th. (Happy thanksgiving to Canadians) . I read a lot of reviews and complaints of other players. At first I kind of just see from their perspective how this game can bee frustrating. Now that i'm ten days into the day... I can say I'm starting to run out of things to do. Of course this is coming from an unemployed gamer  (economy is trash rn) that has been grinding for the Halloween event. Lots of the event items require you to be at a higher skill level for every thing.  \r\n\r\nThe bugs. Oh the bugs. Now obviously yes, game is free, yes game is in beta, but it's been two years since release. Not to mention every bug I encounter and search up, they're not new. A lot of the bugs I've experienced this week and a half are all bugs people have been reporting for years, weeks, months. I also, like most, can't help but notice the amount of shop content there is. Polished outfits, and tool skins, pets etc. I understand there needs to be profit, but please the game needs some attention too. \r\n\r\n I finally got into the story and lore to find out I've practically gone through all the content. The story isn't bad per say. It's quite interesting and makes me a little sad for and towards some characters. The villagers all have their own personality and it's interesting interacting with them. However once we max out friendships with them there feels like there's no real reason to continue gifting them anymore. Other than the interaction and roleplaying. I do like that you can romance multiple people at the same time however you can only wear two pins at once. \r\n\r\nIs this a co-op game? barely. I started this game because my bestie wanted to try it out. I didn't expect much out of it at first tbh. I found myself enjoying the game. It had everything I liked in survival/factory/mmo/farming simulator. Theres no fall damage, HP bar, no punishment in any way. Extremely cozy and relaxing.  I did find myself super addicted really as it is genuinely fun at first. The amount of interactions I've had with my friend IN THE GAME was maybe we pass by each other coincidentally in the game. We're usually busy with other things going on in the game. We would be on discord and thats how we played \"together\".  \"hey do you know where this NPC/villager is right now\" , \"where do you buy this item from again?\" . Occasionally we would visit each others plots to look around. We do the piksii bounce together because that's set to certain time sin the game. To play with friends and do party activities i feel like it would be way later into the game, or earlier if youre not too concentrated on other stuff you need to do solo. But to ME it feels 80% solo, 20% co-op. \r\n\r\nI typed a lot and I may have lost track of the order and what I wanted to convey. I'll end this with what I felt like the game could add or improve on while playing. \r\n\r\n- Swimming/drowning\r\nlike I said there is no punishment in this game what so ever, if you drown you simply respawn nearby. but it's frustrating to drown when i'm walking around in a shallow area and theres one small spot where it's not shallow any more and I drown. i'm not asking for full on swimming mechanic but even a few seconds jut to get back on land would be nice. (although I saw someone say they wanted an underwater area which I thought was cool)\r\n\r\n-climbing\r\nclimbing mechanic is fine reminds me of BOTW/GENSHIN (yes i also hate when ppl compare this game to those but i'm only referring to stamina wheel). When getting stuck or randomly falling for no apparent reason it does get annoying and maybe it something that can be improved on im not sure.\r\n\r\n- Farming\r\nPlease allow us to add more farming soil. The plot/homestead has such a big surface area. When the game runs out of content the decorating and furnishing is such a huge aspect to veteran players. We should be able to do what we want with it and that includes farming. \r\n\r\nTrading/requests\r\nI really do enjoy the requesting in the game. And how you can't request certain items unless you've seen/obtained the item before. But I wish there was a better trading system. The trading system we currently have is limited to pods (decor) , artifacts and such. Being able to have player based market or trading system for regular items would be nice. even if we limit it to only trading with people on friends list idk. something would be nice. \r\n\r\nLet us unbuild/sell decor and furniture. I think this always bothered me that we cant do this. refund on half the materials even, anything. \r\n\r\nI would hope one day events incorporate better rewards, such as cosmetics. If there is a grinding system so that we can obtain more cosmetics or limited time content I think that would be fun. Give us motivation to keep playing. I guarantee players would grind for a new outfit. the prizes for current events is not very enticing (to me anyways). \r\n\r\nI know its in beta, but new areas eventually is a given. but more importantly if we can add more animals we can hunt thatd be great. I always thought to myself, i can hear the bird but i cant see them (lol). I'd be down to cook chicken and what not. \r\n\r\nI'm sure this one is in the works (maybe), given that they recently added ranching anf farm animals, but being able to make our own oil, butter, vinegar etc, would be cool. Im okay with just buying it as well ( i just hate running back and forth to buy it). \r\n\r\nOkay I'm going to stop here because it's starting to become a nitpicking post. Feel free to criticise or agree with me in the comments or add stuff I missed. I wrote this on a whim as i drink coffee.",

The game is essentially a 3D stardew valley that just gives decorations and home (base, honestly) expansions with repeat cycle refinement difficulty curves for tool upgrades.\r\nThe fake difficulty is imposed by the gate of tool grade requirements to harvest the next resources for tools. Yet the work is for what?\r\nA house that you can decorate with worthless bugs and fish you caught?\r\nExcessively expensive house type upgrades and larger footprints?\r\nSupposed social interaction through friends visiting your house... for no reason other than to show off your worthless bugs that they've caught too?\r\n\r\nThere's an NPC relationship system that doesn't seem to actually serve much of a purpose beyond them giving you \"gifts\" from you finding out what they want and then gifting it to them - No different than stardew valley.\r\n\r\nThey include a poorly implemented glider system with no stamina requirement and a played out climbing stamina gauge system used by every game since BotW created it. The climbing is restricted by impassable rock formations and invisible walls, and your character is made of lead so that water contact instantly drowns them.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of... Said mechanics are typically used to find \"treasure chests\" around the world, but they only reward you with a handful of basic materials that you could've collected on your own. This or to find resources higher up on the map <IF> you're allowed up there.\r\n\r\nThere's a poorly implemented system of energy that's refilled with food, with recipes filling up more energy and shrines expanding your energy max cap, but it only adds a bonus to how many resources you gather and XP you gain from said gathering. I played 95% of the game without caring. It didn't matter at all.\r\n\r\nWhen actively playing, 80% of my playtime was spend running around to hunt down freaking plants and bugs to sell for blueprints and inventory expansions, that ended up serving very little purpose beyond reducing the irritation of visiting my home all the time to shunt my crap into a poorly implemented chest storage system. Then refining mining and wood so I can build MORE crafting to upgrade [the same tools over and over].\r\n\r\nThe biggest difference, and it's a negative one, is that there's not even dungeons. At least there's a point to upgrading your tools in stardew in a cycle of upgrading healing, energy, armor, and sword to then get materials from dungeon delving and mining. But this game doesn't even have that cycle. It offers generic story building and plot with no payout or experience.\r\n\r\nThere's resources that are gatekept behind needing people in the public exploration areas (of which there are only 3) to team up to harvest, but again to what purpose beyond superfluous decoration and tool upgrades?\r\n\r\nMost of my hours are AFK after falling asleep waiting for crafting machines to spit out enough refined material for the next upgrade or to sell for recipes.\r\n\r\n2/10: The graphics are the only redeeming factor. If you want a 3D stardew with more shallowly implemented systems and activities, and a pointless gameplay experience to simply make tens of thousands of gold for decorations to put in your pointless abode? This is the game for those boring people. To really put my findings beyond stardew (a game I hate)... I would rather play WARFRAME, a game I dislike and haven't played in over 14 years because the grind and money sink that it forces on the player is to an obscene degree and caliber, than play this knock off shambling undead of a \"game\".",

However the longer you play, the worse it gets. First massive update, Elderwood, has very little to offer in terms of storyline, and what there is is basically a long line of fetch quests that are incredibly tedious and grindy. RNG is horrendous, you can spend weeks trying to get a rare item that's needed to further the quest, and still not get it. You can't request the item from other players too, since you can only do that after you acquired the specific item yourself for the first time, be it from quest or resource runs.\n\nWith each update optimisation tanks - it went from a smooth gameplay to lagging a bit with Bloom update, to lagging horrendously with Ranching. Bugs are everywhere, and they're not getting fixed in a timely manner - unless it's a fun bug, then you can be sure it will be fixed in no time. Updates seem to be purposefully designed to be super grindy to keep your attention to the game for longer so that you buy overpriced cosmetics, and I'm not kidding, the prices for microtransactions are nothing but micro.\n\nAll of that is explained all the time with 'it's a beta' argument, but make no mistake - it's not, it's early access at best. When you start, the world is lively, fun and fleshed out, the base is there, and you can rack up hundreds of hours of playtime alone in Kilima and Bahari (first two available areas). 'Beta' at this point is just an excuse to allow devs to slight players with each stupid and cash-grabby mistake they can think of.\n\nSince the game was initially made by a small studio and then was bought out by a corporation, I don't hold much hope that it will get better anytime soon - the enpoopification will continue until morale improves.

      "review": "I don't typically make reviews and by no means am I a game creator or an expert. This review is mostly coming from the eyes of someone who fell in love with Palia and quickly grew to dislike it.\n\nI'll start it out pretty simple. I was fresh to Steam and got a little bored of the handful of games I had, so I searched for new games and saw Palia. To me, it just seemed like a 3D Stardew and when I popped in the game I got hooked by the customization and achievements. (Being a completionist is the death of me lmao) If you're someone that likes to 100% games or just spend hours doing activities like catching bugs, hunting things, and maybe even fishing then this game will most likely hook you like it did to me. I actually adored Palia for the first 300 hours of my gameplay. Not only did I have all this stuff to do, but there were also communities where I could connect with people. Very rarely did I run into rude/toxic players in the in-game community. \n\nNow this sounds fairly positive so far, right? Wrong. \n\nEventually, I joined their Discord server to get more regular updates - because that's what every lover of a game does. The big problem? There was absolutely no communication with the community at all. For a game that practically revolves around looting things you catch/hunt you would think they'd fix a bug where loot glitches into the sky/ground and you can't grab it, right? Again, WRONG. They've \"fixed\" it a few times and it consistently keeps coming back, not to mention the amount of times the games terrain makes bugs and huntables just straight up disapear. This might not seem like too much of a problem, but Palia has a rarity system. \n\nI'll use my experience as an example. There are epic bugs (currently the highest rarity of bug I believe) and you need both regular and star quality to get certain achievements. These bugs - namely Rainbow Tipped Butterfly and Fairy Mantis - can be a big pain to get. However, I got lucky. Or so I thought. I was just wandering around when I saw a star quality Fairy Mantis (The last bug I needed and one I spent a few hundred hours searching for). I caught it, and it glitched into the ground and I couldn't pick it up. I didn't find another one for about 200 hours of gameplay. \n\nIf that wasn't bad enough, early on in my playing of Palia (We'll say January of 2025) there weren't a lot of big updates much less a roadmap or any communication on what was going on. The most we got were premium store updates which rubbed a lot of people the wrong way - I wonder why? I will say that the one bonus of Palia is that it doesn't force boosts or lock things behind money which is surprising for a free game but anyways. A few months later, we got Elderwoods. Not only that, but we got a roadmap too! Things were actually looking good. That was until these updates actually came out. Yes, I'm talking about the new housing line and the ranching system. Now this might just be my personal opinion, but they overhyped it quite a bit. This led to a lot of players being disappointed by the limited choices with the new housing line (not to mention the price of it) and how dull the ranching system actually was.\n\nI would also like to stress just how horrible some of these achievements are. I have all but two achievements completed. The two I have left are: Pebble Plunderer (Get all pebbles and give them to Einar), and the Makeshift Collector (Obtain every makeshift item from waterlogged chests) Let's dive into Pebble Plunderer. Most of the pebbles you can find around the lands of Palia, except for the smooth pebble. For some godforsaken reason, that pebble can be obtained by random chance from oysters. I am not exaggerating when I say I've opened 2000 (maybe more) oysters and have not obtained one. There was speculation that it was bugged, but I don't believe it was ever confirmed. I disliked repetitive grinding, the only reason I could get through hunting/bug catching was because I was actively focusing on something. Running up and down the coast of Bahari for hours (Which by the way, when you step into the shallow water that is supposed to be fine, you drown. That bug has been around for months.) is not how I want to spend my gameplay. Now onto Waterlogged Chests. You can obtain these from fishing - again at random chance. Personally, I dislike fishing in games but I actually liked Palia's mechanic which is why I can sort of stand it. But again, we run into the problem of just standing there for hours and clicking away. \n\nNow I'm sure you could sit there and say \"But Pumpki, you don't need to do all of that!\" And you're 100% right, I don't. However, I have completed every quest, every board, and all of the relationships with the villagers (Which haven't been expanded in a hot minute) and like I said before, completionist. Again, I'd like to stress that I'm no game developer or expert - and some of this does come from a place of bias. But if you fall in love with a game and witness first hand just how horrible things are handled, it might rub you the wrong way too. \n\nThis isn't to say that Palia isn't a good game. Personally I think that it's a pretty good game with a lot of potential. Most of these issues can be chalked up to poor development and poor communication. That's also not to say that the whole dev team is bad, but if you spend enough time in the community you'll most likely see that there's huge room for improvement. \n\nI really did fall in love with the characters, the story, and the overall design of the game. And yes, I poured many many hours of my life into it. Do I regret it? Sort of. Palia isn't the worst game out there and for free it is pretty decent, but if you're looking for something to grow attached to long-term and watch the development blossom I strongly decide against it.\n\nTLDR: Palia is a decent game without paywalls and gives you plenty to do (If you're a completionist and like decorating/customization) but I strongly advise against growing attached or staying long-term due to the lack of communication between developers and their community (Worst I've seen so far) and the prioritization of mediocre updates over fixing long-term, sometimes game breaking bugs.",

I get that this is a (strangely long) beta, but just trying to move things around your plot is a frustrating nightmare all on its own.\r\n\r\nWhile the maps are decently sized and pretty from afar, they lack in texture and functionality. The collectible bugs and sernuk are often stuck or disappearing into walls, ground, and rocks. You can talk to NPCs through closed doors. And the waiting around for the selling of items to occur is such a waste of time.\r\n\r\nOverall, the mechanics are in dire need of work before I consider returning to Palia, let alone spending money in its store.",

I wanted to come back to it, but had forgotten most of what had happened, so I wanted to restart. Only to find out I can't have multiple characters or restart the game without submitting a request that has yet to be closed. I would love to keep playing this game, but would like to know what's happening with the story line. It's a flawed game mechanic and system to not be able to restart your character or create a new one. If I picked up where I left off, I'd be lost and would just uninstall the game. If you are someone who does not play any other games and will only be locked in on this one, then it's perfect for you. If you are someone who likes to game hop and play different things sometimes, I'd suggest waiting until they figure out the mechanics of restarting the game.",

Because it could easily be done aside from just random grunts and one liners.\n\nThe gameplay is....bugged out.\nI often clip through the ground and animals clip through background assets during hunting, often ruining the entire hunt.\n\nA lot of it is just plain grind, which makes the game repetetive really fast. Since there's no actual reward.\n\nI also noticed that many assets and ideas seem to be inspired by Genshin Impact (climbing animation and the gliders) which is unoriginal. \n\nIt COULD be a good game, but for now, i wouldn't recommend.

      "review": "Palia starts out looking harmless and soft, but once you spend more time in it, the whole structure shows how little there actually is to do. The early moments feel fine, then the repetition creeps in, and it becomes obvious that the game leans on chores instead of anything that feels rewarding.\n\nProgression is the biggest problem. You gather materials, feed them into tasks, wait through long timers, build a room, and then the final result barely matters. Even the house building loop feels dull. Nothing in it gives any sense of payoff. After a while, the only reasonable question is why you would keep putting energy into something that refuses to give anything back.\n\nThe clothing situation makes the everyday experience worse. Every outfit that looks remotely cute requires real money. The free clothes look like leftovers. Character style should be a fun part of a game like this, but here it feels restricted unless you pay. That takes a lot of enjoyment out of the basic presentation of your character.\n\nNPC relationships never grow into anything interesting. You hand them gifts, watch a bar move, and end up with scenes that feel hollow. It is a friendship system without any real development. It does not matter how much time you put into it. The interpretation stays the same every time. It is just a loop.\n\nThe quests deserve their own separate analysis because they are boring as hell. They stretch out simple tasks into long sequences that feel like homework. I could not even finish them. Every objective felt like the same assignment copied and pasted into a new location. There is no momentum and no sense of progress, and the entire questline falls apart because of it.\n\nMoving around the world highlights even more problems. You travel long distances to reach areas that contain very little. Resource spawns appear inconsistent. Sometimes you end up standing in place waiting for something to appear again. It does not feel calm. It simply feels empty.\n\nWhen you put all these pieces into one conclusion, the problem becomes clear. Palia asks for time without giving any meaningful return. The world looks friendly at first glance, but the gameplay underneath feels flat and unrewarding. After enough hours, you stop trying to push the game forward because the answer becomes too obvious. There is no real point to keep going.",
