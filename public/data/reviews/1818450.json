      "review": "Stalcraft is an amazing game, but like most MMOs, there is a lot of grinding. Sometimes, you could also get mugged by some random person because there is PVP outside of safe zones. It's still fun though if you have time to grind and don't care about a few annoying people trying to kill you here and there. \n\nIt's not really pay to win, but some people get the Stalcraft premium, and so they always get the best rewards from the battle pass and such. I will say, however, that you can get max level loot, even without paying a dime.\n\nThe game is set in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, and there are 2 factions; the Bandits, (who really live up to their name) and the Stalkers. You can join either faction at the beginning of the game, and there are unique rewards for each one. There is a story, and there are quests, but I think the most fun part is just getting better and better gear and then playing PVP battles with others. You have to destroy mutants and enemy NPCs to acquire barter resources, which can then be used along with in-game money to trade for better loot. \n\nOne major part of the game is also the different parts of the Zone. At first, you only travel around the South Zone, which is sort of the lower-tier/newbie part of the map, and then you can eventually go to the North Zone, where sweats and no-life binge players walk around in. If you want to search for more money or better artifacts, which are sort of like trinkets, and give you bonuses, then you may want to travel to Lyubech-3, Stillwaters, or the Labyrinth. These 3 places are often considered the hardest parts, and I wouldn't recommend you go to them until you have really good gear.\n\nThe quests, while I won't spoil them for you, have you ally with one of the Northern factions. They are: Mercenaries and Covenant, (both for former bandits) and Rise and Frontier. (both for former stalkers)\nThese 4 factions get very aggressive with each other. \n\nAnyways, it's free, so you might as well give it a try.",

      "review": "This Game is geally good so far ! \r\n\r\n[h2]Lore[/h2]\r\n\r\nI started this game when Stlacker 2 released. I was hype by the lore, but I don’t play solo/PVE game. Stalcraft take the whole ambiance (mutants, anomalies, exclusion zone etc …) of stalker game. The Art Direction is nice, it didn’t feel like minecraft at all. \r\n\r\n[h2]Progression[/h2]\r\n\r\nProgression est very nice ! This is the most important for me when starting a new game. The game offers a quest based progression as well as a grindy/farming progression style. But it’s not too much. If you compare, for instance, to Albion where you need weeks to unlock something, here the grind for an item won’t be more than 2 days (~6h).\r\n\r\n[h2]PVE[/h2]\r\n\r\nPVE will be challenging when you arrived in a new zone, but not too much. But you have to be ready to die from PVE and anomalies. \r\n\r\n[h2]PVP[/h2]\r\nI love PVP in this game. It’s an open world, you can go everywhere, but it will take way more time to go to the other faction territory. So when farming/questing, if you stay on your side of the map, you will only encounter PVP 1 out of 10 raids. But if you want more action, you can farm in the enemy part of the map !\r\n \r\nWhen you die you don’t lose your gear, you drop some valuable collected on your raid, but the most important resources stay in a bag, which is drop but can’t be opened by your enemy so they will either send it back for free or auction it.\r\n\r\n[h2]End Game[/h2]\r\nA lot of critiques concerns the end game, I’m not there yet with 80 hours, and honestly I have been enjoying the game so far. The early game if very nice, mid-game also ! Definitely worth giving it a try.",

      "review": "I've played the shit outta this game. Easily one of my most played games out there. It all went to shit. \n\nDon't waste your time. I've gotten myself outta this abusive relationship type game. Don't get yourself into it.\n\nSure, leme explain then.\n\nThis game is a trap that catches you with a wide sprawling open world map, realistic gun animations, PVP/PVE interactions and loot/economy/gambling.\n\nIt used to be that you could level the battle pass infinitely by completing events around the map. They completely removed this feature as of the time I played this game. Now you are time gated behind a certain amount of season points per day that is completed by completing certain events around the map or session modes. I DO NOT LIKE THIS. Especially with whales existing who just buy the entire season pass in order to use the OP new addition to the game. Which brings me to my next point.\n\nThe entire game play loop once you get to late-end game is this: you join a clan or run solo, you run throughout the map and complete events, you run emission when it hits and compete for arties and you complete dailies to get the most out of your day. Oh, you can also hit up sessions which is ONLY for late game gamers and is filled to the brim with meta using gamers who follow the OP meta as close as they can to get the most kills, thus the most rewards. This is all well and good as long as there isn't an artificial meta curated by the developers in order to curry the most sales possible. Every new battlepass/ weapon balancing/ weapon addition makes an already existing weapon OP or adds a new weapon into the game that is OP. They do this in order to have people buy stalcoins in order to get the newest meta fastest so that who ever does is OP until they nerf said gun. They do this EVERY NEW EVENT. Said practice brings me to my next point.\n\nOnce you get to late game, the only three worth while things you can do outside of the event are clan war, still water and emissions. When there is no event to play through, you have to repeat these three things if you want to progress in late game properly. This gets boring and repetitive. So once you've played everything there is to play and everything to progress is STILL A MONTH OR MORE away and you have to do the same thing over and over again what else is there? There is the event. The events range from cancerous but rewarding to actually somewhat fun for the first few times but not really all that rewarding if you just do what you've already been doing for months. This creates a loop of doing the same shit over and over again getting the event going, then going back to the previous loop. I hated this at the 4th or so time around. Guess what? Once the event is over, you gotta wait more than a month for the next one to drop. All this waiting while dealing with clan drama, ultra sweat lords who you try and try to kill but they annihilate you all the same due to their skill, gear and experience and not having any new content to play through. Which brings me to my next point.\n\nMost of the end game players are the best of the best. Not even joking. The player pool in NA is filled to the brim with people who have been playing for longer than I or are somewhat new to the north and are in the process of getting chewed up and spat out if without proper guidance. Mix this with the fact that there aren't even that many people playing NA either. So the playing pool is super concentrated at this point, once you are full masters/legendary gear to the point where you will really only see the same person everytime. Adding this to the fact that most people at this point of the game are uber sweat lords with the inkling to hunt you down at the slightest peep outta you because they too are bored. With all this in mind, you being an average PVPer with a farming build on attempting to acquire your daily dues in order to progress so that you can keep up. Guess what? Now, in the latest patch of the game I was a part of, grouping up became a whole lot more main-stream. So much so, that if you are alone, you must be one of the best PVPers in the entire game in order to constantly kill a group of five mans as they continuously come back over again. \"What about the clan of 30 or more guys you were a part of?\" you may ask. Nope. Unreliable at best in terms of willingness to go out as a five stack to combat a five stack in order to just get some progression. Most of the clan members you may have been playing with for months if not more than a year are bored of the game at this point. Or are hyper focused on a certain action/activity in the game and are unwilling to go anywhere else or do anything else. You finally got yourself a five man? Were you finally successful in wiping those pesky players from your farming spot in still water? Watch out for third parties. Then fourth parties. Oh, the team you killed that was originally giving you trouble? They are back and you are probably down to one man at that point. This is all if you're lucky enough to get a team together anyways. Wanna try to avoid the hordes of people and try to play at night? Too bad, the game has no-lifers who are capable of playing from dawn to the early hours of the morning. Have fun with that.\n\nAnother problem I had with this game was the incorrigible balancing it had. You have a 9x39/9x19MM SMG? best in slot for within 6 meters. You got a 5.56x45/5.45x39/7.62x39/7.62x51/12.7/9X39 assault rifle? Close to long range but will still lose 80% of the time to either an SMG or a DMR/sniper rifle. You got a 7.62x51/7.62x54/12.7/9x39 sniper rifle/DMR? Wins at range but is useless at close range without support. Add this to the newest artifact changes which can heal you within a few seconds and wear any container on any suit and you got a bullet sponge game. You gotta shoot someone in the head 2-3 times in the head with even the heaviest sniper rifle (more with a DMR). You gotta do that 6-10 times in the head with assault rifles. With smgs? 6-15 times in the head depending. This turns combat into a slaughter fest of just shooting the same guy in the head multiple times while his friend and yours do the same while one party might run away/ do jumps and crouches to mix it up. I hated this. Oh, you got a fight you can't win and you've got a good build? Just walk away and out heal the bullets IMPACTING YOUR HEAD. I hated how survivable everyone felt. Including myself. \n\nPair all of this with the fact that most of the people in this game are immature kids or adults with a whole lotta time on their hands but little people skills and you got yourself stuck in the middle, searching for a group to be a part of. Good luck finding a community you fit in with. I had that, until it all started falling apart. Nothing lasts forever. I just didn't outlast the game constantly changing itself into something I didn't enjoy. \n\nIf you read all this and think \"yeah, I like the sound of this\" then I wish you the best fun. But in my opinion, Stalcraft hasn't had a properly good update in months.",

      "review": "My biggest problem with this game aside from the servers is how the devs handle the \"Economy\" and the backlash they get from it. Recently they had a DBD (dead by daylight) type gamemode, in which the first 24 hours, people who played the game 24/7 gamed the system and gained a ridiculous amount of high tier rewards. Exbo met this with a patch almost immediately, changing the drop rates to \"Save the economy\" and made a comment stating the \"Rewards have changed, but the rates aren't 0%\". Folks on reddit decided to do a deep dive determined that the drop rates for mid to high tier items weren't 0% but only on a technicality, being 0.1% for purple and red tier items that were highly sought after.\nAfter which the devs began to ignore the criticism and posts entirely, with one community manager going out of their way to instead almost mock the players for trying to gain some clarity. \nWhile it is a fun game, it ends up being way to grindy, way to p2w and catering to whales, and the devs prefer obfuscating things and instead making everything (Including the bossfights) as obtuse and vague as possible in favor of getting you to spend more money, to the point that they have a currency to buy loot boxes, specifically so they don't have to provide drop rates, since you \"Technically aren't buying them with real cash\".\n\nEditing My review since a dev responded to add this little nugget: \n\n1: Currently the best shotgun in the game is the Pancor Jackhammer, A battle pass weapon that while free requires almost several hours of daily play to acquire unless you spend money.\n2: In the reddit post for \"The final word on Encaged\" the devs were called out and stated (Direct quote here) \"Yes, we did reduce the chances for key event-case rewards, but they were never “set to zero”\" After which several community members did the math and determined that yes the rewards were set to Zero\n3: One community manager also made a comment about \"Player health\" being a concern despite every reward potentially available being through a lootbox system that has its drop rates obfuscated\n4: The most recent Expansion, \"Operations\" Have already been nerfed and provided rewards so sub par to the communities expectations, that they are already complaining in other areas of the community. With \"Rewards\" that have stats that cancel each other out and make weapons worse, instead of better. \n5: And finally wrapping back around to Encaged \"Preventing Long-term Economic damage\" By letting a few players corner the market on rare items, to include ones that are only cosmetic does more damage than if everyone had a chance to get them.",

The Instanced Missions throughout the game however... God, save me, they are so terribly designed, and if you want to run the questline to get the PvE Operations, DON'T. Ask for someone to be leader and queue with if them it's even possible. The servers died before I could confirm.\n\nPrior to this review, I just got through the Slop Slog that is the mission named \"Path to Area-0\" (Objective: Get through the tunnel). Easier said than done... It's littered with an unreasonable amount of Anomalies, with the design vibe of a \"Mario Maker Pro Course\" that is made by an Adderall-fueled pre-teen that just placed things randomly without thought then called it \"Challenging\", oh and you only get a few checkpoints. It could take ROUGHLY 15 MINUTES if you're lucky or filled with as much Adderall and Krokodil as the Instance's level designer themselves.\nBUT WAIT, IT'S NOT OVER! You now have to run 4 WHOLE PVE OPERATION OBJECTIVES SOLO, where you will be harassed by endless waves of Zombies, Riflemen, Heavy Melee and Tagilla in more armor than a T-34 melted down and carrying either a Gatling Gun with explosive rounds or a Grenade Launcher that spams a dozen 40-mils at your feet! This part features objectives like: Capture the Point, Escort the Plasma Ball, Capture the Point and Slowly Carry a Battery to the Goal, and finally... Laser.\nAll this for a GAMEMODE.\nAll that could at the very least take 30 minutes of your time (Took me an hour). But now hopefully I can lead my friends into the Operations without them having to deal with the same experience I had to go through. It was as if I were a Psychonaut going through the mind of a terminally online LA citizen.\n\nDecent enough of a game, but sweet, fucking, mama. Get a new Level Designer for the Instances!\nFinally, \"Deadman's Marathon\"/\"Марафон Мертвецов\"/\"dmz_fight_music\" from the 2023 Halloween event mode, \"Deadman's Marathon\", is a BANGER of a track and whoever made that better have been paid handsomely! 21-minutes of some of the sickest instrumental-only Metal I've heard from a game has never hit SO DAMN HARD.\n\nThat's enough for my rant of a review. I give a thumbs-down in vainful hopes that they improve the game. What they have here has so much potential. Yes, I'm still going to play Stalcraft for the foreseeable future. I'm going to bed.",

      "review": "Generally speaking, this game is not bad. However, to me, the developers for the past few months have been ruining the game, by removing or changing aspects of which i found enjoyable. For example: This game heavily rewards players who play during specific times during events, or seasons which offer limited time rewards. And after they end, those rewards are practically impossible for anyone else to get, and some of these rewards are the powerful items in the game currently. And in this season, \"Sub Zero\" the rewards are completely underwhelming to me which makes me regret not playing during older seasons when the rewards were op, and that game design is unacceptable as i am finding it difficult to obtain equipment that can compete. secondly, for the past few months, time limited events and operations have been simply horrid, in regards to gameplay, design, and reward. And the dev team have been making it more difficult for casual/ solo players to make in-game money. which leaves me with little to do in regards to gameplay, and therefore, i will no longer be playing this game until they add equipment i care about or change features of which would improve the game to me.",

I would say try out the early game, enjoy the farm/grind, once you hit the north maybe drop it? I love this game, but it is honestly hard to love something that the devs keep making harder to sign into day by day. \n\nIf this community can write thoughtful and constructive criticisms possibly the devs will listen, especially if we don't just cave in and swipe credit cards.

I'd normally be ok with this except for the fact that high level players of either faction inevetably appear in the lowbie zones to get their onesided fist fight kicks. This is almost constant. Its impractically frustrating to progress. And while there's overlapping quest areas, they are camped by the same players for hours. Did i mention they're overlevels in a lower level progress area?\n\nFinally the issue that kinda kills it for me: the fantasy damage balance of weapon types. Semi auto vs automatic. Rifle vs smg vs pistol. Optimal range zones... why... let natural ballistics do their thing. But weapons are broke into tiers so you do you. (This is also why the overleveled griefers in lowbie areas are one sided fist fight champions).\n\nIf none of that bothers you, the game is actually very enjoyable. Its a fun world to run around in and collect things. Crafting is refreshin. Certain items drop in pvp so its not cripling except for your inability to progress with the story so you can level up properly when the high level players stomp about and ambush camp the lowbie quest areas.",

But Stalcraft is the first game i played where after unlocking new gear you really often feel not on the same power level but actually way weaker. What's even worse is that gear score in menu doesn't mean anything, actual thing is hidden and you need to figure it out by esoteric guesses. \n\nIf you really wanna play this game and actually enjoy it, here's advice: never go above blue tier items no matter what, and don't upgrade more than +9",

The core loop is super simple: go to base, grind for your current weapon, go for the next base. The problem is that the time you need to grind scales with your progress. On paper that sounds fair, but in practice the grind ramps up exponentially.\n\nImagine being me: I’ve spent almost 3 years on this game, stuck in Bar trying to grind for my next submachine gun, only to realize there’s a battle pass weapon that’s infinitely better than the one I’m working toward. And I still don’t have my weapon, because I need a ridiculous amount of materials. I end up grinding almost two days every week just to feel like I’m making progress. But I have to work, I’m still studying, and when I log in just to farm, it honestly feels like a second job, then I decide to quit the game.\n\nThen after X number of quests trying to grind the battlepass, suddenly my progress becomes less valuable, I have to wait for the next week, and my only “alternative” is to keep grinding the old fashioned way because I’m still missing 800 units short of the next piece of gear, while world events give me, what, maybe 20-40? It’s ridiculous.\n\nAs a player, it’s overwhelming. It discourages me from continuing, because the other option is just to pay for it. And if I do that (if I buy the levels I’m missing) then what’s the point of playing? It feels like I cheated myself out of the rewards and the journey.\n\nI’m honestly sad the game went in this direction.

Issue is everyone is gonna be much better equipped than you are, meaning they will nuke your shit because they live on this game. Open world is either empty as hell or you got neckbeards camping farming spots and map transitions. You need hundreds and sometimes THOUSAND OR MORE of materials, when quests give like 20 if you're LUCKY. Most of the time you get 4 or 5. \r\n\r\nOnto the PvP modes... Session Battles fucking SUCKS. There is consistently one map that has anyone playing it. It's a very small map, and it wouldn't be an issue if it gave you preset equipment like the other maps. You have to basically have Master/Legendary gear to have a chance, and if you know how artifact hunting works in the game, you won't see a solid artifact build for ages. If you somehow WIN a session battle, you get almost NOTHING even on DOUBLE XP events. Oh you want that cool AKS Stoat in 9x39? You have to sell your soul to EXBO to get it. The preset gear maps are much better, as it is far more balanced. \r\n\r\nThe ONLY thing this game has going for it, is the early game and the southern story line.

The most fun I had with this game is the early game farming copper wire/alpha trackers in Black Willows. It's calm and peaceful.",

This season you can outright purchase all 500 levels of the season pass and instantly unlock one of the most overpowered weapons in the game — the Pancor shotgun (every season is this way there is always some op weapon that people spend real money for).\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, you can buy the season pass/season pass levels and skins with real money, sell it for in-game currency, and then use that currency to upgrade your weapons, artifacts, and armor. In short, if you’re willing to swipe your credit card, you can instantly become one of the strongest players in the game.\r\n\r\nFor everyone else, 95% of fights are decided before they even start — determined by whether your opponent has spent massive amounts of money or simply no-lifed the game for thousands of hours. Even the most skilled FPS players are powerless against someone who’s paid their way to the top.\r\n\r\nThe endgame is a miserable grind with no real sense of fun or accomplishment. Everything revolves around money, time, or both — not skill. Stalcraft X is a cynical, FOMO-driven system designed to squeeze players through gambling-style progression.\r\n\r\nSave yourself the frustration and stay far away from this game.

      "review": "I love this game. Or, rather, the idea of this game. Or, more specifically, what this game is, and has been as a new player, until getting to the end game where you really start to see between the lines. When all of the quests are done (mostly) and you're doing dailies and participating in seasonal stuff and battle passes, you really start seeing between the lines at the greed of the devs and how they continually screw with the game in ways that always make things more tedious for players and try to make them more money from boosters and pay-to-skip or pay-to-optimize.\n\nThe concept of a Stalker multiplayer game that's essentially an MMO with varied, respawning activities is really cool and was well-implemented. The new player experience was magic for me, and this game accomplishes something really special. It has great gun-play, and fantastic exploration and novelty of area, anomalies, gear, and a great progression system and a huge variety of quests that are mostly fun. It scratches the itch to a degree of a Tarkov-like extraction experience with the constant threat of PVP around the corner (but with mutants and anomalies too), but with way less actual punishment when you get ganked, and a really interesting solution of keeping some things, losing some things, and ultimately not suffering as much as it feels like you do when you lose a huge haul. Also there's a great player economy, and a lot of times, players just give you the important stuff back. At least, in the end game, they do.\n\nBut the devs.\n\nThe greed. The constant tweaking to make this a hamster wheel for the players and to chain us to the game every day if we want to get to the end of the battle pass or earn the special things. And every time they come up with ways to renovate systems, they present it as improvements, but secretly (or not so secretly), the new systems are designed to make players grind more for the same benefits. Unless you spend some cash to make it slightly less painful.\n\nAnd it gets worse season after season. I've been playing this game for over a year, I have four characters in the end game (one in each faction), and I've grinded a lot with each of them, some more than others, season by season. And if I really think back over that year+, any improvements I come up with have also come with new chains, more tedium, and more grind. I'm sure the devs sit around and brainstorm ways to present new concepts to the players while also thinking that they'll make more income from this new pay-to-optimize thing, and that thing, and so on. Which is fine. Whatever. Capitalism. But it's just yet another wonderful game being ruined by greed.\n\nThis would be a fantastic game if the devs would get out of the way and stop pushing, pushing, pushing for us to have less fun and grind more. It's disgusting.\n\nStalcraft is great for PVE players who love Stalker, who are also patient enough to accept that PVP exists and you can eventually learn to rat around it. And it's also great for PVPers who love duking it out in arenas, or even hunting poor SOB's that are farming for builds and stealing their stuff. But I wouldn't recommend it unless you accept that it's probably going to continue to go downhill in player exploitation, or unless you accept that after finishing the excellent climb to end-game, you'll be broken-hearted eventually by the shady devs.\n\nP.S. - Most of the bad reviews on this game don't like gankers and cheaters. In all my time, I've seen what I think was a legitimate 'cheater' using support programs etc a few times at most, and only ONE TIME I was certain of it. I also don't suffer from powerful player predating on lesser players. Then again, I didn't totally max out my characters and get onto the master servers. Just keep your gear to a max of +10, and you'll never have those problems. And also get good at situational awareness and avoiding traps. Those common complaints, in my experience, aren't really a thing. This is an amazing game that honestly just suffers from greedy devs.",

      "review": "I've played the shit outta this game. Easily one of my most played games out there. It all went to shit. \n\nDon't waste your time. I've gotten myself outta this abusive relationship type game. Don't get yourself into it.\n\nSure, leme explain then.\n\nThis game is a trap that catches you with a wide sprawling open world map, realistic gun animations, PVP/PVE interactions and loot/economy/gambling.\n\nIt used to be that you could level the battle pass infinitely by completing events around the map. They completely removed this feature as of the time I played this game. Now you are time gated behind a certain amount of season points per day that is completed by completing certain events around the map or session modes. I DO NOT LIKE THIS. Especially with whales existing who just buy the entire season pass in order to use the OP new addition to the game. Which brings me to my next point.\n\nThe entire game play loop once you get to late-end game is this: you join a clan or run solo, you run throughout the map and complete events, you run emission when it hits and compete for arties and you complete dailies to get the most out of your day. Oh, you can also hit up sessions which is ONLY for late game gamers and is filled to the brim with meta using gamers who follow the OP meta as close as they can to get the most kills, thus the most rewards. This is all well and good as long as there isn't an artificial meta curated by the developers in order to curry the most sales possible. Every new battlepass/ weapon balancing/ weapon addition makes an already existing weapon OP or adds a new weapon into the game that is OP. They do this in order to have people buy stalcoins in order to get the newest meta fastest so that who ever does is OP until they nerf said gun. They do this EVERY NEW EVENT. Said practice brings me to my next point.\n\nOnce you get to late game, the only three worth while things you can do outside of the event are clan war, still water and emissions. When there is no event to play through, you have to repeat these three things if you want to progress in late game properly. This gets boring and repetitive. So once you've played everything there is to play and everything to progress is STILL A MONTH OR MORE away and you have to do the same thing over and over again what else is there? There is the event. The events range from cancerous but rewarding to actually somewhat fun for the first few times but not really all that rewarding if you just do what you've already been doing for months. This creates a loop of doing the same shit over and over again getting the event going, then going back to the previous loop. I hated this at the 4th or so time around. Guess what? Once the event is over, you gotta wait more than a month for the next one to drop. All this waiting while dealing with clan drama, ultra sweat lords who you try and try to kill but they annihilate you all the same due to their skill, gear and experience and not having any new content to play through. Which brings me to my next point.\n\nMost of the end game players are the best of the best. Not even joking. The player pool in NA is filled to the brim with people who have been playing for longer than I or are somewhat new to the north and are in the process of getting chewed up and spat out if without proper guidance. Mix this with the fact that there aren't even that many people playing NA either. So the playing pool is super concentrated at this point, once you are full masters/legendary gear to the point where you will really only see the same person everytime. Adding this to the fact that most people at this point of the game are uber sweat lords with the inkling to hunt you down at the slightest peep outta you because they too are bored. With all this in mind, you being an average PVPer with a farming build on attempting to acquire your daily dues in order to progress so that you can keep up. Guess what? Now, in the latest patch of the game I was a part of, grouping up became a whole lot more main-stream. So much so, that if you are alone, you must be one of the best PVPers in the entire game in order to constantly kill a group of five mans as they continuously come back over again. \"What about the clan of 30 or more guys you were a part of?\" you may ask. Nope. Unreliable at best in terms of willingness to go out as a five stack to combat a five stack in order to just get some progression. Most of the clan members you may have been playing with for months if not more than a year are bored of the game at this point. Or are hyper focused on a certain action/activity in the game and are unwilling to go anywhere else or do anything else. You finally got yourself a five man? Were you finally successful in wiping those pesky players from your farming spot in still water? Watch out for third parties. Then fourth parties. Oh, the team you killed that was originally giving you trouble? They are back and you are probably down to one man at that point. This is all if you're lucky enough to get a team together anyways. Wanna try to avoid the hordes of people and try to play at night? Too bad, the game has no-lifers who are capable of playing from dawn to the early hours of the morning. Have fun with that.\n\nAnother problem I had with this game was the incorrigible balancing it had. You have a 9x39/9x19MM SMG? best in slot for within 6 meters. You got a 5.56x45/5.45x39/7.62x39/7.62x51/12.7/9X39 assault rifle? Close to long range but will still lose 80% of the time to either an SMG or a DMR/sniper rifle. You got a 7.62x51/7.62x54/12.7/9x39 sniper rifle/DMR? Wins at range but is useless at close range without support. Add this to the newest artifact changes which can heal you within a few seconds and wear any container on any suit and you got a bullet sponge game. You gotta shoot someone in the head 2-3 times in the head with even the heaviest sniper rifle (more with a DMR). You gotta do that 6-10 times in the head with assault rifles. With smgs? 6-15 times in the head depending. This turns combat into a slaughter fest of just shooting the same guy in the head multiple times while his friend and yours do the same while one party might run away/ do jumps and crouches to mix it up. I hated this. Oh, you got a fight you can't win and you've got a good build? Just walk away and out heal the bullets IMPACTING YOUR HEAD. I hated how survivable everyone felt. Including myself. \n\nPair all of this with the fact that most of the people in this game are immature kids or adults with a whole lotta time on their hands but little people skills and you got yourself stuck in the middle, searching for a group to be a part of. Good luck finding a community you fit in with. I had that, until it all started falling apart. Nothing lasts forever. I just didn't outlast the game constantly changing itself into something I didn't enjoy. \n\nIf you read all this and think \"yeah, I like the sound of this\" then I wish you the best fun. But in my opinion, Stalcraft hasn't had a properly good update in months.",

The way it's managed though.. That's another thing. The game from early to mid game is pretty much fine, a bit grindy but nothing too harsh, it's fair, but from end game you're forced to pvp and the grind spikes up to the max, i'm speaking MONTHS of gameplay to get good gear not to die from a bush camper in the northen zone. And of course, being a greedy freemium game you can pay to speed up your progress in events and battlepasses, getting better gear early and making the grind easier since you won't die that easily to gankers. It saddens me to see this game get worse every season because on paper it's such a good game.. An easy fix would be making (as many other games do) cosmetics pay to obtain and the grind the same for everyone, so they can still monetize and the players are not forced to grind months for a single thing. If you're still reading this and you like the game too, consider leaving a bad review on it, not to kill, but so the devs will be bothered enough to make some changes. Do your part! Save the game!",

Why hasn't this been done yet?\n- Artifact builds are enjoyable to play around with\n- The game very responsive for the most part. In my ~3 weeks of playing I haven't experienced any latency issues.\n- The Russian designers trying to translate into English voice lines is very funny. A couple of them made me actually laugh from poor translation. I guess you could consider it a con but I personally found it funny.\n- It was fun to play with friends...at first. \n- \"What's kickin, chicken?\"\n- The one actual good boss fight in this game (The last Northern story mission....so you'd have to play through the entire game to even experience it) Master of the Zone is actually quite enjoyable. This is surprising considering....\n\nCons: \n- The boss fights. Personally for me, this is the straw that broke the camel's back. I want to know who came up with the designs for these bosses so I can make sure I never play anything made by them again. As a free player I can tell its extremely obvious they expect you to spend money on OP gear to play this game. Using the gear that I have obtained along the way to fight these bosses is quite literally impossible without exploits. Just look up the Twins fight and Morph fight and try to find a video where the person who uploaded isn't running min/maxed OP gear they paid for.\n- Enemy AI is the most basic trash imaginable and this only compounds the boss issue mentioned. Basically, if it can see you it will shoot you. Same with the mutants. They will spot your left pinky toe from across the entire map instantly and bum rush you.\n- The endgame is nothing but cheaters. Probably because the game has no anti-cheat and RMT is a huge thing in this game. There is money for these cheaters to make and there is no concentrated effort by the devs to end it.\n- Gear scaling is atrocious. You will constantly be put into map layers with people way over-geared compared to you. Which isn't a huge deal because the TTK in this game is incredibly fast to begin with... But constantly being at a massive disadvantage for no reason other than poor design choices isn't very fun.\n- Even though it's a multiplayer game, its actively incentivizes playing alone. This game is already a tedious as hell grind for slight upgrades. Most games of this nature will give each player in a squad their own instanced loot at the end of an event. This game, however, TECHNICALLY does the same thing... But the loot each player gained is based on their contribution to the event. So one guy who killed 3 of the mutts at a mutant den event will get say 6 of the stuff for that region's item you need to collect. Your friend who killed 2 will only get 4. You can see how unfun this would be progression especially if you have 4 people in a group. Instead of the events sharing evenly with each participant it only gives to the person who did everything. And scraps to the people who did less. For tradeable loot, this is understandable. But it shouldn't be the case for progression based items.",

      "review": "My biggest problem with this game aside from the servers is how the devs handle the \"Economy\" and the backlash they get from it. Recently they had a DBD (dead by daylight) type gamemode, in which the first 24 hours, people who played the game 24/7 gamed the system and gained a ridiculous amount of high tier rewards. Exbo met this with a patch almost immediately, changing the drop rates to \"Save the economy\" and made a comment stating the \"Rewards have changed, but the rates aren't 0%\". Folks on reddit decided to do a deep dive determined that the drop rates for mid to high tier items weren't 0% but only on a technicality, being 0.1% for purple and red tier items that were highly sought after.\nAfter which the devs began to ignore the criticism and posts entirely, with one community manager going out of their way to instead almost mock the players for trying to gain some clarity. \nWhile it is a fun game, it ends up being way to grindy, way to p2w and catering to whales, and the devs prefer obfuscating things and instead making everything (Including the bossfights) as obtuse and vague as possible in favor of getting you to spend more money, to the point that they have a currency to buy loot boxes, specifically so they don't have to provide drop rates, since you \"Technically aren't buying them with real cash\".\n\nEditing My review since a dev responded to add this little nugget: \n\n1: Currently the best shotgun in the game is the Pancor Jackhammer, A battle pass weapon that while free requires almost several hours of daily play to acquire unless you spend money.\n2: In the reddit post for \"The final word on Encaged\" the devs were called out and stated (Direct quote here) \"Yes, we did reduce the chances for key event-case rewards, but they were never “set to zero”\" After which several community members did the math and determined that yes the rewards were set to Zero\n3: One community manager also made a comment about \"Player health\" being a concern despite every reward potentially available being through a lootbox system that has its drop rates obfuscated\n4: The most recent Expansion, \"Operations\" Have already been nerfed and provided rewards so sub par to the communities expectations, that they are already complaining in other areas of the community. With \"Rewards\" that have stats that cancel each other out and make weapons worse, instead of better. \n5: And finally wrapping back around to Encaged \"Preventing Long-term Economic damage\" By letting a few players corner the market on rare items, to include ones that are only cosmetic does more damage than if everyone had a chance to get them.",

The Instanced Missions throughout the game however... God, save me, they are so terribly designed, and if you want to run the questline to get the PvE Operations, DON'T. Ask for someone to be leader and queue with if them it's even possible. The servers died before I could confirm.\n\nPrior to this review, I just got through the Slop Slog that is the mission named \"Path to Area-0\" (Objective: Get through the tunnel). Easier said than done... It's littered with an unreasonable amount of Anomalies, with the design vibe of a \"Mario Maker Pro Course\" that is made by an Adderall-fueled pre-teen that just placed things randomly without thought then called it \"Challenging\", oh and you only get a few checkpoints. It could take ROUGHLY 15 MINUTES if you're lucky or filled with as much Adderall and Krokodil as the Instance's level designer themselves.\nBUT WAIT, IT'S NOT OVER! You now have to run 4 WHOLE PVE OPERATION OBJECTIVES SOLO, where you will be harassed by endless waves of Zombies, Riflemen, Heavy Melee and Tagilla in more armor than a T-34 melted down and carrying either a Gatling Gun with explosive rounds or a Grenade Launcher that spams a dozen 40-mils at your feet! This part features objectives like: Capture the Point, Escort the Plasma Ball, Capture the Point and Slowly Carry a Battery to the Goal, and finally... Laser.\nAll this for a GAMEMODE.\nAll that could at the very least take 30 minutes of your time (Took me an hour). But now hopefully I can lead my friends into the Operations without them having to deal with the same experience I had to go through. It was as if I were a Psychonaut going through the mind of a terminally online LA citizen.\n\nDecent enough of a game, but sweet, fucking, mama. Get a new Level Designer for the Instances!\nFinally, \"Deadman's Marathon\"/\"Марафон Мертвецов\"/\"dmz_fight_music\" from the 2023 Halloween event mode, \"Deadman's Marathon\", is a BANGER of a track and whoever made that better have been paid handsomely! 21-minutes of some of the sickest instrumental-only Metal I've heard from a game has never hit SO DAMN HARD.\n\nThat's enough for my rant of a review.

However, to me, the developers for the past few months have been ruining the game, by removing or changing aspects of which i found enjoyable. For example: This game heavily rewards players who play during specific times during events, or seasons which offer limited time rewards. And after they end, those rewards are practically impossible for anyone else to get, and some of these rewards are the powerful items in the game currently. And in this season, \"Sub Zero\" the rewards are completely underwhelming to me which makes me regret not playing during older seasons when the rewards were op, and that game design is unacceptable as i am finding it difficult to obtain equipment that can compete. secondly, for the past few months, time limited events and operations have been simply horrid, in regards to gameplay, design, and reward. And the dev team have been making it more difficult for casual/ solo players to make in-game money. which leaves me with little to do in regards to gameplay, and therefore, i will no longer be playing this game until they add equipment i care about or change features of which would improve the game to me.",

At core the game is pretty much a perfect design of an online Stalker game with a player economy but ruined by it's own creator greed. Everything is fun at the beginning but when you approach then end, that is when the fun end. Endless grindfest with a soft lock resource that can only be earned weekly in a tiny sum planned by the developer themselves in order to frustrate the player into paying subscription, if not then it gonna took your weeks or even months to get your hands on to the thing that your wanted. \n\nWhen the developer themselves weren't there to abuse, there are the whales, fully kitted in endgame gear and boasting the best artifact the zone can offer. These \"gentlemans\" most of the times is the bigger scumbag you will ever seen online,  griefing, messing up with your grind by stealing your hard earned items,... If you tried to fight back then good luck, you can't even make a dent of them even when you got the element of surprise on your side since they can just easily tank your shoots and returned fire almost instant.\n\nFor the neglected and the gambling there are events in each season, featuring new game mode and rewards. Which pretty much a rip off from other franchise like Helldivers, Dead by Daylight, PUBG,... but with a twist of their own. Is the event itself good ? Pretty much not since there is always bugs, cheaters, botters,... But loot boxes purchase from the points earned by playing in the event contains really good items so the players base begin to figuring out how \"farm\" the event which the developers doesn't like since according to them \" it ruins the game economy\" and immediately went on to make the event even worse by reducing the points you earned from each match and lower the item drop percentage to almost impossible to get good stuff from the loot boxes while ignoring the plea, suggestions from the player base itself or even trying to find the root cause of the problem\n\nSo yeah, if you don't value your time, love seeing your effort went to waste or have a humiliation kink then this is the game for you",

And when you get to the endgame area its alot more visible, 1 guy is killing the whole server without dying once and keeps getting downtiered somehow. Another problem people can just buy best guns off auction just by selling battlepasses which defeats people with guns that were farmed for. We cant focus only on the negatives tho Storylines good enought i say tho some parts could be a little more polished and all but what do you expect from EXBO.\nFarmings quite long (War Thunder like) and you have to figure it out on your own but when you understand it its quite easy.\nHope this review helps yall out.",

Rifle vs smg vs pistol. Optimal range zones... why... let natural ballistics do their thing. But weapons are broke into tiers so you do you. (This is also why the overleveled griefers in lowbie areas are one sided fist fight champions).\n\nIf none of that bothers you, the game is actually very enjoyable.
