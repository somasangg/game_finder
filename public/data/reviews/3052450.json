Dark, weird, and incredibly metal.\n\nAll the gacha systems are in place, but they’re so generous that the only reason you’d want to spend money is to support the developers. This generosity almost resulted in a shutdown, but thankfully it was avoided.\n\nMy only \"complaint\" is the game’s budget. I appreciate that it’s free and doesn’t demand anything more, but I wish the developers had more resources. At the moment there’s little to no voice-over, the English translation needs some work, most characters only have a few static sprites, and the UI feels like an afterthought.\n\nCan’t wait to see how it evolves over time!",

      "review": "Morimens is amazing and really is underrated. Possibly the most underrated game I have ever come across. \n\nIt starts off as a simple Slay the Spire clone, but quickly evolves into something much more complicated and engaging. \n\nI never feel cheated or frustrated by Morimens brutal difficulty because it is smart about game difficulty and follows the philosophy of RAMPING difficulty.\n\nEvery encounter starts with 5 cards in your opening hand, but one of those cards lets you clone another card, or draw another 2 cards next turn, or discard your hand and draw 2 more. Starting hands of cards being simple and small but increasing the amount of cards you have access to while buffing their power means every fight has a smooth escalation that never feels unsatisfying.\n\nThere are so many options and synergy in the moment to moment gameplay that eventually you form these awe inspiring 20 card a turn combo sequences into clutch wins from seemingly doomed situations. \n\nEnemies and boss encounters also follow this ramping difficulty, enemies will not start strong, but will continuously buff themselves, making them more dangerous the longer fights go on for, but this also applies to YOU. So there is always a chance to play all your cards right (or wrong) in any situation and win.\n\nEach team of awakeners you control needs a plan of HOW you ramp up to defeat difficult encounters before enemies can do it to you. Maybe you will stack strength, or poison, or counterattacks. Maybe you steal their buffs. Maybe your game play is to build a team that pools all your resources into one awakener that just has one huge attack that kills enemies instantly. The options are VAST and exciting.\n\nI have a hard time conveying just how sophisticated Morimens gets after the first few chapters and once you unlock the more complex character kits. Hiding under the unfortunate trappings of being a \"gatcha game\" and being disregarded as slop by many who don't give it a chance is the BEST card battler game you will ever play.\n\nThe devs clearly lacked the proper time, money, and talent to fully realise their vision, but the core gameplay is overflowing with passion. Truly a hidden gem.",

      "review": "[h1]Morimens: Een Pixelated Droom (of Nachtmerrie?)[/h1]\n\n★★★★☆\n\n(Speeltijd: ongeveer 15 uur, alles uitgespeeld. Ja, ik heb de geheimen gevonden.)\n\nSoms zoek je gewoon een game die... anders is. Iets met een ziel, in plaats van weer een open-wereld checklist. Morimens is zo'n game. Ik zag de screenshots op Steam, dacht \"hey, leuke pixel art,\" en kocht het op een goede aflevering. En man, wat ben ik blij dat ik dat gedaan heb.\n\nDit is geen game voor iedereen. Wees daarvan gewaarschuwd. Als je haast hebt, of zoekt naar constant actie, dan is dit niks voor jou. Maar als je je kunt verliezen in een sfeer, in een verhaal... dan is dit een klein meesterwerkje.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h3][b]Sfeer & Gameplay: Langzaam, maar op een goeie manier[/b][/h3]\nDe kern van Morimens is verkenning en verhaal. Je kruipt in de huid van een eenzame figuur in een wereld die op z'n einde lijkt. De gameplay is simpel: lopen, praten met de weinige andere personages die je tegenkomt, en vechten als het moet.\n\nHet eerste wat je opvalt is de artstijl. En die is [b]prachtig[/b]. Het is niet zomaar pixel art, het is schilderachtig. Elke locatie voelt handgemaakt en vol details. Je loopt rond in vervallen steden, mistige bossen, en vergeten ruïnes, en alles ademt een soete melancholie. De muziek is subliem en weet de perfecte sfeer neer te zetten, van rustige momenten tot plotselinge spanning. Het is echt een van de sterkste punten van de hele game.\n\nDe gameplay is traag. Heel traag. Je rent niet, je loopt. En dat is expres. Het dwingt je om om je heen te kijken, naar de details te letten. Ik heb echt momenten gehad dat ik gewoon stilstond en naar de achtergrond keek, omdat het zo mooi was.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h3][b]Combat: Denk, niet klikken[/b][/h3]\nHet vechtsysteem is turn-based. Het is geen complexe strategie-game zoals XCOM, maar het is ook niet simpel \"klik op vijand tot die dood is\". Je moet nadenken. Elke aanval kost een bepaald aantal actiepunten, net als het gebruiken van een item of een vaardigheid. Soms is het slimmer om je te verdedigen, of een speciale aanval te bewaren voor een sterkere vijand.\n\nHet is meer een puzzel dan een gevecht. Je moet de zwakte van de vijand vinden en je acties slim plannen. Ik vond het erg bevredigend, vooral omdat de gevechten niet overmatig vaak voorkomen. Het voelt altijd betekenisvol.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h3][b]Story & Wereld: Leeg, maar vol verhalen[/b][/h3]\nHet verhaal wordt niet aan je verteld in lange cutscenes. Het zit in de omgeving, in de korte, soms cryptische gesprekken die je hebt. De wereld voelt leeg en verlaten, en je voelt je echt een outsider. Het is een game die je dingen laat ontdekken in plaats van het je op een presenteerblaadje te geven.\n\nDat kan ook frustrerend zijn. Ik heb echt momenten gehad dat ik dacht: \"oké, en nu dan?\" en 10 minuten rondliep te kijken wat ik nu weer moest doen. Er is geen questlog die je vertelt waar je heen moet. Je moet het zelf uitzoeken. Voor mij was dat een pluspunt, het voelde avontuurlijk. Maar ik kan me voorstellen dat sommige mensen dit te vaag vinden.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h3][b]Wat vond ik minder?[/b][/h3]\nNatuurlijk is het niet perfect.\n[list]\n[*] De [b]traagheid[/b] kan soms tegenwerken. Als je een keer terug moet lopen omdat je iets gemist hebt, voelt dat als een eeuwigheid.\n[*] De [b]puzzels[/b] zijn soms een beetje onduidelijk. Ik heb een keer online moeten zoeken omdat ik gewoon niet zag wat ik moest doen.\n[*] Het is [b]kort[/b]. Voor de prijs is het meer dan genoeg content, maar als je er echt van geniet, wil je meer.\n[/list]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h3][b]Technisch en Prijs/Kwaliteit[/b][/h3]\nHet is een indie game, en het draait op een aardappel. Geen performance issues, geen crashes. Gewoon soepel. De prijs is laag, en voor wat je krijgt is het een absolute koopje. Je krijgt een unieke ervaring die je in geen enkele AAA game zult vinden.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h2][b]Conclusie: Een aanrader voor de rustige speler[/b][/h2]\nMorimens is een game die bij je blijft. Niet vanwege de epische gevechten of de urenlange grind, maar vanwege de sfeer en het verhaal. Het is een game die je even laat ontsnappen aan de realiteit en onderdompelt in een andere, sombere maar prachtige wereld.\n\n[b]Voor wie is dit?[/b]\nVoor mensen die van indie games houden. Van een goed verhaal. Van sfeer. Spelers die geduld hebben en houden van games als [i]Undertale[/i] (qua sfeer, niet per se gameplay) of [i]Inside[/i].\n\n[b]Voor wie is dit NIET?[/b]\nVoor spelers die op zoek zijn naar actie, een groot open wereld met 1000 uren content, of games die je bij de hand nemen.\n\nDus ja. Pak een kop thee, zet je headset op, en duik erin. Maar verwacht geen explosies. Verwacht een gevoel. En dat is soms veel meer waard.\n\n[b]Eindscore: 8.5/10[/b]",

      "review": "This game is a masterpiece (9.5/10).\r\n\r\nHowever, I would like to point out some issues I had with this game as a new player:\r\n\r\nThis game has too many unintuitive terms such as Exalt, Aliemus, Posse, etc. I was kinda confused by some of the terms. However, as long as you read the tutorial and memorize everything, it shouldn’t be a big issue.\r\n\r\nThe navigation feels a bit too slow, too many clicks to move around. The thing is, the earlier stage fights were quite easy, but it took so much time to navigate through the stage. They should’ve added a 2x SPD or one-click navigation option.\r\n\r\nI can see these two issues harming the potential to gain new players’ interest.\r\n\r\nWith all that said, the game’s combat system is amazing (10/10). Morimens is a deep-learning game. The fun part as a new player is trying to understand all of the mechanics and checking out all of the characters’ kits. The combat system has many layers, and it can be overwhelming for new players, but in the earlier stages it doesn’t really matter. Maybe my tip for new players is to try to learn the game with the basic characters first. Don’t go straight into the gacha and use characters with advanced mechanics. They add more layers to the combat system’s complexity, which could make you even more overwhelmed.\r\n\r\nThe gacha system is quite generous (9/10). I started this game during the anniversary, so I got more pulls than usual. However, some characters in this game require a few dupes to perform optimally, but as a new player, if you only focus on one team, it won’t be a big issue and actually quite fun because you get so many pulls that you can experience the thrill of vertical investment.\r\n\r\nThe character designs are amazing and unique (10/10), and this is actually the reason I tried the game in the first place.\r\n\r\nI didn’t really read much of the story because I was pushing through the stages, but the story is solid and has a unique atmosphere.\r\n\r\nOverall, Morimens is a masterpiece. It’s in my top 3 favorite gacha games, and I could see it becoming my top 1 in the future.",

      "review": "This game slowly (and sneakily) became one of my regular gachas after giving it a try on a whim, and now with the 2nd Anniversary QoL they've added to reduce grinding, the game is at an absolutely amazing place. If you tried it before but stopped due to time commitments, now is the perfect time to get back into it. Dailies/Weeklies take only a fraction of what it used to.\n\nThe main draw of Morimens is strategic teambuilding and combat decision making. The gameplay is easy to pick up, but can get incredibly difficult. The game's rotating endgame is not as forgiving as regular gacha games, and unfortunately character strength can vary very wildly, so not picking up meta units or dupes makes your life a lot more difficult. However, you don't strictly have to complete the endgame (beyond A3/350 points) - anything further is just a bonus.\n\nThe game receives constant balance updates for older characters or characters who miss the mark, as well as huge gameplay rule shifts from time to time. These can sometimes introduce huge meta shifts and render a playstyle and associated characters essentially unplayable, or can essentially amount to small changes that do essentially nothing. However, on the flipside, some characters are given new life when buffed. It makes for a pretty dynamic experience compared to most other gacha games. \n\nThe gacha is generous compared to most other games. However, it is also very dupe heavy (which you can acquire monthly over time), with character functionalities locked behind dupe counts. It's equipment system (WoD) is particularly catered towards whales; you can only equip 1 SSR wheel unless one is at maximum (+12). However, it is ultimately a single-player game, so it's not a big deal.\n\nThe only PvP in the game is completely fair outside of requiring base copies and has its own set of rules. Dupes do nothing. It's pretty fun and rounds are relatively quick - as well as optional.\n\nArtwork and visual style is gorgeous. Sound design is serviceable, with some good pieces here and there. Reminiscent of Reverse 1999 at times.\n\nI can't comment on the story, but I've heard good things. Being a player who started during the AI-translation era, I skipped the majority of it; but what I've seen from some of the plot beats and storytelling from time to time is that the game is heartfelt. Going through the story properly is somewhat on my backlog.\n\nIt's a good game.",

      "review": "First, I've truly enjoyed the story so far, but I don't think my take on the quality/readability would be fair for most considering I grew up reading fan-translated xianxia cultivation novels (but i will say, the underlying plot beats have been excellent and it hasn't veered into a harem-y dating sim mid way through nor had a waifu > everything style dip in quality)... And though the main story is mostly human translated (in English) a number of side stories, character interludes, and past events have yet to be looked over as heavily, so it's all very much still an on going process. \n\nSkipping over that, I'd say the game is very enjoyable, and has honestly been the most engaging experience (let alone gacha) I've played all 2025. Like, before the anniversary update their was no auto-mode at all, and players were heavily incentivized to play a decent amount everyday for endgame mats and currency. Though in my experience, the game was (and still is, but yknow it also was) so dang fun I had a harder time trying to put it down than actually playing it. \n\nTheir exists a depth to the mechanics and a flexibility in team building that allows for some truly wacky comps and an startling amount of variety and techs to be discovered/cheesed with. Just about any character can be viable and easily mained/invested in, and the devs regularly buff older characters to maintain that. I will say that compared to other games, it is a bit dupe heavy (i.e., characters require a lot more investment/need to be pulled for multiple times) and the equipment (wheel of destiny) is gated heavily with dupes as well (the ability to equip two gacha/gold wheels). However, at the same time, the endgame is approachable and the summon currency is easily attainable. \nSome of the standard characters are very endgame viable, and even irreplaceable (like caecus), and both the devs and the actual in-game rewards have been very generous and are frequent enough that it doesn't feel like much of a negative influence on the playing experience. To the extent that one can usually guarantee any single char/banner in a around a month or a month and a half (and really it's two banners, because they're generous with both the standard pulls and special pulls for limited banners).\n\nFurthermore, the pvp mode is both completely optional and F2P friendly, with the only hard requirement being owning one copy of any character/wheel in order to being able to play them. PVP can even replace some of the daily/weeklies, allowing for a change in routine, if you somehow get bored of the standard gameplay (couldn't be me, as I actually probably have 3X the playtime it shows on steam because I also play on mobile, but y'all do you). \nOtherwise, dupes don't matter at all, and this mode exists as a completely separate experience with its own unique gameplay (although there are obtainable rewards/currency for playing). All the chars have completely different kits (mostly the same general unique mechs, just heavily modified) and some even have different roles than usual. When/if you dive into pvp, it adds a whole new layer of fun and more content to be experienced.\n\nLastly, the design/style and the vision the developers have of the game has been consistently peak. There has yet to be a character whose design I haven't atleast liked a little (though I mostly main the dudes). The body and cosmic horror vibe has been incredibly consistent and present in every character without feeling either repetitive or uninspired. Each char also has their own unique mechanic/motif that makes them enjoyable (or interesting) to play/makes me want to play them (even when they're T4, or in the words of our lord and savior flares... ultratrash). \n\nThe devs have also been very transparent/communicative in their discord about the direction and handling of the game, and though it's not something they can super guarantee they've also stated that if for whatever reason it EOS's, their intent would be to try to convert it into a standalone game (and not just another piece of lost media). I know for myself, I feel a little more confident and willing to invest my time and attention here, knowing there's a real chance it wont just completely disappear one day, like other gachas in the past.",

      "review": "Slay the Spire but with gacha economy. The difficulty is serious on this one - not so much in the early game, but very much present in the late game. While the deck building isn't that deep, there is a good amount of tactics in each battle.\nThe game is very overwhelming in the beginning. There is not much in terms of guides on youtube or on wikis. The community does an amazing job at explaining things, but it's tucked away in Discords and visual spreadsheets.\n\nThe story and visual design is also amazing. Love the story from the get go. Very mature story with themes of Hannibal-adjacent murder, cannibalism, slavery and then some. There is a bit of a lovecraftian inspiration from it, as even the opening cutscene shows a quote by Lovecraft - however the story's themes play more into vicious horror than the psychological/cosmic kind. And yes, there is a character called Pickman. He likes to paint and eat unborn babies.\n\nOh and for those who are known to gachas, this one is very f2p friendly. Even if you decide to pay a little, you get much much much more than you get at any other game, with prices of 15 cents to 30 cents per pull (and needing 90 pulls for a guarantee, but you can kind of them in 60 more often than not).",

As a new player the gacha seemed overwhelming at first and almost turned me away from the game but I followed advice online to put my standard pulls into the aequor realm and have been progressing just fine.\n \nMy one gripe is I feel like there are too many FOMO paid currency offers that pop up after completing certain content and expire after a set period of time.

      "review": "[h1]Morimens – Bloody Oath, This Cthulhu Card Crawler Got Me Hooked Like a Barra on a Lure[/h1]\n\n[b]Overall Impression[/b]  \nStrewth, I've clocked about 300 hours into *Morimens* since it dropped on Steam, and it's fair dinkum one of the most addictive roguelite deck-builders I've played in yonks. It's like *Slay the Spire* shacked up with Lovecraft in a dodgy uni dorm, and they birthed this madcap card game full of eldritch horrors and cheeky waifus. Engaging as all get-out, with runs that fly by quicker than a mozzie at a barbie, but it can get frustrating when the RNG gods decide to chuck a spanner in the works. Fun? You betcha - I've lost whole arvos to \"just one more go\" sessions. Not perfect, mind you; it's still early days, but crikey, it's got potential to be a ripper.\n\n[b]Gameplay Mechanics[/b]  \nRighto, let's yarn about the guts of it. You're the Keeper at this Mythag University joint, linking up with these \"awakers\" - think anthropomorphic weapons that are half-hot anime chick, half-tentacled nightmare straight out of a bad acid trip. You build your deck from over 185 cards (and counting, apparently), mixing summons, spells, and buffs to tackle misty maps full of random events, shops, and boss fights that'd make Cthulhu himself chuck a wobbly.\n\nCombat's turn-based card battling: draw your hand, play what you can afford with energy, and watch the chaos unfold. It's lightweight roguelite, so runs are short and sweet - die, and you're back to the hub with some permanent unlocks to tweak your next build. Four main realms to explore, each with their own flavour of madness: foggy swamps, crumbling libraries, that sort of caper. Progression feels ace; you unlock new awakers, card upgrades, and even death-defying perks that let you cheat the reaper a bit.\n\nWhat works? The deck-building is deep without being a headache - plenty of synergies to chase, like stacking madness effects for big payoffs or going full summon spam with your favourite eldritch gal. PvP mode's a hoot too; no grinding needed, just jump in for quick scraps with twisted card rules. Gripes? RNG can be a mongrel - I've had runs where I pull nothing but duds, and the map events sometimes feel samey after a while. Oh, and the tutorial's a bit skimpy; took me a few failed runs to wrap me head around the madness mechanic properly. Still, it's highly replayable, and the devs are chucking in updates like nobody's business.\n\n[b]Graphics and Sound[/b]  \nVisually, it's a treat for the eyes - unique art style with these stylised, almost chibi-like characters that nail the Cthulhu vibe without going full horror show. The awakers are diverse as a mixed grill: some cute and quirky, others proper creepy with tentacles and glowing eyes. Card art's top-notch, full of little details like swirling mists and ancient runes. The maps are misty and atmospheric, but could use a bit more variety; after 50 runs, the foggy backdrops start blending together like vegemite on toast.\n\nSoundtrack's a belter - evocative tunes that build tension during battles, mixing eerie whispers with dramatic swells. Sound effects are spot-on: the *whoosh* of a card play, the guttural roars of bosses, even subtle madness whispers that make you question if your headphones are buggered. No voice acting that I've noticed, but the music carries the mood like a pro. Runs smooth on my rig, no crashes or anything, though it could do with some more polish on the UI - those tiny card texts are a bugger to read without squinting.\n\n[b]Story and Characters[/b]  \nThe narrative's a slow-burn descent into madness, delivered in episodic chunks as you progress through runs. You're uncovering this covert calamity at the uni, linking with awakers who're all teetering on the edge of insanity. Each one's got a personality that shines through in flavour text and story beats: one's a sassy silver key wielder, another's a brooding tome guardian with a tragic backstory. Worldbuilding draws heavy from Cthulhu mythos - eldritch gods, forgotten secrets, the whole shebang - but it's wrapped in this university setting that's equal parts spooky and whimsical.\n\nCharacter development happens outside battles too; you build bonds or something to unlock their full potential, which ties into the lore nicely. It's heart-rending at times, showing human (or half-human) struggles amid the apocalypse. Not gonna spoil it, but there's some ripper twists that had me going \"stone the crows!\" If you're into Lovecraft lite with a dash of anime flair, you'll lap it up. Just don't expect a linear epic - it's more piecemeal, revealed run by run.\n\n[b]Personal Experience[/b]  \nOne standout moment: I was deep in a run with my go-to deck built around this awaker named... bugger, can't remember, the one with the tentacle whip. Anyway, facing off against a boss that kept summoning minions faster than I could swat 'em. I was down to my last health, madness meter maxed out, and pulled off a combo that flipped the script - turned the boss's own summons against it with a madness card. Felt like a legend, mate. Yelled \"get in!\" so loud the dog bolted.\n\nAnother time, I bombed a PvP match hard 'cause I didn't grok the new card effects - got absolutely rinsed by some bloke with a cheese strat. Laughed it off, queued up again, and turned the tables next round. Oh, and the first time I unlocked a new realm? The story drop hit like a ton of bricks; had me pondering the \"burden of secrets\" bollocks while sipping me cuppa. Game's got that pull, y'know? Even when it kicks ya in the guts with bad luck.\n\n[b]Recommendation[/b]  \nReckon you'd love *Morimens* if you're into roguelite deck-builders like *Slay the Spire* or *Inscryption*, fancy a bit of Cthulhu flavour without the full-on terror, or just want something replayable with cute/creepy characters. It's low barrier to entry, so even if you're a newbie to the genre, you'll pick it up quick smart. PvP adds longevity, and the story's got enough meat to keep lore hounds happy.\n\nSkip it if you hate RNG or need a super polished experience right out the gate - it's got that indie charm with a few rough edges. For the price? Cheaper than a flat white and twice as addictive. Grab it, give it a burl, and may the Silver Key guide ya through the madness. Just don't blame me if you end up pulling an all-nighter chasing that perfect run.",

      "review": "Morimens is a gacha game with a bold premise: it's Slay the Spire with hardcore depth, gorgeous anime aesthetics, and a cosmic horror and insanity theme.\n\nThe first thing you should know is that the devs aren't messing around when it comes to horror. This game is *not* for kids. The first chapter alone features body horror, child mortality, and genuinely terrifying visual novel sections. Compared to other, more sanitized games on the market, it's an amazing breath of fresh air for horror fans.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, this is much more deep and strategic than your usual gacha game. Again, this is not a game for the faint-hearted: while the core mechanics are similar to Slay the Spire, so many extra resources and mechanics have been layered on top that it's daunting for new players. There aren't many guides to be found on the English-speaking internet, but the translation is serviceable enough, and there are plenty of in-game tutorials to help you wrap your head around the gameplay. And once you do understand how the mechanics work, you can't just faceroll your way through stages -- you have to actually manage your resources and think through your turns to succeed. It's skill-testing, replayable, and addictive.\n\nWhat about the husbandos and waifus, the most important part of a gacha game? Well, all of them are completely insane. It isn't just the monsters that are Lovecraftian horror -- most of the cast is broken, tormented, or actively detests humanity. It's great. If you are the kind of person who sees a bloodthirsty villain and thinks \"I can fix her,\" you've come to the right place.\n\nThis is maybe the most niche gacha I've ever played, and it's created by a team of indie devs who are obviously incredibly passionate about their work. If Morimens sounds like something you might be interested in, give it a shot, because there are no other games like this.",

      "review": "The game has pro's and con's... so let's start with the good\r\n\r\n- The gameplay is similar to slay the spire, you use cards to attack, defend, use poison, etc. So its quite fun.\r\n- While being a gacha game is a con for some people, the rewards and freebies the devs give usually make up for this part. \r\n- The character designs are different. It's not (only) gooner bait stuff, it has a bit of everything. \r\n- It has PvP but the power level of your unit doesnt affect PvP. That is because there's a PvP balance where every character has the same stats, doesnt matter if your oponent is a 2 year old whale with all the characters maxed out. The \"only difference\" is that you need to own a character to use it, so that's the only advantage older players/whales have over newer people... more choice of units and comps.\r\n\r\nThe cons:\r\n- The difficulty spike can be felt at certain points. You can tell this is a 2 year old game (at the time of the writting) because you might be clearing a chapter just fine and the next one is a major pain to even clear trash monsters.\r\n- There's a big part of the community that sucks balls. In the 2nd anniversary patch devs made the normal story easier to clear and the veterans came complaining the game became too easy. So the devs back pedalled on this matter, meaning the people who already had cleared the story, just made everything harder for newer players. Congratz on being petty af for no reason.\r\n- Everything is tied to account level. Once you start reaching the high 30s, low 40s it will take several days for a single account level up.

      "review": "The gacha is deceptively \"generous\". The numbers of free pulls and the chance to get SSR seem high (1 out of 30). However, the utility/power of the SSR you get is massively different, and the probability of you getting random trash SSR instead is quite high, so the real chance of getting the one you're aiming for is more like 1 out of 90. Also the best characters that can carry the game needs 12 dupes, not one or two, TWELVE. A character's kit is intentionally gimped at 0 dupe.\n\nThe gameplay is basically Slay the Spire, which is very time consuming and doesn't mesh well with the gacha game model.  I played for 12 hours, got showered in first time reward freebies, got around 30 SSRs, 4 of which being the one I was aiming for. Or I can just spend like $10 IAP to get the same amount, because the paid currency only gacha rate is infinitely better than the free gacha.\n\nI know I'm rambling a lot of gacha but the game is revolved around that, with the enemies HP and damage numbers ramping up multiplicatively, and with the shield mechanic of StS that means without sufficient numbers you'll just get clobbered, there's just no playing around it, well, except grinding for hours and hours on end (or spend a few bucks). \n\nIn StS games you want to experiment around with different/new builds (horizontal progression), but Morimens's gacha (diluted pool of unbalanced SSR characters/gears, heavy dupe reliant) and grinding (weeks of energy to farm materials to level up 1 character to usable state) model actively discourages that. To progress you need to invest everything in a few characters (vertical progression), which makes the grinding even worse because you are stuck doing the same thing over and over again, only difference is numbers going bigger. I guess some people can enjoy that but not for me.",

      "review": "The game has pro's and con's... so let's start with the good\r\n\r\n- The gameplay is similar to slay the spire, you use cards to attack, defend, use poison, etc. So its quite fun.\r\n- While being a gacha game is a con for some people, the rewards and freebies the devs give usually make up for this part. \r\n- The character designs are different. It's not (only) gooner bait stuff, it has a bit of everything. \r\n- It has PvP but the power level of your unit doesnt affect PvP. That is because there's a PvP balance where every character has the same stats, doesnt matter if your oponent is a 2 year old whale with all the characters maxed out. The \"only difference\" is that you need to own a character to use it, so that's the only advantage older players/whales have over newer people... more choice of units and comps.\r\n\r\nThe cons:\r\n- The difficulty spike can be felt at certain points. You can tell this is a 2 year old game (at the time of the writting) because you might be clearing a chapter just fine and the next one is a major pain to even clear trash monsters.\r\n- There's a big part of the community that sucks balls. In the 2nd anniversary patch devs made the normal story easier to clear and the veterans came complaining the game became too easy. So the devs back pedalled on this matter, meaning the people who already had cleared the story, just made everything harder for newer players. Congratz on being petty af for no reason.\r\n- Everything is tied to account level. Once you start reaching the high 30s, low 40s it will take several days for a single account level up. And since the game punishes you stat wise for tackling higher level content (your characters might be lv60 but if your account is lv45, trying to tackle recommended level 50+ for example, your stats and card effects are lowered... make it make sense) it will take forever to advance in the story or unlock higher farming stages to upgrade your units.\r\n- Some characters require dupes to be functional.

The drop rate is 3% and the pity is 30, so it's very rare you don't get at least 2 dupes of the character you're going for within the first 2 days of the banner.\nWithin the first 3 days of playing I already had 7 copies of my favourite character, 4 copies of my next favourite, 2 copies of the limited character I wanted and 2 copies of my carry.\n\nSimilar to azur lane the play for summoning seems to be \"Pick one realm of characters and just stick to it\" And the banners have dedicated \"Pick which realm of characters you want\" banners which is pretty amazing. I also appreciate they're very transparent about the difficulty of each realm of characters. When you're selecting which realm you want to go with it has a star system to tell you you're picking easy mode or hard mode by pursuing characters from that realm.\n\nI can't say I recommend it though because after chapter 2 there's very little to do. Your progression is locked behind levelling up your investigator level, which you do by spending energy getting materials. So after a certain point it's just \"Wait for energy and log in once a day to spend it\". That coupled with the drop in story quality past chapter 2 makes it feel like a bait and switch.",

When I received my first one, “Ramona,” with an SR attached to her, I already had a bad feeling — that typical gacha-game vibe you often get from many Asian games.\n\nFor me personally, the worst part comes right after finishing the tutorial. You’re suddenly overwhelmed with tons of different currencies and gacha pulls. Okay, I can deal with that, but then it keeps going — new abilities, traits, mechanics... and at some point, I just stopped.\nI just wanted a clear, guided path to follow without feeling like I needed to do a PhD-level research project during my first two hours, when I only wanted to get a feel for the game, its mechanics, and its story.\n\nIt might be a really good game — I don’t know.

Generally the events are very generous, there's a lot of easy ways to get summons and resources without spending any money at all!\r\n\r\nSo why am I giving it a negative review: You cannot fuck Thais. Thais is best girl and I can't have wet, sloppy sex with her. Also ngl the bosses in the finale are pretty damn annoying.",

      "review": "The gacha is deceptively \"generous\". The numbers of free pulls and the chance to get SSR seem high (1 out of 30). However, the utility/power of the SSR you get is massively different, and the probability of you getting random trash SSR instead is quite high, so the real chance of getting the one you're aiming for is more like 1 out of 90. Also the best characters that can carry the game needs 12 dupes, not one or two, TWELVE. A character's kit is intentionally gimped at 0 dupe.\n\nThe gameplay is basically Slay the Spire, which is very time consuming and doesn't mesh well with the gacha game model.  I played for 12 hours, got showered in first time reward freebies, got around 30 SSRs, 4 of which being the one I was aiming for. Or I can just spend like $10 IAP to get the same amount, because the paid currency only gacha rate is infinitely better than the free gacha.\n\nI know I'm rambling a lot of gacha but the game is revolved around that, with the enemies HP and damage numbers ramping up multiplicatively, and with the shield mechanic of StS that means without sufficient numbers you'll just get clobbered, there's just no playing around it, well, except grinding for hours and hours on end (or spend a few bucks). \n\nIn StS games you want to experiment around with different/new builds (horizontal progression), but Morimens's gacha (diluted pool of unbalanced SSR characters/gears, heavy dupe reliant) and grinding (weeks of energy to farm materials to level up 1 character to usable state) model actively discourages that. To progress you need to invest everything in a few characters (vertical progression), which makes the grinding even worse because you are stuck doing the same thing over and over again, only difference is numbers going bigger. I guess some people can enjoy that but not for me.",

      "review": "The first 2 chapters of the story are peak fiction, after that the translation issues come in hard at the start of the third chapter. It literally feels like we skipped two chapters between chapter 2 and chapter 3, it's very hard to follow along.\n\nAs for combat it's very well thought out but it feels tedious after a while, each battle can take around 10 minutes and with 4-5 battles per stage and 14 stages per chapter it takes ages to get through.\n\nI do think the gacha is one of the best in all gacha games, along with azur lane's. The drop rate is 3% and the pity is 30, so it's very rare you don't get at least 2 dupes of the character you're going for within the first 2 days of the banner.\nWithin the first 3 days of playing I already had 7 copies of my favourite character, 4 copies of my next favourite, 2 copies of the limited character I wanted and 2 copies of my carry.\n\nSimilar to azur lane the play for summoning seems to be \"Pick one realm of characters and just stick to it\" And the banners have dedicated \"Pick which realm of characters you want\" banners which is pretty amazing. I also appreciate they're very transparent about the difficulty of each realm of characters. When you're selecting which realm you want to go with it has a star system to tell you you're picking easy mode or hard mode by pursuing characters from that realm.\n\nI can't say I recommend it though because after chapter 2 there's very little to do. Your progression is locked behind levelling up your investigator level, which you do by spending energy getting materials. So after a certain point it's just \"Wait for energy and log in once a day to spend it\". That coupled with the drop in story quality past chapter 2 makes it feel like a bait and switch.",

The mechanics seem quite deep, and the story — from what little I’ve seen — feels somewhat okay or a bit cliché, but that’s fine since it’s first and foremost a card game.\n\nThe game starts by throwing a ton of different keywords at you and introducing four different characters. When I received my first one, “Ramona,” with an SR attached to her, I already had a bad feeling — that typical gacha-game vibe you often get from many Asian games.\n\nFor me personally, the worst part comes right after finishing the tutorial. You’re suddenly overwhelmed with tons of different currencies and gacha pulls. Okay, I can deal with that, but then it keeps going — new abilities, traits, mechanics... and at some point, I just stopped.\nI just wanted a clear, guided path to follow without feeling like I needed to do a PhD-level research project during my first two hours, when I only wanted to get a feel for the game, its mechanics, and its story.\n\nIt might be a really good game — I don’t know. But the effort required to read through and understand all the different systems and mechanics is just too high for an investment in a game I’m not yet sure I’ll enjoy or spend more time in.\n\nFor some players, this level of depth might be appealing.

Mtg lets you earn the secondary currency slowly over time by competing in drafts. It keeps the pool of players consistent and actually adds an incentive to spend money for more of the secondary contrary to what you'd originally think.

Its disappointing bc I would actually invest time and money into something like this if there was potential for it to improve visually and conceptually, but I seriously doubt my money will go toward anything but a predatory market strategy at this point. Mtg lets you earn the secondary currency slowly over time by competing in drafts. It keeps the pool of players consistent and actually adds an incentive to spend money for more of the secondary contrary to what you'd originally think.

Enemy health is also 2-4 times as your team with boss hp sometimes around 60k while your team is at 1,500 hp. Still doable, if your point of making the game is to waste people's time. Damn it takes 10-15 minutes to win a stage with same level of team and enemy lol, and the reward? well you just wasted time. This is basically a pay to win now, you could still grind and win but you know, it's not fun anymore.

      "review": "The game has pro's and con's... so let's start with the good\r\n\r\n- The gameplay is similar to slay the spire, you use cards to attack, defend, use poison, etc. So its quite fun.\r\n- While being a gacha game is a con for some people, the rewards and freebies the devs give usually make up for this part. \r\n- The character designs are different. It's not (only) gooner bait stuff, it has a bit of everything. \r\n- It has PvP but the power level of your unit doesnt affect PvP. That is because there's a PvP balance where every character has the same stats, doesnt matter if your oponent is a 2 year old whale with all the characters maxed out. The \"only difference\" is that you need to own a character to use it, so that's the only advantage older players/whales have over newer people... more choice of units and comps.\r\n\r\nThe cons:\r\n- The difficulty spike can be felt at certain points. You can tell this is a 2 year old game (at the time of the writting) because you might be clearing a chapter just fine and the next one is a major pain to even clear trash monsters.\r\n- There's a big part of the community that sucks balls. In the 2nd anniversary patch devs made the normal story easier to clear and the veterans came complaining the game became too easy. So the devs back pedalled on this matter, meaning the people who already had cleared the story, just made everything harder for newer players. Congratz on being petty af for no reason.\r\n- Everything is tied to account level. Once you start reaching the high 30s, low 40s it will take several days for a single account level up. And since the game punishes you stat wise for tackling higher level content (your characters might be lv60 but if your account is lv45, trying to tackle recommended level 50+ for example, your stats and card effects are lowered... make it make sense) it will take forever to advance in the story or unlock higher farming stages to upgrade your units.\r\n- Some characters require dupes to be functional. This is the bad part of the gacha. On top of this, there's a wheel (think like a weapon) gacha, which some units want to have... so more investment in terms of pulls necessary.\r\n- Depending where you live, the ping is a major pain... from europe i have 300+ ping... meaning to open a page, loading levels, starting a pvp battle, etc... its so slow and some stuff is just a pain to deal with.\r\n\r\nWith the pro's and cons out of the way (i cant judge story since i skip and play most of the game on mute so i can listen to my own stuff on the background, i cannot say if these are pro's or con's) i wanna say that i really like the game and intended to keep up with it but seeing the veterans pressuring the devs to screw new players by retracting the nerfs to normal stages (so everyone could enjoy the main story and the freebies it has) made me write this negative review and that im really thinking about dropping the game as a new player who's now stuck on story... not in the hard mode, not the incoming nightmare difficulty... on normal difficulty. That's how petty and out of touch those old players are and devs decided to listen to them.",

Important mechanics are locked behind levelling up both\r\n- No way to store energy for later\r\n- No skip gacha features except the standard banner pickers\r\n- Extremely repetitive long fights, that basically become battles of attrition very quickly\r\n- While it's possible to level up charter levels and progress the story at low account levels, too many things are locked behind account level (Like party max HP). This damages the overall experience for those that want to play 6 hours every day trying to speedrun the story.\r\n-  Combined with a live service system, where rewards scale with your account level and more pulls / powerful things can be farmed at higher account level, this becomes a problem\r\n- Symptom cards have card art, while character cards don't. This is a major problem as a character in this game is a few voice lines, a single PNG (not even Live 2D), some animations like the Exault and that is it. No card art, just the same character PNG on all cards.\r\n- The PC client is not that great. Clicking things is confusing, the shortcuts are there, but not that useful. The story viewing and things not fitting in boxes is pretty annoying\r\n- The cards text is just bloated. There are extremely long descriptions on all cards and it's confusing a lot how things really function. \r\n- Damage is not clear, there is a preview of enemy damage, but there are other damages that can come as a surprise. For example, tentacle damage is very unclear. Sometimes my team just bursts the boss completely\r\n- Crit rate and crit damage gacha trap again\r\n- Inconsistent difficulty and a fallback on a revive mechanic for unbalanced fights\r\n- The writing falls off after chapter 2. Chapter 3 and 4 feel very similar to chapter 1, chapter 5 feels like nothing really happened at all\r\n- Too many rogulike sections in the main story. There should have been more story fights to make the story progression faster\r\n- A bit too predatory design with the popups to spend money. A bit too many places to claim rewards and too many notifications",
