      "review": "I've played the game almost entirely on mobile, and I've read some of the negative reviews here, and think some of them are being a bit unfair/unrealistic. So here's the top six reasons why people gave this a negative review:\n\n---The game is made by Akatsuki, and they haven't been made the best choices for the players\n\nThat's true--there's a lot of people that have been burned by them, so if you dislike them, I wouldn't bother playing the game. I think this game is good, but I can see why someone would have an issue with the company and not even give the game the time of day.\n\n---The banners don't separate weapons and characters\n\nThat's also true--one of the few issues I really have with the game. So if you pull a banner, and the animation makes it look like you're going to get something good, and then you pull a weapon instead of the character? That hope they give you just hurts a bit more. I don't know why they chose to do banners like this, but it's extremely frustrating.\n\n---The game has an auto battling button, and you can just click it and make everything boring\n\nThis one is interesting because A.) the game isn't making you auto battle, and B.) sometimes you actually need to battle because the AI can be stupid. I enjoy the auto battle button sometimes when I just want to do the battle without much input, and I'm not sure why that's a negative--that's more of a QoL function than anything.\n\n---The game doesn't have a lot of end game content\n\nThat's true, but the game is fairly new and it is adding content every several weeks. So you could make the case for that being a reason why you don't play, or you could just...wait until there's more content to play.\n\n---People only focus on playing with the best characters, and many others get left behind\n\nThis comment I saw a few times, I thought it was weird--people were complaining that there is a meta and that some characters aren't even effective or useful. And while that is true, you'd be surprised at how many lower characters are extremely useful in higher/end game content--there are at least four to five 4 star characters that are amazing support for a team and allow your star characters to do tons of damage.\n\n---The gacha and rates are somehow more terrible in this game than other gatcha games\n\nFor me personally, I've been lucky to get almost every character and their weapons from the banners. I've had some bad luck, but the game gives you plenty of opportunities to get characters and their weapons. But that is for me personally. What I will say is I've played other gatcha games, and this game doesn't seem as terrible--in fact, a lot of the comments on reddit say that this game is fairly mild when it comes to gatcha tactics. But you may find that it's terrible just based on bad luck.\n\nHonestly, I really enjoy this game--it's not something you need to grind at, but you check in every few times a day to burn through your energy, do a few battles, and then go do something else. I hate gatcha games that make you feel like you have to check them every 10-20 mins and they're so busy that it just becomes a job to play them. I think some of the negative comments are warranted, but some of them aren't, and for me personally? I believe this game gets a positive review.",

      "review": "**Kaiju No. 8: The Game** is fun to play and easy to recommend to other gamers because it taps into what makes both action games and the *Kaiju No. 8* series exciting. Even if someone hasn’t read the manga or watched the anime, the game delivers a satisfying mix of fast-paced combat, cinematic moments, and progression that keeps players hooked.\r\n\r\nHere’s why players find it enjoyable:\r\n\r\n### **1. Power-Fantasy Combat**\r\n\r\nTransforming into a kaiju and unleashing massive, screen-shaking attacks is inherently fun. The game lets you feel powerful in a way that’s both chaotic and strategic—big hits, destructive abilities, and enemy-swarming scenarios make every mission feel intense.\r\n\r\n### **2. Faithful to the Kaiju No. 8 Universe**\r\n\r\nFans of the series get:\r\n\r\n* recognizable characters,\r\n* iconic transformations,\r\n* story moments adapted or expanded from the source material.\r\n\r\nIt feels like being dropped right into the manga/anime world, but with interactivity and personal choice layered in.\r\n\r\n### **3. Satisfying Progression**\r\n\r\nYou’re constantly unlocking:\r\n\r\n* new abilities,\r\n* suit upgrades,\r\n* kaiju transformations,\r\n* mission types.\r\n\r\nThis sense of growth keeps players motivated and makes replaying missions rewarding instead of repetitive.\r\n\r\n### **4. Variety of Playstyles**\r\n\r\nWhether someone prefers:\r\n\r\n* melee-heavy rushdown combat,\r\n* long-range strategy,\r\n* team-based missions,\r\n* or boss-style kaiju encounters,\r\n\r\n…the game gives different ways to play. That makes it appealing to both casual and hardcore action-game players.\r\n\r\n### **5. High Production Value**\r\n\r\nExplosions, environmental destruction, giant monster fights, and dramatic character animations create a cinematic feel. Even simple missions feel like part of a big, ongoing war against kaiju.\r\n\r\n### **6. Easy to Pick Up, Hard to Put Down**\r\n\r\nCombat inputs are approachable, but mastering combos, dodging, and special abilities takes practice. This balance makes the game fun for newcomers while offering depth for dedicated gamers.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Why It’s Recommended for Other Gamers**\r\n\r\n* **Action fans** love the fast pace and huge boss fights.\r\n* **Anime fans** appreciate the faithful presentation.\r\n* **Co-op or mission-based players** enjoy taking on giant threats together.\r\n* **Casual players** can enjoy short, explosive missions without long time commitments.\r\n\r\nOverall, **Kaiju No. 8: The Game** delivers high-energy combat, cool transformations, and a world that feels alive and dramatic—making it an easy recommendation for anyone who enjoys action, spectacle, or kaiju-themed adventures.",

Since I played a lot of this kind of game, I'm familiar with the mechanics, I just need to understand their terminologies and I'm good. Overall a good game though with some cons. One of my recommendation is to have an ingame option to have an ultimate cut scene on/off button that you can switch anytime even during auto mode so If you're grinding, you can just on the ultimate cut scene to stop the time consuming ultimate animations. Another one is the FPS cap, I guess it  better if we can maximize our GPU, having a 60FPS cap, there's a time I still experienced a FPS drop even with good GPU.",

I was worried about this too, but everything worked fine for me.\nSome reviews suggest that people used the Link Account option and then lost their data. That’s not how you log into your account. That option will overwrite your data. On the startup page, when logging into the game, you need to select Transfer Data in the menu instead. A detailed description of how to do this has been available in the game ever since Account Linking was enabled (check the News button in-game).\n\n[h1] [u] Pay To Win Aspect [/u] [/h1]\nI’ll mainly compare this game to One Punch Man: Road to Hero 2.0 and a few other gacha games. In most of those, you have PvP modes and leaderboard events where the “richer get richer.”.\nThis game doesn’t have that problem. Other whales won’t hinder your event rewards. All of the content is very F2P-friendly.\nIn OPM, you could easily spend $1000 on a single new character just to get all the pay-to-win event benefits. This game has nothing like that. Yes, it’s still gacha, so luck plays a role, but it’s far less aggressive and much more welcoming to free-to-play players.\n\n[h1] [u] Banners [/u] [/h1]\nI’ve seen some reviews complaining about banners. Honestly, I don’t see the problem. Other games do the same thing (OPM does it a bit differently, but it still has limited characters).\nHere, you can pull from limited banners for a chance at specific characters. As of now, there are only two limited characters that appear rarely in special events. The rest will eventually be available in the regular gacha. Overall, you can get all the characters you want over time.\n\n[h1] [u] Content [/u] [/h1]\nThere isn’t a huge amount of content right now, but I actually see that as a positive. As a F2P player, I can catch up and level up to max, which will let me focus more on new characters and content as it’s released. Plus, this is still a new game with plenty of content on the way. Just give it some time.\n\n[h1] [u] Gacha Currency [/u] [/h1]\nIf you play consistently, you’ll earn enough currency to get new characters at least once. So far, I’ve been able to unlock all the characters, and even get some dupes, without spending money. Very F2P-friendly.\n\n[h1] [u] Performance [/u] [/h1]\nThe game runs great — max settings at 120 FPS. No screen tearing or visual artifacts, just smooth gameplay all the way. RTX 3060 Ti.\n\n[h1] [u] Overall Experience [/u] [/h1]\nI enjoy the anime, and the game itself is a nice, chill experience. You can finish your dailies in about five minutes and then come back later in the day if you want.\nI’m not saying other reviews are wrong, and of course, there are things that could be improved, but my own experience with the game has been positive so far. That’s really it.",

Stamina recharges fast at 12 hrs so you can dump stamina twice a day. \n\n5 star rates are super generous, I've finished all content and farmed up all the f2p gems I could get and pretty much unlocked the entire base game roster including some dupes. There are times when you do a multi summon and get like 4 5-stars. If you are any luckier than me then you could easily get 1-2 5-star characters and weapons to max dupe by the time you can do endgame content. \n\nAs for endgame itself, its pretty easy. You require 2 teams like HSR which is easily achievable. There's also gear for characters, but maxing out gear isn't a requirement. I've finished endgame with mild investment in gear. The game also gives you a bunch of resources to redeem gear with so there's almost no need to farm gear unless you REALLY wanna max characters out. The only hard part is lvl up characters. Unless your willing to login twice a day, its gonna take a while to lvl up a couple characters for a full team.\n\nThere are 2 negatives. The game is running on 5x speed. In the span of 1 month the devs have released 5 characters and although they are generous with rewards, it's just not enough especially if your unlucky. Theres no 5050 guarantee like in Hoyo games, what we do have is the spark system. 150 for the weapons and 250 for the character so your shit outa luck if RNGsus hates you. 2nd negative is that rate up for on banner character is absolute doodoo water. I havne't gotton super unlucky yet, but i've played too many gacha games to know the feeling. It hurts doing 100+ pulls and not get the character you want",

Honestly, I think the game is really fun — it not only follows the original manga/anime story but also adds original scenarios and side character stories.\n\nGameplay-wise, it’s a turn-based gacha similar to Honkai Star Rail. Combat feels smooth, polished, and fun, with great visuals and an excellent voice cast that brings the characters to life. The game modes are varied, and the story has been enjoyable so far.\n\nI might be a bit lucky with pulls (I’ve gotten quite a lot of 5stars), but even as a F2P player the game feels generous with currency and resources. Like other gachas, you’ll be farming to invest in your favorite characters and weapons, but here it feels satisfying when you see those power boosts after upgrading.\n\nThat said, my one concern is the developer. This is from Akatsuki Games — their last title, Tribe Nine, shut down just 3 months after launch. That history makes me nervous, but I’m hoping they’ll treat Kaiju No. 8 better because the game really has a lot going for it.\n\n✅ If you’re a Kaiju No. 8 fan, you’ll love this.\n✅ If you’re a gacha player, it’s familiar but well put together.\n⚠️ Just… please don’t die early, Akatsuki.\n\nI wish there was a mixed rating review option but yeah.",

      "review": "**Kaiju No. 8: The Game** is fun to play and easy to recommend to other gamers because it taps into what makes both action games and the *Kaiju No. 8* series exciting. Even if someone hasn’t read the manga or watched the anime, the game delivers a satisfying mix of fast-paced combat, cinematic moments, and progression that keeps players hooked.\r\n\r\nHere’s why players find it enjoyable:\r\n\r\n### **1. Power-Fantasy Combat**\r\n\r\nTransforming into a kaiju and unleashing massive, screen-shaking attacks is inherently fun. The game lets you feel powerful in a way that’s both chaotic and strategic—big hits, destructive abilities, and enemy-swarming scenarios make every mission feel intense.\r\n\r\n### **2. Faithful to the Kaiju No. 8 Universe**\r\n\r\nFans of the series get:\r\n\r\n* recognizable characters,\r\n* iconic transformations,\r\n* story moments adapted or expanded from the source material.\r\n\r\nIt feels like being dropped right into the manga/anime world, but with interactivity and personal choice layered in.\r\n\r\n### **3. Satisfying Progression**\r\n\r\nYou’re constantly unlocking:\r\n\r\n* new abilities,\r\n* suit upgrades,\r\n* kaiju transformations,\r\n* mission types.\r\n\r\nThis sense of growth keeps players motivated and makes replaying missions rewarding instead of repetitive.\r\n\r\n### **4. Variety of Playstyles**\r\n\r\nWhether someone prefers:\r\n\r\n* melee-heavy rushdown combat,\r\n* long-range strategy,\r\n* team-based missions,\r\n* or boss-style kaiju encounters,\r\n\r\n…the game gives different ways to play. That makes it appealing to both casual and hardcore action-game players.\r\n\r\n### **5. High Production Value**\r\n\r\nExplosions, environmental destruction, giant monster fights, and dramatic character animations create a cinematic feel. Even simple missions feel like part of a big, ongoing war against kaiju.\r\n\r\n### **6. Easy to Pick Up, Hard to Put Down**\r\n\r\nCombat inputs are approachable, but mastering combos, dodging, and special abilities takes practice. This balance makes the game fun for newcomers while offering depth for dedicated gamers.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Why It’s Recommended for Other Gamers**\r\n\r\n* **Action fans** love the fast pace and huge boss fights.\r\n* **Anime fans** appreciate the faithful presentation.\r\n* **Co-op or mission-based players** enjoy taking on giant threats together.\r\n* **Casual players** can enjoy short, explosive missions without long time commitments.\r\n\r\nOverall, **Kaiju No. 8: The Game** delivers high-energy combat, cool transformations, and a world that feels alive and dramatic—making it an easy recommendation for anyone who enjoys action, spectacle, or kaiju-themed adventures.",

Since I played a lot of this kind of game, I'm familiar with the mechanics, I just need to understand their terminologies and I'm good. Overall a good game though with some cons. One of my recommendation is to have an ingame option to have an ultimate cut scene on/off button that you can switch anytime even during auto mode so If you're grinding, you can just on the ultimate cut scene to stop the time consuming ultimate animations. Another one is the FPS cap, I guess it  better if we can maximize our GPU, having a 60FPS cap, there's a time I still experienced a FPS drop even with good GPU.",

      "review": "I should start by saying that the higher up executives of the company Akatsuki Games should not be trusted, they again and again disappoint their fans by giving up on their projects, most recently they developed the amazing game Tribe Nine which was the best Gacha game I have ever played in 10 years playing Gacha games, only to suddenly end support, fire the developers and abandon their fans in 3 months, this company has proven that it does not deserve your money.\n\nWith that out of the way, I did still want to give this game a fair shot as I did not want to simply review bomb this and go on with my life, for as much as I hate the higher ups, the developers, artists and writters working on this game deserve a chance. As of right now I've played the game on mobile for about 3 weeks and have completed quite literally every piece of content currently available.\n\nThis game is a very standard turn based rpg team building gacha game, with most of it's systems being very clearly taken from one of the most popular gacha games of the current day, Honkai Star Rail. The break bar system, the two attacks and an ultimate per character, the character order list, it's all an obvious copy of HSR (that game already being a copy of the Trails series and FFX). In a way that's good, if it ain't broke don't fix it and all that, but Kaiju No8 doesn't do anything particularly special to make me reccomend it over just playing Honkai Star Rail, which has in my opinion a very good story. Just to be done with comparisons, the one thing I do quite like that Kaiju No8 does is their version of the break bar system, instead of it being a bar that is depleted slowly like in HSR, it is instead based on number of attacks that correspond to a certain group of elements and weaknesses, that I think makes it much more strategic to think about your attacks, at certain points you'll find yourself thinking \"should I use this buff skill now or do a regular attack to get closer to breaking the bar\" or \"should I use the ultimate to help break the bar or to do more damage after it's broker\", and that can be quite fun. \n\nNext I should mention the story, if you're a fan of the series already you will probably have a fine time with the new content that is exclusive to this game, the new characters are interesting enough even if they have very little screen time, and the character exclusive little chapters are charming, but I couldn't reccomend this game to anyone who is not already a fan of the series, half of the story content is just a worse retelling of the first season of the anime that uses the in game models to tell the story, and while you can tell good stories with little animation, in this case it just ends up looking weird and cheap.\n\nThe most positive point in my opinion is the graphics and visuals in combat, the fidelity with the style of the original work is impressive and the models and animations are on point there, on that regard I have zero complaints.\n\nNow for the biggest complaint of this game is just how barren it is, overrall for content you have the Story Mode, farming for leveling and other powerups, and the endgame mode which are just high level battles with turn limit based rewards, and that's quite honestly about it, there have been a few events like the kaiju raid, but those just end up becoming an extra daily to skip after the first time you do it. There's also the expedition mode which is this weird roguelike autobattle thing, it's honestly fun but it's a completely separate game and aside from weekly rewards theres not much reason to do it. \nYeah there's no exploration, no unique gamemode that can go infinitely, or even a changing endgame mode, once you're done you're done and you'll be left waiting, which is a very bad look for this game overrall.\n\nIn conclusion, Kaiju No. 8 is an okay game that takes a lot from other sources and does an okay work with it, but the lack of content or anything really special makes it a hard sell for anyone that's not already a fan of the original series.\nConsidering the terrible past of Akatsuki Games, I would only reccomend this game if it blew me away the same way Tribe Nine did, it's okay overrall but it didn't even come close to it, and as such, unless you are a big fan of Kaiju No8, I don't reccomend this game to you. \nWell, come back in 6 months and see if it's still alive and not EoS.",

      "review": "[h3]Don't give Akatsuki your money. Seriously.[/h3]\n\nFirst of all - the delay for the Steam release already makes the situation bad. We didn't have any news about it until almost two weeks have passed, and the statement was literally \"we didn't finish making the port\". (the Steam page of Kaiju8 game and their official socials still have \"coming soon\" in descriptions, they didn't even bother). Their communication department is awful, and have been like this for a while with the previous games too. Late underwhelming character teasers, no proper marketing, no proper patch notes, lack of interactions with the community, nearly no support feedback.\nThe port itself isn't that good either, if you are interested. No advanced graphics options, no higher resolution for the cutscenes or sprites, controls are the same as in any of your average mobile ports: you can \"tap\", and... Yeah, that's kinda it. No keyboard shortcuts. Plus there are some annoying things such as jitter effect on the models and forced lack of smoothing even on \"max quality\" setting. You can't disable the effects or make the quality better, just as mentioned above. Not to mention the PC only players are missing out on an entire month of resources, and will NOT receive any compensation ever, nor did we get any sort of celebration for the PC release. PC only players, who were excited for the release in August, are now in an active disadvantage in terms of progression and rewards. If you wanted to get a unit that was released for mobile only just a few weeks ago - too bad. Their banner is gone, wait for a rerun.\n\n[u]Now to the actual game.[/u]\n\n[b]Story[/b] - since I haven't interacted with the ip before, I can't judge how faithful it is. My apologies, will have to skip this part.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b] - it's hsr, plain and simple. Not like it's bad, you can have some fun with it. But the UI is quite confusing, skill buttons lack information (you'll have to hold character icons to see the detailed skill info), no turn indicator (it only shows in fierce battle) which makes it hard to manage the buffs, AI for the auto is kind of dumb, spamming the skill even if it's not needed, and the animations are too damn long (and lack impact sometimes). X2 speed doesn't help much.\n\n[b]Graphics[/b] - just as told in the Steam release rent, it's not good for a PC port. Character models are decently done (but lack emotions and have awful lipsync), their animations are smooth (for the most part, story cutscenes are kind of awkward), and the animations do get frequently re-used (attack and follow-up animations are the same, ult animations get re-used in the story, gacha animation literally being the same as protag's ult but slightly shinier). I still respect those responsible for the actual art part, both 2D and 3D. They did their best, just probably weren't given enough time.\n\n[b]Progression[/b] - one of the most scammy parts. If you log in once a day - you are missing out on at least half of the resources you could get. But to be fair, if you are a patient casual player that is not bothered by fomo - it probably won't stress you too much and you can ignore this paragraph. If you are not - prepare to log in twice a day and plan your routine, or the progress will suffer.\nThe worst part though is the gear system. You have to literally gamble both for the rarity and the main stat. Doesn't sound too bad as there are no level ups like in hoyo games, but there is no way to guarantee yourself a gold rarity set piece (5 star), and the highest rarity material you can get to make a set piece is purple rarity (4 star). Meaning it only has a CHANCE to get you a gold. Plus the stat reroll is expensive. And did I mention the set bonus actually scales off the set rarity? Not all pieces are gold? You miss out on quite a few percents. \nEach replaced piece gives you \"recycling\" mat, and you can buy more materials for making the equipment, but the whole process is insanely miserable if you even slightly care for the stats and set bonuses.\n\n[b]Music and voices[/b] - it's alright, I guess. Voice acting is actually very good, and I didn't expect less from the professional cast. The soundtrack is a bit generic, but maybe someone could enjoy it. The variety in tracks is not much, so they do get boring after a while...\n\n[b]Content and gacha[/b] - there is no content. You finish the story, you finish fierce battle (aka mirror from hsr), and you have nothing to do aside from maxing all your teams. Gacha income? There is none. The game tricks you into thinking it's generous by giving away characters, dupes, tickets and currency. But once you clear everything mentioned before - you get 1/3 of a pull daily, and nothing more. The \"fierce battle\" updates once a month, but it gives you less than a ten pull, so don't expect miracles. What about the events tho? There are none. Two log-in campaigns that last a week, one \"event\" that doesn't give pull currency. That's all I was met with on PC release. I don't expect improvements from Akatsuki in this department, especially not hoyo levels of creativity or Nikke levels of generousity.\n Speaking of pulls, what about the banners? There is no weapon banner, BUT just because weapon and character are in the same one. 3% for a featured unit, 5% for their featured weapon. No soft pity, no hard pity. BUT the tokens you get for pulling don't expire, similarly to Nikke. You can buy a unit or their signature weapon if you want, but it will take A LOT of pulls (250 for a unit, 150 for a weapon), and you will never have enough of those with an income like that. Game can shower you with random 5 stars on every ten, or it can leave you with nothing after 200. You will never know until you get into this situation. Imagine getting two copies of a weapon in 150 pulls, yet not a single copy of the character it was made for. Couldn't be me of course...\n\n[i]The game overall clearly expects you to spend in order to make any sort of progress. Limited energy with no overflow yet at least two paid stamina packs, battle pass with limited weapons (but not too much value imo) just like in your favourite hoyo games, huge amounts of pulls required to get the character. God forbid if you want to get them to max dupes (that being 6) OR their weapon (4 dupes). It's your average anime IP cashgrab. Looks good on the surface, can be enjoyed, but will occasionally remind you what it is. All gacha games are predatory, but some just hide it better than the others. This one kind of fails at that. Even if you are a fan of Kaiju no.8 - I'd avoid getting into it. Maybe complete the story if you are interested in the new original characters or casual conversations between the cast members in chats, but that's all I can say.[/i]\n\n[u]... And I repeat again. Don't give them your money.[/u]\n\nAkatsuki games have a long history of abandoning their projects, most games living for 3-4 years at best. While the art, voices, music and writing are amazing, their actual management and communication are very bad, and the decisions are clearly made with no long term strategy in mind. The exception that people bring up is DBZ Dokkan, since it still lives, but I need to remind that it wasn't [u]published[/u] by Akatsuki, only developed. Meaning they are not in charge of financial matters and game's lifespan. \n\nI understand you want your favourite franchise to thrive and have good games, I myself lived through a few dead JoJo gachas, but please stay cautious, and don't put too much trust or money into a publisher, that shut their recent game down in FOUR MONTHS with no preparations or warnings either for the fanbase or their own employees. While getting partial refunds, we never got any \"closing party\" for the community, statements on why the game shuts down, or even the characters that ARE ALREADY IN THE GAME INCLUDING SKINS, ITEMS ETC, but not accessible due to rushed EoS.\n[b]If you see ANY live service game PUBLISHED by Akatsuki - turn back.[/b]",

That's why it makes me all the more sad that this game is the way it is.\n(Though it is playable on Steam Deck and Linux, this is a big W for an gacha game!)\n\nLike I said, it's a gacha game, so you need to play it every day or pull your credit card to get enough rewards to pull all the possible characters. Right now you get enough rewards to unlock every character with his weapon, though the catch is there will come a time where you won't be able to get this many rewards anymore. All the while you may also be out of luck and don't unlock your character at all, as there doesn't seem to be any pity mechanic in this game like ZZZ or Genshin have. So while good enough right now, the gacha system could be improved in my eyes to feel more consistent and less punishing.\n\nYou acquire \"tickets\" for pulls, with one ticket meaning one pull. The other way is using the game's own currency which is similar to ZZZ polychrom. The problem is that tickets and said currency can't be mixed which extends grinding if you want to do ten pulls at once. Grinding energy can add to the padding of the game but there is one mechanic i personally like in which you can skip the combat to get your rewards early. This avoids redundant combat missions, but in case you really like the turned based combat system you can still do it the manual way.\nThe main gripe comes with that you'll need resources to level up your characters, which may result in you just waiting another day to be able to continue the story, which drags it on even more.\n\nAs you can see, the game does have its gripes but if you can overlook the padding mechanics and the waiting periods, there is much fun to be had.",

As the time of this review, it dropped down to a few hundred thousand max. It show that at least people have half a brain cells to not play this kusa. Thank god. \n\nFor a gacha game, this game offer NOTHING new to the gaming scene. Literally just a cash grab on a dead IP where the manga already concluded. Gameplay is same old turn based action that you have seen in 90% of gacha games of the same genre. Press either attack, skill or use ultimate.\n\nCharacter and weapon are in the same banner? What kind of backward brain rot is this? The reason why Mihoyo split their weapon and character banners is because they know putting both together is a dead system that scream \"GIVE ME YOUR WALLET\".\n\nTribe 9 died for this shit to be born which is a shame. Tribe 9 indeed have a pretty rough start with less overall revenue due to less known IP, but eventually with added contents and more support no doubt will become a big hit.\n\nI give this game another half a year to a year max. It will run out of new characters to gacha on. They will reuse old characters by giving them skins and make players gacha on it.",

      "review": "I should start by saying that the higher up executives of the company Akatsuki Games should not be trusted, they again and again disappoint their fans by giving up on their projects, most recently they developed the amazing game Tribe Nine which was the best Gacha game I have ever played in 10 years playing Gacha games, only to suddenly end support, fire the developers and abandon their fans in 3 months, this company has proven that it does not deserve your money.\n\nWith that out of the way, I did still want to give this game a fair shot as I did not want to simply review bomb this and go on with my life, for as much as I hate the higher ups, the developers, artists and writters working on this game deserve a chance. As of right now I've played the game on mobile for about 3 weeks and have completed quite literally every piece of content currently available.\n\nThis game is a very standard turn based rpg team building gacha game, with most of it's systems being very clearly taken from one of the most popular gacha games of the current day, Honkai Star Rail. The break bar system, the two attacks and an ultimate per character, the character order list, it's all an obvious copy of HSR (that game already being a copy of the Trails series and FFX). In a way that's good, if it ain't broke don't fix it and all that, but Kaiju No8 doesn't do anything particularly special to make me reccomend it over just playing Honkai Star Rail, which has in my opinion a very good story. Just to be done with comparisons, the one thing I do quite like that Kaiju No8 does is their version of the break bar system, instead of it being a bar that is depleted slowly like in HSR, it is instead based on number of attacks that correspond to a certain group of elements and weaknesses, that I think makes it much more strategic to think about your attacks, at certain points you'll find yourself thinking \"should I use this buff skill now or do a regular attack to get closer to breaking the bar\" or \"should I use the ultimate to help break the bar or to do more damage after it's broker\", and that can be quite fun. \n\nNext I should mention the story, if you're a fan of the series already you will probably have a fine time with the new content that is exclusive to this game, the new characters are interesting enough even if they have very little screen time, and the character exclusive little chapters are charming, but I couldn't reccomend this game to anyone who is not already a fan of the series, half of the story content is just a worse retelling of the first season of the anime that uses the in game models to tell the story, and while you can tell good stories with little animation, in this case it just ends up looking weird and cheap.\n\nThe most positive point in my opinion is the graphics and visuals in combat, the fidelity with the style of the original work is impressive and the models and animations are on point there, on that regard I have zero complaints.\n\nNow for the biggest complaint of this game is just how barren it is, overrall for content you have the Story Mode, farming for leveling and other powerups, and the endgame mode which are just high level battles with turn limit based rewards, and that's quite honestly about it, there have been a few events like the kaiju raid, but those just end up becoming an extra daily to skip after the first time you do it. There's also the expedition mode which is this weird roguelike autobattle thing, it's honestly fun but it's a completely separate game and aside from weekly rewards theres not much reason to do it. \nYeah there's no exploration, no unique gamemode that can go infinitely, or even a changing endgame mode, once you're done you're done and you'll be left waiting, which is a very bad look for this game overrall.\n\nIn conclusion, Kaiju No. 8 is an okay game that takes a lot from other sources and does an okay work with it, but the lack of content or anything really special makes it a hard sell for anyone that's not already a fan of the original series.\nConsidering the terrible past of Akatsuki Games, I would only reccomend this game if it blew me away the same way Tribe Nine did, it's okay overrall but it didn't even come close to it, and as such, unless you are a big fan of Kaiju No8, I don't reccomend this game to you. \nWell, come back in 6 months and see if it's still alive and not EoS.",

      "review": "[h3]Don't give Akatsuki your money. Seriously.[/h3]\n\nFirst of all - the delay for the Steam release already makes the situation bad. We didn't have any news about it until almost two weeks have passed, and the statement was literally \"we didn't finish making the port\". (the Steam page of Kaiju8 game and their official socials still have \"coming soon\" in descriptions, they didn't even bother). Their communication department is awful, and have been like this for a while with the previous games too. Late underwhelming character teasers, no proper marketing, no proper patch notes, lack of interactions with the community, nearly no support feedback.\nThe port itself isn't that good either, if you are interested. No advanced graphics options, no higher resolution for the cutscenes or sprites, controls are the same as in any of your average mobile ports: you can \"tap\", and... Yeah, that's kinda it. No keyboard shortcuts. Plus there are some annoying things such as jitter effect on the models and forced lack of smoothing even on \"max quality\" setting. You can't disable the effects or make the quality better, just as mentioned above. Not to mention the PC only players are missing out on an entire month of resources, and will NOT receive any compensation ever, nor did we get any sort of celebration for the PC release. PC only players, who were excited for the release in August, are now in an active disadvantage in terms of progression and rewards. If you wanted to get a unit that was released for mobile only just a few weeks ago - too bad. Their banner is gone, wait for a rerun.\n\n[u]Now to the actual game.[/u]\n\n[b]Story[/b] - since I haven't interacted with the ip before, I can't judge how faithful it is. My apologies, will have to skip this part.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b] - it's hsr, plain and simple. Not like it's bad, you can have some fun with it. But the UI is quite confusing, skill buttons lack information (you'll have to hold character icons to see the detailed skill info), no turn indicator (it only shows in fierce battle) which makes it hard to manage the buffs, AI for the auto is kind of dumb, spamming the skill even if it's not needed, and the animations are too damn long (and lack impact sometimes). X2 speed doesn't help much.\n\n[b]Graphics[/b] - just as told in the Steam release rent, it's not good for a PC port. Character models are decently done (but lack emotions and have awful lipsync), their animations are smooth (for the most part, story cutscenes are kind of awkward), and the animations do get frequently re-used (attack and follow-up animations are the same, ult animations get re-used in the story, gacha animation literally being the same as protag's ult but slightly shinier). I still respect those responsible for the actual art part, both 2D and 3D. They did their best, just probably weren't given enough time.\n\n[b]Progression[/b] - one of the most scammy parts. If you log in once a day - you are missing out on at least half of the resources you could get. But to be fair, if you are a patient casual player that is not bothered by fomo - it probably won't stress you too much and you can ignore this paragraph. If you are not - prepare to log in twice a day and plan your routine, or the progress will suffer.\nThe worst part though is the gear system. You have to literally gamble both for the rarity and the main stat. Doesn't sound too bad as there are no level ups like in hoyo games, but there is no way to guarantee yourself a gold rarity set piece (5 star), and the highest rarity material you can get to make a set piece is purple rarity (4 star). Meaning it only has a CHANCE to get you a gold. Plus the stat reroll is expensive. And did I mention the set bonus actually scales off the set rarity? Not all pieces are gold? You miss out on quite a few percents. \nEach replaced piece gives you \"recycling\" mat, and you can buy more materials for making the equipment, but the whole process is insanely miserable if you even slightly care for the stats and set bonuses.\n\n[b]Music and voices[/b] - it's alright, I guess. Voice acting is actually very good, and I didn't expect less from the professional cast. The soundtrack is a bit generic, but maybe someone could enjoy it. The variety in tracks is not much, so they do get boring after a while...\n\n[b]Content and gacha[/b] - there is no content. You finish the story, you finish fierce battle (aka mirror from hsr), and you have nothing to do aside from maxing all your teams. Gacha income? There is none. The game tricks you into thinking it's generous by giving away characters, dupes, tickets and currency. But once you clear everything mentioned before - you get 1/3 of a pull daily, and nothing more. The \"fierce battle\" updates once a month, but it gives you less than a ten pull, so don't expect miracles. What about the events tho? There are none. Two log-in campaigns that last a week, one \"event\" that doesn't give pull currency. That's all I was met with on PC release. I don't expect improvements from Akatsuki in this department, especially not hoyo levels of creativity or Nikke levels of generousity.\n Speaking of pulls, what about the banners? There is no weapon banner, BUT just because weapon and character are in the same one. 3% for a featured unit, 5% for their featured weapon. No soft pity, no hard pity. BUT the tokens you get for pulling don't expire, similarly to Nikke. You can buy a unit or their signature weapon if you want, but it will take A LOT of pulls (250 for a unit, 150 for a weapon), and you will never have enough of those with an income like that. Game can shower you with random 5 stars on every ten, or it can leave you with nothing after 200. You will never know until you get into this situation. Imagine getting two copies of a weapon in 150 pulls, yet not a single copy of the character it was made for. Couldn't be me of course...\n\n[i]The game overall clearly expects you to spend in order to make any sort of progress. Limited energy with no overflow yet at least two paid stamina packs, battle pass with limited weapons (but not too much value imo) just like in your favourite hoyo games, huge amounts of pulls required to get the character. God forbid if you want to get them to max dupes (that being 6) OR their weapon (4 dupes). It's your average anime IP cashgrab. Looks good on the surface, can be enjoyed, but will occasionally remind you what it is. All gacha games are predatory, but some just hide it better than the others. This one kind of fails at that. Even if you are a fan of Kaiju no.8 - I'd avoid getting into it. Maybe complete the story if you are interested in the new original characters or casual conversations between the cast members in chats, but that's all I can say.[/i]\n\n[u]... And I repeat again. Don't give them your money.[/u]\n\nAkatsuki games have a long history of abandoning their projects, most games living for 3-4 years at best. While the art, voices, music and writing are amazing, their actual management and communication are very bad, and the decisions are clearly made with no long term strategy in mind. The exception that people bring up is DBZ Dokkan, since it still lives, but I need to remind that it wasn't [u]published[/u] by Akatsuki, only developed. Meaning they are not in charge of financial matters and game's lifespan. \n\nI understand you want your favourite franchise to thrive and have good games, I myself lived through a few dead JoJo gachas, but please stay cautious, and don't put too much trust or money into a publisher, that shut their recent game down in FOUR MONTHS with no preparations or warnings either for the fanbase or their own employees. While getting partial refunds, we never got any \"closing party\" for the community, statements on why the game shuts down, or even the characters that ARE ALREADY IN THE GAME INCLUDING SKINS, ITEMS ETC, but not accessible due to rushed EoS.\n[b]If you see ANY live service game PUBLISHED by Akatsuki - turn back.[/b]",

I’d say it’s fine if you’re a fan, but not really worth it for long-term play. Eventually this game will fail like most of the gacha games today.",

Here i though they make kaiju 8 so good but nope it just pretty much a normal to under mid standard gacha game for me. They lucky have dokkan as their main income.",

That's why it makes me all the more sad that this game is the way it is.\n(Though it is playable on Steam Deck and Linux, this is a big W for an gacha game!)\n\nLike I said, it's a gacha game, so you need to play it every day or pull your credit card to get enough rewards to pull all the possible characters. Right now you get enough rewards to unlock every character with his weapon, though the catch is there will come a time where you won't be able to get this many rewards anymore. All the while you may also be out of luck and don't unlock your character at all, as there doesn't seem to be any pity mechanic in this game like ZZZ or Genshin have. So while good enough right now, the gacha system could be improved in my eyes to feel more consistent and less punishing.\n\nYou acquire \"tickets\" for pulls, with one ticket meaning one pull. The other way is using the game's own currency which is similar to ZZZ polychrom. The problem is that tickets and said currency can't be mixed which extends grinding if you want to do ten pulls at once. Grinding energy can add to the padding of the game but there is one mechanic i personally like in which you can skip the combat to get your rewards early. This avoids redundant combat missions, but in case you really like the turned based combat system you can still do it the manual way.\nThe main gripe comes with that you'll need resources to level up your characters, which may result in you just waiting another day to be able to continue the story, which drags it on even more.\n\nAs you can see, the game does have its gripes but if you can overlook the padding mechanics and the waiting periods, there is much fun to be had.",

Thank god. \n\nFor a gacha game, this game offer NOTHING new to the gaming scene. Literally just a cash grab on a dead IP where the manga already concluded. Gameplay is same old turn based action that you have seen in 90% of gacha games of the same genre. Press either attack, skill or use ultimate.\n\nCharacter and weapon are in the same banner? What kind of backward brain rot is this? The reason why Mihoyo split their weapon and character banners is because they know putting both together is a dead system that scream \"GIVE ME YOUR WALLET\".\n\nTribe 9 died for this shit to be born which is a shame. Tribe 9 indeed have a pretty rough start with less overall revenue due to less known IP, but eventually with added contents and more support no doubt will become a big hit.\n\nI give this game another half a year to a year max. It will run out of new characters to gacha on. They will reuse old characters by giving them skins and make players gacha on it.",
