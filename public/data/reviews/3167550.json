Great visuals and idea, a fun idle game while being immensely wholesome and comes with many different types of animals and crossovers\n\nThe decors are cute [and interactive!] and the whole mechanism like breeding compounding coins and the fact that you get to have multiple pastures + do size adjustments of the pasture to fit your screen makes it even more flexible for any display\n\nNot to mention being compatible with both Windows and MacOS! Great game, great value for money, and just so fun\n\nOnly downside - too addictive so I play less now XD",

But I don't mind that this game will last longer, in fact I am aiming for my own additional achievements - to own one rainbow level animal of every specie and colour.\n\nThe game is supposed to stay idle and unobtrusive at the bottom of your screen. But I keep watching my animals and clicking on them. My productivity has dropped dramatically. My future may be ruined.\n\nDefinitely recommend.",

It’s super cheap even without the discount  and the DLCs are really worth it too. 🐑\r\n\r\nIt’s a very cozy game that makes time fly pleasantly. The gameplay is surprisingly addictive, especially in the beginning when you take your animals for walks and unlock new ones through tasks. It doesn’t use much RAM or storage space, which is a nice bonus. 💾\r\n\r\nThe base game is quite short, but with the DLCs there’s plenty of extra content to enjoy.\r\n\r\n💡 Tip: Try to unlock Ropuka as fast as you can. He costs 720 to buy, but if you sell him with one star, you get 9600 back! You can repeat this and basically get unlimited gold 💰\r\n\r\nEnjoy and have fun! 🌿🎮",

In fact, there's enough here to dampen the burn of loosing 3 mil in-game currency in my relentless spree for a highest quality fox or two. I like the attainability of most of the achievements, I would like to have more achievements that weren't so in-game wealth based, though. The animations that are unique to each animal hold the charm of the game entirely. I mean, who doesn't want to click on a red panda going \"Uppies!\" - love it. \n\nWhat I want: More customization. I want more backdrops to choose from/obtain through diversified methods (not just in-game wealth based), ability to size my windows by dragging rather than the built in perspectives (their either too big or too small and not quite right for me). I want to see more to do beyond breeding and pulling the highest quality animal once your past the initial gameplay. It would be neat if there was a character you created to then \"care\" for the pasture(s) (some more personalization).",

However it can get a little bit exhausting and boring because you need money to buy decoration,food,facilities and more animals which the animals gather over time (slow or fast depending on animal and stage of the animal) so you definetly need to keep track and feed said animals. So i´d suggest leveling up your facilities first so at some point you can just keep the game running and the feeding etc. happens automatically. Art work is insanely cute but the execution could definitely be better. None the less still a thumbs up and a must buy if on sale! :)",

There is breeding to get better rarities, so many upgrades, plus decorations to buy, and a good bit of achievements to earn. You can have multiple \"pastures\" so you can hold more and more and more animals and not feel like you have to sell any of your rarest or favorite ones. The DLC is also totally worth it, you can turn any of your pastures into aquariums and keep fish! Which includes sooooo many new species and so many new decorations and items to buy. \r\n\r\nThe devs are super responsive on their discord chat too. Overall, I'm very happy with this game and I would have paid more than they are asking for it. It's basically a full size cozy game hidden in a desktop idle background game.

      "review": "Oh hey! I didn't actually review this and I thought I did long ago. This is such a cute little game, a great idler, something nice to have on the bottom of the screen.\n\nSo the pros:\n- The animals are, largely, cute. \n- If you have a favorite animal, you can get that animal up, through rainbow breeding, to millions of coins if you want. This means there are no animals that 'go to waste'. If you want little corgis running around and red pandas posing: you can do that. It's a lot of work... it's a LOT of hours, but there comes a point where you generate so much gold that this is easily done.\n- The props are pretty nice and the automated stuff will truly automate things with only a bit of loss.\n- The fish DLC is pretty nice, there are a things I'd like with that, but overall I like it. The water effect is cool where it dips where you put your mouse cursor at the top like you are dipping it in water and I like that. \n- The screen options are really nice, you can have a massively zoomed in farm or an itty-bitty farm with all your critters and props. \n- The constant collabs give some really cool creatures, they don't give a ton so they aren't broken, but even cosmetic animals can be bred higher if you want.\n- The color variants are pretty nice and none of them are bad.\n\nThe things I'd like possibly looked at:\n- The water stuff: I'd love more water variants. I posted in the forums but I'd love a water version the bees in the form of hermit crabs, or the broom could be snails. Things like that so we can make a real aquarium.\n- Some of the props actually have use, but I'd love it if all of them did. Like maybe the Corgi jumps on the bench, or the rabbit and cat hide under it.\n\nThe biggest thing I'd like: \n- When there are a bunch of animals on the farm it would be nice if we could click them and milk for coins from the menu, or... and this is a big one: If we could have a little window in the farm where we could have the petting and clicking animations. We have the ability to turn off coin collecting so we can just pet them, but when you have a ton of animals it could be hard. I'd love to have them bigger on my screen, just a little one wandering in a window that I can click on. Think Dogz and Catz from the Windows 3.1 days. I really think this game could have a DLC just for that. Let us raise an animal and then pull that into it's own little sub window with some props, it can wander and we can pet it. In fact, as a punishment, in the pen it doesn't generate gold but can still need feeding and stuff. Imagine chilling with the Capybara just chilling while we pet it but taking up a third of our screen?  \n\nYeah... yeah I'd pay for that. I have, actually, as I bought Dogs and Catz many times. You have so many cute animals here that it could be fun.\n\nThere is a lot I like and very, VERY, little I don't. This isn't just a recommended game as I've actually forced it on friends by sending it to multiple of them. I kind of feel like anyone who likes animals or idlers would like it.",

I didn't realize there is a PUNISHMENT if you don't watch them like a newborn human child. I don't feel like the page description accurately tells you this.\n\nI left it running, went about some stuff in my day, came back to a screen full of poop and all my animals sick.  I couldn't afford medicine, and the only option to heal them is to get them well fed and a clean pasture and they will very, very slowly start to heal.  Too slowly, all the while you need to feed and clean or they won't heal.  They also make no coins during this time.  I left it on intending to return after an hour to clean and feed and hopefully see some improvement in health, but once again I have a life and it was left on too long and now I'm back to poops and 0% health.  Time to uninstall.  $5 down the drain.\n\nI believe you can unlock items that will automate this for you down the line, but I have no desire to grind out hours to that point.\n\nIt's SO cute, but this is not at all what I was looking for.  If the devs add a setting toggle for a \"fun\" experience, ie. no poop, no sickness, no starving etc. just a fun thing you can leave running without maintenance, then I will be back to enjoying cute animals on my screen.  I downloaded this to add some joy, not to give myself another stress :\\",

It's cute but trying to get coins so you can buy more animals and things is time consuming. You need to constantly click on the animals or they will get \"full\" form coins and won't collect anymore. Then you also need to click and drag on them to make them produce more coins. A little too much effort than what I'm looking for when I'm working from home.",
