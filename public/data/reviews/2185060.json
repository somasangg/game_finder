With Museum, the Two Point franchise pivots from business sim to design sim and is all the stronger for it. Being able to create aesthetically pleasing things for the sake of aesthetic pleasure, and having the game reward this, means that I can continue to play each level long after achieving victory and still enjoy it. In Hospital and Campus, once you were making money hand over fist and had no more stars to get there was no real point in playing any longer, but by reducing the number of levels and allowing the player to really build up something that looks and feels amazing, play can go on indefinitely. Kudosh to Two Point Studios for their best franchise entry yet; now please let me choose what exhibits I'm recovering once I've Pristine-surveyed a point of interest, this (and a few more varied generic decorations) would make it much easier to customize museums exactly how I want.",

      "review": "NOTE: This is for version 7.0 Of the game\n\nHello friends,\n\nToday I will be reviewing the game Two Point Museum. This game is part of the two point series which includes the two point hospital and two point campus. This is the third game made by two point studios.\n\n\nBasically in this game, the player is a curator of a failing museum and must make it successful to make money. This is easier said than done, as the player must take expeditions to find new exhibits to place in the museum, then research information about exhibits to gain knowledge about them. Also, each exhibits can be upgraded, but it relies on the quality of the exhibit. Pristine exhibits allow you to upgrade three times, while lesser ones have only two or one upgrade slots. Not only can you have exhibits, but players can also put aquariums in their museums to feature fish, and with the newest upgrade, live animals. Although the newest dlc is currently not out yet, the developers provided a sample museum players can play on the map.\n\nBy having players develop the best museums, they can advance to other museums on the map and do the same thing. Each museum has it's own goals and trials, so players must learn to cope with new challenges. The hardest museums are the pop up ones, where players have a time limit to do something in them, such as having enough money from farming fish, or having enough buzz to get enough money.\n\n\nPROS:\n\n- A new game in the two point series featuring museum building.\n\n- Players must make a museum successful.\n\n- Sandbox mode and campaign mode.\n\n- Many obstacles will stand in players ways, including criminals trying to steal museum exhibits.\n\n- Cartoony graphics and silly exhibits. Many of the exhibits include silly things they are named or how they look. \n\n- New content will still be coming for the game, including new dlc's at this time.\n\n- A seasonal map only open during seasonal events. Last one was for Halloween. Once you open them, you can keep items and decorations.\n\n- Some of the maps are hard called pop up museums, and one museum called Pointy Mountain.\n\n\n\nCONS:\n\n- Some bugs with pathfinding in the museum maps. It causes people to get stuck, especially if you max out the size of the museum.\n\n- Associated with the DLC Fantasy Finds, there is a bug when small races use watering fountains. The graphic makes them go into the water fountain.\n\n- Some forum users also have reported several other bugs, but i have not run into these bugs personally.\n\n- Some people are mad the pre order items and not enough floors are available to design their museums.\n\n\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes, although there are some bugs that need to be fixed, the game is quite fun if you like micro managing sims. This means players need to hire staff, build museum parts, watch out for criminals. The game can be that addictive \"one more minute\" kind of game if players are into this sim. Many of the games exhibits are also silly looking. This game does not take itself serious, but can be hard depending on the level of the players skills. So players who like micro managing things and building and even designing things may like this game.",

      "review": "Really High Quality Experience!!! Over 100 hours of fun for me.\n\nMy first impression was that the variety & depth in game systems is much improved from Two Point Campus.\n \nEach museum type has different exihibit mechanics, different balances of requirements for each world map, and unique quests for getting stars for each museum. \n\nThe game juggles your attention, which keeps things engaging to me. Whenever one system lulls in the progression you can make on it, you can turn your attention to another game mechanic, while the others pick up. Hunting for actifacts, plot driven checklists to improve your museum rating and unlock content, the mastery of exhibit quality & knowledge, constantly expanding and decorating your museum, managing your staff and guests needs, preparing for future exhibitions, executing your ideas for interesting exhibit curations, improving the efficiency of the museum... wowie!\n\nBoth efficiency and aesthetics must be considered to make a popular (and crime free) museum, which I like. It's definitely on the easy side of a management simulation, but is juuuuuuuuust consiquential enough that it doesn't feel like a sandbox (a feeling I got with both Planet Zoo & Planet Coaster).\n\nThe attention to detail in the art direction is a big plus for me. I'm delighted and charmed by guests, exhibits, and the amazing audio from the DJs. The stylized Physical Based Rendering and lighting is so well done; it makes me just want to admire how beautiful everything looks. The Two Point world is so fun and goofy, and it is fantastically executed in this game!!!\n\nI'm on a second run of the game now from the ground up, and I look forward to new DLCs, which have so far been very high quality too (Fantasy Finds) !",

It’s easy to pick up but surprisingly deep once you start digging into it. And the humor? Peak Two Point. I caught myself grinning at random animations more times than I’d like to admit.\n\nIf you loved Two Point Hospital or Two Point Campus, this one is a no-brainer.

Other than that I think the exhibit bonuses are done right with a grading system, the way you capture pieces of exhibits through expeditions is really addicting pushing you to try to complete a set. Overall a good solid game, I haven't personally experienced any bugs however I can't say for certain when it comes to NPCs and AI if there are no bugs there.

I have played some other Two Point games and enjoyed them but always bounced off for reasons that are hard to describe. Because of this I was skeptical of this game and hesitated to buy it despite the overwhelming praise it was getting. That lasted until a night of quiet contemplation and solo drinking in my office where I desperately needed a specific experience, a grounding experience that can only be achieved by a balanced, simple but deep management simulation. I added Two Points Museum to my cart and stumbled through the installation process. I instantly could tell that, while familiar, there was something different about this game compared to its predecessors. The systems made sense, the aesthetics and design, which admittedly are not my cup of tea, were cohesive and contributed to the atmosphere, the campaign had satisfying progression that was not just a glorified tutorial for sandbox mode. In short, if you are on the fence about this game, and you like management sims, go ahead and buy this playboy, you deserve it.",

At least with me and my play style I found the difficulty levels the best in this game out of the TP series.\nThe plot lines at each museum is another layer that makes game progression fun. The exhibits and exploration areas/worlds are also much more vast and expansive than I would have expected. Definitely not a game you’d get bored of quickly.\n\nHoping for more museums in the future as well as functional items. I find that with things like snack and drink machines, decor within rooms, and useable decor items like those in the staff room that’s there’s not a ton of variety so I’m always using the same items.

      "review": "Like all Two Point games, Museum is incredibly addictive. Its really satisfying getting max-level exhibits, and arranging your museum to display it all. There is quite a broad range of exhibits and mechanics, too. You start out with fairly basic fossils, but later you unlock aquariums that you can decorate and populate with weird fish, scientific devices you can build and upgrade, and strange space anomalies that you have puzzle out to unlock their full potential. Every map comes with its own theme and set of mechanics, and once a map is unlocked you can mix and match exhibits in the same museum.\n\nThe music is catchy and never gets dull - though that might be helped by the radio-like interspersions from in-game DJs, which range from funny to hilarious. The general humour in the game is on-point (on-Two-Point, if you will, ohohoho). \n\nRarely the museum decoration and customization options might not gel perfectly, but there is such a breadth of ways to design and decorate your museums that some small technical bugs cannot be avoided, and are usually fixed by just deleting something and replacing it.\n\nMy only real complaint about the gameplay is that there is no way to immediately repeat an expedition - each time you have to set up the expedition from scratch, meaning opening the map, choosing a location, choosing your staff from the staff list, choosing an item, etc. It would be nice if you could just click a button to \"redo\" the expedition with the same staff/loadout if you didn't quite get what you wanted the first time.\n\nOn the whole, the game is very good and highly addictive. And with the wealth of free updates and DLC the game has and is going to get, I can see me sinking many more hours into it.",

      "review": "Fun, but gets grindy\r\n\r\nThe latest entry in the Two Point series follows their now-familiar pattern of whimsical sim-style games. This time with museums.\r\n\r\nAnd look, it is fun to play. If you’ve played other Two Point games, you’ll likely get exactly what you expect here. If you've played their previous games, you’ll almost certainly like this one… to a point (see below).\r\n\r\nSeeing Stars…\r\n\r\nOnce you reach the 4–5 star levels, the game introduces unnecessary grind. Aside from placing exhibits and tweaking the museum layout to your liking, you’re mostly hit with 'meet these conditions and get a cookie' style tasks through expeditions. They start out ok and remain so for the most part, but eventually the conditions just become irritating rather than challenging. 'Hey, have a combined skill level of 30, otherwise the people you send will go missing!' (start again with a new staff member) Ha, take that player, how fun. No. not fun.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because the systems in place to get your staff to higher levels (and the time invested to do so), is in itself a bit grindy, or, clunky to achieve. It’s a weak part of the game. Want to level up a staff member? Ah-ha, make the player go to a ‘special’ expedition location, 15 times! They will love doing that for x30 staff members, what joy they will experience! No. No joy. \r\n\r\nFrom a gameplay perspective, the loop is 'trade time to get XP' but they’ve added unnecessary clicking and repetition. Let's make them click 20 times, per trip, to do it. I think functionally, you could of used the same trade, but instead had in museum items (in the staff room or training room), where staff could just sit and ‘learn’ (get xp), or remove a curses, etc, without the need to fluff about so much. Same result, less busywork. At this point the game started to overstay its welcome. Do I really want to sink another 10 hours just to finish the 5-star level, while playing at max speed, repeating the same loop to satisfy an irritating condition?\r\n\r\nNah. Not really.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn point (pun intended) with the expedition theme, they make you do the same thing again, but this time for exhibits, in the form of exhibit ‘quality’. This makes little sense. Again, why force the player to go do the same thing, but this time you got a slightly better version of the thing you already have! Yes, that was awesome! *blink*, *blink*. How about no, it’s not. Again, the mechanics are there, there is knowledge system, etc. Instead, I would have again preferred an ‘in museum’ system, where perhaps your experts could study the exhibits in order to unlock both knowledge, which in turn provided a higher tier of quality. The ‘go back again 20 times’ idea works when it’s a multi-part display that requires multiple pieces sure, but otherwise what am I supposed to be imagining here? The expert flys to a location where there is an endless supply of the same exhibit, and for some reason they are unable to identify what the good one looks like, unless they go back 25 times?\r\n\r\n\r\nLook, I could go on,  but hopefully the point is clear.\r\n\r\nThe core gameplay and concept are absolutely there. The satire, the whimsical tone, the animations, the fake radio ads, all of it adds charm and character. But please: why do developers think grind mechanics  make a game better? This is a full release title. Give players a smooth, sensible gameplay flow all the way to the end.\r\n\r\nYour model is clearly to release DLC with new museums and content, and that’s fine. If the base game is fun, people will happily buy more. Just because a movie could be five hours long doesn’t mean it should be. Sometimes the same story, or in this case, gameplay loop, can be just as impactful in one....",

      "review": "Fantastic game, great for casual play, very relaxing with lots to discover (and add to your museum!). If you didn't like the wave-format of TPH and TPC then fear not, because Museum opts more for a continuous sense of progression as you tweak and update and expand your museum. Instead of dozens of levels restricted to 3 tiers of goals, Museum gives you a handful of Museums, each with a specific theme in mind at the outset (though you can definitely grab Science and Necromancy exhibits for your Deep Sea museum!). You bounce between them as you gain stars, and each has a special mystery/reveal that you're trying to solve. It's a refreshing update to the classic format.\n\nALSO, the Developers are EXTREMELY active with this game. There are free timed seasonal events for time-limited rewards (they will return in the future for those with FOMO), free crossover digiverses with games like Dredge and Vampire Survivors, and even some free content updates that are not exclusive to DLC like previous Two Point games.\n\nMy only complaint is a relatively minor one, which is that the readily obvious humor of Hospital and Campus is much more subdued in Museum. Maybe it's because I'm used to it, but there's just less flavor text, fewer visual effects on many things (outside of certain sets of exhibits, I friggin' LOVE the Possessed Objects exhibits), and it feels a little more mature/serious despite how whacky things are. \n\nDefinitely get this game if you enjoyed previous Two Point games or you want a relatively simple business management game with a ton to explore.",

There is something about the flow, the mechanics, the work-reward and humor that hooks me in Hospital that are missing in the other two.\n\nI have no complaints about the design or execution of the game from a technical or graphical standpoint; I just could not get into it; after a brief time, I realized I was just going through the motions, and I wasn't enjoying it.",

      "review": "tldr: feels like the game's hiding important info from me for the luls, I'm over it\r\n\r\nSomehow, my museum is unsustainable in the second map and I don't understand why. I check the graphs, check what visitors say and the satisfaction and there's just no explanation, apparently I sink most money into wages, but my staff are complaining that their wages are too small. Meanwhile, I've got like 80 people there at all times yet after raising ticket price I got 200$ more income, which makes no sense.\r\n\r\nAlso, someone gets possessed - which I only learn by seeing visitors run around of course - but I have no indication who it is, I can pause and check staff but even there it says nothing, then I can click on each staff member but then the window is so big it obscures the person it centers on, and their profile doesn't say they're possessed, so if I want to check, I have to close the window and zoom in so I can find the staff member amidst visitors... I'll just play a different game, thanks.",

I really, really, really, really, dislike FOMO mechanics - cosmetics locked behind specific out-of-game interactions, like three now entirely unobtainable costumes, especially. \nI debated continuing playing for two weeks but knew deep down I wouldn't be able to stand the fact that I literally missed out on content because I didn't watch someone I didn't want to watch play the game.",

      "review": "[h2]Gacha/lootbox simulator[/h2]\nIt's repetitive from the very beginning. You don't manage much.\nBack then i was glad to get Theme Hospital remake. And then studio made even cooler Two Point Campus. So the hype for Museum was real. I bought it and while you get used to mechanics you get that \"novelty\" sensation. But it got already stale after 2 hours.\nBasically all grind consists of sending crew(s) on expedition(s), getting random thing, placing it. Repeat. And don't forget to throw bunch of decorations.\n\nHospital and Campus get repetitive too, but way later than Museum. In Museum there's not much of variety in gameplay. All strat is to send more expeditions. In Campus and Hospital player has some ways to experiment and explore and have fun while playing games. Museum is not fun. Maybe for kids it would be.",

I was signed in while playing Two Point Campus and it signed me out, I could never sign in to Two Point Museum. It claims it can't connect, I should check my internet connection. Blame the player, especially when this is an ongoing problem on your end, for YEARS.\r\n\r\nFix that.",
