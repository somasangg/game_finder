You can spend hours hunting, gathering, and making potions, or jump straight into massive 50-player raids and castle sieges where betrayal is as common as loot drops. The classes are solid—warrior swings big swords, sorcerer nukes everything, Taoist heals your incompetent friends, and the lancer is basically a mobile Swiss Army knife. Stunning graphics, fluid combat, and a free-for-all loot system that turns friendly encounters into chaos. 10/10, I’ve never felt simultaneously zen and terrified while farming mushrooms.",
