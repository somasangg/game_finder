      "review": "One of the best sim racing experiences you can get, even years later.\n\nAssetto Corsa might be getting old, but it’s aged like fine wine - especially once you dive into the modding scene. The base game alone is solid but a bit barebones by today’s standards. The real magic happens once you install Content Manager and Custom Shaders Patch (CSP). Those two completely transform the game -better lighting, weather, physics tweaks, smoother performance, and tons of quality-of-life features. It honestly feels like a new title after that.\n\nThen you’ve got the mods - cars, tracks, visuals, sound packs, everything you can imagine. The community support is insane, and there’s something for every kind of driver, from casual track day enthusiasts to full-on sim racers. You can go from drifting in Japan to racing GT3s at Spa, or even just cruising through city maps at sunset.\n\nIf you’re playing on a controller, don’t worry - there are some amazing Gamepad FX scripts that completely change how Assetto Corsa feels without a wheel.\n\nFor grip racing, there’s Advanced Gamepad Assist, which smooths out steering, reduces twitchiness, and gives you way more precision when braking and cornering. It makes racing with a controller feel natural and consistent.\n\nFor drifting, there’s a different script called A7 Assist, designed specifically for smoother countersteering. It makes it much easier to catch slides and hold long drifts without the car snapping or feeling unpredictable.\n\nBoth are absolute game-changers depending on your driving style.\n\nPerformance-wise, it runs great on most modern PCs, and the visuals can look stunning once you tune everything with CSP and a good graphics preset (would definitely check out Pure if I were you)\n\nAll in all, Assetto Corsa is one of those games that grows with you - the deeper you go, the better it gets. It’s not perfect out of the box, but with the right setup, it’s easily one of the best and most flexible sim racing platforms ever made.",

Creating servers to play with friends require some techy knowledge, you cannot change cars on the go and have to go through loading screens, the essential content manager has LOADS of settings one might get overwhelmed by. Youll be watching quite a bit of youtube guides to setup a traffic system if you want that. But once you get all of these out of the way, and get used to the setup process then it really becomes one of the best driving experiences you could get.

However, none of that overshadows the reason this game is still played a decade later: the driving experience is outstanding.\n\nCars feel alive and responsive, and the handling remains one of the most authentic in the genre. Even after ten years, the physics are still among the best available. Every lap delivers that satisfying feedback where the car talks to you through the track, the force feedback, and the subtle shift in grip.\n\nOn top of that, Assetto Corsa offers full mod support, which continues to extend its life far beyond what most racing titles manage. Modding should always be standard on PC, and here it shines.\n\nI hope Assetto Corsa Evo will bring modern features and infrastructure to the table, while keeping the core driving experience that made the original special. If it can achieve that, it might just set the bar again.",

It's extremely active, you can drive pretty much any car you want on pretty much any track you want, but with some caveats (don't always expect dev quality in mods).

      "review": "I absolutely love this game. I recently got really into F1, and I have always loved racing, but never knew where to begin. This game drops you in, there's no free roam no story, just set up a race and start driving. Here are some pros and cons about the game that you should know before buying.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[olist]\n[*]This game is one of (if not) the cheapest racing games that have realistic racing and racing physics. It strives on track, but it's fine on rally courses, and karting tracks too. I know the newest F1 game is 5x the price of this on sale and for $4.99 the game gives you so much. I do recommend getting the Ultimate Edition, as it will give you the most out of what you want, and for less than $20 (on sale) it's a steal.\n[*] Has Good Graphics, and if you want more you can use mods to better the lighting, but it's not built for it so the game may crash.\n[*]Super Customizable. You can race anything, you could race F1 with GT3 cars, drive karts on GT Cup tracks, etc. You have so much control over your system/game and your races.\n[*]AC's Tracks are great! and you can find good mods for any track they don't have. It helps with learning a track before a race you are going to watch. You can try and set your fastest lap and see it in relation to the real drivers.\n[*]I'm not a racer, but the physics feel and act very well. You \n[/olist]\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[olist]\n[*]It's not great by it's self, You won't be able to easily race a custom race without mods. If you want to race F1, Nascar, any newer class or car models (Like Porsche 911 GT3 RS or any 992, etc.), or things like rally you have to use a mod manager and download mods.\n[*]Not the best for multiplayer/online, if you want to play with friends or others it's just not the best. The AI is pretty good, and very customizable with the difficulty, sometimes (mainly with mods) ai can act weirdly or not be the best, but overall it's pretty good.\n[*]Not good for Keyboard players. You need a wheel to have fun with this game. But, with a cheap wheel it's still feels good and realistic.\n[/olist]\n[i][Note: This is not the full list of Pros and Cons just somethings to think about][/i]\n\nIf you are interested in racing, but don't want to buy iRacing because of it's super expensive model, this game is for you. If you want to buy F1 25 (or the newest version), but you don't want to pay for such a high price for a game that doesn't have much stuff, this game is for you (with mods). I can't recommend this game enough, it's super affordable and a great introduction into circuit racing and way better than EA and Xbox's expensive racing games (Forza).",

The detailed physics engine, laser-scanned tracks, and deep car setup options come alive when paired with proper wheel hardware, delivering an authentic and deeply rewarding driving simulation. With a wheel, every nuance of the car’s handling is felt, making each lap an immersive experience.\n\nHowever, trying to play Assetto Corsa with a gamepad feels frustrating and limiting. The precise control required for braking, throttle, and steering is difficult with analog sticks and triggers, often making the game nearly unplayable for all but the most casual racing fans. Assetto Corsa truly shines with a wheel; anything else misses the soul of the simulation. If you’re serious about racing games, do yourself a favor and experience it as it was meant to be: with a wheel!",

However, the community of this game is very toxic. If you don't have a 500-1k€ plastic wheel base with ffb stronger than the million of newton that a single space shuttle can make, a 350€ separate wheel, 150€ clutch pedal, 200€ shifter and 500€ cockpit (no seat included), then you shouldn't be \"allowed\" to play this video game according to them. Last time I checked, 1700€ is the minimum salary in majority of European countries.\n\nAnd also, majority of modders paywall their mods behind a subscription fee. This pratice is very common and is actively encouraged in the community.\n\nTL;DR: If you play on gamepad, keyboard or any cheap alternative to wheels, avoid playing this video game UNLESS you want to get martyred by gatekeepers that can't differentiate reality and fictional races with fictional cars and tracks.",

If there wasn't any kind of support for mods, the game would have aged poorly.\n\nRegarding the modding community, they have outdone everything the developers have done for this game. However, the community of this game is very toxic. If you don't have a 500-1k€ plastic wheel base with ffb stronger than the million of newton that a single space shuttle can make, a 350€ separate wheel, 150€ clutch pedal, 200€ shifter and 500€ cockpit (no seat included), then you shouldn't be \"allowed\" to play this video game according to them. Last time I checked, 1700€ is the minimum salary in majority of European countries.\n\nAnd also, majority of modders paywall their mods behind a subscription fee. This pratice is very common and is actively encouraged in the community.\n\nTL;DR: If you play on gamepad, keyboard or any cheap alternative to wheels, avoid playing this video game UNLESS you want to get martyred by gatekeepers that can't differentiate reality and fictional races with fictional cars and tracks.",

You can never recover from a bad move and just have to wait to fall to 2nd gear again. If that wasn't bad enough, the game automatticly downshifts for you in manual.
