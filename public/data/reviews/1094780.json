      "review": "tl;dr - Very, very exceptional game. Better than RF4 and Fishing Planet in most ways, with RF4's deeper simulation mechanics to the fishing itself really being the only thing I see that this game doesn't do better than both of those. Well worth the money, just be prepared to watch some YouTube tutorials if you haven't played the other two because the in-game tutorial here isn't great.\n\nAs someone with hundreds of hours in the other two big online fishing games, I know that most people that are curious about trying Fisher Online are probably former players of at least one of those, so I'll do my best to relate the biggest things that I see as positives here and why I've had a blast in my 50 hours of play on Fisher Online so far.\n\nFirst off - Costs. Compared to the other two, there is a gate price here. You can't just jump in to check it out for free, but what about after that? Well, with both of the other two games, I found myself buying premium subscriptions within days of trying them out, not because I necessarily wanted to, but because I felt that meaningful progress was nearly impossible without it. Here, I have not felt pushed to purchase VIP at all; in fact, I honestly don't even know what perks VIP offers, that's how little I have felt the need to get it. I likely will at some point simply to support the developer if nothing else, but that's a HUGE plus for me. Additionally, there aren't premium baits/lures, and very few premium rigs which, as far as I can tell, mostly focus on bonus XP rather than being the best gear you can get. I've even taken part in some of the automated daily tournaments and have been able to place very well, so there's not a P2W aspect here for those either. The value for just picking up the games (and if you're into those maps and their fish species, the DLC) is great, and you won't feel pressured to throw a bunch of additional money at it. Valuation I'm going to give a 9/10; I would give it a 10/10 if it had a demo or something along those lines that would give players that want to try the game out a way to do so to see if it's for them or not.\n\nNext, the fishing mechanics themselves... I'd put this in the middle of the other two games. The fishing here is very fun; it's not super arcady, but it's not to the full sim level with the fluiditity of motion of rod control you'd see in RF4.  You have trolling from boats, spin fishing, feeder fishing, float fishing, deep sea fishing, and fly fishing (the last of which you won't find in the other two games). I haven't gotten to try deep sea fishing yet, but the rest all work very well and are fun, but there are a few minor things (like less rod control while casting or when operating telescopic rods) that hold it back from top grades here. By no means bad, but I'd put it at an 8/10 here.\n\nNext, content variety (maps, species, tackle, etc) - There is a great amount of diversity here in bodies of water and fish species, but the amount of tackle and bait is slimmer than the other two games. Some may see this as a negative, but I actually find it to be a positive because it means there's less bloat to have to deal with. There's enough variety to that you can experiment and try different things and different techniques, but not so much that you're spending more time trying 50 different pieces of tackle at a spot to find something that works. This applies to rods and reels, as well; instead of there beings a huge variety, there's a much more narrow variety. Again, this may be viewed as a negative for some, but I see it as a positive because I'm able to upgrade all forms of fishing much more efficiently rather than stressing about whether this reel or that reel is better for my use case, or having to spend all the money I get in-game on minor upgrades and the bigger setups feeling farther and farther out of reach. [EDIT] I originally gave this an 8/10, but after seeing the shop contents of the level 22 map, I'm revising that upwards as the amount of gear variety for specific purposes jumps up drastically there. I'll give this an 9/10 (updated from 8/10).\n\nA big question I see in other reviews: Is it grindy? Well, it sounds like level 40+ gets pretty grindy, but I can't speak for that as I am currently level 21. But I have not felt like I have had to grind at all, and that applies to both earning money and gaining experience. I've been focusing on knocking out quests I want to do and fishing in places I have fun fishing, and I am progressing just fine. I've also been able to get plenty of great rigs setup and never feel like I am stressing for money to pay, whereas the other games I constantly feel like I am barely keeping any money because all of it would go to repairs, travel costs, bait, etc. I'm giving Fisher Online a 10/10 here, I am able to focus on having fun and fishing rather than visitng active/preset hot spots to get as much XP/coin per hour as possible just to make minor progress.\n\nWhat about non-fishing content? This game features gathering and crafting, and they aren't tied to skills you have to grind out, and they aren't money pits. I've enjoyed making my own baits and making things to sell for the market for additional coin. There's also automated tournaments daily, which can reward XP and tournament coins (which can be used for various tackle or converted to other coin types that are used for other types of things). You've got boats and land vehicles to get around the large maps. The only thing I think it falls a bit short on is making your own lures and flies. I'll give the non-fishing content a 9/10 here; adding lure and fly crafting would make it a 10/10 easily.\n\n[EDIT] New amazing discovery: Via the help of a mod in the workshop, I have discovered that this game almost gives you the multiplayer experience of Fishing Planet in that you can see your friends in your group on the map with you. You can see their gear, the vehicles their own, etc.; you just don't see the fish they're fighting. But that's a HUGE game changer for me, as I enjoy playing this game with friends and being able to follow each other as we look for spots or compete in tournaments just adds a whole new layer of awesome to the game.\n\nOverall, Fisher Online is great. Its biggest negative, in my opinion, is a very lackluster tutorial. If you are coming from the other two games, most of the controls and systems will be fairly intuitive for you, but if you've never played either of them before, the tutorial here is not going to do a good job setting you up for playing the game effectively; be prepared to look up some YouTube tutorials in that case. I can whole-heartedly recommend Fisher Online as someone who has been itching for a fishing game again but was just too burnt out on the insanely grindy nature of the other two.\n\n[EDIT] Fixed some typos, updated the review on the content variety based on visiting the level 22 map and seeing how much more gear options open up at that point, and added an additional blurb about a multiplayer mod that makes the game SO much better if you play with friends.",

I'd put this in the middle of the other two games. The fishing here is very fun; it's not super arcady, but it's not to the full sim level with the fluiditity of motion of rod control you'd see in RF4.  You have trolling from boats, spin fishing, feeder fishing, float fishing, deep sea fishing, and fly fishing (the last of which you won't find in the other two games). I haven't gotten to try deep sea fishing yet, but the rest all work very well and are fun, but there are a few minor things (like less rod control while casting or when operating telescopic rods) that hold it back from top grades here. By no means bad, but I'd put it at an 8/10 here.\n\nNext, content variety (maps, species, tackle, etc) - There is a great amount of diversity here in bodies of water and fish species, but the amount of tackle and bait is slimmer than the other two games. Some may see this as a negative, but I actually find it to be a positive because it means there's less bloat to have to deal with. There's enough variety to that you can experiment and try different things and different techniques, but not so much that you're spending more time trying 50 different pieces of tackle at a spot to find something that works. This applies to rods and reels, as well; instead of there beings a huge variety, there's a much more narrow variety. Again, this may be viewed as a negative for some, but I see it as a positive because I'm able to upgrade all forms of fishing much more efficiently rather than stressing about whether this reel or that reel is better for my use case, or having to spend all the money I get in-game on minor upgrades and the bigger setups feeling farther and farther out of reach. [EDIT] I originally gave this an 8/10, but after seeing the shop contents of the level 22 map, I'm revising that upwards as the amount of gear variety for specific purposes jumps up drastically there. I'll give this an 9/10 (updated from 8/10).\n\nA big question I see in other reviews: Is it grindy? Well, it sounds like level 40+ gets pretty grindy, but I can't speak for that as I am currently level 21. But I have not felt like I have had to grind at all, and that applies to both earning money and gaining experience. I've been focusing on knocking out quests I want to do and fishing in places I have fun fishing, and I am progressing just fine. I've also been able to get plenty of great rigs setup and never feel like I am stressing for money to pay, whereas the other games I constantly feel like I am barely keeping any money because all of it would go to repairs, travel costs, bait, etc. I'm giving Fisher Online a 10/10 here, I am able to focus on having fun and fishing rather than visitng active/preset hot spots to get as much XP/coin per hour as possible just to make minor progress.\n\nWhat about non-fishing content? This game features gathering and crafting, and they aren't tied to skills you have to grind out, and they aren't money pits. I've enjoyed making my own baits and making things to sell for the market for additional coin. There's also automated tournaments daily, which can reward XP and tournament coins (which can be used for various tackle or converted to other coin types that are used for other types of things). You've got boats and land vehicles to get around the large maps. The only thing I think it falls a bit short on is making your own lures and flies. I'll give the non-fishing content a 9/10 here; adding lure and fly crafting would make it a 10/10 easily.\n\n[EDIT] New amazing discovery: Via the help of a mod in the workshop, I have discovered that this game almost gives you the multiplayer experience of Fishing Planet in that you can see your friends in your group on the map with you. You can see their gear, the vehicles their own, etc.; you just don't see the fish they're fighting. But that's a HUGE game changer for me, as I enjoy playing this game with friends and being able to follow each other as we look for spots or compete in tournaments just adds a whole new layer of awesome to the game.\n\nOverall, Fisher Online is great. Its biggest negative, in my opinion, is a very lackluster tutorial. If you are coming from the other two games, most of the controls and systems will be fairly intuitive for you, but if you've never played either of them before, the tutorial here is not going to do a good job setting you up for playing the game effectively; be prepared to look up some YouTube tutorials in that case. I can whole-heartedly recommend Fisher Online as someone who has been itching for a fishing game again but was just too burnt out on the insanely grindy nature of the other two.\n\n[EDIT] Fixed some typos, updated the review on the content variety based on visiting the level 22 map and seeing how much more gear options open up at that point, and added an additional blurb about a multiplayer mod that makes the game SO much better if you play with friends.",

Better than RF4 and Fishing Planet in most ways, with RF4's deeper simulation mechanics to the fishing itself really being the only thing I see that this game doesn't do better than both of those. Well worth the money, just be prepared to watch some YouTube tutorials if you haven't played the other two because the in-game tutorial here isn't great.\n\nAs someone with hundreds of hours in the other two big online fishing games, I know that most people that are curious about trying Fisher Online are probably former players of at least one of those, so I'll do my best to relate the biggest things that I see as positives here and why I've had a blast in my 50 hours of play on Fisher Online so far.\n\nFirst off - Costs. Compared to the other two, there is a gate price here. You can't just jump in to check it out for free, but what about after that? Well, with both of the other two games, I found myself buying premium subscriptions within days of trying them out, not because I necessarily wanted to, but because I felt that meaningful progress was nearly impossible without it. Here, I have not felt pushed to purchase VIP at all; in fact, I honestly don't even know what perks VIP offers, that's how little I have felt the need to get it. I likely will at some point simply to support the developer if nothing else, but that's a HUGE plus for me. Additionally, there aren't premium baits/lures, and very few premium rigs which, as far as I can tell, mostly focus on bonus XP rather than being the best gear you can get. I've even taken part in some of the automated daily tournaments and have been able to place very well, so there's not a P2W aspect here for those either.

I'll give this an 9/10 (updated from 8/10).\n\nA big question I see in other reviews: Is it grindy? Well, it sounds like level 40+ gets pretty grindy, but I can't speak for that as I am currently level 21. But I have not felt like I have had to grind at all, and that applies to both earning money and gaining experience. I've been focusing on knocking out quests I want to do and fishing in places I have fun fishing, and I am progressing just fine. I've also been able to get plenty of great rigs setup and never feel like I am stressing for money to pay, whereas the other games I constantly feel like I am barely keeping any money because all of it would go to repairs, travel costs, bait, etc. I'm giving Fisher Online a 10/10 here, I am able to focus on having fun and fishing rather than visitng active/preset hot spots to get as much XP/coin per hour as possible just to make minor progress.\n\nWhat about non-fishing content? This game features gathering and crafting, and they aren't tied to skills you have to grind out, and they aren't money pits. I've enjoyed making my own baits and making things to sell for the market for additional coin. There's also automated tournaments daily, which can reward XP and tournament coins (which can be used for various tackle or converted to other coin types that are used for other types of things). You've got boats and land vehicles to get around the large maps. The only thing I think it falls a bit short on is making your own lures and flies. I'll give the non-fishing content a 9/10 here; adding lure and fly crafting would make it a 10/10 easily.\n\n[EDIT] New amazing discovery: Via the help of a mod in the workshop, I have discovered that this game almost gives you the multiplayer experience of Fishing Planet in that you can see your friends in your group on the map with you. You can see their gear, the vehicles their own, etc.; you just don't see the fish they're fighting. But that's a HUGE game changer for me, as I enjoy playing this game with friends and being able to follow each other as we look for spots or compete in tournaments just adds a whole new layer of awesome to the game.\n\nOverall, Fisher Online is great. Its biggest negative, in my opinion, is a very lackluster tutorial. If you are coming from the other two games, most of the controls and systems will be fairly intuitive for you, but if you've never played either of them before, the tutorial here is not going to do a good job setting you up for playing the game effectively; be prepared to look up some YouTube tutorials in that case. I can whole-heartedly recommend Fisher Online as someone who has been itching for a fishing game again but was just too burnt out on the insanely grindy nature of the other two.\n\n[EDIT] Fixed some typos, updated the review on the content variety based on visiting the level 22 map and seeing how much more gear options open up at that point, and added an additional blurb about a multiplayer mod that makes the game SO much better if you play with friends.",

      "review": "tl;dr - Very, very exceptional game. Better than RF4 and Fishing Planet in most ways, with RF4's deeper simulation mechanics to the fishing itself really being the only thing I see that this game doesn't do better than both of those. Well worth the money, just be prepared to watch some YouTube tutorials if you haven't played the other two because the in-game tutorial here isn't great.\n\nAs someone with hundreds of hours in the other two big online fishing games, I know that most people that are curious about trying Fisher Online are probably former players of at least one of those, so I'll do my best to relate the biggest things that I see as positives here and why I've had a blast in my 50 hours of play on Fisher Online so far.\n\nFirst off - Costs. Compared to the other two, there is a gate price here. You can't just jump in to check it out for free, but what about after that? Well, with both of the other two games, I found myself buying premium subscriptions within days of trying them out, not because I necessarily wanted to, but because I felt that meaningful progress was nearly impossible without it. Here, I have not felt pushed to purchase VIP at all; in fact, I honestly don't even know what perks VIP offers, that's how little I have felt the need to get it. I likely will at some point simply to support the developer if nothing else, but that's a HUGE plus for me. Additionally, there aren't premium baits/lures, and very few premium rigs which, as far as I can tell, mostly focus on bonus XP rather than being the best gear you can get. I've even taken part in some of the automated daily tournaments and have been able to place very well, so there's not a P2W aspect here for those either. The value for just picking up the games (and if you're into those maps and their fish species, the DLC) is great, and you won't feel pressured to throw a bunch of additional money at it. Valuation I'm going to give a 9/10; I would give it a 10/10 if it had a demo or something along those lines that would give players that want to try the game out a way to do so to see if it's for them or not.\n\nNext, the fishing mechanics themselves... I'd put this in the middle of the other two games. The fishing here is very fun; it's not super arcady, but it's not to the full sim level with the fluiditity of motion of rod control you'd see in RF4.  You have trolling from boats, spin fishing, feeder fishing, float fishing, deep sea fishing, and fly fishing (the last of which you won't find in the other two games). I haven't gotten to try deep sea fishing yet, but the rest all work very well and are fun, but there are a few minor things (like less rod control while casting or when operating telescopic rods) that hold it back from top grades here. By no means bad, but I'd put it at an 8/10 here.\n\nNext, content variety (maps, species, tackle, etc) - There is a great amount of diversity here in bodies of water and fish species, but the amount of tackle and bait is slimmer than the other two games. Some may see this as a negative, but I actually find it to be a positive because it means there's less bloat to have to deal with. There's enough variety to that you can experiment and try different things and different techniques, but not so much that you're spending more time trying 50 different pieces of tackle at a spot to find something that works. This applies to rods and reels, as well; instead of there beings a huge variety, there's a much more narrow variety. Again, this may be viewed as a negative for some, but I see it as a positive because I'm able to upgrade all forms of fishing much more efficiently rather than stressing about whether this reel or that reel is better for my use case, or having to spend all the money I get in-game on minor upgrades and the bigger setups feeling farther and farther out of reach.

      "review": "tl;dr - Very, very exceptional game. Better than RF4 and Fishing Planet in most ways, with RF4's deeper simulation mechanics to the fishing itself really being the only thing I see that this game doesn't do better than both of those. Well worth the money, just be prepared to watch some YouTube tutorials if you haven't played the other two because the in-game tutorial here isn't great.\n\nAs someone with hundreds of hours in the other two big online fishing games, I know that most people that are curious about trying Fisher Online are probably former players of at least one of those, so I'll do my best to relate the biggest things that I see as positives here and why I've had a blast in my 50 hours of play on Fisher Online so far.\n\nFirst off - Costs. Compared to the other two, there is a gate price here. You can't just jump in to check it out for free, but what about after that? Well, with both of the other two games, I found myself buying premium subscriptions within days of trying them out, not because I necessarily wanted to, but because I felt that meaningful progress was nearly impossible without it. Here, I have not felt pushed to purchase VIP at all; in fact, I honestly don't even know what perks VIP offers, that's how little I have felt the need to get it. I likely will at some point simply to support the developer if nothing else, but that's a HUGE plus for me. Additionally, there aren't premium baits/lures, and very few premium rigs which, as far as I can tell, mostly focus on bonus XP rather than being the best gear you can get. I've even taken part in some of the automated daily tournaments and have been able to place very well, so there's not a P2W aspect here for those either. The value for just picking up the games (and if you're into those maps and their fish species, the DLC) is great, and you won't feel pressured to throw a bunch of additional money at it. Valuation I'm going to give a 9/10; I would give it a 10/10 if it had a demo or something along those lines that would give players that want to try the game out a way to do so to see if it's for them or not.\n\nNext, the fishing mechanics themselves... I'd put this in the middle of the other two games. The fishing here is very fun; it's not super arcady, but it's not to the full sim level with the fluiditity of motion of rod control you'd see in RF4.  You have trolling from boats, spin fishing, feeder fishing, float fishing, deep sea fishing, and fly fishing (the last of which you won't find in the other two games). I haven't gotten to try deep sea fishing yet, but the rest all work very well and are fun, but there are a few minor things (like less rod control while casting or when operating telescopic rods) that hold it back from top grades here. By no means bad, but I'd put it at an 8/10 here.\n\nNext, content variety (maps, species, tackle, etc) - There is a great amount of diversity here in bodies of water and fish species, but the amount of tackle and bait is slimmer than the other two games. Some may see this as a negative, but I actually find it to be a positive because it means there's less bloat to have to deal with. There's enough variety to that you can experiment and try different things and different techniques, but not so much that you're spending more time trying 50 different pieces of tackle at a spot to find something that works. This applies to rods and reels, as well; instead of there beings a huge variety, there's a much more narrow variety. Again, this may be viewed as a negative for some, but I see it as a positive because I'm able to upgrade all forms of fishing much more efficiently rather than stressing about whether this reel or that reel is better for my use case, or having to spend all the money I get in-game on minor upgrades and the bigger setups feeling farther and farther out of reach. [EDIT] I originally gave this an 8/10, but after seeing the shop contents of the level 22 map, I'm revising that upwards as the amount of gear variety for specific purposes jumps up drastically there. I'll give this an 9/10 (updated from 8/10).\n\nA big question I see in other reviews: Is it grindy? Well, it sounds like level 40+ gets pretty grindy, but I can't speak for that as I am currently level 21. But I have not felt like I have had to grind at all, and that applies to both earning money and gaining experience. I've been focusing on knocking out quests I want to do and fishing in places I have fun fishing, and I am progressing just fine. I've also been able to get plenty of great rigs setup and never feel like I am stressing for money to pay, whereas the other games I constantly feel like I am barely keeping any money because all of it would go to repairs, travel costs, bait, etc. I'm giving Fisher Online a 10/10 here, I am able to focus on having fun and fishing rather than visitng active/preset hot spots to get as much XP/coin per hour as possible just to make minor progress.\n\nWhat about non-fishing content? This game features gathering and crafting, and they aren't tied to skills you have to grind out, and they aren't money pits. I've enjoyed making my own baits and making things to sell for the market for additional coin. There's also automated tournaments daily, which can reward XP and tournament coins (which can be used for various tackle or converted to other coin types that are used for other types of things). You've got boats and land vehicles to get around the large maps. The only thing I think it falls a bit short on is making your own lures and flies. I'll give the non-fishing content a 9/10 here; adding lure and fly crafting would make it a 10/10 easily.\n\n[EDIT] New amazing discovery: Via the help of a mod in the workshop, I have discovered that this game almost gives you the multiplayer experience of Fishing Planet in that you can see your friends in your group on the map with you.

Well worth the money, just be prepared to watch some YouTube tutorials if you haven't played the other two because the in-game tutorial here isn't great.\n\nAs someone with hundreds of hours in the other two big online fishing games, I know that most people that are curious about trying Fisher Online are probably former players of at least one of those, so I'll do my best to relate the biggest things that I see as positives here and why I've had a blast in my 50 hours of play on Fisher Online so far.\n\nFirst off - Costs. Compared to the other two, there is a gate price here. You can't just jump in to check it out for free, but what about after that? Well, with both of the other two games, I found myself buying premium subscriptions within days of trying them out, not because I necessarily wanted to, but because I felt that meaningful progress was nearly impossible without it. Here, I have not felt pushed to purchase VIP at all; in fact, I honestly don't even know what perks VIP offers, that's how little I have felt the need to get it. I likely will at some point simply to support the developer if nothing else, but that's a HUGE plus for me. Additionally, there aren't premium baits/lures, and very few premium rigs which, as far as I can tell, mostly focus on bonus XP rather than being the best gear you can get. I've even taken part in some of the automated daily tournaments and have been able to place very well, so there's not a P2W aspect here for those either. The value for just picking up the games (and if you're into those maps and their fish species, the DLC) is great, and you won't feel pressured to throw a bunch of additional money at it. Valuation I'm going to give a 9/10; I would give it a 10/10 if it had a demo or something along those lines that would give players that want to try the game out a way to do so to see if it's for them or not.\n\nNext, the fishing mechanics themselves... I'd put this in the middle of the other two games. The fishing here is very fun; it's not super arcady, but it's not to the full sim level with the fluiditity of motion of rod control you'd see in RF4.  You have trolling from boats, spin fishing, feeder fishing, float fishing, deep sea fishing, and fly fishing (the last of which you won't find in the other two games). I haven't gotten to try deep sea fishing yet, but the rest all work very well and are fun, but there are a few minor things (like less rod control while casting or when operating telescopic rods) that hold it back from top grades here. By no means bad, but I'd put it at an 8/10 here.\n\nNext, content variety (maps, species, tackle, etc) - There is a great amount of diversity here in bodies of water and fish species, but the amount of tackle and bait is slimmer than the other two games. Some may see this as a negative, but I actually find it to be a positive because it means there's less bloat to have to deal with. There's enough variety to that you can experiment and try different things and different techniques, but not so much that you're spending more time trying 50 different pieces of tackle at a spot to find something that works. This applies to rods and reels, as well; instead of there beings a huge variety, there's a much more narrow variety. Again, this may be viewed as a negative for some, but I see it as a positive because I'm able to upgrade all forms of fishing much more efficiently rather than stressing about whether this reel or that reel is better for my use case, or having to spend all the money I get in-game on minor upgrades and the bigger setups feeling farther and farther out of reach. [EDIT] I originally gave this an 8/10, but after seeing the shop contents of the level 22 map, I'm revising that upwards as the amount of gear variety for specific purposes jumps up drastically there. I'll give this an 9/10 (updated from 8/10).\n\nA big question I see in other reviews: Is it grindy? Well, it sounds like level 40+ gets pretty grindy, but I can't speak for that as I am currently level 21. But I have not felt like I have had to grind at all, and that applies to both earning money and gaining experience. I've been focusing on knocking out quests I want to do and fishing in places I have fun fishing, and I am progressing just fine. I've also been able to get plenty of great rigs setup and never feel like I am stressing for money to pay, whereas the other games I constantly feel like I am barely keeping any money because all of it would go to repairs, travel costs, bait, etc. I'm giving Fisher Online a 10/10 here, I am able to focus on having fun and fishing rather than visitng active/preset hot spots to get as much XP/coin per hour as possible just to make minor progress.\n\nWhat about non-fishing content? This game features gathering and crafting, and they aren't tied to skills you have to grind out, and they aren't money pits. I've enjoyed making my own baits and making things to sell for the market for additional coin. There's also automated tournaments daily, which can reward XP and tournament coins (which can be used for various tackle or converted to other coin types that are used for other types of things). You've got boats and land vehicles to get around the large maps. The only thing I think it falls a bit short on is making your own lures and flies. I'll give the non-fishing content a 9/10 here; adding lure and fly crafting would make it a 10/10 easily.\n\n[EDIT] New amazing discovery: Via the help of a mod in the workshop, I have discovered that this game almost gives you the multiplayer experience of Fishing Planet in that you can see your friends in your group on the map with you. You can see their gear, the vehicles their own, etc.; you just don't see the fish they're fighting. But that's a HUGE game changer for me, as I enjoy playing this game with friends and being able to follow each other as we look for spots or compete in tournaments just adds a whole new layer of awesome to the game.\n\nOverall, Fisher Online is great. Its biggest negative, in my opinion, is a very lackluster tutorial. If you are coming from the other two games, most of the controls and systems will be fairly intuitive for you, but if you've never played either of them before, the tutorial here is not going to do a good job setting you up for playing the game effectively; be prepared to look up some YouTube tutorials in that case. I can whole-heartedly recommend Fisher Online as someone who has been itching for a fishing game again but was just too burnt out on the insanely grindy nature of the other two.\n\n[EDIT] Fixed some typos, updated the review on the content variety based on visiting the level 22 map and seeing how much more gear options open up at that point, and added an additional blurb about a multiplayer mod that makes the game SO much better if you play with friends.",
