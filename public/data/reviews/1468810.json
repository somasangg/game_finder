      "review": "So I enjoyed this game quite a bit. I enjoy the wuxia/ murim genre though so may have a bias. It has a bunch of cool little systems. Took me about 125 hours to beat on nightmare so it has a great amount of content, and the story is well written. Will probably come back to play on chaos again in the future wish i had played on chaos to begin with. \n\nSome tips\n- Luck>insight>travel speed are the only stats that are fixed and you can't scale, travel speed matters the least out of the 3. Luck affects everything. Insight affects learning manuals you'll learn a lot but don't neccesarily need this only to shave time taken to learn manuals down. \n\n-You can save scum even if it deletes your file by alt f4ing during death cinematic if something really bad happens out of the blue so don't be afraid of harder modes.\n\n- You can earn special starting traits from beating the game and achieving certain things. Like ending 1-4 gives new outfits and traits to pick at the start.\n\n- [spoiler]When you become a sects grand elder you get a random message to become sect leader it isn't because he's in a higher sect. [/spoiler]\n\n- [b]Most important [/b] When cultivating take your time to get the best possible items for your breakthrough! \n\n- On breakthroughs some of the destinies you add have tiers like bloodthirsty 1 2 3 you need to grab 1 at a lower cultivation rank then 2 and 3 if you plan to rewrite the destiny later. End game challenging shattered alter gives rewrites & so does the main story. \n\n- Artifact spirits! Breaking a pact with one takes 3 years before you can create a new pact! Also the more points you put into an spirit the more focus it costs to use them so check the wiki for talents!\n\nCons\n- 1 Quest was completely untranslated\n- Starting destiny lock is bugged for me\n- few other translations missing like during sect tournament the ui buttons etc",

      "review": "As of Oct 2025, I would say perhaps 95% of the game is translated in english, including the five bloom DLC. The remaining 5% is on some minor dialogue and random sidequests, I think it's fine and I personally didn't miss out much on it, but your mileage may vary.\n\nRegarding the game itself, this is my favourite Xianxia or Cultivator game thus far, the combat and sense of progression is done really well. It's not just \"numbers go up\" ala borderlands style, rather, each increase in cultivation rank brings about new gameplay options, such as artifacts, spirits, summoning dragons, etc.\n\nThe build diversity + power scaling is especially commendable, with 4 elements + 5 martial arts, each having 3 different basic, 6 special skill and 2 ultimates. I'm only 50 hours into the game and I already played more builds than i have in popular arpgs such as POE/Titan Quest/Diablo etc. Definitely well worth your money.\n\nStory-wise, it's done well enough, the main story quest is a bit loose, you're dropped off into the world with little explanation, but the ending does stick pretty well and explains quite a bit(i did spoil myself on the ending). Something I wish was done better is the lack of linearity in obtaining quests, instead of the usual yellow exclaimation marks on NPCs in a central hub town, a lot of the well written quests were actually encountered randomly while traversing the world. Some may prefer this approach, but I always get the feeling like there's a whole bunch of quest that i missed, so it's not quite my cup of tea. However, the quests that I did encounter were well written and enjoyable.\nThe DLC story is a bit hit and miss, it adds 5 NPC lady companions with their own storyline. The first 2 that you encounter, the dimension traveller and the snow lady were definitely the highlights, while the other 3 could have been focused more on in later areas of the game. Instead, you meet them and do their quest bits and pieces throughout the game, making their storyline feel quite disjointed. But for a few extra dollars, i would still recommend it. Despite the glowing negative review on the DLC, many of which pointed out the lack of english translation, I'm happy to say that 95% of it was properly translated for me as of writing.\n\nA huge negative is how grindly and lack of QOL the game seems to be intentionally doing. I do see what the developers are trying to do, but it's not for me. Thankfully, there are numerous english mods that solve this issue and make the game a lot more enjoyable. I would definitely recommend the following mods \"Get forge items - KnightedWarrior\", \"God's eye - KnightedWarrior\" and most importantly \"Cheat Menu – Dynamic Multi-Language Support\", just to solve certain grindy aspects. Even with mods and cheats, you'll likely still get 100+ hours out of the game.\n\nWould definitely recommend.",

This fix cleared it up for me immediately. That's really my only complaint about the game! After that, I've been having a baller time on this thing. \n\nNo kidding, this game is great, and the mods make it even better. There's even in-game mods that you can load without using Nexus and stuff if you're less tech savvy. There's a lot of freedom to do whatever you want while also having objectives. The progression feels meaningful, but you can also grind endlessly if you'd prefer. You can get adopted parents and siblings and a spouse, too.",

      "review": "This game is probably the best Xianxia RPG out there.\r\n\r\nThe translation is a bit wonky and/or awkward at times, as Chinese to English tends to be, but if you can look past this, the game has incredible depth to it.\r\nYou have 10 \"Levels\" of cultivation. 5 Areas, so 2 levels per area, which are seperated through a story relevant barrier and monster infested areas.\r\n\r\nEvery new area, you will want to look for new skills to grow stronger. You have your regular skill, LMB, to attack, you have a special skill RMB, which has a short cooldown of about 10 seconds, but can be reduced, you have a \"Motion\" skill, spacebar, which allows you to move around the arena, and you have an ultimate skill, R, which has a lengthy cooldown but can have powerful effects.\r\n\r\nThere are 12 Skill-trees (Sword, Blade, Spear, Finger, Palm, Fist, Fire, Water, Wood, Earth, Wind, Lightning) in total, and every attack I just described has multiple possible versions of it. For example, Lightning could learn a chain lightning skill, or shoot lightning orbs, or use a lightning whip to attack, and that's just one skill-tree and the LMB attack.\r\n\r\nEvery skill rolls a random set of sub-stats, the amount being dependant on the level and rarity of the skill, passive effects that affect this skill as well as your character. For Example, Motion Skills can roll \"Agility\", which is basically movement speed in an arena. So while you have this motion skill equipped, it provides you with bonus movement speed as well as it's active effect. The strength-cap on this effect is determined by the rarity and level of the skill as well. Red being rarest and grey being the weakest, classical A-RPG rarity system, you know the drill.\r\n\r\nObviously, you will want to have stronger skills, as a Level 1 skill will do very poorly against a Level 5 Enemy. On the other hand, a Level 5 Skill will more than likely oneshot a level 1 Enemy.\r\n\r\nYou are not locked in into your skill choices. You can make any kind of hybrid character you want, for example Sword-Wind or Spear-Lightning. There are, of course, synergies if you stay in your chosen skill-tree, but there can be some very powerful synergies if you think about existing effects, especially if you add the so-called Mind-Skills, which are entirely passive statboosters.\r\n\r\nNPCs are randomly generated in a fixed world with a semi-randomized overlay. That means that the Towns generated will be in random spots across the map, sects created will have randomized skill-sets (I think?) and NPCs will be entirely random, but the layout of the world is always the same. NPCs can interact with you as much as you can with them. They  can ask you to be romantic with them, or they can choose to fight and kill you, just as much as you can do so towards them.\r\n\r\nWhile travelling the world and living your best life as a cultivator, you will get sidequests which provide you both a concluding story, as well as more insight in the overall story, which is the mystery of the world. These sidequests can be short, one-part events like finding a wounded animal and deciding whether to nourish it back to health or finishing it off for potential treasure. You can be both good and evil in this game, both during these short events, as well as during the Main Story End Choices. There are FIVE different endings to the game, each with a unique boss fight. I won't spoiler though.\r\n\r\nYou can either join a sect and cultivate alongside them, raise through the ranks to eventually become the Sect Leader - or you can choose to remain on your own. (This is definitely a challenge run. If you attempt this, I recommend picking the Imp Gourd at the start, or getting Spiritual Fruits, which you need to increase your stats, will be cancer)\r\n\r\nMost activities in the game, like Making Pills, Finding Treasure and learning new skill, have minigames associated with them. They are fun and non-intrusive the first few times, but they may become a little repetetive after a dozen or so times, but not to the point where I found them annoying.\r\n\r\nGraphics-Wise, the game has gorgeous backgrounds that look almost handpainted in classical chinese fashion with the dynamic figures such as your player character and NPCs moving on them. The world map, too, looks hand drawn, but you won't see NPC-Models on there, just small numbers indicating they are there, as well as a bar on the top of the screen to see who is on the currently occupied square. That being said, every NPC has an avatar you can look at - and yes, the female avatars are attractive, it's not Concord.\r\n\r\nThe longer you play the deeper the game seems to get, continuously introducing new systems as you play. The only critique I have is that it's very easy to miss some of the stuff, but that might lead to your second playthrough becoming more interesting.\r\n\r\nFor the record: A single playthrough took me around 54 hours, and I knew what I was doing because I may or may not have played this game... elsewhere. It's very likely that your first playthrough might take between 80 and 100 hours all on it's own.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy A-RPGs, Xianxia, don't mind the occassional grind, but you DO love to see yourself getting stronger to the point of oneshotting what once seemed to be an unsurmountable opponent, this is definitely worth your money and time. That being said: You don't get stronger in the classical RPG-fashion of killing mobs and gaining XP. Instead, you have to cultivate by absorbing Qi. This can be done easily inside a sect, or, if you aren't part of one, in the open world on blue-glowing spots.\r\n\r\nIf you are, however, looking for a mindless, easy and quick-to-get-into game to play, you might want to give this a pass. The tutorial teaches you only the very basics, and for everything else, the game respects your intelligence and relies on your curiosity.\r\n\r\nMy piece of advice: When you create your character, make sure you only push for Luck and Insight. Everything else can be raised ingame rather easily. But Luck and Insight can't, and they are crucial for your journey.\r\nInsight determines how fast you learn skills and, minimally, how many \"Rollback\" Points you get when you reroll the Sub-Skill values.\r\nLuck determines the quality and amount of Loot drops.\r\nBoth can cap out at 200. You probably want to start with around 100, preferrably more, in both.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, the game has mod support, and yes, they are all Gooners.",

Once you master one skill, it takes a long time to develop the others. Though, to be fair, that makes sense if you consider how cultivation works in the novels it takes years for beginners to improve. I think the game would be even better if the combat felt more realistic, similar to typical action games.\n\nThe artwork is beautiful, but the fighting scenes feel quite different in style compared to the rest of the game. Still, I’ve seen some previews, and it seems like the developers are improving this aspect for the future.\n\nOne thing I don’t like is the text in the story windows it’s quite small and hard to read, which strains my eyes during long play sessions.\n\nAs for the quest information, some parts are still confusing and unclear. I’d like to see more detailed descriptions, such as objectives, city names, and information about people involved.\n\nOverall, it’s a fun game. Even though it can get repetitive after playing for many in game years, I still recommend giving it a try.",

      "review": "As of Oct 2025, I would say perhaps 95% of the game is translated in english, including the five bloom DLC. The remaining 5% is on some minor dialogue and random sidequests, I think it's fine and I personally didn't miss out much on it, but your mileage may vary.\n\nRegarding the game itself, this is my favourite Xianxia or Cultivator game thus far, the combat and sense of progression is done really well. It's not just \"numbers go up\" ala borderlands style, rather, each increase in cultivation rank brings about new gameplay options, such as artifacts, spirits, summoning dragons, etc.\n\nThe build diversity + power scaling is especially commendable, with 4 elements + 5 martial arts, each having 3 different basic, 6 special skill and 2 ultimates. I'm only 50 hours into the game and I already played more builds than i have in popular arpgs such as POE/Titan Quest/Diablo etc. Definitely well worth your money.\n\nStory-wise, it's done well enough, the main story quest is a bit loose, you're dropped off into the world with little explanation, but the ending does stick pretty well and explains quite a bit(i did spoil myself on the ending). Something I wish was done better is the lack of linearity in obtaining quests, instead of the usual yellow exclaimation marks on NPCs in a central hub town, a lot of the well written quests were actually encountered randomly while traversing the world. Some may prefer this approach, but I always get the feeling like there's a whole bunch of quest that i missed, so it's not quite my cup of tea. However, the quests that I did encounter were well written and enjoyable.\nThe DLC story is a bit hit and miss, it adds 5 NPC lady companions with their own storyline. The first 2 that you encounter, the dimension traveller and the snow lady were definitely the highlights, while the other 3 could have been focused more on in later areas of the game. Instead, you meet them and do their quest bits and pieces throughout the game, making their storyline feel quite disjointed. But for a few extra dollars, i would still recommend it. Despite the glowing negative review on the DLC, many of which pointed out the lack of english translation, I'm happy to say that 95% of it was properly translated for me as of writing.\n\nA huge negative is how grindly and lack of QOL the game seems to be intentionally doing. I do see what the developers are trying to do, but it's not for me. Thankfully, there are numerous english mods that solve this issue and make the game a lot more enjoyable. I would definitely recommend the following mods \"Get forge items - KnightedWarrior\", \"God's eye - KnightedWarrior\" and most importantly \"Cheat Menu – Dynamic Multi-Language Support\", just to solve certain grindy aspects. Even with mods and cheats, you'll likely still get 100+ hours out of the game.\n\nWould definitely recommend.",

This fix cleared it up for me immediately. That's really my only complaint about the game! After that, I've been having a baller time on this thing. \n\nNo kidding, this game is great, and the mods make it even better. There's even in-game mods that you can load without using Nexus and stuff if you're less tech savvy. There's a lot of freedom to do whatever you want while also having objectives.

      "review": "This game is probably the best Xianxia RPG out there.\r\n\r\nThe translation is a bit wonky and/or awkward at times, as Chinese to English tends to be, but if you can look past this, the game has incredible depth to it.\r\nYou have 10 \"Levels\" of cultivation. 5 Areas, so 2 levels per area, which are seperated through a story relevant barrier and monster infested areas.\r\n\r\nEvery new area, you will want to look for new skills to grow stronger. You have your regular skill, LMB, to attack, you have a special skill RMB, which has a short cooldown of about 10 seconds, but can be reduced, you have a \"Motion\" skill, spacebar, which allows you to move around the arena, and you have an ultimate skill, R, which has a lengthy cooldown but can have powerful effects.\r\n\r\nThere are 12 Skill-trees (Sword, Blade, Spear, Finger, Palm, Fist, Fire, Water, Wood, Earth, Wind, Lightning) in total, and every attack I just described has multiple possible versions of it. For example, Lightning could learn a chain lightning skill, or shoot lightning orbs, or use a lightning whip to attack, and that's just one skill-tree and the LMB attack.\r\n\r\nEvery skill rolls a random set of sub-stats, the amount being dependant on the level and rarity of the skill, passive effects that affect this skill as well as your character. For Example, Motion Skills can roll \"Agility\", which is basically movement speed in an arena. So while you have this motion skill equipped, it provides you with bonus movement speed as well as it's active effect. The strength-cap on this effect is determined by the rarity and level of the skill as well. Red being rarest and grey being the weakest, classical A-RPG rarity system, you know the drill.\r\n\r\nObviously, you will want to have stronger skills, as a Level 1 skill will do very poorly against a Level 5 Enemy. On the other hand, a Level 5 Skill will more than likely oneshot a level 1 Enemy.\r\n\r\nYou are not locked in into your skill choices. You can make any kind of hybrid character you want, for example Sword-Wind or Spear-Lightning. There are, of course, synergies if you stay in your chosen skill-tree, but there can be some very powerful synergies if you think about existing effects, especially if you add the so-called Mind-Skills, which are entirely passive statboosters.\r\n\r\nNPCs are randomly generated in a fixed world with a semi-randomized overlay. That means that the Towns generated will be in random spots across the map, sects created will have randomized skill-sets (I think?) and NPCs will be entirely random, but the layout of the world is always the same. NPCs can interact with you as much as you can with them. They  can ask you to be romantic with them, or they can choose to fight and kill you, just as much as you can do so towards them.\r\n\r\nWhile travelling the world and living your best life as a cultivator, you will get sidequests which provide you both a concluding story, as well as more insight in the overall story, which is the mystery of the world. These sidequests can be short, one-part events like finding a wounded animal and deciding whether to nourish it back to health or finishing it off for potential treasure. You can be both good and evil in this game, both during these short events, as well as during the Main Story End Choices. There are FIVE different endings to the game, each with a unique boss fight. I won't spoiler though.\r\n\r\nYou can either join a sect and cultivate alongside them, raise through the ranks to eventually become the Sect Leader - or you can choose to remain on your own. (This is definitely a challenge run. If you attempt this, I recommend picking the Imp Gourd at the start, or getting Spiritual Fruits, which you need to increase your stats, will be cancer)\r\n\r\nMost activities in the game, like Making Pills, Finding Treasure and learning new skill, have minigames associated with them. They are fun and non-intrusive the first few times, but they may become a little repetetive after a dozen or so times, but not to the point where I found them annoying.\r\n\r\nGraphics-Wise, the game has gorgeous backgrounds that look almost handpainted in classical chinese fashion with the dynamic figures such as your player character and NPCs moving on them. The world map, too, looks hand drawn, but you won't see NPC-Models on there, just small numbers indicating they are there, as well as a bar on the top of the screen to see who is on the currently occupied square. That being said, every NPC has an avatar you can look at - and yes, the female avatars are attractive, it's not Concord.\r\n\r\nThe longer you play the deeper the game seems to get, continuously introducing new systems as you play. The only critique I have is that it's very easy to miss some of the stuff, but that might lead to your second playthrough becoming more interesting.\r\n\r\nFor the record: A single playthrough took me around 54 hours, and I knew what I was doing because I may or may not have played this game... elsewhere. It's very likely that your first playthrough might take between 80 and 100 hours all on it's own.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy A-RPGs, Xianxia, don't mind the occassional grind, but you DO love to see yourself getting stronger to the point of oneshotting what once seemed to be an unsurmountable opponent, this is definitely worth your money and time. That being said: You don't get stronger in the classical RPG-fashion of killing mobs and gaining XP. Instead, you have to cultivate by absorbing Qi. This can be done easily inside a sect, or, if you aren't part of one, in the open world on blue-glowing spots.\r\n\r\nIf you are, however, looking for a mindless, easy and quick-to-get-into game to play, you might want to give this a pass. The tutorial teaches you only the very basics, and for everything else, the game respects your intelligence and relies on your curiosity.\r\n\r\nMy piece of advice: When you create your character, make sure you only push for Luck and Insight. Everything else can be raised ingame rather easily. But Luck and Insight can't, and they are crucial for your journey.\r\nInsight determines how fast you learn skills and, minimally, how many \"Rollback\" Points you get when you reroll the Sub-Skill values.\r\nLuck determines the quality and amount of Loot drops.\r\nBoth can cap out at 200. You probably want to start with around 100, preferrably more, in both.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, the game has mod support, and yes, they are all Gooners.",

Took me about 125 hours to beat on nightmare so it has a great amount of content, and the story is well written. Will probably come back to play on chaos again in the future wish i had played on chaos to begin with. \n\nSome tips\n- Luck>insight>travel speed are the only stats that are fixed and you can't scale, travel speed matters the least out of the 3. Luck affects everything. Insight affects learning manuals you'll learn a lot but don't neccesarily need this only to shave time taken to learn manuals down. \n\n-You can save scum even if it deletes your file by alt f4ing during death cinematic if something really bad happens out of the blue so don't be afraid of harder modes.\n\n- You can earn special starting traits from beating the game and achieving certain things. Like ending 1-4 gives new outfits and traits to pick at the start.\n\n- [spoiler]When you become a sects grand elder you get a random message to become sect leader it isn't because he's in a higher sect. [/spoiler]\n\n- [b]Most important [/b] When cultivating take your time to get the best possible items for your breakthrough! \n\n- On breakthroughs some of the destinies you add have tiers like bloodthirsty 1 2 3 you need to grab 1 at a lower cultivation rank then 2 and 3 if you plan to rewrite the destiny later. End game challenging shattered alter gives rewrites & so does the main story. \n\n- Artifact spirits! Breaking a pact with one takes 3 years before you can create a new pact! Also the more points you put into an spirit the more focus it costs to use them so check the wiki for talents!\n\nCons\n- 1 Quest was completely untranslated\n- Starting destiny lock is bugged for me\n- few other translations missing like during sect tournament the ui buttons etc",
