So one for you, and one for your friend!\n\nFor npcs: yes there is always room for improvement, and at this point, no doubt they will deliver.",

Then it has many cool animations including weapon animations in first person view. In third person view, most animations are not there yet. It does not have full story, except we know we are prisoners on island and kinda have to entertain unknown audience. It still not finished, every player/character starts with the same BIO.\nThere are some transport to find, rebuild/repair and use. Quite detailed and realistic.\nAlso there is huge food and digestion/nutrition system, but it seems not all parts of it works, for example vitamins and minerals. There are cooking and food preserving options including electric generators and portable fridges, electric plates, gas plates, pots and pans. Recent addition is buildable oven and kitchen cabinets with own inventory space. No more wardrobes in kitchen!\nIt has very dumb (early versions) of NPC's that attack players and zombies on sight.\nThere are little basic base building with very limited selection of wall, floor and roof pieces. But it has lockable doors with optional security system.\nRecent addition are gas and electric lighting, but it drains electricity from generators, which must be in lamps range (why not expand that range or add wiring, because for large base one might need several generators to be placed at certain distances to cover all lamps.\nDevs seems are working onto something, but there are old bugs and new bugs, community want modding, because mods already solved few fundamental problems with NPC's behavior, but future of that is unclear.\nLatest release of 1.0 is mere a new version number, it actually changed not much.\nBut if you are friendly like minded, creative bunch of people, you might find the fun in it running some RP server.",

And honestly? That’s kind of what makes it fun.\r\n\r\nWhat I like most is how open everything feels. You can sneak around looting abandoned buildings, go full Rambo in the woods, build a base, hunt animals, or just run around trying not to starve (which, for me, happens way too often). The map is huge, and every time I think I’ve seen most of it, I stumble into some new corner of the island and immediately get chased by something that wants me dead.\r\n\r\nCombat is hit-or-miss depending on what you’re into. Guns feel great when you actually have them, but half the time I’m running around with some janky melee weapon hoping a puppet doesn’t jump me around a corner. Speaking of puppets—they’re creepy as hell when they sprint at you, but it definitely keeps things exciting.\r\n\r\nThe crafting and metabolism systems are super detailed, almost too detailed, but once you get the hang of it, it makes the survival feel way more realistic. Eating the wrong thing actually matters. So does running too much, or carrying too much, or basically doing anything without planning ahead.\r\n\r\nThe game isn’t perfect—there are bugs, and sometimes it feels a little rough around the edges—but when SCUM hits, it really hits. It’s one of those games where you can easily lose hours without realizing it.\r\n\r\nIf you like survival games that actually challenge you instead of just throwing you in a forest with unlimited berries, SCUM is definitely worth playing. Just be prepared to die in the dumbest ways imaginable. Trust me, I’ve tested plenty of them.",

I loved DayZ and Rust and this seems to have the best of both combined! Crafting and building is pretty straight forward, the health and metabolism mechanics go very very deep, but they won't get in your way when you are just starting out, lockpicking is a nice twist and challenging enough. To me it feels much better than Rust, and also much better than DayZ. Also the graphics are just phenomenal, compared to either of these two games. It is a bit of a grind to get started, but building a base is easier than DayZ, more challenging than Rust. Getting a vehicle is hard at the start and takes the game on another level. Looking at videos from last few years, it's obvious the devs are active on the game as a lot of things are changing, from visual to interface to mechanics through time, which I find a good thing. The 45 euro price seems a bit pricey for a survival game like this, but it also does feel pretty deep to me. Getting it on a sale, feels like a steal.",

They helped me get started, put together a truck, built a house and walked me through the basics: proper pooping and peeing techniques (very important or you will soil your clothes), wetness management, how to trip balls for two days straight, crafting items, interacting with traders, treating wounds, what to do when you die, etc, etc.\n\nSuffice to say there's a LOT going on and a pretty steep learning curve even with help; can't imagine how difficult it would be going in blind with no buddies.\n\nI've been enjoying a lot of solo looting and selling to the nearby traders, using the money for necessities like gas, specific ammo and mags for the guns I've found so far (lost the guns my buddy gave me almost immediately, NEVER hold items in your hands), easy food (haven't gotten into cooking yet), repair items and whatnot.\n\nI like finding vehicles and getting them running, was able to get a Laika after finding two of them nearby and using the parts to make one that runs, also got a tractor going, my buddies helping with rides to go pick them up and bring them back to the compound\n\nRecently learned how to open weapon lockers in the police station, so far have found a VAL assault rifle, a Tec01 pump shotty, a MAC10 and a Hunter 85 (that one was in a gas station), also finding lots of different types of ammo and magazines\n\nThe lore is pretty cool, especially the part about the scum who escaped the island and started a resistance movement, suggesting that it might be possible to follow in their footsteps, potentially making the game much more than just a survival crafting sim, but I really don't know.\n\nI'd like to experiment with different starting builds, think it would be fun to make a character designed to be constantly moving with no base, with heightened perception, stealth, thievery  and running skills, just slip in and out of situations looting supplies as you go\n\nAnyway I'm still getting the hang of it, have yet to venture into pvp areas (spooky!), will be hitting a bunker and the airbase soon for military loot and weapons\n\nHope y'all scumbags have fun out there, and for Pete's sake try not to soil your clothes!",

But not as much as there should've been for how many years has been put into this project. Not ONLY THAT, but the devs keep nerfing strats to gain skill in a game where each server you go, you have to make a new character. I understand skill/stat gain should be meaningful, but honestly it's not. \n\nLockpicking is garbage at a 3 second timer and most of the time it's really a crapshoot if you can pick a really hard lock unless you have a big desk and can swing your mouse fast to scan a lock. Otherwise, you're fucked lmao. Disarming bombs also feels like a chore with each wire you need to snip being the same color. No joke, I know squads where people screen share to disarm bombs. That makes zero fucking sense. \n\nThat being said, the game has some positives. The vehicles (except planes) feel generally pretty good. Archery feels good, and the weapons are alright, and there's some nice customization. Gear feels a bit limited in terms of what's meta, but if you wanna look cool or sexy or w/e you can do that. \n\nThe survival mechanics are probably the best from any other survival game out there. I can't really think of any other survival games that handle metabolism at this level, but compared to content that doesn't matter lol. That's more a plus if there was more meaningful content to do.\n\nI dunno, I hope this game gets more updates and shapes up to be great, but right now?

The game no longer feels like a game show, I am not sure what it is. I spawn, and it costs me 250 credits to respawn randomly anywhere if I die, so you get in debt from dying, but you have to walking simulator run for 45 minutes to an edge camped safe zone with a bank card you can drop, to deposit cash you have to farm and sell. So reasonably quickly I realised, this isn't feasible because everything is worth fuck all and you can't even carry a large turd without having to spend 5 minutes dropping it. The survival is INSANELY deep, but also, beyond the realms of non-realistically pedantic. Like, it is the most tediously painful crafting experience I have experienced even surpassing, and I don't say this lightly, Life is Feudal MMO where you could spend 2 real life days digging shovels with 10 other people to \"flatten\" the land to even start build a castle on. And that was tedious as fuck. Naturally that game died because it was shit, as I am assuming so will this one. Other than that, EU server is full of Chinese people speaking Chinese, and every 2 minutes another player accuses his attacker of being a hacker which is probably not true, but still.\n\nI think the real issue comes with, ultra hardcore perma death with extra detailed human entropy roulette wheel, combined with the CLUNKIEST jank of movement and combat that I find it hard to compare to anything other than, trying to pilot a human against ultrafast terrain glitchopping zombies like a Mechwarrior Mechpilot. It really has broken the boundaries of what I am shocked a human can actually enjoy. I have no idea how anyone is playing this, and honestly reckon most players must be hackers, not because they are pulling off crazy shots but because, they would probably need to be one in order to actually improve quality of life to play this game in any remotely enjoyable way. But I still don't condone it for even that reason.\n\nIt's a nice idea for a game I guess to a degree, but the graphics, mechanics, design, and development really let it down.\n\nI'm trying to give it a chance but deleting my character to bankrupt my debt from learning the game, actually did annoying shit like delete all my favourites in the, oh yeah, WORST UI I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. You can and must right click on everything in the game, however, you have to go click on big massive buttons to do things like, examine an item, or go back. And you have what, 12-15 pages of controls to try and work out if you decide to go change them. Typing into chat regularly goes haywire but I don't need to reply when 90% of the EU server is speaking Chinese for some reason.\n\nClunky, ugly, buggy, unintuitive, janky, boring, tedious, linear rubbish.\n\nI used to have fun on it building bases when I could actually build a bed and spawn on it, or near it, or in the same grid, or withing 50 miles of it, but those days seem gone. Chasing airdrops and gunning people down and fixing up cars and galavanting, now is like, some safezone merchant \"hunting\" spots for campers, and I guess naked running to military compounds. Honestly, like a really tedious, worse version of PUBG. With the most tedious attribute and skill levelling I've seen with \"maintenance\" like eating actual good protein to stop your strength decreasing, very cool, if you want to play a misery simulator.\n\nIt also had the cool feature where you could put a lock on the actual houses on the map, and protect your locks, but bases or survival seems to be removed from the game in place of, run and gun shooter looter with no extraction, just long term base building, that if its anything like last time I played, with get offlined every day with great ease like most of these dumb wipe loop games. \n\nShocked at how it feels much worse to play or build a base than it did last time when it had buggy zombies and buggy trees. 0/10 \n\nTL:DR Can't craft a bed and respawn at it anymore.

The game does many things exceedingly well, and I've experienced some of the highest highs I've ever had in gaming here. My favorite memory was taking over a town we named \"Bikini Bottom\" and boarded up every window, then locked up every single door. We spread our gear and loot throughout the town so that someone would have to pick nearly a hundred locks to get to all of it. We held the town for months and fought off teams of attacking players that inevitably took notice. Whole parts of the town were impassable because we laid minefields and when we finally were pushed out it was because we simply had nothing left to fight with. It was glorious.\r\n\r\nThere is one undeniable and infuriating fact that cannot be overlooked: the game is full of rampant cheating. When you encounter a hacker in a game like Battlefield or CoD, you lose the fight and you're right back in it a few seconds later. When you encounter a cheater in this game, you can lose a hundred hours of progress and you're right back at square one, naked and afraid with no gear and the daunting task of starting over.\r\n\r\nI've reported players and posted evidence of cheating on official servers through the correct channels and seen those players banned, Only for them to login with an alt and immediately go back to besieging and harassing me again. It's a game of whack-a-mole and there is simply no winning. Even if you do manage to get them banned, you don't get your lost gear and progress back. What is lost is lost. Make no mistake, it is not a matter of if a cheater will get you, but when.\r\n\r\nThe only recourse is to join a private server with custom rules and flaky admins that may or may not actually do their jobs. Even if you do find a good server that fits your taste, the admin could simply close the server when the population get too low to justify the cost. Myself and four friends ran into this exact scenario, and when we all lost our characters on that private server, none of them ever came back to the game again.\r\n\r\nI can't recommend this game to anyone in good conscience. It's got a lot of great ingredients, but the game is just overrun with cheaters and misery awaits anyone foolish enough to step into this world.

Now I know where they are, i'll get craft a bow and go fuck em up. Parachute just outside  the fence and start crafting a bow. Mech blows me away. Or how about mechs having thermal vision and can shoot you through the walls even though the doors are closed and weren't agro'd beforehand. Trash, trash, trash. What a fucking waste of time.",

Personally, I play PVE and enjoy the survival, hunting, building aspect of it the most, however NPCs have forced PVE into PVPs, you cannot just be silly and goofy or relax. Getting 6 NPCs with guns on you when you're just starting. Killing them and somehow more spawn right in the same exact place and know exactly where you are as soon as they do. All that you work for, lost so quickly. If they make NPCs optional or let you play with your squad without needing to pay for a server or be in someone else's, we'll be back to the game, until then, that was the end sadly. \nHope to see a change in the future",

      "review": "First, I want to say that survival games are my favorite genre. I have played almost every major survival game on Steam, but I simply cannot recommend this one in particular.\n\nThe game is probably not too bad with friends, but solo in sandbox mode? The systems are well designed, but the game is painfully empty and sloooooow. What takes 10 hours to do in this game can be done in under an hour in other survival games. For example, it took me 20 minutes just to craft 10 arrows. By the time you finish getting your basic gear, a basic backpack, some weapons, and basic clothes, you are already dying of hunger and thirst.\n\nAnd to heal yourself, you need alcohol. In one of my runs, I spawned near a zombie, barely had time to craft a stone knife, and when I attacked, the hitbox was so bad that I only hit him once every two swings, even though my character’s arm was literally going through his body. He caused me to bleed. I tried to make bandages by tearing clothes, but I could not use them because I needed to disinfect them first. So I had no choice but to watch my character die. On top of that, when you respawn, you get hit with a debt of 250 dollars for each death. So I felt forced to create a new character.\n\nThis time I was more cautious. I avoided the RARE enemies (and fun) for find a better gear. I searched for alcohol to make those famous bandages. I did not find a single bottle in 3 hours of gameplay. And the world itself is completely empty. No animals, no enemies. I had more fun just walking around in Death Stranding.\n\nI finally reached an outpost, kept a few items to sell, thinking I was finally going to start getting some decent gear. But nope, you need REPUTATION just to buy anything.\nI did not rage quit. I stopped because I no longer expected anything from this game.\n\nAre you sure this is a 1.0 and not a 0.1?\nI had ten times more fun during the first year of 7 Days to Die.\n\nIn short, play it with friends and you might have fun since the heavy grind will be shared, but it is very far from being a good solo game.",

Enemies are few and far between, loot is boring for the most part. The most exciting thing you can find is just guns that you can buy at a trader, but even a basic pistol can 1 shot any \"puppets\" (zombies) or npc that you will rarely run into. I did log into a few different official servers to get a feel of the online but hours of running around in the dark, literally every container giving \"no items found\"  before finally seeing someone and getting into a improvised bow fight only to find the enemy player had nothing either made me drop it. \ntl;dr game lacks content, juice ain't worth the squeeze. looks and runs great though.",

No voiced AI please. idc about story flavortext, i'm going to murder your toaster with a baseball bat and send you its pieces in the mail piece by piece. i am an AI moderate btw just so we're clear) These folks desperately need new eyes to decide how their UI works. It's very clear the devs have their own preferences and opinions on UI that have aged poorly, but NOT ALL OF THEM ARE INCORRECT, just the current summation of them ARE. Please hire or consult with someone under the age of 30 (NOT ME BTW) on making this feel intuitive and you will have more success than you expect. This project has clearly been inDev for a long time, and the best practices of UI/UX have completely changed while yours hasn't quite caught up. That's fine, but now's the time to change it. \n\nUPDATE: COOL GAME, new experience learning is rough still but TY devs for busting ass. I believe in u and will update my review when i got more hours in besides just the new player exp to report in on, as a ARMA2 DayZ player back in the day i see so much of what the game I wanted way back when to materialize into here, but with far better clarity of vision. UI changes will be no sweat for ya'll it seems, Q4 update targetted? Outstanding, i'll be here! TY for responding <3\n\nUPDATE2: Ok the PVE is cool. The PVP is really really really laggy and bad, which  is really unfortunate because it's like the main marketing point of the game. I don't care if you have fiber. Your oponents are going to be blipping around, rubber banding, and skipping around looking like they're teleporting with what feels like 0 network interpolation on the servers' part. Wtf lol.I love all the mechanics, but none of it matters in the conetxt of PVP if the network performance is seriously questionable. Some of the oldheads who've been playing this game a long time might b like, \"WHAT LAG\", but they are usually over 40 pushing 50 and have no idea what they've lost in their faculties (not trying to be mean but they're not exactly nice so w/e) It's dialup bad at times. Best way to see it for yourself is to play any of the server 'events' that pop up for some fastpaced arena style PVP and really get your taste of it. I can't believe i'm saying this but even Tarkov's worst network issues look cute in comparison.\n\nUPDATE3: VEHICLES. NEAT. I almost fucking rage quit the game though when I watched my truck dissolve like sugar in the rain when it got a little bit wet. I'm not exaggerating. The storage just disappeared. Then the doors disappeared, until it was nothing. If you want to total the truck, fine. But to completely destroy all the player's storage when it gets up to its axel in water? That's infuriating. I lost everythinnnnng moving bases around the map due to this. It isn't a bug, it's a very very bad choice in game design. Fix it.",

      "review": "💬 Honest Review After 24+ Hours of Playtime\r\n\r\nEven though I haven’t spent hundreds of hours like some players, I’ve seen enough to form an honest opinion — and sadly, it’s disappointing for how long the game has been in Early Access.\r\nI’m not hating on it — SCUM has huge potential — but it feels weird, unfinished, and missing the spark that keeps you playing.\r\n\r\n✅ PROS\r\n\r\nExcellent Survival Systems\r\nThe metabolism and core survival mechanics are among the best I’ve seen in any game. Vitamins, hydration, body temperature, energy — it’s all there and genuinely impressive. This is clearly where SCUM shines and what it was built around.\r\n\r\nHuge Open World with Potential\r\nThe map is massive, with a ton of room for exploration and base building. There’s potential for it to become one of the best survival adventure experiences… someday.\r\n\r\nSolid Framework for a True Sandbox\r\nCustom server settings, admin controls, scripting options, and freedom to modify rules give this game a great sandbox foundation. Vehicles, boats, planes — all modular and detailed.\r\nThe systems are incredible; the content is not.\r\n\r\n❌ CONS\r\n\r\nJanky Movement and Controls\r\nMovement speed is tied to your mouse scroll wheel (why?). Interaction controls overlap in messy ways — opening your inventory also opens the emote/pee/vomit wheel. Changing keybinds doesn’t fix it. These should be separate keys, not stacked together.\r\n\r\nBase Building Needs a Complete Rework\r\nEasily one of the weakest parts of SCUM. It’s clunky, unintuitive, and restrictive.\r\n\r\nSegmented walls needing upgrades piece by piece.\r\n\r\nAwkward snapping that barely aligns.\r\n\r\nRandom “can’t place here” errors.\r\n\r\nAnd that cursed “Hold F → select upgrade → confirm → repeat” loop… THIS FEELS REALLY CRAPPY.\r\nYou can’t properly extend or expand structures — no balconies, no creative freedom.\r\nGames like Rust, DayZ, and 7 Days to Die handle building way better.\r\n\r\nGear & Progression Feel Empty\r\nClothing and gear variety are painfully limited. A few recolors, a few guns, and then repetition.\r\nAfter looting one bunker, you’ve basically seen it all — the sense of progression or discovery disappears fast.\r\n\r\nWhy Bunkers Feel Repetitive\r\n\r\nStatic loot tables. Almost every bunker shares the same loot pool — guns, ammo, attachments. No unique bunker-only items.\r\n\r\nNo scaling. Loot barely changes with fame level, location, or difficulty. Once you’ve looted one, you’ve looted them all.\r\n\r\nEvent spawns slowed down. Special crates and rotating loot stopped being updated meaningfully after version 0.9.\r\n\r\nGraphics Are Inconsistent\r\nDecent in some areas, but low-quality textures still appear — even on high-end GPUs like an RTX 4070.\r\n\r\nOutposts Are a Cool Idea but Break Survival Balance\r\nBeing able to sell anything and buy all your gear instantly ruins the survival loop. There’s no sense of scarcity or progression.\r\n\r\nAI and Audio Are Weak\r\nPuppet (zombie) variety is minimal — maybe three main models. Sounds are repetitive and lack impact. AI pathfinding and awareness feel outdated.\r\n\r\nCrafting Feels Half-Finished\r\nFeels like a 500-page recipe book where only 20 pages have actual content. Great concept, but there’s no depth or evolution to it.\r\n\r\nMap Interface Is Awful\r\nYou can’t zoom in, add markers, or set custom pins. For such a massive map, that’s a huge flaw — especially in multiplayer where coordination is crucial.\r\n\r\nSandbox Mode Still Feels Empty\r\nEven maxing animal spawns resulted in finding nothing. Systems are there, but the content and consistency aren’t.\r\n\r\n⚙️ The Game’s Strengths (But Underused)\r\n\r\nEven with its problems, SCUM’s foundation is one of the best ever made for survival games:\r\n\r\nDeepest survival simulation in the genre (nutrition, injuries, diseases, metabolism).\r\n\r\nTrue base-territory mechanics and modular construction.\r\n\r\nVehicles, boats, planes, and admin scripting systems.\r\nBut the devs haven’t filled this incredible structure with meaningful gameplay or content — it’s all systems, no soul.\r\n\r\n🔮 What’s Missing / Still in Progress\r\n\r\nPlayers have been asking for years for:\r\n\r\nReal PvE variety (AI factions, scavengers, raiders).\r\n\r\nDynamic world events (supply drops, storms, migrating hordes).\r\n\r\nMore loot diversity and themed bunkers.\r\n\r\nCivilian interiors that actually matter.\r\n\r\nEndgame objectives beyond “loot bunker, sell loot, repeat.”\r\n\r\n⚠️ Final Thoughts\r\n\r\nSCUM’s problem isn’t its mechanics — it’s the lack of content and direction.\r\nAfter seven years in Early Access, progress feels slow, and developer communication is minimal.\r\nThey talked about mod support, which could’ve saved this game by letting the community expand it for free — and then did nothing.\r\n\r\nThere’s still massive potential, but potential doesn’t matter if it stays untapped. Right now, SCUM feels like a brilliant survival framework waiting for someone to finally build a real game on top of it.\r\n\r\nEven DayZ, which once felt emptier, offers more reason to play today.\r\n\r\n⭐ Verdict:\r\nAn impressive simulation engine trapped inside an empty world.\r\n5/10 — Incredible potential, disappointing execution.\r\n\r\nThis is my version and opinion of this game, comments are appreciated but it will be very difficult to convince me anyhow this game is going places.. If you want to discuss things with me I have no problem. Leave a comment 😊",

Armed NPCs[/h3]\r\nI’ve played since v0.4, and the recent addition of Armed NPCs feels out of place. They make PvP servers feel like single-player or PvE servers, which is not what I enjoy. I play for human interaction and the thrill of not knowing when you will meet another player. [u]Armed NPCs pretending to be human players ruin the dynamic of human interaction.[/u]\r\n\r\nI’m fine with other NPCs like puppets, Mr. Brenner, Razors, sentries, and wild animals because they add variety without replacing (or imitating) player encounters. However, Armed NPCs should either be limited to single-player and PvE servers, [u]or Armed NPCs could have a different purpose in the game (like being TEC1 soldiers to specifically protect the police stations and POIs)[/u]. Thus, if you're away from the police stations and any other POIs, Armed NPCs would simply ignore you (like what happens with the sentries protecting POIs).\r\n\r\nI’m not against NPCs in general, but [u]on official PvP servers, Armed NPCs should not exist, or they should not behave like regular players[/u].\r\n\r\n[h3]2. Spawn System[/h3]\r\nThe spawn/encounter system still needs work. [u]Puppets often appear suddenly behind trees or bushes you just saw were clear.[/u] I'm pretty sure that puppets are not smart enough to keep hiding until you get closer. Spawning them from farther away would improve immersion. I hope future updates will continue to address/improve this.",

But not as much as there should've been for how many years has been put into this project. Not ONLY THAT, but the devs keep nerfing strats to gain skill in a game where each server you go, you have to make a new character. I understand skill/stat gain should be meaningful, but honestly it's not. \n\nLockpicking is garbage at a 3 second timer and most of the time it's really a crapshoot if you can pick a really hard lock unless you have a big desk and can swing your mouse fast to scan a lock. Otherwise, you're fucked lmao. Disarming bombs also feels like a chore with each wire you need to snip being the same color. No joke, I know squads where people screen share to disarm bombs. That makes zero fucking sense. \n\nThat being said, the game has some positives. The vehicles (except planes) feel generally pretty good. Archery feels good, and the weapons are alright, and there's some nice customization. Gear feels a bit limited in terms of what's meta, but if you wanna look cool or sexy or w/e you can do that. \n\nThe survival mechanics are probably the best from any other survival game out there. I can't really think of any other survival games that handle metabolism at this level, but compared to content that doesn't matter lol. That's more a plus if there was more meaningful content to do.\n\nI dunno, I hope this game gets more updates and shapes up to be great, but right now?

Also training strength now is so stupidly hard with the stamina blackouts you might as well not even bother as you have to start stop start stop every 20 seconds which is totally not fun at all. At least before you could go train for 5 or 10 mins before needing to stop for food and drink and actually see a benefit and not feel like ripping your hair out while doing it. The npc's are also very clunky, stupid with their movements - just walks towards you you till completely in your face with a gun and too much aimbot like behaviour while doing so they need a hell of a lot of work and dont think they belong in the game till they are in a much more polished state . I used to play scum a lot and now its mostly just gathering dust as a once good game now in the trash can. Shame as it was having such good potential.",

      "review": "At first glance it looks nice. And it can definitely be a challenge to players who love hardcore survival games. \r\n\r\nBut it's buggy, vague and player unfriendly in many ways. Items despawn randomly, sometimes right as you're looking at them. Have 4 or 5 enemies to fight? Be prepared for the first one to despawn before you even finish the fight. Want to store some stuff in your base? Some of it will despawn before you even log back in the next day. You have to put almost EVERYTHING in storage containers. Expect those to be there for you later? Nope, they are on a 14 day time limit, you have to constantly open and close the containers to \"reset\" the timer.\r\n\r\nYou're a seasoned gamer and got this figured out? You're still going to get sniped by armed NPCs in \"beginner\" parts of the map randomly and NOTHING you can do about it but just lose everything and start over. You basically have to follow the \"META\" or the NPCs will eat you for lunch. Even pro players get sniped by NPC's frequently before they're able to armor up. \r\n\r\nThe game has a lot of those \"why the heck did the devs do that?\" moments. Balance? Lol, right. There's no balance with NPC's. Puppets are easy, and then suddenly you get popped by an NPC with a top tier weapon for no reason. \r\n\r\nIt's like the devs want you, even in \"sandbox\" single player mode, to feel like you're being griefed. \r\n\r\nThink you're just going to go into settings and turn down the intensity? Nah, the settings are convoluted and often don't work as described, either simply not working, or having unintended side effects. \r\n\r\nIt's fun for a minute, but... I don't see myself passing the 100 hour mark on this one.",

The issues are not just minor annoyances—they have a huge impact on gameplay and ruin the overall experience.\r\n\r\nArchery & Firearms: Using bows and pistols feels broken. Shots often don’t register correctly, even when aiming directly at the target. This makes ranged combat unreliable and frustrating.\r\n\r\nMelee Combat: If a puppet (zombie) is close to you, melee weapons miss far too often for no logical reason. You end up swinging endlessly with no effect while the puppet hits you without issue.\r\n\r\nSuicide Puppets: Sometimes these enemies make no sound at all. Instead of hearing them approach, you suddenly find one right in front of you, which feels completely unfair.\r\n\r\nPuppet Movement: Puppets can climb obstacles instantly, while players are stuck with a delay. This imbalance makes encounters even more punishing and unrealistic.\r\n\r\nPersistent Bugs: These problems have been around for a long time, and many players (myself included) have complained about them. Yet the developers seem to struggle to fix even the most game-breaking issues.\r\n\r\nOverall, the game feels unpolished and poorly balanced. Instead of enjoying survival gameplay, you end up fighting against broken mechanics. After wasting so many hours dealing with these bugs, I can’t recommend SCUM in its current state.",

Recent updates have really changed the direction of the game for the worst, while bugs i used to encounter years ago still exist. I was holding off from even posting anything until I saw the toddler of a community manager (Assuming that's what he is, hope not a real game dev with real input) responding to a lot of ragebait instead of interacting only with the people that actually give a fuck where the game is at. This game had (hopefully still has) tons and tons of potential to be the most unique zombie looter/shooter/survival game that exists. It was SO SO CLOSE at release to doing so, instead lets add more broken features instead of reallocating devs and funds into making the game consistantly playable. Note- theres some good stuff they've added which we can all see and agree on without going into specifics- the updates havent been all bad that would be a straight lie. What isn't a lie is this game has really- really hit rock bottom and should NOT have had a full release in this current state- not to mention full game dropped in June and it's practically October with no real content updates or major bug fixes during this time (can definitely respond if I'm inaccurate, but this is what I see from the posted game updates on the steam page.) I really do hope that all of these comments the devs are getting are a big wake up call- and please fire or talk to the man responding to these complaints and concerns about the game- he really needs to grow up and I'd be terrified if he's above the age of 18 and/or has any real say at Gamepires. Started to remind me of the old Reign of Kings days with that dev team- least this isnt straight abandonware but it feels like it is inching closer and closer. How can we have a full release when the game doesn't have all the content that was promised in the start? How can we have a full release when there is no true transparancy about development? How can we have a full release - with a 45$ price tag- when half the people I bring to this game experience game breaking bugs in the EARLY GAME when there is truly NO LATE GAME.\n\nAlso edit: Realized theres a dev actually talking about the criticism and responding very well so take back what I said partially- still see a single dev or community guy that acts like a discord mod on steam reviews.

But here's a brief scenario... load into the game, make a stone knife to cut branches, etc., make a bow and arrows, cloth backpack etc. Start exploring towns and looting the buildings, make lock picks, find a police station and pick locks on lockers. Cool! Found weapons and ammo... check the condition and it's low... not cool, not fun. Basically a trap because if you use those damaged guns they are gonna jam or misfire when you need them. \n\nUsing a bow is really your best option in the game, and yeah it's okay but I want to use guns too. Sadly, guns are a mob magnet, and even with a suppressor they will eventually trigger a horde that spawns on your head and stun locks you until you die if you get cornered.

Marketed as a gritty, open-world survival experience with deep mechanics, it instead delivers a clunky, frustrating mess that feels like a half-baked alpha even years after its early access launch.The gameplay is a tedious slog—inventory management is a nightmare, crafting is unintuitive, and the survival elements are more annoying than immersive. The promised \"complex metabolism system\" feels like a gimmick, with hunger and thirst meters that punish you for existing rather than adding depth. Combat is janky, with hit detection that’s about as reliable as a coin toss, and the open world, while large, is a barren wasteland of repetitive landscapes and brain-dead AI.But the real rot lies in the community and moderation. The game’s servers are a cesspool of cheaters—aimbotters, wallhackers, and speed hackers run rampant, turning PvP into a farce. You’ll spend hours scavenging only to get one-shotted by some script-kiddie who teleports in with god-mode enabled. Reporting these clowns is pointless; the moderators are either absent or comically inept, ignoring blatant evidence while banning innocent players for vague \"violations.\" The official forums are a toxic echo chamber where valid criticism is drowned out by fanboys or silenced by heavy-handed mods who seem allergic to accountability.The developers, Gamepires, have coasted on promises of “future updates” for years, delivering patches that break more than they fix and ignoring the cheating epidemic. It’s clear they’ve bitten off more than they can chew, and players are left holding the bag. SCUM isn’t just a bad game—it’s an insult to anyone who paid for it, a shining example of how to alienate your player base with incompetence and neglect.

The game no longer feels like a game show, I am not sure what it is. I spawn, and it costs me 250 credits to respawn randomly anywhere if I die, so you get in debt from dying, but you have to walking simulator run for 45 minutes to an edge camped safe zone with a bank card you can drop, to deposit cash you have to farm and sell. So reasonably quickly I realised, this isn't feasible because everything is worth fuck all and you can't even carry a large turd without having to spend 5 minutes dropping it. The survival is INSANELY deep, but also, beyond the realms of non-realistically pedantic. Like, it is the most tediously painful crafting experience I have experienced even surpassing, and I don't say this lightly, Life is Feudal MMO where you could spend 2 real life days digging shovels with 10 other people to \"flatten\" the land to even start build a castle on. And that was tedious as fuck. Naturally that game died because it was shit, as I am assuming so will this one. Other than that, EU server is full of Chinese people speaking Chinese, and every 2 minutes another player accuses his attacker of being a hacker which is probably not true, but still.\n\nI think the real issue comes with, ultra hardcore perma death with extra detailed human entropy roulette wheel, combined with the CLUNKIEST jank of movement and combat that I find it hard to compare to anything other than, trying to pilot a human against ultrafast terrain glitchopping zombies like a Mechwarrior Mechpilot. It really has broken the boundaries of what I am shocked a human can actually enjoy. I have no idea how anyone is playing this, and honestly reckon most players must be hackers, not because they are pulling off crazy shots but because, they would probably need to be one in order to actually improve quality of life to play this game in any remotely enjoyable way. But I still don't condone it for even that reason.\n\nIt's a nice idea for a game I guess to a degree, but the graphics, mechanics, design, and development really let it down.\n\nI'm trying to give it a chance but deleting my character to bankrupt my debt from learning the game, actually did annoying shit like delete all my favourites in the, oh yeah, WORST UI I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. You can and must right click on everything in the game, however, you have to go click on big massive buttons to do things like, examine an item, or go back. And you have what, 12-15 pages of controls to try and work out if you decide to go change them. Typing into chat regularly goes haywire but I don't need to reply when 90% of the EU server is speaking Chinese for some reason.\n\nClunky, ugly, buggy, unintuitive, janky, boring, tedious, linear rubbish.\n\nI used to have fun on it building bases when I could actually build a bed and spawn on it, or near it, or in the same grid, or withing 50 miles of it, but those days seem gone. Chasing airdrops and gunning people down and fixing up cars and galavanting, now is like, some safezone merchant \"hunting\" spots for campers, and I guess naked running to military compounds. Honestly, like a really tedious, worse version of PUBG. With the most tedious attribute and skill levelling I've seen with \"maintenance\" like eating actual good protein to stop your strength decreasing, very cool, if you want to play a misery simulator.\n\nIt also had the cool feature where you could put a lock on the actual houses on the map, and protect your locks, but bases or survival seems to be removed from the game in place of, run and gun shooter looter with no extraction, just long term base building, that if its anything like last time I played, with get offlined every day with great ease like most of these dumb wipe loop games. \n\nShocked at how it feels much worse to play or build a base than it did last time when it had buggy zombies and buggy trees. 0/10 \n\nTL:DR Can't craft a bed and respawn at it anymore. Shit game.",

I liked the concept however its just a running simulator where you spend hours and hours finding crap lout and eventually die from a bugged out zombie and lose all your stuff. Rinse and repeat. completely pointless game. No wonder hardly anyone talks about or plays this game. Could have been something too as it had potential.",

My settings were not tampered with apart from me changing puppets not vaulting windows or opening doors so this is the default actions of the ai bandits, it's far too unbalanced and unfair.\n\nI do understand that there are options to tweak ai and make them less frequent/ less difficult etc but honestly your server settings is like reading a manual, it's so confusing to read through, so many slider bars and options and values to set i am just lost reading it so i leave it alone.\n\nIf i can give any kind of constructive feedback it is this; please re-design your settings/configure menus to be easily understandable.",
