Even before the game begins, the name alone hints at something personal, unsettling, and oddly inviting. \r\n\r\nThis psychological horror gem takes the concept of \"mommy\" character and spins it into a kaleidoscope of personalities- clones, but each a different shade of the same identity. Beneath the cute veneer and soft colors runs a surprisingly share philosophical undercurrent: escapism, identity, and what happiness even means when the walls of reality start to bend. You don't expect a game that shifts from 2D to 3D- with the sudden realization on the occasional breaking into 4th dimension. \r\n\r\nIf you're into adorable anime girls mixed with the oppressive dread of P.T. (yes, there's a level that wears its Silent Hills influence proudly- except the terror comes wrapped in kawaii aesthetics), this game is basically saying, \"Welcome home, sweetie.\"\r\n\r\nIn short, MiSide pulls off plot twists I genuinely never saw coming. It's a fantastic litmus test for how you, the player, shape the digital world- and how that world quietly shapes you right back. \r\n\r\nNote:\r\n-Game is best enjoyed with headphones and a bowl of Nude noodles",

I love the tension; getting a mini heart attack during a creepy encounter/chase, then suddenly seeing everything back to normal + meeting another cute Mita, like the game’s giving you a short breather before throwing you back into the madness\r\n\r\nMain puzzles were chill. Some of the mini-games were pain in the ass, though. Trying to perfect them ate up way too much time and reminded me how much of a noob I really am.\r\n\r\nHoping to unlock all the achievements soon!

But, the industrial revolution was not a wholly negative thing. After all, it directly led to society as we know it today, and although we theorize that we would be better off without industry, life as it is now is non-negotiable for almost everyone. There is of course, a much greater benefit of the industrial revolution: You can draw a line from the industrial revolution to the creation of MiSide, which I, for one, believe is worth the death of the climate and eventual extinction of the human animal.",

It's honestly a surprise to see a game run without any hiccups in today's age.\n\nThe voice acting is superb and really completes the experience. I love the vibrant art style. The story is intriguing and the horror doesn't rely merely on cheap jump scares. The tension builds up well and the scares pay off. It was a short five hour experience but it was enough time to get immersed in the world of MiSide and get invested in all the terrific characters.\n\nI look forward to any future content and future games by the developers.",

I saw this game's reviews and thought it would be cool, unique and interesting. It honestly wasn't any of those things.\r\nThe only thing that stood out about this game is the artstyle, cutsy, and anime. Everything else was honestly pretty cliche, and dissatisfying. It felt like I was playing through a horror trope checklist for a fair bit of the game.\r\nThe story felt like I was playing DDLC but every character was Mita. The gameplay was a list of different tropes, starting with Backrooms, to PT, to the \"don't look away from the enemy or it moves\" thing. The soundtrack was uninteresting and honestly, I can't remember if there really is any music in it. I also played the game with English voices, and the voice acting was fine, but for some reason the lines had weird pauses in them.\r\nThe game also took quite a bit of time to pick up, and even when it did, I don't think it ever got particularly interesting, The gameplay and puzzles weren't good (and honestly the game held your hand like this was your first horror game) and the story stayed kinda samey and mostly predictable throughout, other than one somewhat interesting thing at the end that ultimately has no bearing on anything else since the game has no satisfying endings.\r\nHonestly, unless you're super into the anime aesthetic, and not a huge horror game person I can't recommend this game to you. This really does feel a lot like a game designed for anime fans who aren't that big into horror, it's not unique, and honestly it's not scary.",

I love the start, very creepy, a work of art, but as time goes on, the game starts to become a little bit silly, appealing more to the \"waifus\" than the story or the horror itself.\r\nLike, don't get me wrong, the girls are GORGEOUS and the artstyle helps a ton, I'm madly in love with Mila and Cappie, but is it really all that it needs to be a great game? Because that's one of the main attractions of the game.\r\n\r\nAs for horror stops working at a certain point. God, those two minigames where you [spoiler]\"play\" with Mita[/spoiler] are so stupid and slow.\r\nIt all just stops working in a certain point and it becomes a farm for streamers and tiktoks.\r\n\r\nAs for the endings? Extremely disappointed. Of course, heavy spoilers ahead, but it's not like I'm dropping a bomb here.\r\n[spoiler]The ending where you become a cartridge? I was honestly excited because I thought this was a hald of the game. After all, from the very beginning is clear that to unlock another ending, you need to complete the main story first, right? Well, yeah, it's true, but it doesn't continue the story in any meaningful way, it's just a peaceful mode that hasn't been done yet.\r\nThe game really stops caring about the story and horror just to give the mainstream-waifu stuff more views, and goddamn, I hate to admit it, but it marketed the game pretty good.\r\nIt just feels very incomplete, the three endings are extremely anti-climatic.\r\nI've heard that they plan to make a new ending where you can save all the Mitas. I'm not aware if this is a official statement but I hope it is. Might as well change my review if they deliver.[/spoiler]\r\n\r\nAll in all, the game is okay-ish. Not the master-piece people make it to be, but it should get a positive review, or at least a \"mixed\" one if it existed anyway, right?\r\nMaybe, but my biggest annoyance with this game is that is ANOTHER game being weaponized against AAA games just like Expedition 33 is being weaponized too against them.\r\nI hate AAA corpos just like the next guy, but is it really that enough to lower the bar and give a crown to ANY indie dev that barely does the acceptable job?\r\n7/10, even 6/10 are now treated like 20/10 just because they are okayish and from an indie development, and I'm starting to get sick of it.\r\nKudos to the devs tho, not for the game itself but for the marketing work. They knew how to sell it and they made it because of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Horror and story is only good at the beginning. The rest is heavily carried by \"waifu\" stuff, \"Wow, a DDLC-like game!\" and the biggest selling point: It's made by two indie developers, but I guess that one carries it from 7/10 to 11/10 for most people nowadays.\r\nMila and Cappie are the best girls.",

Thumbs up or down is just my personal like or dislike of the game.\nPro\n[list]\n    [*] A great premise with clever use of game logic.\n    [*] While all the characters are the same character they did a good job in making them feel unique.\n    [*] A fairly short experience even if you want to 100%.\n    [*] The community put together voice work is impressive and adds just what this game needed.\n    [*] Each section of the game has some unique gameplay keeping it fresh from start to finish.\n[/list]\nCon\n[list]\n    [*] While there is promised content and other updates, releasing without controller support hurts this too much. This feels even more apparent given how clunky the controls feel.\n    [*] The beginning pacing feels far too disjointed and does very little to build up anything.\n    [*] 100%ing the game requires side activities that don't really offer much to the story or world.\n    [*] No hard save feature is an odd choice. If you quit before another chapter starts you will have to redo the chapter you are on.\n    [*] Taking away control options till they are relevant again feels awful namely running which further leads to the clunky feeling.\n[/list]",

You'd think a game about a game would use its medium in creative ways to tell its story, but it doesn't. Instead you're made to do menial tasks and walk through \"creepy\" (YMMV) settings while the voice acting does all the heavy lifting.\n\nDespite the game being about 7 hours long, the story goes nowhere. You start with a yandere going after you, you end with a yandere still going after you. Her motives, how she captured you, the inner workings of this entire system; none of this is answered or hinted at. The \"video game\" setting exists purely for imagery's sake.\n\nOnly thing I can praise about this game is that it's production value is good. Animations are great, voice acting is great, and the presentation is gorgeous. But the gameplay is equivalent to a Unity tech demo with an anime girl following you around.",

I saw this game's reviews and thought it would be cool, unique and interesting. It honestly wasn't any of those things.\r\nThe only thing that stood out about this game is the artstyle, cutsy, and anime. Everything else was honestly pretty cliche, and dissatisfying. It felt like I was playing through a horror trope checklist for a fair bit of the game.\r\nThe story felt like I was playing DDLC but every character was Mita. The gameplay was a list of different tropes, starting with Backrooms, to PT, to the \"don't look away from the enemy or it moves\" thing. The soundtrack was uninteresting and honestly, I can't remember if there really is any music in it. I also played the game with English voices, and the voice acting was fine, but for some reason the lines had weird pauses in them.\r\nThe game also took quite a bit of time to pick up, and even when it did, I don't think it ever got particularly interesting, The gameplay and puzzles weren't good (and honestly the game held your hand like this was your first horror game) and the story stayed kinda samey and mostly predictable throughout, other than one somewhat interesting thing at the end that ultimately has no bearing on anything else since the game has no satisfying endings.\r\nHonestly, unless you're super into the anime aesthetic, and not a huge horror game person I can't recommend this game to you. This really does feel a lot like a game designed for anime fans who aren't that big into horror, it's not unique, and honestly it's not scary.",
