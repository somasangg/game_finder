I've spent countless hours not just playing but also dreaming about conveyor belts, figuring out logistics, and even messing around with tools like Satisfactory Calculator and Satisfactory Modeler. Fair warning: this game is addictive as hell.\n\nMap: The world of Massage is like its own character. It’s massive, super pretty, and packed with different biomes, crazy creatures (watch out for those creepy spider things!), and hidden secrets just waiting to be found. Exploring is a fun adventure and adds even more to an already deep game.\n\nProgression: Satisfactory does a great job of gradually making things trickier. As you unlock new tiers, you get to build cooler stuff and expand your base. Jumping to nuclear power can seem intimidating at first, but using blueprints and external tools makes it way easier to handle the tough parts. These player-made tools are super helpful for designing factories and figuring out what machines you need for specific outputs.\n\nEndgame: Completing everything 100% isn’t as hard as it sounds if you stay dedicated. My only real letdown was how the story wrapped up — it felt kinda weak after all the time I put in. That said, the new content added in update 1.1 totally keeps things interesting and fresh, so I’m still hooked.",

      "review": "Satisfactory, a factory-building video game developed by Coffee Stain Studios, was officially released on September 10, 2024, on Steam. From my 300-hour experience playing Satisfactory, I am confident that this game should be rated 3.5 out of four stars.\n\tSatisfactory takes place in a technologically advanced future where the player starts out in a small rocket, landing on an uncharted planet. While on the rocket, a display screen shows the mission: to build a factory for FICSIT Corporation. Upon landing, the player notices that it looks similar to Earth, with grass and trees. The player will also discover that there are hostile alien creatures. To help navigate the environment, an AI voice, called A.D.A., talks to the player, giving instructions. Scattered across the planet are ore deposits that the player must extract resources from. Using these resources, the player will build multiple machines to refine materials as well as produce electricity. As the factory grows increasingly complex, the player is able to create an ever-expanding factory. Essentially, the player is there to create an automated process of manufacturing materials using a network of machines and conveyor belts, where the final products are sent up through a space elevator to FICSIT corporation.\n\tSatisfactory will not be entertaining for everyone, but those who have the mind of an engineer will be deeply engaged with its gameplay. At first, the game is effective at keeping your attention. There are milestones and phases that can be completed as a way of progression, and completing milestones unlocks new machines and tools. This creates a consistent feeling of advancement through the progression line for you. There are also many areas to explore throughout the alien world, providing the feeling of adventure. Additionally, Satisfactory has multiplayer support to create a more enhanced experience through collaboration and teamwork with other players. However, once you complete all the milestones there is no definite end goal anymore, which can cause a loss of interest. Also, the exploration of the game is usually overly repetitive and tedious.\n\tSatisfactory has a mysterious storyline to it that is optional to explore. Because the main goal is to construct a factory, this secondary storyline is mostly in the background. The game was mainly designed to be geared toward building a factory with efficiency, resource management, and optimization, but there is an adventurous aspect to the game. There is an incentive to explore to collect items, and sometimes there are mysterious objects that add to the story while also adding to industrial design and optimization. This storyline brings up profound questions. Because the player of the game builds a factory for a mysterious corporation, and the player is also considered their property it raises the questions towards the player: what are the motives of FICSIT, and why am I considered their property? Some strange objects can be found called Somersloops and Mercer Spheres. These strange objects cause A.D.A. to malfunction and say strange messages that come from an alien entity. This story relates to reality in a way, as sometimes we do not know the meaning of the work we do within our lives. Just like the player of the game sometimes we blindly follow our passions or routines without asking the question: is this truly meaningful?\n\tOverall, Satisfactory is a highly exceptional video game. It is a very thought-provoking game, intentionally designed and geared towards engineering and automation. Its great progression design keeps you engaged in the experience, but its exploration is more mundane. Additionally, Satisfactory’s background story raises many questions about the true meaning of the player’s identity within the game. For these reasons, I give Satisfactory a 3.5 out of four stars and recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a challenge through industrial design.\n\nI did this review for a college essay and now I will post it here.

I also would like to add that this game's attention to detail is just mind-blowing, machines and item models really immerse you into this new planet and really, REALLY make this game addicting. There is so much more to say, but this review is getting too long so thank you, and its been Pax!",

Coffee Stain never stopped making Satisfactory the best game it could be, when it was already in a state many others would have called it finished. Now it is easily the best automation game out there. Sometimes it can be a lot of work, but the game always feels like it gives you just enough tools for that work to never feel boring. It'll make you think you did something quick and efficiently, when it actually took all day.\nNow if they would just fix the dang pipes.",

The game does a nice job introducing you to the game by giving you simple tasks first that progressively gets bigger in scale the more you complete them. There is also story progression for those interested but it's definitely not the spotlight. \r\nOne thing I have a problem with is that setting up railways is always the biggest pain in the behind.

My favorite part, the machine designs are just breathtaking, from the humble constructor to the towering particle accelerator, the sound they make, the small mesmerizing animations to the scale of the sounds, with some of the best in class sound design I've ever had the chance to experience, clunking metal, tensing wires, electric hums, and above all the dreadful fuse blowing up. I love this game, and I hate this game, it kept me sane during a very dark period in my life, but can suck the life out of you if you let it, looking for that moment, when you look for a high vantage point to admire the delicate dance of the massive mega-factory you just got finally running after 400hrs of planning, dragging resource buses literal kilometers, fixing that pesky train signal issue,  and finagling conveyor belts in too little space... that glorious moment, when everything just works, the sound of a 1000 machines and the flow of finished products is an itch that I can only scratch with this work of love, passion and talent.

The game rewards systematic thinking, optimization, and clean design. It doesn't need to be clean, but the real satisfaction comes from building a factory that’s not just functional but organized and efficient. I think it's because I have seen a factory that is awful in real life, I just want to prove I can make something better here.\n\nCompared to Factorio, Satisfactory is easier to get into for me (don't hate me pls). The 3D perspective matters more for me because the space feels intuitive when you can literally walk through your production line, climb on top of a higest point and see your factory work.

Simply things and ideas that i believe would make the game more enjoyable.\r\n\r\n- Please add aircrafts with seats, trains have it, trucks have it, would make late game transportation much more enjoyable. Other transportation methods as well, Dirt bikes for quick exploration, bulldozers for clearing out terrain, Boats, barges to take advantage of the ocean. Submarines?\r\n- Underwater ressources, would allow better use of the ocean as well and fun new mechanics (clay as new ressource? Sea water could be treated in refineries to obtain fresh water and salt blocks, with fresh water still obtainable from lakes and rivers?)\r\n- Radiation shielding, not expecting no radiation from containers, but perhaps a costly upgrade to containers to reduce radiation from stored radioactive materials. Shielded walls/foundations/gates would be even better. Lead could be a new ressource used for that.\r\n- I'd love to see new maps which would help introduce the previous ideas, that way you don't need to modify the current map. Could have different materials, recipes, and a follow up to project save the day. As much as i'd love it being a free update, i recognize that amount of effort would not be cheap, worst case scenario it could be a DLC addon like most games do.\r\n- This one is mostly a bug: I get issues using the customizer on trains, mainly when they render in and out. Would be cool if that issue gets fixed. (i can give more details or screenshots if you reach out)",

All these issues were reported almost immediately after their first appearance in the game, it means that an important part of the game logistics is remaining broken for more than 6 months already.\n\n[olist]\n[*] Vertical splitters / mergers have a 1m offset if you try to build them on a lift section between conveyor lift hole. This one is the most annoying because you can't align splitters / mergers with the machines without offsetting machines as well. \n[*] Nudge doesn't work for vertical splitters / mergers. This one is not big because they are can not be placed as separate buildings anyway but that would help with aligning issues. \n[*] If you ever disconnect the lift from the placed vertical splitter / merger and try to build a lift again, it will get a 0.5m offset and will not ever align with other floors, also all new vertical splitter / mergers will get 0.5m offset too. \n[*] If you rebuild the lift start or end, it doesn't resume operation if it was connected to the splitter / merger.\n[/olist]\n\nI don't find this to be \"normal\" for an already released game. I wouldn't mind that much if it still was an early access product but releasing things in such state and not fixing them for months afterwards is discouraging.

It has a decent amount of content in it.\n\nMy problem however is with the purpose you have in the game and the lack of variety of things to do.\n\nUltimately, all you are doing in this game is just making factories for the sake of making bigger and better factories. That's it. Exploration? It's just for finding new rare resources or for new sites to build more factories. Survival? It's just for making more factories. Factories are all that matter in this game ultimately.\n\nBut what is a factory except just a means to an end - an end that doesn't even exist in this game?\n\nI've had people try to hype me up for the game talking about: \"Oooh, but there's a space elevator!\" Cool, can you personally take that space elevator to space and build your own space station with a shipyard, and then build a fleet of warships out of separate customizeable parts/blocks/etc, and then take that fleet to go conquer another solar system and/or planets? No? Then what's the point of the space elevator? It's not really a space elevator at all! It's just another factory component disguised as a \"space elevator\".\n\nThere are no starships you can build, no solar systems to conquer, not even FPS combat with aliens - It's just endless factory-grinding, resource-processing, and conveyor belt spam. Given you can't actually do anything meaningful with your factory except make a bigger factory, what's even the point of it? It's just a gigantic waste of time.\n\nWhen I play a game, I want to feel like there's an actual greater purpose and massive goals to accomplish and hurdles to overcome and villains to defeat, rather than just endless grinding for the sake of endless grinding. If I'm going to grind with factory work in the game, it better be for the end goal of building something amazing that can do amazing things to complete an amazing goal - and by \"amazing\", I mean something other than just being another piece of factory equipment.\n\nWhy can't I build starships and go explore the galaxy? I don't want to sit around doing endless factory spam. I want to build tanks, ships and space cruisers and then go crush the local wildlife and conquer alien civilizations with what my factories have made. I want to build automatic rifles with high-capacity magazines and render certain undesireable local alien wildlife extinct. I even want to explore strange new worlds and colonize them with such notoriety that it makes the Klendathu Drop from Starship Troopers look like a toddler's birthday party and so I get a holiday made in my name, and centuries later that holiday gets virulently hated by some blue-haired nutcase college-age space-kids with nose rings and daddy-issues.\n\nBut nope, you can't do any of that in this game. It's just more and more factory nonsense.\n\nSuffice to say, this game is definitely not for me.\n\nI'm going back to Empyrion Galactic Survival.",

There is not enough \"game\" in this game to offset the level of late game G.R.I.N.D.\n\nI have studied Lean and SixSigma and have more than a decade of experience in assembly line based manufacturing processes and optimization. I find great joy in creating well designed, automated, optimized manufacturing lines. So this game was made for me and it does starts very strong. Super fun for the first 30 hours, colorful, well described tasks, quirky humor. Unfortunately it falls into the usual trap of the survival/crafting genre. You start like collect some wood to power your iron mine and forge to make some iron rods. Easy enough. 50 hours in and you make something like a pseudodimensional crystaline resonator matter vessel using similar non-sense base materials. The grounded early game goes out of the window. Annoying.\n \nMy main gripe is that around and over phase 3, the game drops the fun and turns into pure time sink. Grind for the sake of grind. Make 1000 of an item that takes 2 mins per. That alone takes 33 hours game time. Sure you can bump up the speed but it has such ridiculous base material and energy needs that your smelters can't keep up. Also, while your mines can upgrade, your factories can't. You need to build more and more of those to handle the mine. Vertical building is encouraged, but managing the conveyors and the spliters/mergers on vertical builds is a major pain. At one point, you say F. it and accept the fact the stuff will just hang in the air and clip like hell. This will trigger everyone with the type of OCD that actually made you play the game the first place. Turns the initially fun gameplay into a frustrating endgame grind.  \n\nAlso, you really don't need any of the transports. conveyors work perfectly fine. You don't transport raw materials on anything other than conveyors. You move the end items over longer distance. For that, even your inventory is good enough. Tubes, grid switches, useless. If you create a robust electric grid, there will be power to run everything all the time and zipline and jetpack around.",

This one is the most annoying because you can't align splitters / mergers with the machines without offsetting machines as well. \n[*] Nudge doesn't work for vertical splitters / mergers. This one is not big because they are can not be placed as separate buildings anyway but that would help with aligning issues. \n[*] If you ever disconnect the lift from the placed vertical splitter / merger and try to build a lift again, it will get a 0.5m offset and will not ever align with other floors, also all new vertical splitter / mergers will get 0.5m offset too. \n[*] If you rebuild the lift start or end, it doesn't resume operation if it was connected to the splitter / merger.\n[/olist]\n\nI don't find this to be \"normal\" for an already released game. I wouldn't mind that much if it still was an early access product but releasing things in such state and not fixing them for months afterwards is discouraging.

I even want to explore strange new worlds and colonize them with such notoriety that it makes the Klendathu Drop from Starship Troopers look like a toddler's birthday party and so I get a holiday made in my name, and centuries later that holiday gets virulently hated by some blue-haired nutcase college-age space-kids with nose rings and daddy-issues.\n\nBut nope, you can't do any of that in this game. It's just more and more factory nonsense.\n\nSuffice to say, this game is definitely not for me.\n\nI'm going back to Empyrion Galactic Survival.",

Nothing makes sense at all.\nMaybe its 1.1 bug or something.\nFor this reason, I am out. Have fun everyone. Cheers.",

And one of the biggest Bug Glitches that they have known about for 5 years and been actively avoiding is now the issue, where a Constructor with no upgrades or sloop suddenly needs 5 Billion MW of power to run, so it will trip the breakers on every system, even when I have rearranged the power distribution so that Water Extractors and the likes have their own constant power. I have tapped every Geo Thermal on the map but instead of producing what they say they produce, they only 1 to 5 MW, less than the garbage bio gens on the Hub. \n\nAlso, I posted about this issue on their forums, and it was automatically deleted, despite not violating any of their rules, with my account being given a 7 day Temp ban.   They have no interest in fixing this festering pile of garbage, because they have already tricked people out of their money for an Incomplete Game, that they lied about it being a Full Release.",
