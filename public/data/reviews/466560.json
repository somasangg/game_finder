      "review": "Okay so I have over 450 hours in this game and still intend on adding more. This game scratches my need for a good RTS game, yet also brings a fresh style/gameplay to the genre. It has different gameplay styles for Co-op which is something I have always wanted in my RTS style games. Especially when it adds modifiers to bring out some buffs and extra fun. The Bifrost mode is both really enjoyable and cooperative intensive yet frustratingly hard sometimes. This game really does bring out so much of the fun in RTS that I could only hope other games of the genre incorporate into their games Co-op modes. I also cant wait for the upcoming December update that should be adding more to these modes.\n\nNow things I have noticed that others have also mentioned. Yes after long playtimes there seems to be something that causes lag or some kind of connection issues when you didn't have an ounce of them before. Doesn't seem to matter which connection you choose either, after about 806-809 AD time in game, it seems to struggle to keep a good connection in any game mode. Or You will experience lag or time stops for only one of the players.\nTo be fair though, these are nothing compared to the struggles we had when this game first came out with its multiplayer, that was a nightmare, constant drops, constant lag. Now it seems to really only affect long timed games. I Hope to see more updates and fixes on these soon.\n\nBesides that, the rest of the game is amazing and enjoyable and I can repeat the Conquest and Bifrost modes with friends over and over and I enjoy the small rewards/cosmetics for your first completions. I would recommend maybe adding another cosmetic for regular villagers, one for each clan maybe? Maybe getting that cosmetic would be by completing a second Conquest with that clan? Or each time you Complete a Bifrost with a clan for the first time? Just ways to suggest even more replayability in these modes. I hope some more fixes for the connection stuff come with the new update and extended game modes. I hope we see even more new clans. Even though everyone says they are just reskins of the same clans, once you play each one and try playing them in the Co-op modes, they really do have different checks and balances that can make each map harder or easier. \n\nAlso the whole \"THE BOTS CHEAT\" thing is true, instead of other games like Age of Mythology as an example, making each Bot act exactly like a player. The Bots get an auto income of resources regardless of how many plots they have, can summon their villagers in a wave of 3 sometimes, and can resummon their Warchief even without mining Iron or Stone. But I get why this is easier than forcing the Bots to act and resource manage like the player for a higher challenge as well as its easier on the developers and coding. Yet I won't deny its irritating to watch the Bots with three land plots or several empty plots pushing troops like its free and sending waves at objectives or your own land to try to steal. Especially early on when you are just trying to get enough food and wood for winter. So maybe the suggestion could be to fix this, or limit how much auto resources they get and make them at least have to act more like the player?\n\nI highly suggest this game for anyone who likes an RTS with a bit of a twist on the resource grab/management style. If you liked AOM, SC2, WC3, AOE, DoW or any games similar to those, this game scratches those itches, while still being different in its own way. This game is awesome and fun and with the continuation of updates and features on the way I am still as excited and stoked with playing time and time again with my friends as I was in the beginning.\nTo those that read the whole thing, thank you for reading my TED talk long review on Northgard.",

It's a shame there will be no more content, but the content in the game is enough to have hundreds of hours of gameplay.

It's a heck of a lot of fun with your friends and it just scratches that itch of a Zone Style City Builder/RTS fun where you manage resources and build your clan up how you see fit. Each Clan has a unique play style that it leans towards in how your build order goes out to what military units you want to use in combat. Yes they don't really explain the which clan is more effective early, mid or late game but that's the point in which you play each clan and figure out their playstyle. If you haven't already gotten this game I suggest picking up the Definitive Edition that's coming up Dec. 4th. The only con I had with this game was the massive amount of DLC where each clan is an add-on but I'm kind of ok with the pricing - some clans more than others. Some are just copy pasta but for most of all the DLC it's been worth it in my eyes. I've had a blast and I'll continue to enjoy this game into the future.",

      "review": "Northgard is a fun but often frustrating game which lets you manage a small colony against a wide variety of threats. These threats range from wolves to ravenous foxes, mystical creatures, draugurs, starvation, cold, the kraken, etc. etc. and of course... your enemy.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed this game and have spent most of my time in the conquest mode, playing on the hardest difficulty with all base clans. I have one major complaints is that it feels the AI gets a large amount of cheats, often fielding armies 3-4x the size of my army by the time I meet them. They can usually be cheesed or whittled down but you cannot beat some combinations of terrain and AI aggression. (tip: If you retreat from a neutral land, the AI usually retreats back to their land. This can be repeated infinitely I believe.) You can usually scratch by with food but this also can be very tight, every game tends to have different challenges.\r\n\r\n[b]This is not a micro heavy game[/b], it favors efficient use of your villagers and you never control very many units in your army for the base game. I kind of like this, and its worth trying for the base game. The biggest problem I have with it is when first encountering DLC factions it can \"feel\" unfair especially against Dragonkin, but you are usually able to make it through. Don't be afraid to reset the map in Conquest, I have seen spawns that seem impossible, even to me.\r\n\r\nSome specific complaints:\r\n1. POPUPS DURING COMBAT - Having to click twice has cost me a few units over my time playing the game.\r\n2. Game tends to favor grouping up your army into one death ball, there is very little reason to split except for abusing AI.\r\n3. Military is too expensive, it's very difficult for the player to replace it, even with a large population. Perhaps adding a gold upkeep would work better, definitely could help with mad rushes to defend. Using your villagers in combat is an effective strategy and can work in a crunch to swing back, but this is a surefire way to starve in the short term. (The AI never does this.)\r\n4. You cannot tell your towers what unit to attack, it would also be nice to build an additional tower.\r\n\r\nSome of my favorite things to do:\r\n1. Steal enemy Altar of Kings\r\n2. Outmanuever the silly bots and kill lonely units, especially warchiefs. It's very hard for them to bounce back.\r\n3. With the Wolf Clan, hunting is well done and fun.\r\n4. Starve for most of the game until I finally get enough land to stop starving.",

      "review": "Review:\n\nIf you're a fan of strategy games that offer a perfect balance of resource management, exploration, and combat, then Northgard is a hidden gem you absolutely shouldn’t miss. Set in a vibrant world inspired by Norse mythology, this real-time strategy game takes you on an epic journey to colonize and conquer a wild, untamed land.\n\nThe beauty of Northgard lies in its simplicity and depth. The core mechanics are easy to grasp, but the strategic decisions you make are anything but simple. You control a clan of Vikings, and your main goal is to expand your territory, gather resources, build up your settlement, and defend it from both the harsh environment and rival clans. Whether you’re managing your villagers, deciding where to build structures, or planning military campaigns, the decisions you make always feel impactful.\n\nWhat I love:\n\nUnique Faction Playstyles: Each clan in Northgard comes with its own unique abilities, strengths, and playstyles. Whether you're leading the aggressive Wolf Clan, the resourceful Raven Clan, or the peaceful Elk Clan, every faction feels different and offers a fresh challenge.\n\nStunning Art Direction: The art style is gorgeous! The world of Northgard is full of rich forests, snowy mountains, and peaceful lakes, all brought to life with stunning visuals. The animation is fluid, and it’s easy to get lost in the beautiful Nordic landscape.\n\nChallenging Survival Elements: This game isn’t just about building an empire; it’s also about surviving. The environment can be unforgiving, with harsh winters that threaten your food supply and wildlife that can attack your settlement. Surviving through these conditions is a constant challenge that makes each game feel intense and rewarding.\n\nMultiplayer and Replayability: The multiplayer mode is fantastic, allowing you to compete with friends or random players in competitive matches. Plus, with different maps, factions, and strategies, each game feels fresh and offers high replayability.\n\nWhat could be improved:\n\nAI Behavior: While the game does a great job at offering a challenge, the AI could use a bit more refinement in some of the later stages. Occasionally, enemy clans seem to take actions that are a bit too predictable, making them easier to counter.\n\nResource Management in the Late Game: As you expand and grow your settlement, resource management can sometimes feel a bit overwhelming. More automation options or clearer ways to manage your growing empire would be a welcome addition for players who want to focus more on strategic decision-making and less on micromanagement.\n\nOverall:\nNorthgard is an incredibly well-rounded strategy game that offers a fantastic experience for fans of resource management, survival, and tactical gameplay. Its Norse-inspired world, combined with unique factions and challenging survival mechanics, make it a game that’s hard to put down. Whether you’re in it for the story, the strategic depth, or just the pure fun of exploration and conquest, Northgard delivers in every way.\n\nFinal Verdict: 8/10 – A charming and challenging strategy game with plenty of replayability. A must-try for fantasy Viking and RT strategy enthusiasts!",

For unknown reason the game got laggy so badly in the late game, even though I play single player and there was only 1 enemy left. My population is <40. Even after defeating the enemy, it still lags. My computer did not struggle to run the game though, so I don't know what is causing the FPS drop and lag.\r\n\r\nSecond is balance. Story mode is fine, but conquest is horrible. It doesn't make sense to play in normal difficulty where 4 enemies just attack you, 2-3 clans at one time (while you are fending off wolf/fox/draugr attack from neighboring tile). Worse if the enemy is dragon clan with their ridiculously powerful army and somehow the AI can amass such big army 20 minutes into the game.\r\n\r\nLastly and the most forgivable one is bad UX:\r\n1. Clicking your unit automatically scrolls the map to the unit. So if you want a unit to build in a different tile, you need to create the building in the tile, click on the unit (not villager) which scrolls to it, then move to the building tile to ask it to build. It gets crazy in the late game when your settlement is inevitably occupy large tiles as each can only support 3-4 buildings.\r\n2. Notification sometimes cover the entire screen, so when you're in the middle of doing something (e.g selecting what to upgrade in blacksmith, browsing trade route choices), the entire process is aborted. And if you accidentally clicked on anything in the screen, that huge notification is gone without trace, so I don't know what was that.\r\n\r\nFrom gameplay mechanic perspective, the game is quite bloated. The game has 9 types of resource (food, wood, stone, iron, krown (money), lore, fame, military experience, happiness). N I N E! That is more than 4x Warcraft3 and 2x Age of Empires.

On paper, the concept is great you manage which buildings to place in each region you control, expand your territory, and defend your lands from invaders. Sounds promising, right? Unfortunately, in practice, it falls short. Even a simple threat, like a lone wolf, can wipe out multiple villagers because the defensive systems are poorly balanced. You’re limited to only one tower per region, and that single tower is almost useless in combat enemies often destroy it without taking a single casualty. This leaves you relying almost entirely on your warriors, who are very limited in number. You constantly face a frustrating choice  spread your units thin to defend multiple areas and risk losing villagers, or focus on attacking and watch your population dwindle. The balance makes little sense. Towers should either be far stronger, or there shouldn’t be any restriction on the number you can build. Villagers themselves are also far too fragile, leaving defensive gameplay repetitive and often pointless. Natural disasters, like earthquakes, create additional headaches by setting buildings on fire while your villagers stand idly by. Micromanaging repairs at such a granular level becomes tedious and breaks the flow of the game. It would have been far more engaging if villagers could automatically repair damage or handle minor threats on their own. Despite its problems, the game still has a lot of potential. The strategy elements, territorial expansion, and building management are interesting, and the visuals are impressive. With better balancing and smarter automation, it could easily become a standout strategy title but as it stands, the bugs and design flaws make it a frustrating experience.",

      "review": "The game looks nice. Plays similar to some of the original Warcraft / Red Alert type RTS games as far as controls, resource gathering, upgrading, base building and army building go. Though significantly more simplified, and with less impact. Story mode seems written for a younger audience. It's alright, but very basic and slow paced. Getting locked into story animations / cinematics if having to repeat anything is a bit annoying, given the slow pacing. I found that there wasn't always an option to skip everything. It's a fairly easy game, but still decently enjoyable thanks to an appealing concept, a fun theme, and decent visuals accompanying the nostalgic value. I don't find it complex enough to call it challenging, but it's familiar and nostalgic enough, while offering a new environment and look to explore for those who have enjoyed similarly played games in the past. Found it to be a relaxing playthrough. \n\nClasses don't feel as unique or distinct as I'd like. It doesn't feel important what kind of military units I train - they all seem more or less the same as far as effectiveness in most situations. Defence towers feel very underwhelming. Base layout and design in addition to army building both feel much less important than in other games of this format. Build order in all regards (base, army, upgrades) feels unimportant. Resource management is one of the few things that feels necessary to pay attention to, as if you let your resource management derail - it does throw a wrench into pretty much everything. Troops supplied by allied forces, don't seem to hot-key properly, which makes controlling them a bit of a nuisance. I do like that each of the leader figures that you get to play as, comes with their own unique benefits. Somewhat similar in the sense that choosing a different nation in the \"Civillization\" games might in a much more simplistic manner. \"Racial perks\" if you will. It is worth noting the hero perks, even though the impact isn't as poignant as they could be - they do make a difference.\n\nBiggest issue, which is a game-breaking issue. Upon killing the final \"boss\" on chapter 11, the game crashes instantly & fails to provide credit for the victory. So the game is stuck in a constant loop at this point and cannot be passed. I have a fairly up to date, high-end rig designed for much more than anything this game can throw at it. Everything is up to date. I have cleared cache, reinstalled, replayed the game again to that point, loaded the game via both startup options, all drivers are up to date, have tried turning off any potentially problematic options in game, and dialling down all the graphics settings to no avail. All of my graphics settings are in order and optimized No issues with any other software, game or anything except for the Chapter 11 victory in this game. Have tested at least 20 times trying different solutions to give it a fair shot and the benefit of the doubt. Each instance always ending with the same result at the same moment. A quick google search did show other people having this issue, but seemingly no resolution. As a completionist, this is frustrating. But it's an impassable obstacle in my progression. Unfortunately, as much as I'd like to thumbs-up the game - a bug that prevents completion is a big nope for me. Doesn't seem that everybody has the same issue, but that has been my experience, and one I've read about a number of times. Perhaps I've overlooked a solution, but not so far as I can tell. Would love to see a solution and give it another shot. But story mode of any game should definitely be in the very least functional for everybody within reason.",

I like that it’s more accessible for casual players - RTS games are notoriously difficult to get into because of the learning curve.\n\nI only play PvE and I can beat both normal & hard difficulties pretty consistently. I don't play on extreme as I always get obliterated - not just by the AI but by the environment too (e.g. fallen sailors). The AI is not very smart, it reacts poorly to counterattacks and once you get the upper hand in a fight, it will keep sending in units one by one in desperation.\n\nIf there’s one mechanic I hate, it’s the raids. If you play as Raven, you’re able raid your opponents’ shorelines with the click of a button. The worst thing is, there’s no defense against this - you must evacuate your villagers every single time. I don’t think a mechanic where your opponent can force you to react & halt your production with a single click belongs in an RTS game.\n\nIf one of your tiles gets raided often, you might think building a defense tower is a good idea. It’s not. The defense towers in this game are disappointing to say the least. You must rely on your army to defend your tiles, fortifications are not an option unfortunately.\n\nI would love to see some QoL improvements. For example, it would be great if villagers could be assigned to buildings under construction. Is there a reason why two villagers can't build one building?\n\nI may disagree with some design choices, but I don’t think it’s a bad game. The reason I’m leaning towards “no” is that I experience technical issues on a regular basis. I don’t know if it’s just me, but the game suffers from lag, especially after playing for a while (in singleplayer!). It becomes difficult to click buildings, control units and it’s just not a good experience.",

For unknown reason the game got laggy so badly in the late game, even though I play single player and there was only 1 enemy left. My population is <40. Even after defeating the enemy, it still lags. My computer did not struggle to run the game though, so I don't know what is causing the FPS drop and lag.\r\n\r\nSecond is balance. Story mode is fine, but conquest is horrible. It doesn't make sense to play in normal difficulty where 4 enemies just attack you, 2-3 clans at one time (while you are fending off wolf/fox/draugr attack from neighboring tile). Worse if the enemy is dragon clan with their ridiculously powerful army and somehow the AI can amass such big army 20 minutes into the game.\r\n\r\nLastly and the most forgivable one is bad UX:\r\n1. Clicking your unit automatically scrolls the map to the unit. So if you want a unit to build in a different tile, you need to create the building in the tile, click on the unit (not villager) which scrolls to it, then move to the building tile to ask it to build. It gets crazy in the late game when your settlement is inevitably occupy large tiles as each can only support 3-4 buildings.\r\n2. Notification sometimes cover the entire screen, so when you're in the middle of doing something (e.g selecting what to upgrade in blacksmith, browsing trade route choices), the entire process is aborted. And if you accidentally clicked on anything in the screen, that huge notification is gone without trace, so I don't know what was that.\r\n\r\nFrom gameplay mechanic perspective, the game is quite bloated. The game has 9 types of resource (food, wood, stone, iron, krown (money), lore, fame, military experience, happiness). N I N E! That is more than 4x Warcraft3 and 2x Age of Empires.

On paper, the concept is great you manage which buildings to place in each region you control, expand your territory, and defend your lands from invaders. Sounds promising, right? Unfortunately, in practice, it falls short. Even a simple threat, like a lone wolf, can wipe out multiple villagers because the defensive systems are poorly balanced. You’re limited to only one tower per region, and that single tower is almost useless in combat enemies often destroy it without taking a single casualty. This leaves you relying almost entirely on your warriors, who are very limited in number. You constantly face a frustrating choice  spread your units thin to defend multiple areas and risk losing villagers, or focus on attacking and watch your population dwindle. The balance makes little sense. Towers should either be far stronger, or there shouldn’t be any restriction on the number you can build. Villagers themselves are also far too fragile, leaving defensive gameplay repetitive and often pointless. Natural disasters, like earthquakes, create additional headaches by setting buildings on fire while your villagers stand idly by. Micromanaging repairs at such a granular level becomes tedious and breaks the flow of the game. It would have been far more engaging if villagers could automatically repair damage or handle minor threats on their own. Despite its problems, the game still has a lot of potential. The strategy elements, territorial expansion, and building management are interesting, and the visuals are impressive. With better balancing and smarter automation, it could easily become a standout strategy title but as it stands, the bugs and design flaws make it a frustrating experience.",

      "review": "The game looks nice. Plays similar to some of the original Warcraft / Red Alert type RTS games as far as controls, resource gathering, upgrading, base building and army building go. Though significantly more simplified, and with less impact. Story mode seems written for a younger audience. It's alright, but very basic and slow paced. Getting locked into story animations / cinematics if having to repeat anything is a bit annoying, given the slow pacing. I found that there wasn't always an option to skip everything. It's a fairly easy game, but still decently enjoyable thanks to an appealing concept, a fun theme, and decent visuals accompanying the nostalgic value. I don't find it complex enough to call it challenging, but it's familiar and nostalgic enough, while offering a new environment and look to explore for those who have enjoyed similarly played games in the past. Found it to be a relaxing playthrough. \n\nClasses don't feel as unique or distinct as I'd like. It doesn't feel important what kind of military units I train - they all seem more or less the same as far as effectiveness in most situations. Defence towers feel very underwhelming. Base layout and design in addition to army building both feel much less important than in other games of this format. Build order in all regards (base, army, upgrades) feels unimportant. Resource management is one of the few things that feels necessary to pay attention to, as if you let your resource management derail - it does throw a wrench into pretty much everything. Troops supplied by allied forces, don't seem to hot-key properly, which makes controlling them a bit of a nuisance. I do like that each of the leader figures that you get to play as, comes with their own unique benefits. Somewhat similar in the sense that choosing a different nation in the \"Civillization\" games might in a much more simplistic manner. \"Racial perks\" if you will. It is worth noting the hero perks, even though the impact isn't as poignant as they could be - they do make a difference.\n\nBiggest issue, which is a game-breaking issue. Upon killing the final \"boss\" on chapter 11, the game crashes instantly & fails to provide credit for the victory. So the game is stuck in a constant loop at this point and cannot be passed. I have a fairly up to date, high-end rig designed for much more than anything this game can throw at it. Everything is up to date. I have cleared cache, reinstalled, replayed the game again to that point, loaded the game via both startup options, all drivers are up to date, have tried turning off any potentially problematic options in game, and dialling down all the graphics settings to no avail. All of my graphics settings are in order and optimized No issues with any other software, game or anything except for the Chapter 11 victory in this game. Have tested at least 20 times trying different solutions to give it a fair shot and the benefit of the doubt. Each instance always ending with the same result at the same moment. A quick google search did show other people having this issue, but seemingly no resolution. As a completionist, this is frustrating. But it's an impassable obstacle in my progression. Unfortunately, as much as I'd like to thumbs-up the game - a bug that prevents completion is a big nope for me. Doesn't seem that everybody has the same issue, but that has been my experience, and one I've read about a number of times. Perhaps I've overlooked a solution, but not so far as I can tell. Would love to see a solution and give it another shot. But story mode of any game should definitely be in the very least functional for everybody within reason.",

      "review": "I’m on the fence about this game.\n\nI appreciate that it’s trying to do something different. Northgard is not like other RTS games. It’s a bit more simplified & restricted. I like that it’s more accessible for casual players - RTS games are notoriously difficult to get into because of the learning curve.\n\nI only play PvE and I can beat both normal & hard difficulties pretty consistently. I don't play on extreme as I always get obliterated - not just by the AI but by the environment too (e.g. fallen sailors). The AI is not very smart, it reacts poorly to counterattacks and once you get the upper hand in a fight, it will keep sending in units one by one in desperation.\n\nIf there’s one mechanic I hate, it’s the raids. If you play as Raven, you’re able raid your opponents’ shorelines with the click of a button. The worst thing is, there’s no defense against this - you must evacuate your villagers every single time. I don’t think a mechanic where your opponent can force you to react & halt your production with a single click belongs in an RTS game.\n\nIf one of your tiles gets raided often, you might think building a defense tower is a good idea. It’s not. The defense towers in this game are disappointing to say the least. You must rely on your army to defend your tiles, fortifications are not an option unfortunately.\n\nI would love to see some QoL improvements. For example, it would be great if villagers could be assigned to buildings under construction. Is there a reason why two villagers can't build one building?\n\nI may disagree with some design choices, but I don’t think it’s a bad game. The reason I’m leaning towards “no” is that I experience technical issues on a regular basis. I don’t know if it’s just me, but the game suffers from lag, especially after playing for a while (in singleplayer!). It becomes difficult to click buildings, control units and it’s just not a good experience.",

      "review": "The game was fun after learning the basics, but few things ruined it for me.\r\n\r\nFirst is performance. For unknown reason the game got laggy so badly in the late game, even though I play single player and there was only 1 enemy left. My population is <40. Even after defeating the enemy, it still lags. My computer did not struggle to run the game though, so I don't know what is causing the FPS drop and lag.\r\n\r\nSecond is balance. Story mode is fine, but conquest is horrible. It doesn't make sense to play in normal difficulty where 4 enemies just attack you, 2-3 clans at one time (while you are fending off wolf/fox/draugr attack from neighboring tile). Worse if the enemy is dragon clan with their ridiculously powerful army and somehow the AI can amass such big army 20 minutes into the game.\r\n\r\nLastly and the most forgivable one is bad UX:\r\n1. Clicking your unit automatically scrolls the map to the unit. So if you want a unit to build in a different tile, you need to create the building in the tile, click on the unit (not villager) which scrolls to it, then move to the building tile to ask it to build. It gets crazy in the late game when your settlement is inevitably occupy large tiles as each can only support 3-4 buildings.\r\n2. Notification sometimes cover the entire screen, so when you're in the middle of doing something (e.g selecting what to upgrade in blacksmith, browsing trade route choices), the entire process is aborted. And if you accidentally clicked on anything in the screen, that huge notification is gone without trace, so I don't know what was that.\r\n\r\nFrom gameplay mechanic perspective, the game is quite bloated. The game has 9 types of resource (food, wood, stone, iron, krown (money), lore, fame, military experience, happiness). N I N E! That is more than 4x Warcraft3 and 2x Age of Empires. Your villagers will struggle trying to balance them without drowned in curse of dimensionality.",
