      "review": "If you are new to the Drone/Quad/FPV hobby, this is not an \"optional\" purchase... It is your VERY VERY FIRST PURCHASE!!! I cannot stress this enough. If I had anyyyy cluuuuue jusst how simple everybody on youtube makes it look, to fly a quadcopter in all these different amazing ways - I could have saved myself nearly $2k that I spent on my initial purchase when I thought that I was \"ready\" to join the hobby... When in reality - I wouldd have never even thought about spending a dime more in the FPV/quad section of the RC world, if I had just listened to bardwell and everybody else, annd ONLY PURCHASED LIFTOFF & A DECENT ELRS RADIO that has BLE built in, FIRST!!!... All the youtuber's tell you to learn with sim, but I ignored that becausue I am not like most people when it comes to learning how to control any kind of vehicle. I have always been a easy & lightning fast learner in general, but especially when it comes to getting a feeling for new mechines & controlling them. I was 7 years old the first time I drove a car. it was a 1996 Ford Expedition, and the link between my brain and the vehicle was almost instanious. My own first car was a 5 speed stick shift - Got that down within 10 minutes of watching my uncle drive it in a parking lot from the passenger seat while he explained what he was doing/why... First time I rode a motorcycle, I lied to the owner and said I had owned one before - Literally rode it one way down the street to learn the clutch and shift pattern, turned around, and rode a wheelie past the owner on my 2nd pass not even 30 seconds later.... Later in life, I got in the drivers seat of a bobcat, and then an excavator and the exact same thing happened... I have ALWAYS been an absolute \"natural\" when it comes to learning the controls of any kind of mechanical object and almost instantly feeling as if I was \"one with the machine\" because the controls always feel like they're second nature to me, to the point where I have never needed to think about, or consciously calculate what my hands or feet are doing with the controls... They just do whats needed, 100% naturally without any thought, and without error...Ever, after being in one vehicle or another everyday for the past 20yrs now.... after I feel each of the controls, and undnerstand how they work, the attention/brainpower I have had to put into anyhting has always gone from 100% conscious thought, to 0% conscious & 100% SUBconscious, within minutes of learning in the real world... Mmy first nitro Traxxas RC Car?? Same exact thing there even... No matter what kind of mechanics I've thrown at myself, I have never struggled with the controls or getting a feeling for the machcine's limits.... UNTIL I TRIED TO FLY A QUAD... lol NOOOOBODY TELLS YOU HOW SIMPLE THEY MAKE FLYING DRONES LOOK ON YOUTUBE, COMPARED TO HOW MUCH ACTUAL TIME THEY'VE HAD TO SPEND LEARNING TO FLY AS WELL AS THEY DO... They all say to put 10 hours into the simulator first. but that's about all they ever say... Had I listened and thought that wouldnt appply to me - I 100% would have never spent a dime pastpaying for liftoff & my radio. I would have nevvvver considered trying to learn how to fly a quad-rotor after my first hour in liftoff... I am now, currently almost 3 years & over 100hrs into the sim, and STILL have not put my BNF drone I made the mistake of purchasing, in the air, in real life, other than just to hover around and make sure that it worked for less than 1 pack.\r\n\r\nThat \"One with the machine\" type of feeling when you are flying a drone,\r\nTake it from somebody who bought everything in one shopping cart for almost $2,000USD and literally NONE of it has been used/is all outdated now... If you want to get into this hobby, The one and only thing you should spepnd any moneye on before anything else is Liftoff and a radio.. 100-200 USD total... DO NOT SPEND A DIME ON ANYTHING ELSE UNTIL YOU SPEND AT LEAST 10HRS IN LIFTOFF, TO KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE THE SPARE TIME & PATIENCE TO FULLY LEARN TO FLY, AND COMMIT YOURSELF TO IT... Because had I know just how simple they make it look on youtube, compared to how hard it actually is to do in the sim, and in real life - for me, personally, for whatever reason - I would have never purchased anything further. I love everything about FPV and the ehobby aspect of it. I really don't care for the actual flying part though. something about it has still just never fully \"clicked\" for me. \r\n\r\nEverybody learns different things in different ways. Don;t make the same mistakes I did. I have 100+ hours into this simulator and am just barely confident enough to spin my real life motors up and put my  real $600 drone in the air. STILL. lol getting into this hobby in real life requires TONS of extra, real life money, and the time to spend in real life YEARS of flying daily in order to ever aquire that \"subconscious, one with machine\" type fo feeling over any drone. KNOW THIS, AND HEED MY WARNING!!!",

The game has an extensive customization system for putting together your own drones, from realistic components.\r\n\r\nIt runs comparatively well on lower end GPUs. Some of the other sims have more realistic looking graphics but tend to feel more bland to me. Liftoff's level design feels more intentional.\r\n\r\nAnother great thing, for advanced simulation, that other sims (AFAIK) lack is the telemetry output. You can have it send various real-time information about the drone to external applications for display and analysis.",

So I got out of bed, ran to my PC and bought and went back to bed while it was downloading. \r\n\r\nFast forward to the next day when I discovered I can in fact NOT fly a drone... I did the training and found that near impossible, watched some more videos on how to fly and change some key settings so my Xbox controller works better for what I was trying to do. Then I just went into free fly mode and tried and tried tried... wasted thousands of dollars of drones in crashes but just hitting one button resets me. After about 5 hours I was doing some pretty decent maneuvers, and after 10 hours I was doing some much more complex moves and dodges around trees... granted I still can't do race track courses as that is just next level skill, and hats off to those that can. \r\n\r\nSo that's how I learned that I can't fly a drone, but then learned... and am now waiting on $1800 worth of real drone equipment now and studying for my Basic drone Pilot certification test (ugh... Canada...). Yes I recommend if you want to try an FPV drone without the risk, and just like to cruise through some pretty good looking maps and maybe even if you have the skills to race.",

It's like ice skating on gravity. It took a good 10-15 hours of frustration before I could even really fly more than a few seconds at a time.
