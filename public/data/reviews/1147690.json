You can play actively or just sit back and let your numbers climb while sipping coffee. ☕✨\nThe humor is ridiculous, the dev is delightfully snarky, and the progress bars never stop giving that sweet, sweet sense of achievement.

I've reached boss 150 in normal mode, out of 301 bosses and 3 difficulties, defeated 6 of the 19 titans, and only have 14 out of 19 main features to unlock. I've played a lot of idle games, and one of the things that I dislike about other idlers is the lack of new content. The game itself is good, but I get bored of just doing the same thing over and over, but NGU doesn't have that problem. As I mentioned earlier, there are 19 different main features to help you get stronger and fight more bosses, and lots of different things for each feature.
