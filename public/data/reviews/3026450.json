And all this leads to some level frustration.\r\n\r\nI hope they manage to balance things out because overall I enjoyed the game so far.",

      "review": "in EA, so keep that in mind. Right now there is not a ton here, but what is, is quite solid. The things that are wonky are mainly that ranged weapons suck, and melee builds are superior except for the character who reduces reload times on ranged weapons, which is the main issue, reload times are long enough that it allows enemies to swarm you and kill you until you get reload times way down and there is only 1 item that reduces reload times outside of the special item of the one character, so 2 but you have to play the one guy to get it. Then also there is one enemy type that is the only real threat and it throws tons of enemies at you so it becomes an issue really fast. They are ones that dash at you. And they are the only ones that will kill you most of the time. You cant hurt them during their dash, and they are invulnerable for a 1 second period after they dash for some reason too. Another issue is really that the crafting system has bad recipes. Some items that take a lot of awkward items in amounts that are kind of tough to get, lead to really underwhelming items. Meanwhile some pretty universally good ones thankfully at least, have easy to get items. The worst is the melee item chainsaw, which requires 2 ranged weapon items for some reason? And then the pizza launcher item is also really bad but takes 3 other crafted items to build. I really hope they tweak some of these to be easier to get, and add more recipes. Especially for the items that allow you hold more weapons, which right now you have to get really lucky to find since they are the top rarity.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of space to grow and you can see the blank spots in parts of the game as placeholders to add tons more, so I'm looking forward to that. The gameplay is addictive and while there is a lot of room to grow, what we have here is already solidly built and plenty of fun to be had. I like the way you unlock characters being through gameplay instead of some boring meta progress tokens. Feels like the old games of the past in the 80s and 90s and early 2000's.\r\n\r\nThere have been solid additions so far, but they come slow. So don't expect weekly updates. The focus is definately to first build a solid game with good features before adding tons of content on a weak foundation which is the right way to do this.",

Day turns to night and the zombies get more and more powerful so you are always working to be as efficient as possible.  It's a very enjoyable mix.\n\nThere are the typical long term progression perks one can acquire and more characters to unlock as in a survivors style game.\n\nThe overall loop is very satisfying if not wildly addicting.",

      "review": "Great game with fun gameplay and beautiful art style, but still room for improvement.\n\nThe game concept is very simple: loot a bunch of cool stuff, build your loadout and shred zombies with it. Then, after collecting enough gas, you can extract from the current stage and go on to the next stage. After 7 stages you fight the final boss and after defeating it, you have completed your first run. Back in your camp, there is some meta progression to unlock and then you start all over again.\n\nDespite the base game mechanics being very simple, each run is still a fun and more or less unique experience (more on that later). The complexity comes from the different items, weapons and characters and the way you combine them. Managing your inventory, choosing which items to equip, which to sell and building your loadout is really cool. I really like how items are affected by your inventory arrangement, in particular. This can all lead to some pretty insane loadout configurations. And testing those against hordes of zombies is REALLY fun.\n\nHowever, there are also some aspects that are still in need of improvement. First of all, the game needs a lot more content. There is already an okay amount in the game, but it's stretched very thin and restricted by a lot of meta progression upgrades. It took me about 45 hours (including the 10h I spent on the demo) to unlock all content (damn the astronaut). Looking back now, it feels like the time I've spent on the game and the amount of content I unlocked during that time don't really add up. The balance just seems a little off and there were some times, when I just rushed through another run to get duct tape for an upgrade, so that I could finally get more items for more complex builds.\nAll of that just felt a little dry and unrewarding [u] sometimes[/u] . Especially because you can only get a maximum amount of 2 duct tape in one run and therefore have to defeat the boss, if you want to progress. This can be a little frustrating, because it takes away your motivation to experiment with new loadouts and higher danger levels. You have to play it safe and always get the 2 possible duct tape to ensure your progress.\nThat also leads to my last point of criticism. Currently, endgame is a very dull experience. After finishing a couple of runs, you pretty much get the hang of it and defeating the boss isn't really much of a challenge anymore. What keeps the game interesting is honing your loadout to perfection by getting every last backpack space filled with the best possible item to boost your weapon and then see how far you can get with that. And this is all possible by staying in one stage for as long as you can last or by choosing the endless mode after completing a run. But there are some problems you'll run into.\nFor starters you get no meta progression in endless mode, which makes it kind of pointless, if you haven't unlocked everything yet. Also, as I mentioned earlier, there is not enough content in the game yet, so endless mode gets repetitive really quickly (more than in other similar games). And finally, you come across perfomance issues rather quickly, especially with some specific weapons and builds. Some of those perfomance issues have already been patched but not all of them. To be fair, it was highlighted by the devs that endless mode is still a work in progress and more of a fun bonus. Nevertheless, it plays a big part in keeping the game interesting after few hours of playtime, which is why I chose to view it as a main part of the game.\n\nTo put it in a nutshell, the game can be really fun to play and has a lot of potential, but it still lacks in content and some proper endgame mechanics. Whether those are achieved by improving the endless mode or by adding another way to keep endgame interesting is yet to be seen. Eventhough, I focused a lot on aspects that still need improvement in the section above, I still recommend this game because I had a lot of fun playing it. It is still in early access, so most of the things I criticised will probably be fixed over time (or at least I hope so)",

Hypothetically anyway.\n\nUnfortunately there isn't much build variety, and they rarely change the way you engage with the game, so everything feels more-or-less the same. Additional characters and items are added as you progress, but they do far too little to shake things up, and take far too long to unlock. \n\nWhat's here is good, but there's very little here to begin with, and it's all very straightforward and safe. You could wait for more content to be added, but I'd expect pistols with slightly varying rates of fire before anything notable or impressive.  You could have a good time here, sure, but given the stiff competition in it's genre (and price-point) I can't bring myself to recommend it.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nEdit:\n\nHi Leon!\n\nMy review was pretty short and may be conveying the wrong message, so to clarify:\nMy main criticism here is the lack of mechanical variety and player engagement, not the literal amount of updates the team pushed out. \n\nWhile appreciated, I'm not interested in cosmetic updates like the ability to swing on a swing set, splash screens, and popup notifications. Nor am I talking about basic functionality like run persistency, crit chance, or bullet settings. Using your list as an example, I'm interested in talking about the titan block event, the armored enemies, and items like the radar.\n\nThe titan block event is technically variety, in that it's an alternative to the highway blockage event, but I think its addition is overall a detriment to the game. The highway blockage requires the player to sit and protect a specific spot - which is different than their usual activities of constantly running around the map scrounging for loot and kiting enemies. I like this! The Titan block event, however, involves the player kiting enemies ( literally the same enemies they normally fight, just scaled up ) until they die, which is what the player is always doing. I don't like this, because now the Titan block event dilutes the pool for unique gameplay experiences, in favor of making me do more of the same thing I've BEEN doing. Technically, adding the Titan block event created variety in block events, but it REDUCED mechanical variety.\n\nThe same thing can be said of armored enemies that have resistance to damage (especially melee) and prevent piercing. A different enemy type technically adds complexity, sure, but as a player I don't engage armored enemies any differently than I would normal enemies. I can't change my loadout on the fly to accommodate their melee or piercing resistance (all I can do is attack them till they die, same as every other enemy in the game), and they aren't obtrusive enough to warrant me doing so anyway. Technically, adding armored enemies adds variety, but practically they have no impact on my experience or approach to a run - they might as well be cosmetic.\n\nThe radar item is a neat idea - but a random chance to get extra level-up rewards is not something that a player actively chooses, it's something that randomly happens to them. That's not inherently wrong, but (subjectively speaking) in a game about puzzle-solving and active player choice, I'd rather cut out the middleman and make the player actively deliberate over limited options, rather than removing engagement through passive radar procs.\n\nOn paper these updates add variety and complexity to the game (increasing player engagement), but the practical result is the stagnation or regression of both. When I mention adding \"pistols with slightly varying rates of fire\", I do mean that somewhat literally (weapons that are visually/ thematically distinct, but mechanically more of the same), but it's moreso meant to evoke the image of updates that don't push the boundaries of the game or make a large impact, in favor of slightly-modified content that's already here.\n\nI don't want to be overly negative, and I don't think the game is devoid of fun or value - there's cool stuff here! I also think the act of making something is to be lauded and I wish the absolute best for your team! \nBut this is also a product that's being sold for money (early access or no) in a highly competitive market, and you \"just launched into early access yesterday and there is a journey to be made\", so of course there are flaws in the game and critique to be had. I don't know if there's a cultural barrier, but your response here (and in other negative reviews) feels passive aggressive and I don't think reflects on the Pixelsplit team the way you intended.\n\nFor what it's worth, I did play the Demo! It's why I wishlisted the game, followed the updates as they've come out the past few months, purchased the game the day it released, put multiple hours into it, and then tried to communicate my thoughts on the game. That's also why I'm putting in the effort to reply and clarify my stance - I don't want to dissuade the dev team, or have them think I'm being snide. I want it to be clear that I think the game has fun, strong elements - but that the game's current state and the style of updates don't leave me confident enough to recommend it - at least not yet.",

I would give this a neutral if i could so i'm forced to make it a negative one because there's stuff to fix here.\r\n\r\nThe balance feels bad, overall winning a standard run is not too difficult if you know what you're doing but you never really get to feel powerful. For a game that takes inspiration in backpack battles/hero there's really not a lot of backpacking to do. In backpack battles you can have as many weapons as you can fit and then improve them with other items but here, due to the hand limitation more often than not you'll simply have to ignore a good chunk of things because you can't simply fit them so they mark your weapon of choice. \r\n\r\nThere is a roboarm item that helps with that but being an S shaped legendary item it's rare and not easy to fit, plus then you will have the issue of finding and fitting stuff to take advantadge of the roboarm BUT, since this will be late into the run chances are low that you'll get to that. \r\n\r\nEndless is a thing, and it doesn't affect your win on a run, but the jump from day 7 (day 8 is the final boss) to day 9 is so massive that even my strongest builds can't make a dent on the hordes and it's simply not fun...which sucks because that's where you would be able to actually exploit the limits of building in the game (and things like the roboarm). This is potentially due to ranged weapons having a reload time that will simply give time for the horde to respawn and group up around you so there is a massive reliance on anything that lets you hit multiple targets (like the drill, which makes bullets go through enemies). I imagine melee builds can be more successful but i haven't tried them yet since i prefer ranged combat in survivors games. It is irrelevant to the case tho, because if an entire archetype feels bad...that's something that should 100% be fixed. \r\n\r\nAnother big issue with the game is optimization. Optimization in survivors games can be tricky, as the massive amount of calculations, enemies, projectiles and items on the floor all take a toll on performance (Soulstone survivors devs had to basically remake the game to offer a better performance) but it is something necessary. Of course in an endless run eventually you'll have a problem but, if a regular AK firing 2 explosive projectiles multiple times per second whilst applying poison (a pretty basic thing is just basically ak+fork+fireworks+snake/rat) is already making the framerate drop insanely...we have a problem.  Specially when the graphics are pixel art(no complains there, the art is fantastic) which is not performance-intensive. \r\n\r\nAnyway, i'm eager to see what the devs cook, the potential of this game is amazing but it clearly needs time.",

Hypothetically anyway.\n\nUnfortunately there isn't much build variety, and they rarely change the way you engage with the game, so everything feels more-or-less the same.

You could wait for more content to be added, but I'd expect pistols with slightly varying rates of fire before anything notable or impressive.  You could have a good time here, sure, but given the stiff competition in it's genre (and price-point) I can't bring myself to recommend it.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nEdit:\n\nHi Leon!\n\nMy review was pretty short and may be conveying the wrong message, so to clarify:\nMy main criticism here is the lack of mechanical variety and player engagement, not the literal amount of updates the team pushed out. \n\nWhile appreciated, I'm not interested in cosmetic updates like the ability to swing on a swing set, splash screens, and popup notifications. Nor am I talking about basic functionality like run persistency, crit chance, or bullet settings. Using your list as an example, I'm interested in talking about the titan block event, the armored enemies, and items like the radar.\n\nThe titan block event is technically variety, in that it's an alternative to the highway blockage event, but I think its addition is overall a detriment to the game. The highway blockage requires the player to sit and protect a specific spot - which is different than their usual activities of constantly running around the map scrounging for loot and kiting enemies. I like this! The Titan block event, however, involves the player kiting enemies ( literally the same enemies they normally fight, just scaled up ) until they die, which is what the player is always doing. I don't like this, because now the Titan block event dilutes the pool for unique gameplay experiences, in favor of making me do more of the same thing I've BEEN doing. Technically, adding the Titan block event created variety in block events, but it REDUCED mechanical variety.\n\nThe same thing can be said of armored enemies that have resistance to damage (especially melee) and prevent piercing. A different enemy type technically adds complexity, sure, but as a player I don't engage armored enemies any differently than I would normal enemies. I can't change my loadout on the fly to accommodate their melee or piercing resistance (all I can do is attack them till they die, same as every other enemy in the game), and they aren't obtrusive enough to warrant me doing so anyway. Technically, adding armored enemies adds variety, but practically they have no impact on my experience or approach to a run - they might as well be cosmetic.\n\nThe radar item is a neat idea - but a random chance to get extra level-up rewards is not something that a player actively chooses, it's something that randomly happens to them. That's not inherently wrong, but (subjectively speaking) in a game about puzzle-solving and active player choice, I'd rather cut out the middleman and make the player actively deliberate over limited options, rather than removing engagement through passive radar procs.\n\nOn paper these updates add variety and complexity to the game (increasing player engagement), but the practical result is the stagnation or regression of both. When I mention adding \"pistols with slightly varying rates of fire\", I do mean that somewhat literally (weapons that are visually/ thematically distinct, but mechanically more of the same), but it's moreso meant to evoke the image of updates that don't push the boundaries of the game or make a large impact, in favor of slightly-modified content that's already here.\n\nI don't want to be overly negative, and I don't think the game is devoid of fun or value - there's cool stuff here! I also think the act of making something is to be lauded and I wish the absolute best for your team! \nBut this is also a product that's being sold for money (early access or no) in a highly competitive market, and you \"just launched into early access yesterday and there is a journey to be made\", so of course there are flaws in the game and critique to be had. I don't know if there's a cultural barrier, but your response here (and in other negative reviews) feels passive aggressive and I don't think reflects on the Pixelsplit team the way you intended.\n\nFor what it's worth, I did play the Demo! It's why I wishlisted the game, followed the updates as they've come out the past few months, purchased the game the day it released, put multiple hours into it, and then tried to communicate my thoughts on the game. That's also why I'm putting in the effort to reply and clarify my stance - I don't want to dissuade the dev team, or have them think I'm being snide. I want it to be clear that I think the game has fun, strong elements - but that the game's current state and the style of updates don't leave me confident enough to recommend it - at least not yet.",

For a game that takes inspiration in backpack battles/hero there's really not a lot of backpacking to do. In backpack battles you can have as many weapons as you can fit and then improve them with other items but here, due to the hand limitation more often than not you'll simply have to ignore a good chunk of things because you can't simply fit them so they mark your weapon of choice. \r\n\r\nThere is a roboarm item that helps with that but being an S shaped legendary item it's rare and not easy to fit, plus then you will have the issue of finding and fitting stuff to take advantadge of the roboarm BUT, since this will be late into the run chances are low that you'll get to that. \r\n\r\nEndless is a thing, and it doesn't affect your win on a run, but the jump from day 7 (day 8 is the final boss) to day 9 is so massive that even my strongest builds can't make a dent on the hordes and it's simply not fun...which sucks because that's where you would be able to actually exploit the limits of building in the game (and things like the roboarm). This is potentially due to ranged weapons having a reload time that will simply give time for the horde to respawn and group up around you so there is a massive reliance on anything that lets you hit multiple targets (like the drill, which makes bullets go through enemies). I imagine melee builds can be more successful but i haven't tried them yet since i prefer ranged combat in survivors games. It is irrelevant to the case tho, because if an entire archetype feels bad...that's something that should 100% be fixed. \r\n\r\nAnother big issue with the game is optimization. Optimization in survivors games can be tricky, as the massive amount of calculations, enemies, projectiles and items on the floor all take a toll on performance (Soulstone survivors devs had to basically remake the game to offer a better performance) but it is something necessary. Of course in an endless run eventually you'll have a problem but, if a regular AK firing 2 explosive projectiles multiple times per second whilst applying poison (a pretty basic thing is just basically ak+fork+fireworks+snake/rat) is already making the framerate drop insanely...we have a problem.

Hypothetically anyway.\n\nUnfortunately there isn't much build variety, and they rarely change the way you engage with the game, so everything feels more-or-less the same. Additional characters and items are added as you progress, but they do far too little to shake things up, and take far too long to unlock. \n\nWhat's here is good, but there's very little here to begin with, and it's all very straightforward and safe. You could wait for more content to be added, but I'd expect pistols with slightly varying rates of fire before anything notable or impressive.  You could have a good time here, sure, but given the stiff competition in it's genre (and price-point) I can't bring myself to recommend it.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nEdit:\n\nHi Leon!\n\nMy review was pretty short and may be conveying the wrong message, so to clarify:\nMy main criticism here is the lack of mechanical variety and player engagement, not the literal amount of updates the team pushed out. \n\nWhile appreciated, I'm not interested in cosmetic updates like the ability to swing on a swing set, splash screens, and popup notifications. Nor am I talking about basic functionality like run persistency, crit chance, or bullet settings. Using your list as an example, I'm interested in talking about the titan block event, the armored enemies, and items like the radar.\n\nThe titan block event is technically variety, in that it's an alternative to the highway blockage event, but I think its addition is overall a detriment to the game. The highway blockage requires the player to sit and protect a specific spot - which is different than their usual activities of constantly running around the map scrounging for loot and kiting enemies. I like this! The Titan block event, however, involves the player kiting enemies ( literally the same enemies they normally fight, just scaled up ) until they die, which is what the player is always doing. I don't like this, because now the Titan block event dilutes the pool for unique gameplay experiences, in favor of making me do more of the same thing I've BEEN doing. Technically, adding the Titan block event created variety in block events, but it REDUCED mechanical variety.\n\nThe same thing can be said of armored enemies that have resistance to damage (especially melee) and prevent piercing. A different enemy type technically adds complexity, sure, but as a player I don't engage armored enemies any differently than I would normal enemies. I can't change my loadout on the fly to accommodate their melee or piercing resistance (all I can do is attack them till they die, same as every other enemy in the game), and they aren't obtrusive enough to warrant me doing so anyway. Technically, adding armored enemies adds variety, but practically they have no impact on my experience or approach to a run - they might as well be cosmetic.\n\nThe radar item is a neat idea - but a random chance to get extra level-up rewards is not something that a player actively chooses, it's something that randomly happens to them. That's not inherently wrong, but (subjectively speaking) in a game about puzzle-solving and active player choice, I'd rather cut out the middleman and make the player actively deliberate over limited options, rather than removing engagement through passive radar procs.\n\nOn paper these updates add variety and complexity to the game (increasing player engagement), but the practical result is the stagnation or regression of both. When I mention adding \"pistols with slightly varying rates of fire\", I do mean that somewhat literally (weapons that are visually/ thematically distinct, but mechanically more of the same), but it's moreso meant to evoke the image of updates that don't push the boundaries of the game or make a large impact, in favor of slightly-modified content that's already here.\n\nI don't want to be overly negative, and I don't think the game is devoid of fun or value - there's cool stuff here! I also think the act of making something is to be lauded and I wish the absolute best for your team! \nBut this is also a product that's being sold for money (early access or no) in a highly competitive market, and you \"just launched into early access yesterday and there is a journey to be made\", so of course there are flaws in the game and critique to be had. I don't know if there's a cultural barrier, but your response here (and in other negative reviews) feels passive aggressive and I don't think reflects on the Pixelsplit team the way you intended.\n\nFor what it's worth, I did play the Demo! It's why I wishlisted the game, followed the updates as they've come out the past few months, purchased the game the day it released, put multiple hours into it, and then tried to communicate my thoughts on the game. That's also why I'm putting in the effort to reply and clarify my stance - I don't want to dissuade the dev team, or have them think I'm being snide. I want it to be clear that I think the game has fun, strong elements - but that the game's current state and the style of updates don't leave me confident enough to recommend it - at least not yet.",

For a game that takes inspiration in backpack battles/hero there's really not a lot of backpacking to do. In backpack battles you can have as many weapons as you can fit and then improve them with other items but here, due to the hand limitation more often than not you'll simply have to ignore a good chunk of things because you can't simply fit them so they mark your weapon of choice. \r\n\r\nThere is a roboarm item that helps with that but being an S shaped legendary item it's rare and not easy to fit, plus then you will have the issue of finding and fitting stuff to take advantadge of the roboarm BUT, since this will be late into the run chances are low that you'll get to that. \r\n\r\nEndless is a thing, and it doesn't affect your win on a run, but the jump from day 7 (day 8 is the final boss) to day 9 is so massive that even my strongest builds can't make a dent on the hordes and it's simply not fun...which sucks because that's where you would be able to actually exploit the limits of building in the game (and things like the roboarm). This is potentially due to ranged weapons having a reload time that will simply give time for the horde to respawn and group up around you so there is a massive reliance on anything that lets you hit multiple targets (like the drill, which makes bullets go through enemies). I imagine melee builds can be more successful but i haven't tried them yet since i prefer ranged combat in survivors games. It is irrelevant to the case tho, because if an entire archetype feels bad...that's something that should 100% be fixed. \r\n\r\nAnother big issue with the game is optimization. Optimization in survivors games can be tricky, as the massive amount of calculations, enemies, projectiles and items on the floor all take a toll on performance (Soulstone survivors devs had to basically remake the game to offer a better performance) but it is something necessary. Of course in an endless run eventually you'll have a problem but, if a regular AK firing 2 explosive projectiles multiple times per second whilst applying poison (a pretty basic thing is just basically ak+fork+fireworks+snake/rat) is already making the framerate drop insanely...we have a problem.

      "review": "It's alright.\n\nCollecting items and puzzling out a build in a cramped backpack is fun to do - and the game is easy enough that you can get away with wackier un-optimized builds. Hypothetically anyway.\n\nUnfortunately there isn't much build variety, and they rarely change the way you engage with the game, so everything feels more-or-less the same. Additional characters and items are added as you progress, but they do far too little to shake things up, and take far too long to unlock. \n\nWhat's here is good, but there's very little here to begin with, and it's all very straightforward and safe. You could wait for more content to be added, but I'd expect pistols with slightly varying rates of fire before anything notable or impressive.  You could have a good time here, sure, but given the stiff competition in it's genre (and price-point) I can't bring myself to recommend it.\n\n---------------------------------------------\nEdit:\n\nHi Leon!\n\nMy review was pretty short and may be conveying the wrong message, so to clarify:\nMy main criticism here is the lack of mechanical variety and player engagement, not the literal amount of updates the team pushed out. \n\nWhile appreciated, I'm not interested in cosmetic updates like the ability to swing on a swing set, splash screens, and popup notifications. Nor am I talking about basic functionality like run persistency, crit chance, or bullet settings. Using your list as an example, I'm interested in talking about the titan block event, the armored enemies, and items like the radar.\n\nThe titan block event is technically variety, in that it's an alternative to the highway blockage event, but I think its addition is overall a detriment to the game. The highway blockage requires the player to sit and protect a specific spot - which is different than their usual activities of constantly running around the map scrounging for loot and kiting enemies. I like this! The Titan block event, however, involves the player kiting enemies ( literally the same enemies they normally fight, just scaled up ) until they die, which is what the player is always doing. I don't like this, because now the Titan block event dilutes the pool for unique gameplay experiences, in favor of making me do more of the same thing I've BEEN doing. Technically, adding the Titan block event created variety in block events, but it REDUCED mechanical variety.\n\nThe same thing can be said of armored enemies that have resistance to damage (especially melee) and prevent piercing. A different enemy type technically adds complexity, sure, but as a player I don't engage armored enemies any differently than I would normal enemies. I can't change my loadout on the fly to accommodate their melee or piercing resistance (all I can do is attack them till they die, same as every other enemy in the game), and they aren't obtrusive enough to warrant me doing so anyway. Technically, adding armored enemies adds variety, but practically they have no impact on my experience or approach to a run - they might as well be cosmetic.\n\nThe radar item is a neat idea - but a random chance to get extra level-up rewards is not something that a player actively chooses, it's something that randomly happens to them. That's not inherently wrong, but (subjectively speaking) in a game about puzzle-solving and active player choice, I'd rather cut out the middleman and make the player actively deliberate over limited options, rather than removing engagement through passive radar procs.\n\nOn paper these updates add variety and complexity to the game (increasing player engagement), but the practical result is the stagnation or regression of both. When I mention adding \"pistols with slightly varying rates of fire\", I do mean that somewhat literally (weapons that are visually/ thematically distinct, but mechanically more of the same), but it's moreso meant to evoke the image of updates that don't push the boundaries of the game or make a large impact, in favor of slightly-modified content that's already here.\n\nI don't want to be overly negative, and I don't think the game is devoid of fun or value - there's cool stuff here! I also think the act of making something is to be lauded and I wish the absolute best for your team! \nBut this is also a product that's being sold for money (early access or no) in a highly competitive market, and you \"just launched into early access yesterday and there is a journey to be made\", so of course there are flaws in the game and critique to be had. I don't know if there's a cultural barrier, but your response here (and in other negative reviews) feels passive aggressive and I don't think reflects on the Pixelsplit team the way you intended.\n\nFor what it's worth, I did play the Demo! It's why I wishlisted the game, followed the updates as they've come out the past few months, purchased the game the day it released, put multiple hours into it, and then tried to communicate my thoughts on the game. That's also why I'm putting in the effort to reply and clarify my stance - I don't want to dissuade the dev team, or have them think I'm being snide. I want it to be clear that I think the game has fun, strong elements - but that the game's current state and the style of updates don't leave me confident enough to recommend it - at least not yet.",

Wait until it goes to massive sale, or they add YEARS worth of content.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- The Inventory expansion mechanic is really nice and innovative.\r\n- Combining loot into better loot and rotating everything in order to find the best placement is so much fun\r\n- First few zones are pretty good.\r\n\r\nCon:\r\n- Game only has 1 level that is divided to few zones, beat the boss at the end. Game over. \r\n- There is SO little content right now. It feels like you played through the beginner tutorial level, get some kind of build going, well too bad, game is over already.\r\n- The game is designed to be juuuust long enough that once you beat the one and only boss and realize there is nothing else to do, you have gone barely over that 2 hour window so you cannot refund anymore.\r\n- There are so few characters, i believe 6, where 3 of them you can unlock rather quick, but they are just flat out worse and somehow less interesting than the starting one, which is really bad, since starting characters only \"ability\" is slightly bigger starting inventory bag",

      "review": "The game has a LOT of potential. I would give this a neutral if i could so i'm forced to make it a negative one because there's stuff to fix here.\r\n\r\nThe balance feels bad, overall winning a standard run is not too difficult if you know what you're doing but you never really get to feel powerful. For a game that takes inspiration in backpack battles/hero there's really not a lot of backpacking to do. In backpack battles you can have as many weapons as you can fit and then improve them with other items but here, due to the hand limitation more often than not you'll simply have to ignore a good chunk of things because you can't simply fit them so they mark your weapon of choice. \r\n\r\nThere is a roboarm item that helps with that but being an S shaped legendary item it's rare and not easy to fit, plus then you will have the issue of finding and fitting stuff to take advantadge of the roboarm BUT, since this will be late into the run chances are low that you'll get to that. \r\n\r\nEndless is a thing, and it doesn't affect your win on a run, but the jump from day 7 (day 8 is the final boss) to day 9 is so massive that even my strongest builds can't make a dent on the hordes and it's simply not fun...which sucks because that's where you would be able to actually exploit the limits of building in the game (and things like the roboarm). This is potentially due to ranged weapons having a reload time that will simply give time for the horde to respawn and group up around you so there is a massive reliance on anything that lets you hit multiple targets (like the drill, which makes bullets go through enemies). I imagine melee builds can be more successful but i haven't tried them yet since i prefer ranged combat in survivors games. It is irrelevant to the case tho, because if an entire archetype feels bad...that's something that should 100% be fixed. \r\n\r\nAnother big issue with the game is optimization. Optimization in survivors games can be tricky, as the massive amount of calculations, enemies, projectiles and items on the floor all take a toll on performance (Soulstone survivors devs had to basically remake the game to offer a better performance) but it is something necessary. Of course in an endless run eventually you'll have a problem but, if a regular AK firing 2 explosive projectiles multiple times per second whilst applying poison (a pretty basic thing is just basically ak+fork+fireworks+snake/rat) is already making the framerate drop insanely...we have a problem.  Specially when the graphics are pixel art(no complains there, the art is fantastic) which is not performance-intensive. \r\n\r\nAnyway, i'm eager to see what the devs cook, the potential of this game is amazing but it clearly needs time.",

So the moment the runs becomes crazy and fun you gotta reset again if you want to make progress.  Input lag is also rather high , fix those two issues and the game is cool (low amount of content too but ea i guess)",
