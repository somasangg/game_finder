It crashed to desktop with error message like \"Can't create vertex buffer\" or error mentioning \"d3dgl.dll\" file, you are not likely going to enjoy this if you want hassle free & casual gaming. Visit community forums about errors related to this game, my advice is not to buy it because it will waste your time and setback progress for 20min at least.",
