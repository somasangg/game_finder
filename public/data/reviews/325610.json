There is one campaign, set in 1212 AD obviously, covering many factions. It looks like the modders are planning to make another later era at some point.\n\nShould say I have been playing with just the official MK 1212 AD files on the Steam Workshop, along with the 'MK 1212 Expanded Portraits' mod. No crashes so far.\n\nCan't comment on the vanilla game as I haven't played anything more than the start of the Prologue but that era of the Dark Ages doesn't interest me much so I didn't get the game for that.

Its core mechanics have depth, and veterans of the series will likely find rewarding complexity beneath the chaos. However, the game’s governance and settlement management systems are deeply flawed, and may feel punishing or even alienating—especially for newcomers.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of my experience:\n\n✅ Strengths:\n\nCavalry feels powerful and decisive, unlike in Rome II, where mounted units often felt underwhelming.\n\nFactions are well-designed and varied, offering meaningful gameplay differences and a moderate degree of religious flexibility.\n\nThe modding community is outstanding, delivering high-quality mods that expand, improve, or completely overhaul the game.\n\n❌ Weaknesses:\n\nThe governance system and public order mechanics lack clarity and balance, making even well-managed provinces feel unstable. It’s a core system that undermines enjoyment rather than enhancing challenge.\n\nThere are too many DLCs, and many feel superficial or unnecessary. Some players may enjoy the added content, but to me, most of it lacks meaningful value.\n\n🎯 Verdict: 7/10",

Eastern Rome is especially fun since it's a lot easier to stabilize and build a good economy than the WRE. Various assorted barbarians(franks, goths, danes, etc.) desert despots(sassanids, himyar, tanukhids, etc.),and eastern nomads(huns, white huns) are also available to play if those factions tickle your fancy.\r\n\r\nProbably the best aspect of the game is that it's very hard to steamroll your way across the map due to stacking public order, food, sanitation, and religious penalties. Meaning you really have to think hard about where you want to concentrate strength and investment in your empire, and also whether you can feasibly expand into and keep new holdings. Also when playing as Rome, half the map hates your guts and wants to kill you so it really feels more like a fight for survival than a game that you can just autoresolve every battle and do better than you would fighting the battle yourself. (Looking at you Warhammer III!)\r\n\r\nHighly recommend to anyone looking to get into Total War. This and Shogun 2 take the cake for the two best historical titles in the series. 10/10",

Many love this game for its challenging campaign, however, I do not play games to simply beat my head against the wall with frustration. By adding in some mods you can transform the game into something quite fun. The battles are fantastic with great animations and a good weight to the units such that collisions and shield walls pack a punch. The game looks amazing and has some great mechanics such as the ability of fire to spread or shooting onagers in first person. When modified it can be a lot of fun, and I plan on sinking many more hours into this one having found that out.",

Each hour I do spend therein, each fleeting minute immersed, doth toss my spirit upon a tempest most wild—a true emotional chariot, careening betwixt the stars and the abyss. It maketh one laugh with mirth, tremble with dread, rage with fury, and weep with deepest sorrow. In one breath, thou art seized by agony and torment, mingled with hatred, despair, and grievous lamentation. In the next, thy heart soareth with joy, emboldened by triumph and radiant hope.\n\nThis game unfoldeth a world of endless fancy and possibility. All that mortal life forbiddeth by chains unjust and cruel limitations, here mayst thou pursue without restraint. Lo! Thou canst raise taxes to the very heavens, funneling coin not to the well-being of thy folk, but rather to feed the fires of war. Or mayhap, thou takest to trade, forging pacts with villainous cartels that slither ‘neath the gaze of thine own capital.\n\nShould thy will lean toward virtue, thou mayest craft a realm most noble: a land of justice and equity, where all live in joy, prosperity, and blessed peace. Yet if thine heart be hardened, thou mayest forge a tyranny most bleak, where every second edifice serveth industry or the plough, taxes bite with cruel teeth, and the people live in wretchedness and want.\n\nIn sooth, the possibilities stretch beyond mortal reckoning.

      "review": "It has been a while since I played a Total War game, but I feel there is a lot of micromanagement that distracts here. The game punishes rapid expansion as you cannot maintain multiple territories while ensuring enough food and happiness. This leads to revolts where you are fighting rebel armies along with other enemies. Otherwise it just punishes you for existing, as other reviews have said this entry in the series is about sheer survival. Not to mention the Huns, who in similar fashion to Medieval Total War where the Golden Horde (Mongols) are OP, the Huns are OP and always at full strength. This makes for a good challenge, although the Huns do not attack preferentially (except it seems against Romans) and you can make peace with them. Other issue is diplomacy where seemingly at random a faction will declare war on you and refuse negotiations for unknown reasons (except for monetary gifts, which they never refuse). You are always fighting on multiple fronts and attrition is killer while you're out of your territory not camped. Still fun, but you're in for the long haul with any campaign. Building becomes a balancing act to ensure squalor, disease, strife, happiness, food, income all match up - which is impossible...more revolts. Also don't build a shipyard on the African East coast (or anywhere that water channels don't lead to the ocean) because inevitably you will be locked in with no way to get out and have to disband your fleet. I won a minor victory but was confused as it says puppet states and alliances count toward the total provinces toward victory, but I feel that it didn't account for my alliances - however it only counts a full province which is three settlements in combination, so maybe that's why. Bless those that can play each faction's campaign and the DLC all the way through, because barely 60 hours into it and I feel burnt out.

If its not crashing from trying to open the family/politics tab because there are too many characters or from just crashing ending your turn, then this game would easily have over 1k hours from me since I got it last year. I just now uninstalled to try and redownload because the cut scene is choppy now and freezes, then the game itself does the same. I then tried to play Rome 2 and was laggy. Could be a problem on my end for that, not sure. The game crashing bugs however are not my fault. I honestly wish Creative Assembly would get back to their old mindset of caring, and get their act together to fix old games. Hell even create new ones that are good, unlike Pharoah.

Rome 2 and Shogun 2 have been my favorites so far, but Attila would surpass them if the game would just run. If its not crashing from trying to open the family/politics tab because there are too many characters or from just crashing ending your turn, then this game would easily have over 1k hours from me since I got it last year. I just now uninstalled to try and redownload because the cut scene is choppy now and freezes, then the game itself does the same. I then tried to play Rome 2 and was laggy. Could be a problem on my end for that, not sure. The game crashing bugs however are not my fault. I honestly wish Creative Assembly would get back to their old mindset of caring, and get their act together to fix old games. Hell even create new ones that are good, unlike Pharoah. The game was fun when it did work, but unfortunately its becoming more work than its worth to try and get it to work. Take this as a warning, buy or don't buy.

You discover this fatal flaw only after investing significant hours into a campaign and world building.  This could be fixed if there was an active way to mitigate the drop in fertility or toggle the feature off altogether.   I do realise the great migration, which is the setting had a cause.  Climate would have been a factor, but it is massively over played in the mechanics.  I cannot see evidence that climate change as severe as depicted in the game actually existed in the period.  The reason cited as the most likely trigger for the migrations, was the construction of the Great Wall of China causing a domino shift westwards for all the nomadic peoples of the Asian Steppe.  Climate has a role to play but not this big.  I've played as the Eastern Roman Empire, over 110 turns and now all but two provinces are totally infertile: Total Lame.",

      "review": "It has been a while since I played a Total War game, but I feel there is a lot of micromanagement that distracts here. The game punishes rapid expansion as you cannot maintain multiple territories while ensuring enough food and happiness. This leads to revolts where you are fighting rebel armies along with other enemies. Otherwise it just punishes you for existing, as other reviews have said this entry in the series is about sheer survival. Not to mention the Huns, who in similar fashion to Medieval Total War where the Golden Horde (Mongols) are OP, the Huns are OP and always at full strength. This makes for a good challenge, although the Huns do not attack preferentially (except it seems against Romans) and you can make peace with them. Other issue is diplomacy where seemingly at random a faction will declare war on you and refuse negotiations for unknown reasons (except for monetary gifts, which they never refuse). You are always fighting on multiple fronts and attrition is killer while you're out of your territory not camped. Still fun, but you're in for the long haul with any campaign. Building becomes a balancing act to ensure squalor, disease, strife, happiness, food, income all match up - which is impossible...more revolts. Also don't build a shipyard on the African East coast (or anywhere that water channels don't lead to the ocean) because inevitably you will be locked in with no way to get out and have to disband your fleet. I won a minor victory but was confused as it says puppet states and alliances count toward the total provinces toward victory, but I feel that it didn't account for my alliances - however it only counts a full province which is three settlements in combination, so maybe that's why. Bless those that can play each faction's campaign and the DLC all the way through, because barely 60 hours into it and I feel burnt out. I have several other TW titles in my library but it will likely be a few months before I delve back into the series.",
