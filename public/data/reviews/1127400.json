If steam recorded the hundreds of hours I wasted with the itch.io version and the older versions from the mobile release this would be my first game reaching over 1k hours.\n\nEvery update keeps adding more and more content I don't get but enjoy very much to figure out, the mechanics are \"simple\" enough to understand, but its layered, and gets so complex at endgame.\n\nBy the end of one planet, your production will be global, and having a central command base sector will be where your resources will be beamed out towards other areas for conquering. I just love this game too much.\n\nHighly recommended, in fact I am in your walls right now whispering in your ear to buy and play this game and give it a try, but if you aren't sold go get the free version on itch before spending money in this game.\n\nIf I had a forever game this would be the game I would be playing in the retirement home.",

If steam recorded the hundreds of hours I wasted with the itch.io version and the older versions from the mobile release this would be my first game reaching over 1k hours.\n\nEvery update keeps adding more and more content I don't get but enjoy very much to figure out, the mechanics are \"simple\" enough to understand, but its layered, and gets so complex at endgame.\n\nBy the end of one planet, your production will be global, and having a central command base sector will be where your resources will be beamed out towards other areas for conquering. I just love this game too much.\n\nHighly recommended, in fact I am in your walls right now whispering in your ear to buy and play this game and give it a try, but if you aren't sold go get the free version on itch before spending money in this game.\n\nIf I had a forever game this would be the game I would be playing in the retirement home.",

Hundreds of hours worth of content, two unique campaigns both with their own planet to conquer, materials to discover and tech tree to unlock.\n\nIt's similar to Factorio but leans way more into the tower defense RTS aspect which goes really hard, I used to play C&C Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2 as a kid and 90% of my time in those games was just spent building ridiculously large bases with walls and turrets everywhere, Mindustry really takes me back to those days in that it gives you the freedom to basically just turtle into a section on the map and fortify yourself with crazy defenses while amassing an army of units, it's peak gaming imo.\n\nThe campaign is fantastic (START ON SERPULO!!), you land on a planet in one sector, you establish your first base there after evicting the enemy presence, and then you launch into new sectors from that base. You will either be defending your base from enemy waves in order to capture the sector, or you'll have to destroy the enemy bases to do so. Both mission types are a ton of fun and thanks to the variety in the maps, it never gets old. Every sector you capture expands your presence on the map, and remains useful throughout your gameplay since sectors keep passively farming resources for you. Later on you unlock the ability to ship your resources to your central base, from where you can launch into new sectors with a ton of resources to give you a head start. This really gives you the feeling that you grow more powerful, since new sectors improve your resource gathering, and having a lot of resources means you can land in new sectors with premium materials that allow you to set up the best turrets and units right out the gate.\n\nI could muse on and on about this game, it's that good, just grab it, even at full price it's an absolute steal, I have hundreds of hours already logged on my ipad and I plan to do the same on steam. 10/10 game\n\nBTW: Start with Serpulo. Devs recommend Erekir as your first planet but I don't understand why because when it comes to balancing and progression, Erekir is honestly kind of @ss, way less freedom and way too focused on units instead of towers. On Serpulo you can really turtle in behind walls and turrets, on Erekir the AI just spams waves of flying units and mechs that don't give a fuck about your walls, which almost killed my enjoyment of this game. If I had started on Erekir it's quite possible I wouldn't have liked this game, it's only because of Serpulo's much better progression that I'm able to stomach Erekir. Ignore devs advice, they claim it's better tuned, but in my experience, it's the complete opposite and Erekir is 100% the worst of the two planets, and it's not even close",

Factorio with deeper combat.\n\nOne thing I want to highlight, is that the devs were extremely smart with what the player does when a level is lost: All your building locations are saved and you can just restart the level, hit the button and rebuild. You still need the resources, but you can bring plenty on level start. But the important thing is, you don't need to plan and you don't need to click a bunch just to get your solution so far up and running. The wave based levels have a button to start waves early to speed things up.\n\nProbably not a thousand hour game for me, but it's pretty good!\n\nThis is for the purple planet, I did not like the campaign on the orange planet.",
