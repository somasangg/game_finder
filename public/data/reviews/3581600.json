      "review": "I've played many of these pvp territorial strategy games.  What I like about the game are the different ways you can upgrade the Hero strengths and traits. You can level their traits to be tanks, defense, dps, farmers, etc. I like the graphics and the easy transition from phone to laptop. I believe you can be F2P easily.  There are no leveling roadblocks or paywalls. You can level Heroes by grinding the NPC monsters or using earned medallions.  There is a variety of events to play, you can grow in a small alliance, but there is an urge to join a large alliance in order to maintain the level of resources it takes to upgrade and keep up with the event tasks. I also like that you can't just pay your way to be strong (i.e. \"whales\").  Money does give you benefits of course, but it doesn't quickly make your Hero or your Castle the strongest. It costs a lot of money to get a little bit.  Like you can buy a package but it doesn't allow much more than maybe upgrading a building or finishing some research in your town, or it gives your hero some tokens to upgrade a skill. The growth takes a lot of time.\r\n- One of my complaints with this game are the amount of resources it takes almost immediately, like it is rediculous how much you need to level up your buildings and your army tiers.  \r\n- Another HUGE complaint is the lack of visibility the Tribe leaders have in their log history.  Most games will tell you what members scout or attack your alliance buildings, or when your members attack other tribes, or when your members are attacked and by whom. I had no idea who was attacking or scouting my buildings. Sometimes it would say \"someone scouted a building\" and that's it. Sometimes It would tell me a tribe name when my building burned, but not the player name. The leaders don't always know that their members are attacking something they shouldn't and it puts the leader in a vulnerable position when another alliance thinks it was on purpose and you can't get a straight answer from your team.  Some tribes get sabotaged by rogue players that go in just to cause trouble and wars.They seriously need to improve their Tribe Logs to be more helpful.\r\n-The translator in the chat helps a lot overall, but still needs a little improvement with certain dialects.\r\n- Also, IGG is terrible at not allowing you to delete characters. They will never let you do it in any of their games. It leaves a lot of waste on the servers and dead weight in the tribes. \r\nOverall, this game is great, it's worth a try. They have put a lot into it.",

      "review": "I've played many of these pvp territorial strategy games.  What I like about the game are the different ways you can upgrade the Hero strengths and traits. You can level their traits to be tanks, defense, dps, farmers, etc. I like the graphics and the easy transition from phone to laptop. I believe you can be F2P easily.  There are no leveling roadblocks or paywalls. You can level Heroes by grinding the NPC monsters or using earned medallions.  There is a variety of events to play, you can grow in a small alliance, but there is an urge to join a large alliance in order to maintain the level of resources it takes to upgrade and keep up with the event tasks. I also like that you can't just pay your way to be strong (i.e. \"whales\").  Money does give you benefits of course, but it doesn't quickly make your Hero or your Castle the strongest. It costs a lot of money to get a little bit.  Like you can buy a package but it doesn't allow much more than maybe upgrading a building or finishing some research in your town, or it gives your hero some tokens to upgrade a skill. The growth takes a lot of time.\r\n- One of my complaints with this game are the amount of resources it takes almost immediately, like it is rediculous how much you need to level up your buildings and your army tiers.  \r\n- Another HUGE complaint is the lack of visibility the Tribe leaders have in their log history.  Most games will tell you what members scout or attack your alliance buildings, or when your members attack other tribes, or when your members are attacked and by whom. I had no idea who was attacking or scouting my buildings. Sometimes it would say \"someone scouted a building\" and that's it. Sometimes It would tell me a tribe name when my building burned, but not the player name. The leaders don't always know that their members are attacking something they shouldn't and it puts the leader in a vulnerable position when another alliance thinks it was on purpose and you can't get a straight answer from your team.  Some tribes get sabotaged by rogue players that go in just to cause trouble and wars.They seriously need to improve their Tribe Logs to be more helpful.\r\n-The translator in the chat helps a lot overall, but still needs a little improvement with certain dialects.\r\n- Also, IGG is terrible at not allowing you to delete characters. They will never let you do it in any of their games. It leaves a lot of waste on the servers and dead weight in the tribes. \r\nOverall, this game is great, it's worth a try. They have put a lot into it.",
