You can get through all the \"Episodes\" aka missions whatever you call them in around 15 hours ish depending on how quick you go through them, Then you finally get to the real \"Meat of the game\" going back through all the iconic locations and collecting all the kyber bricks and unlocking all the other characters which took me around 90 or so hours unlocking all the characters and getting all kyber bricks.

In reality this should be a neutral review. Last point: comparing this game to LSW the Complete Saga is pointless in my opinion, as they are trying to be fundamentally different games.

It allows you to play through a Lego themed version of every single Star Wars movie all in one place. Now the missions aren't super movie-accurate and they are filled with silly humor but the game is still very fun. I have about 20 hours in the game, have not really been hunting collectables or doing side quests, and I am just now finishing up Episode VII. So I would say about 25 hours to beat the main episodic missions and then at least a hundred hours worth of side quests and collectable hunting on top of that. For reference, there are 1200 Kyber bricks in the game, which is the main collectable used to upgrade your characters. At 20 hours I have about 150 of them. I also have 160/380 characters so you can get a LOT of playtime out of this game if you want to.",

You can collect dozens of ships to fly including mini Lego kits which is funny in its own sense. There are many capital ships to liberate and make your own flagship where you can see them from the planet side in space. The whole saga is filled with crazy easter eggs and comical skits that will make you laugh every single time.

The game modes can also be customised where you can include crazy effects or turn the mute on for the original games that didn't include voice acting.

There's also several battles that could have been a cutscene and instead have tedious pace-breaking puzzles during high tension moments. Looking at you Cpt Phasma, you big shiny letdown. \r\n\r\nLast of the gripes, the melee combat is based around a new combo system that encourages mixing up attacks, basically by button mashing. It's actually kind of fun if it was limited to skilled opponents, but it creates of a leveling effect that has stormtroopers trading blows with jedi, while you will easily dispatch sith lords and assassins. It also takes WAY too many blaster shots to kill pretty much all enemies.\r\n\r\nOk, all that in mind, this game is trying hard to be the best Lego game ever, and it's NEARLY succeeding. This has all the best elements from previous Lego games. The exploration is vast and rewarding. Most of the levels integrate directly into the world around them. While the leveling combat feels questionable in story levels, it feels very appropriate while freely exploring the galaxy, which I think might be the point. I haven't encountered any COMPLETELY broken puzzles. Definitely some glitches, but so far nothing that required quitting or reloading to progress.\r\n\r\nI don't know if Lego Skywalker is the BEST Lego game ever, but it's gotta be top 3, and it's definitely my favorite. This is like Lego Hobbit if they actually finished it instead of just having the game end at a totally arbitrary point in the story for no apparent reason.\r\n\r\nDon't let the 12 hours fool you, I'm at about 60% on the Switch, but it's VASTLY superior on PC.

      "review": "As a game in isolation, it equally feels bloated and without substance. To look at the main game, if there were no predecessors within the LEGO franchise as a whole; looking at the poor and clunky level designs, forced camera movements, odd narrative choices (It didn't feel like they made a consistent choice towards prioritising the original story, the LEGO version of the story or even just the LEGO humour) and the EXTREMELY hard-to-navigate hub, which literally had taken me hours to use efficiently, this game would already be seen with a negative lens. Which honestly makes it so much worse WHEN compared to the previous games. \n\nFor the sake of honesty I purchased this game as an homage to the enjoyment I had when playing the original LEGO Star Wars on my old family PS2 many years ago, and between the bias of nostalgia and now being a adult with the experiences of good and enjoyable games, full knowing this is a game made with the primary consumer being kids. I truly just disliked playing this game regardless. To even finish this game, not achievement hunt but just finish it, I somehow got burnout and had to return to it even with story and narrative to still experience with the assistance of external entertainment because of all these issues and then some.\n\nThe complaints I have towards achievement hunting however go further then the already mentioned issues. It's a SLOG, now this is where I believe i can start justifying having reasonable crash-out worth reactions to this game because no child is going to have the patience for 1200 of a singular collectable type, 140 side missions and another 300+ character, ships and mics collectables to collect let alone your average person because the only reason I found justification in achievement hunting this game is that I had already spent WAY too many hours playing it to NOT finish what I started. \nLike I said first, the HUD and the menu system are way too flooded, for example; whenever you're flying out in space for the variety of reasons that would be for, you're met with so much at any given time; space battles, potential cruisers with unskippable cutscenes, small collectables, tracking pings for a dozen plus small ships and waypoint markers for planets on TOP of whatever mission/sidemission tracker is present. Secondly having collectables on EVERY planet, side location, house and mission is already alot but having those collectables be soft-locked until after certain story elements, niche side-missions, player collectable progression and even just the number of times you were present at a location is SO SO taxing and unrewarding. I generally in open-world-adjacent games like to consciously get collectables and side missions in new/undiscovered areas just for the sake of parallel progression for the sake of not doing a huge collectables rush at the end of the game. In this game that is literally impossible and not by a small margin either, between that constant soft locking, the sheer number of cross-environment missions, the loading times/travel cut scenes in-between and the game registering what side quest you're doing because you could literally sneeze in one pile of scrap and progress four different micro scavenge missions that the game kicks you out of whatever objective you are doing and replaces it whatever it sees fit means you are spending an indescribable amount of time regretting the fact you even opened the game. \n\nAll-in-all for your average play; main missions, exploration and general experience, you are already going to have a rough time justifying buying this game. Gameplay is truly repetitive even in the main missions, mini-bosses and main bosses just don't take damage when the game doesn't want it and the LEGO humour elements don't make up for any of the other lacking elements.\nFor you achievement hunters out there; just don't do it, there aren't even ways to mass unlock collected unlockables, the meticulous process of unlocking every currency locked item is already a 20 minute process in itself, let alone how unrewarding investing your time is into a game like this where no section of this game is genuinely enjoyable. Good luck anyway",

I don't find the open world areas interesting to explore, and all the missions and challenges are extremely tedious to me, and the levels in the story missions are just really boring and not fun to play. The platforming isn't interesting most of the time, and there's not much to explore in these levels either. \n\nMy biggest issue is just that it doesn't feel anywhere near as whimsical and charming as the original. Beyond a few fun idle animations and easter eggs in particular character interactions here and there, there's very little cute little background details, and the humour is so incredibly try hard sometimes, especially in the dialogue written for the cutscenes. I want to like this, it's a Lego Star Wars game, of course I want to like it, but I just don't find myself having fun when I'm playing it. \n\nIf you love grinding for collectables, this is probably awesome, but if you want another fun charming Lego game that has fun Lego Levels recreating the Star Wars films, it's probably not gonna appeal to you.",

I don't know if you can consider this a review, more like my collection of rants and feelings. If you like the game, and think it's better than TCS, good for you. You have your feelings, so do I. \n\n1 - Why is this open world? Why couldn't we have a singular hub? Sure the planets are nice and cool to look (especially with the LEGO aesthetic) but in exploring and getting the Kyber bricks, it just felt boring and a chore. And remember there's like, what, 40 of these planets? Yeah, once I visited every planet, I was done. I don’t have time for checklists. \n\n2 - Regarding the levels, they were underwhelming. Yeah they had a joke here and there but there was no sense of exploration and I did not feel rewarded when I went to do my own thing. I don't know how you shoehorned scripted events in a LEGO game, but here we are. Past games had streamlined fun with fun puzzles and funny Easter eggs. There is little of that and what little is there is just forgettable.\n\n\n3 - And the UI. THE USER INTERFACE. I have no idea why it is so crowded and complicated. What is this? Knights of the Old Republic? This game does not have multiple endings, dialog trees, varying weapons, leveling up, so why is the UI like this? This is a huge turnoff when devs make their UI complicated all to make their game look and feel deeper than it really is. There is no consequences for failure (if that's possible in this game) and there's only one attack button. So why is your UI like this? \n\n4 - At least space travels are good I guess. I always loved Star Wars ships and especially flying the ones I built is cool. But you will of course have to unlock them by progressing through the game. No thank you. If the game was fun then yeah.\n\nAgain, maybe I am too grumpy. Maybe I am legit. I don’t think Skywalker had that goofy charm and simpleness the past games had. If you want to get the game, get it on sale so if you hate it, you didn't burn your wallet. But at least get TCS with the extra cash. Yeah get both and test both (although how could you claim to love Star Wars and not have played TCS?). Whatever you feel about those games, it belongs to you. But my feelings belong to me.

The platforming isn't interesting most of the time, and there's not much to explore in these levels either. \n\nMy biggest issue is just that it doesn't feel anywhere near as whimsical and charming as the original. Beyond a few fun idle animations and easter eggs in particular character interactions here and there, there's very little cute little background details, and the humour is so incredibly try hard sometimes, especially in the dialogue written for the cutscenes. I want to like this, it's a Lego Star Wars game, of course I want to like it, but I just don't find myself having fun when I'm playing it. \n\nIf you love grinding for collectables, this is probably awesome, but if you want another fun charming Lego game that has fun Lego Levels recreating the Star Wars films, it's probably not gonna appeal to you.",

This game from 2020 still has the same bugs and poor optimization as the game from 2007. Atrocious lags in certain parts where you ride a ship/vehicle, oftentimes accompanied by the game crashing entirely and losing all the progress you made in the mission up until that point. And I MORE than fulfill the recommended system specs, so it's not related to my PC.\n\nThe gameplay itself is fairly enjoyable, but lots of content is locked behind replaying missions (impossible to collect a lot of collectibles on the initial playthrough) and the poor optimization further limits the fun to be had. \n\nIt's kinda sad that the developers don't seem to see a need to improve their games on a fundamental level, otherwise I'd happily recommend these to others.

I don't know if you can consider this a review, more like my collection of rants and feelings. If you like the game, and think it's better than TCS, good for you. You have your feelings, so do I. \n\n1 - Why is this open world? Why couldn't we have a singular hub? Sure the planets are nice and cool to look (especially with the LEGO aesthetic) but in exploring and getting the Kyber bricks, it just felt boring and a chore. And remember there's like, what, 40 of these planets? Yeah, once I visited every planet, I was done. I don’t have time for checklists. \n\n2 - Regarding the levels, they were underwhelming. Yeah they had a joke here and there but there was no sense of exploration and I did not feel rewarded when I went to do my own thing. I don't know how you shoehorned scripted events in a LEGO game, but here we are. Past games had streamlined fun with fun puzzles and funny Easter eggs. There is little of that and what little is there is just forgettable.\n\n\n3 - And the UI. THE USER INTERFACE. I have no idea why it is so crowded and complicated. What is this? Knights of the Old Republic? This game does not have multiple endings, dialog trees, varying weapons, leveling up, so why is the UI like this? This is a huge turnoff when devs make their UI complicated all to make their game look and feel deeper than it really is. There is no consequences for failure (if that's possible in this game) and there's only one attack button. So why is your UI like this? \n\n4 - At least space travels are good I guess. I always loved Star Wars ships and especially flying the ones I built is cool. But you will of course have to unlock them by progressing through the game. No thank you. If the game was fun then yeah.\n\nAgain, maybe I am too grumpy. Maybe I am legit. I don’t think Skywalker had that goofy charm and simpleness the past games had. If you want to get the game, get it on sale so if you hate it, you didn't burn your wallet. But at least get TCS with the extra cash. Yeah get both and test both (although how could you claim to love Star Wars and not have played TCS?). Whatever you feel about those games, it belongs to you. But my feelings belong to me.

I don't find the open world areas interesting to explore, and all the missions and challenges are extremely tedious to me, and the levels in the story missions are just really boring and not fun to play. The platforming isn't interesting most of the time, and there's not much to explore in these levels either. \n\nMy biggest issue is just that it doesn't feel anywhere near as whimsical and charming as the original. Beyond a few fun idle animations and easter eggs in particular character interactions here and there, there's very little cute little background details, and the humour is so incredibly try hard sometimes, especially in the dialogue written for the cutscenes. I want to like this, it's a Lego Star Wars game, of course I want to like it, but I just don't find myself having fun when I'm playing it. \n\nIf you love grinding for collectables, this is probably awesome, but if you want another fun charming Lego game that has fun Lego Levels recreating the Star Wars films, it's probably not gonna appeal to you.",

      "review": "As a game in isolation, it equally feels bloated and without substance. To look at the main game, if there were no predecessors within the LEGO franchise as a whole; looking at the poor and clunky level designs, forced camera movements, odd narrative choices (It didn't feel like they made a consistent choice towards prioritising the original story, the LEGO version of the story or even just the LEGO humour) and the EXTREMELY hard-to-navigate hub, which literally had taken me hours to use efficiently, this game would already be seen with a negative lens. Which honestly makes it so much worse WHEN compared to the previous games. \n\nFor the sake of honesty I purchased this game as an homage to the enjoyment I had when playing the original LEGO Star Wars on my old family PS2 many years ago, and between the bias of nostalgia and now being a adult with the experiences of good and enjoyable games, full knowing this is a game made with the primary consumer being kids. I truly just disliked playing this game regardless. To even finish this game, not achievement hunt but just finish it, I somehow got burnout and had to return to it even with story and narrative to still experience with the assistance of external entertainment because of all these issues and then some.\n\nThe complaints I have towards achievement hunting however go further then the already mentioned issues. It's a SLOG, now this is where I believe i can start justifying having reasonable crash-out worth reactions to this game because no child is going to have the patience for 1200 of a singular collectable type, 140 side missions and another 300+ character, ships and mics collectables to collect let alone your average person because the only reason I found justification in achievement hunting this game is that I had already spent WAY too many hours playing it to NOT finish what I started. \nLike I said first, the HUD and the menu system are way too flooded, for example; whenever you're flying out in space for the variety of reasons that would be for, you're met with so much at any given time; space battles, potential cruisers with unskippable cutscenes, small collectables, tracking pings for a dozen plus small ships and waypoint markers for planets on TOP of whatever mission/sidemission tracker is present. Secondly having collectables on EVERY planet, side location, house and mission is already alot but having those collectables be soft-locked until after certain story elements, niche side-missions, player collectable progression and even just the number of times you were present at a location is SO SO taxing and unrewarding. I generally in open-world-adjacent games like to consciously get collectables and side missions in new/undiscovered areas just for the sake of parallel progression for the sake of not doing a huge collectables rush at the end of the game. In this game that is literally impossible and not by a small margin either, between that constant soft locking, the sheer number of cross-environment missions, the loading times/travel cut scenes in-between and the game registering what side quest you're doing because you could literally sneeze in one pile of scrap and progress four different micro scavenge missions that the game kicks you out of whatever objective you are doing and replaces it whatever it sees fit means you are spending an indescribable amount of time regretting the fact you even opened the game. \n\nAll-in-all for your average play; main missions, exploration and general experience, you are already going to have a rough time justifying buying this game. Gameplay is truly repetitive even in the main missions, mini-bosses and main bosses just don't take damage when the game doesn't want it and the LEGO humour elements don't make up for any of the other lacking elements.\nFor you achievement hunters out there; just don't do it, there aren't even ways to mass unlock collected unlockables, the meticulous process of unlocking every currency locked item is already a 20 minute process in itself, let alone how unrewarding investing your time is into a game like this where no section of this game is genuinely enjoyable.

Just about the only consistently fun thing about the core gameplay loop is the ship combat.\r\n\r\nI think the game's biggest flaw however is it's lackluster attitude towards levels. There's only five levels per chapter and they're either too short or feel like a chore, and on top of that a lot of portions of the chapters are done in the overworld even though they could've easily been made into levels. Seriously, tell me why the segment where Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan board the trade federation ship couldn't have been a level on it's own? it's about as long as some of the levels in the game anyway. I just feel like the lack of quality in it's levels are such a letdown and they aren't really fun to replay either because as previously mentioned most of them are either a slog or too short.\r\n\r\nOverall I do think fun can be had with this game if you're a Star Wars fan, but if you're a fan of prior Lego games like I am and played nearly ALL the ones that came out since 2005, you're probably gonna find this a pretty weak installment.",
