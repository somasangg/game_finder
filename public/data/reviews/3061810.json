      "review": "Pirate Yakuza reminds me why I love this series. Beneath the over the top action, absurd and funny moments, it has its heart rooted firmly on reality. It explores life as a whole: bits of absurd, bits of funny, some parts intense and other parts heartwarming while can still be sad. It's a mix of those feelings that is the heart of the series and while at first glance Pirate Yakuza is the most absurd canon spin off/side story in the series with pirates and chasing after legendary treasure, it still focuses on human relationships and dreams handled with sensitivity and care. \r\n\r\nNarrative wise, while this game's Chapter 2 has its quality dips with its pacing slowed to a halt, especially after its stellar prologue. The pacing recovers well from Chapter 3 onwards with great character developments all throughout the story. The genius in Pirate Yakuza's narrative is it uses Majima as an unreliable narrator; narrating his story as an amnesiac turned pirate chasing legendary treasure and elixir of life. You know things definitely happened, but the details are not clear since the story is from Majima's POV and it fits his persona as the Mad Dog. That plot device is still used in the after credit that it even recontextualize the whole story into a tale of someone wanting to bring hope to a hospitalized friend, that friend is obviously Kiryu who is in hospital after what happened in Infiite Wealth. It's handled with such care that I personally find it so touching, much more so because I have a family member who is also fighting an illness.\r\n\r\nThe actual pirate story is filled with great characters who develop throughout the story with their own motives and personalities often bring tensions around each others. While the villain could've had more screentime to give him more depth, I know why RGG focuses more on the other characters like Noah, Masaru, Saejima, etc. Because of Pirate Yakuza's tone is more fairy tale since it is essentially told by Majima, the conflict between Majima and the villain is much more clearly defined like good vs evil. I think this simpler conflict fits the game's tone and what it's trying to say, though I understand if people expect more depth for the conflict similar to the other entries in the series. Overall though, it's a good story of Majima helping repay a kid for saving his life by trying to achieve the kid's dream. It is well written, straightforward and also heartwarming while still having bits of conflicts from secondary villains and other supporting characters that add depth to the story.\r\n\r\nGameplay wise, compared to Kiryu's Gaiden game which plays much more like a mainline Yakuza game, Pirate Yakuza is much more experimental and takes more advantage at being a spin off/side story game. As much as I love Kiryu's Gaiden, that game's spy thriller aspect doesn't translate to its gameplay while Pirate Yakuza has a fully fuctional pirate ship to control, building your crews and ships, etc. It plays both like a Yakuza game and a pirate game which it delivers on both aspects. As such it is experimental by design and I appreciate it. The combat feels a bit different with Majima having a jump that he can use to either dodge or aerial combo while the ship combat feels good with quite limited but distinct choice of weapons to choose. Both combat modes feel good to play and Mad Dog fighting style in this game is my favorite iteration of Majima's styles. Combining Thug and Mad Dog into 1 style is such a great idea and the moveset feels so fitting for majima as a character and plays great mechanically. Sea Dog style is also equally good to use with its sidearms that are much more seamless to use than Gaiden's Agent style's gadgets. Also the implementation of equipments in the form of rings that are visible on Majima's fingers is cool. Some of the rings also alter the combat like having the mad dog style much more faster or the boomerang sidearm to last longer are great although there's too many rings that increase attack power. These games are not hard and there's already permanent skills to upgrade attack power so having many rings that increase attack power is just too much (although there's a mod that makes the rings to not increase attack power).\r\n\r\nAlso quite unexpectedly, Pirate Yakuza is the only RGG game that has issues with NVIDIA DLSS. I encountered missing visual/black screen a couple times when using DLSS. I had no such issues with any other RGG games and there's a couple times where the fps is not stable. Apart from Yakuza 6 which was the first Dragon Engine game so that game was understandable to have technical issues, Pirate Yakuza is the one with similar technical issues which is unfortunate since the game looks great and often run great too.\r\n\r\nOverall, personally I feel like Pirate Yakuza is RGG unflitered. This game is just the devs having fun with the gameplay aspects and just want to tell a story the way they want without a burden to impress anyone and for me personally, it's great. It's such a good feeling to play an entry in a long running series that dares to do something different, it even has two musical notes in the game which are hilarious and then the story concludes in one of the most touching bromance scene. This is precisely why I love this series. Despite some of the experiments in this game fails a bit like the story's uneven pacing in chapter 2, the final villain lacking more depth, the hitbox from gun sidearm is sometimes not functioning properly and technical issues, it still delivers on telling a sincere human drama with a much more hopeful tone, which is a great decision due to the previous entries often end on bittersweet endings.",

Never, EVER, did I expect RGG releasing a game combining my favorite boy Majima into one of my favorite themes! Pirates! It was meant to be!\n\nObviously, my review may be bias, but the gameplay, especially the fighting in the pirate ships, is very fun. I’m also digging the way RGG‘s going by having only two different fighting styles for the smaller games. Same thing like Gaidon: The Man Who Raised His Name and soon Kiwami 3, there are two main fighting styles that are fun to switch back-and-forth to.\n\nBut I will admit, there are some down falls in this game that I wasn’t too happy with. One being there are some scenes that the lighting is very blown out and distracting. It’s too much at times and it ruins some cutscenes. The other thing is that I wish you can still revisit the islands you’ve raided. Once you get the treasure there, the island is complete and you longer have access to it. It would’ve been neat if there other reasons we could be able to keep raiding those islands because not only I found those moments to be really cool and fun, but also more of a reason to keep sailing around in the other maps. The music especially hits hard during those raids.\n\nBesides that, I find the story was very wholesome, and the lesson it’s teaches you. Especially to what’s currently happening in the main storyline of Like a Dragon. A subtle way of preparing us to what may come in the next title.",

But then, it doesn't make you do it. You could also simply skip a few of those repetitive mini games and still do very well in the game.\nSome of the substories add quite a lot of ... well, stories that are not connected to the main storyline, which in my book is always a big plus. Many of the characters have their own back stories, same as some of the pets which can join the Goro Goro Animal Kingdom.\n\nMe personally, I'm not a fan of remembering comboes in fighting games and stuff. The game has you covered there too, by offering settings to simplify the controls which can trigger moves, otherwise hidden behind certain input combos, automatically.\n\nI'll be on the lookout for other Yakuza games.

Villains feel ramshackle and poorly paced, and the more interesting aspects of the story are all too often briefly touched on before being left abandoned. \r\n\r\nThe gameplay is a mixed bag, as well. The presence of side stories alone raises the category above Gaiden, and their quality is solid to good, but Honolulu feels even more empty than in Infinite Wealth. If RGG is going to keep coming back to this setting, it needs to be revised and elevated; it needs to have the same level of detail Kamurocho, Sotenbori, and Ijincho have in abundance. Combat is fun as a gimmick, but neither combat style has depth to match its panache, and far, far too many fights amount to the Yakuza 6 textbook of throwing tons and tons of guys at you. \r\n\r\nI really think Gaiden's price point of $50 would suit Pirate Yakuza better, but if you're enthusiastic about pirates or the Yakuza franchise, $60 still does garner a recommendation from me, albeit one more tacit than I've made for RGG's games in recent years.",

I wasn’t rushing through the main story; instead, I made it a point to complete every side story and mini-game before touching the final chapters. That’s just how I enjoy these games.\r\n\r\nThe story missions themselves are fun and engaging. The narrative has its moments, and while it didn’t blow me away, I liked the ending and appreciated the teaser for the next Yakuza entry. It left me curious about what’s coming next.\r\n\r\nCombat-wise, it’s solid but a bit repetitive. The heat actions are cool and flashy, but it’s always off-putting how everyone else disappears during them except for the enemy you’re targeting. Then they just reappear like nothing happened, which breaks the immersion. It’s also strange that characters use swords, knives, guns, and even hooks, yet there’s no real visual damage—just some slash marks and fake blood splats that enemies shake off like it’s nothing. It feels disconnected from the intensity of the weapons being used. That said, the two new fighting styles are distinct and add some welcome variety.\r\n\r\nThe battleship gameplay was a mixed bag. It was fun in concept, but the equipment system felt unbalanced. Min-maxing wasn’t satisfying. I just slapped the strongest weapons—laser cannons, rocket launchers, and miniguns—on both sides and steamrolled everything. There wasn’t much incentive to experiment with different loadouts when the most powerful gear made everything else obsolete.\r\n\r\nOverall, it’s a good time, especially if you’re into the Yakuza formula. It’s not perfect, but it’s packed with charm, side content, and that signature RGG flavor. If you’re a fan of the series, you’ll find plenty to enjoy here. I'd say this is way better like a dragon entry than the Like A Dragon: Ishin! game they release a while back ago. But that's me just liking the Hawaii and modern day setting compared to the Bakumatsu era setting.",

Y3 on legend was frustrating because the AI just blocks all day, and Ishin was janky, like every input registers a frame late and an atrocious camera. This game's combat is terrible because I felt like I was playing Dynasty Warriors. You just button mash to win, and sometimes you have to button mash because some idiot at RGG decided to have you fight huge mobs just like in DW, but since the screen becomes all cluttered with friend and foe that blocks vision of what you character model is doing, you just smash buttons and hope it works out instead of inputting deliberate combos. Then, to add oil to fire, they decided to add a jump to this game. I cannot tell you how many times I wanted to sprint, but only ended up jumping in place, or how many times my combos got messed up because I accidentally jumped.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the story, it felt really inconsequential. In Gaiden, which was also a \".5\" game, you actually felt the relationship build between Kiryu and Hanawa, and the final payoff with an emotional Kiryu at the end of the game made it so you went on a journey with a purpose. In this game, I didn't care for any one. There were too many allies in this short game to actually build a relationship with, and the enemies literally just phase in and out like a rotating roulette of villains. At the end of the game, nothing has really changed for Majima. The sad thing is, some of the characters could've really had potential. Naomi (and her interactions with Saejima) comes to mind. At this point, it should be clear that RGG don't know what to do with female characters aside from using them as plot devices.\r\n\r\nAlso, a personal \"wtf\" moment  - somehow you're tasked with chasing down the bad, evil Devil Flags for stealing someone else's treasure as a righteous hero, but then you go and steal Esperanza's treasure that belongs to the Nele islanders? \r\n\r\nFor a long time player of the series, this game was a poor effort, but if you come into it with no expectations, and no frame of reference, then this could be a buy-on-sale game to try.",

Combat has seen the biggest downgrade - forget combos, positioning, and strategy, now that every brawl is against a small army of foes, the most efficient way to beat em' down is to just spam X and Y. Pile on top the sheer number of battles thrown at you to pad out the game's length and you have the perfect recipe for tedium. It get's old very fast, and as the story slowly drags itself along, requiring you to go to A to B and back to A just for the heck of it, you really start to question what makes this experience worth it.\n\nSo what does? The naval combat? No. Like all Yakuza minigames, the naval combat is just an under-baked gimmick; it's fun for a while and certainly adds to the experience, but you are just simply never going to spend hours drifting around the ocean shooting cannonballs and lasers at pirate ships over and over, outside of when you're required to, when the only rewards are: money (to make you more lethal in brawls) and rings (to make you more lethal in brawls). Who in their right mind is going to spend hours grinding repetitive naval battles to make the repetitive but already easy brawling even easier?\n\nThere really isn't that much to like here, and I say that as someone who has played every game in this series. The gameplay is boring, the narrative serves no purpose, and literally everything feels low quality, low effort, and outdated. Don't believe me? Take one look at a Madlantis to see the disgustingly high-contrast lighting and the most egregious and inconsiderate asset flipping this series has seen to date. \n\nHow could I possibly recommend a game where it feels like not even a single thought was put into any of it's design?

He becomes embroiled with a Yakuza story but the Mad dog of shimano is never really a factor. \n\nThe story isn't all that great, and the combat also feels very lacking. I mentionned Devil May cry earlier, and it's because this game really tries to make Majima into a weird Nero, moveset wise. Moverset wise, he's got a devil bringer, blue rose, round trip, and the gameplay really wants you to start juggling bodies but it doesn't have nearly the depth that DMC has. Instead of the classic X > X > X > Y > Y combos for examples, i'd have liked it better if we had DMC's motion inputs, where holding back while doing the combots throws enemies into the air. \n\nIt's also too easy. I didn't do a lot of sidequestion and I completely rolled on everything with little to no difficulty. Just use mad dog style for individual fights and sea dog for group fights. \n\nIt could have been way better if they went and made more changes to the formula we're all to familiar with.

I love majima, as Yakuza 0 was my first game then played every single entry after that ( through Xbox pc not on my steam ) and even though 3 had terrible combat, still had a much more compelling story than this game. The board gameplay gets very old very fast, the two styles are a huge shame as for example Lost judgment which is one of my favourites had four battle styles than an additional 2 with the DLC (Kaito) and Kaito actually just felt more polished and that was just a dlc worth not even half of what this game is. The graphics are nice as always, but very bright and washed out in some areas (5090 so no excuse for my rig). The new characters were alright like Jason for example, however having a literal child follow you every where in this game totally took me right out of the story. I just wish I didn’t have this annoying child who shouldn’t even be on this journey in the first place follow me for majority of the game, which severally let me down throughout the entirety of the story. I don’t just love these games for the gameplay, I love them for the story as well and this game definitely has the weakest story of any Yakuza game so far. I just finished through lost judgment on detective mode and will go back to 100% and when you compare these two games, Pirate in Hawaii in just such a huge disappoint in every aspect compared to that game except of course Majima which is a top tier Yakuza character. Hence why this game hurts my soul so much, for his own game I really wish the would have done a better job, with a much grittier storyline. This game is not worth 80$ at all especially for five acts. Kaito files had four acts and is 30 bucks and some change yet that story was miles and miles better and more compelling than this game. I don’t think this studio has lost their touch with game making at all, I just think this is a weaker entry to date and I really hope Kiwami 3. Is better than this game as they are the same price. I wouldn’t call this a bad game, but I can’t recommend either. Just very disappointed in general and 20 hours to finish the story and a lot of side content? For 80 bucks? I just don’t think it’s worth it. Get it on deep sale if you do plan on buying it.",

Weird because Infinite Wealth didn't have this problem.\n\n(Majima) Combat is dogshit. Pure buttonmash spam with silly effects and no serious combos to break it up. The game knows it sucks and sharts enemies at you constantly in hordes with 10hp each, knowing that your attacks are all essentially just \"do some big crazy spin shit and slam out loads of low damage in a 360 arc\". Massive downgrade from Gaiden and even the older DE games. The ship combat is perfectly passable even though it feels like the devs weren't able to collate the systems they came up with into a proper package. The rating of your weapons will determine the outcome of a fight moreso than your combat manoeuvres or style of offense.\n\nStory is nonsensical, whimsical bullshit but doesn't play into its goofyness and instead tries really hard to get you to care about the most bland-ass, PG12 rated characters and plot you've ever witnessed. Terrible writing, objectively one of the worst written RGG games ever.\n\nI have to sit here and admit I lost the energy to finish playing this game around halfway through.

The new combat mechanics can feel solid at first, but they get boring fast. The fights themselves feel terrible. Remember Clan Creator, or those colosseum minigames in past Yakuza games where you fight a hundred people?

If you have any form of photosensitivity, do NOT buy this game unless you’re planning to install a mod to fix it. I’d be lucky to leave a session with only a minor headache. Dark areas are literally pitch black, and bright areas like Honolulu’s streets in the morning are blindingly white. I don’t know what went wrong here. Maybe it’s just me, but I’ve seen plenty of others complain about the lighting too, and there’s even a mod dedicated to fixing it.\n\nThe game just isn’t that good. I wasn't too invested in the story because it really was a pirate spinoff instead of an actual continuation of the story (save for some moments).

The guys at RGG have always managed to throw out quality stuff annually. Yeah, you get reused assets like animations and music in side quests, but they always make up for it with a great story and epic fist fights...\n\nThey've dropped the ball with Pirate Yakuza though.\n\nThe story was below average, the pacing and use of characters felt off, and the emotional moments never hit home.\n\nGameplay-wise, Majima's fighting styles (Mad Dog and Sea Dog) are the worst fighting styles that the series has produced thus far. They don't flow well, and feel very awkward and limited compared to past instalments. The ship battles are probably the highlight because they can get quite tense when you face harder opponents.\n\nLike others have said, there are still technical issues on PC: the visual contrast is broken and there is a micro-stuttering issue. Not game breaking, but still noticeable.\n\nHonestly, the older games had much better gameplay. We've been in this Dragon Engine since Yakuza 6 now and it's just not as good as say Yakuza 5 or 0 (best combat in the series imo). RGG won't go back though, but it would be nice if they could reinvent the wheel again for this franchise.\n\nPirate Yakuza may be a miss this time around, but I have high hopes for Stranger than Heaven and Kiwami 3.",

Y3 on legend was frustrating because the AI just blocks all day, and Ishin was janky, like every input registers a frame late and an atrocious camera. This game's combat is terrible because I felt like I was playing Dynasty Warriors. You just button mash to win, and sometimes you have to button mash because some idiot at RGG decided to have you fight huge mobs just like in DW, but since the screen becomes all cluttered with friend and foe that blocks vision of what you character model is doing, you just smash buttons and hope it works out instead of inputting deliberate combos. Then, to add oil to fire, they decided to add a jump to this game. I cannot tell you how many times I wanted to sprint, but only ended up jumping in place, or how many times my combos got messed up because I accidentally jumped.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the story, it felt really inconsequential. In Gaiden, which was also a \".5\" game, you actually felt the relationship build between Kiryu and Hanawa, and the final payoff with an emotional Kiryu at the end of the game made it so you went on a journey with a purpose. In this game, I didn't care for any one. There were too many allies in this short game to actually build a relationship with, and the enemies literally just phase in and out like a rotating roulette of villains. At the end of the game, nothing has really changed for Majima. The sad thing is, some of the characters could've really had potential. Naomi (and her interactions with Saejima) comes to mind. At this point, it should be clear that RGG don't know what to do with female characters aside from using them as plot devices.\r\n\r\nAlso, a personal \"wtf\" moment  - somehow you're tasked with chasing down the bad, evil Devil Flags for stealing someone else's treasure as a righteous hero, but then you go and steal Esperanza's treasure that belongs to the Nele islanders? \r\n\r\nFor a long time player of the series, this game was a poor effort, but if you come into it with no expectations, and no frame of reference, then this could be a buy-on-sale game to try.",

Combat has seen the biggest downgrade - forget combos, positioning, and strategy, now that every brawl is against a small army of foes, the most efficient way to beat em' down is to just spam X and Y. Pile on top the sheer number of battles thrown at you to pad out the game's length and you have the perfect recipe for tedium. It get's old very fast, and as the story slowly drags itself along, requiring you to go to A to B and back to A just for the heck of it, you really start to question what makes this experience worth it.\n\nSo what does? The naval combat? No. Like all Yakuza minigames, the naval combat is just an under-baked gimmick; it's fun for a while and certainly adds to the experience, but you are just simply never going to spend hours drifting around the ocean shooting cannonballs and lasers at pirate ships over and over, outside of when you're required to, when the only rewards are: money (to make you more lethal in brawls) and rings (to make you more lethal in brawls). Who in their right mind is going to spend hours grinding repetitive naval battles to make the repetitive but already easy brawling even easier?\n\nThere really isn't that much to like here, and I say that as someone who has played every game in this series. The gameplay is boring, the narrative serves no purpose, and literally everything feels low quality, low effort, and outdated. Don't believe me? Take one look at a Madlantis to see the disgustingly high-contrast lighting and the most egregious and inconsiderate asset flipping this series has seen to date. \n\nHow could I possibly recommend a game where it feels like not even a single thought was put into any of it's design?

He becomes embroiled with a Yakuza story but the Mad dog of shimano is never really a factor. \n\nThe story isn't all that great, and the combat also feels very lacking. I mentionned Devil May cry earlier, and it's because this game really tries to make Majima into a weird Nero, moveset wise. Moverset wise, he's got a devil bringer, blue rose, round trip, and the gameplay really wants you to start juggling bodies but it doesn't have nearly the depth that DMC has. Instead of the classic X > X > X > Y > Y combos for examples, i'd have liked it better if we had DMC's motion inputs, where holding back while doing the combots throws enemies into the air. \n\nIt's also too easy. I didn't do a lot of sidequestion and I completely rolled on everything with little to no difficulty.

The board gameplay gets very old very fast, the two styles are a huge shame as for example Lost judgment which is one of my favourites had four battle styles than an additional 2 with the DLC (Kaito) and Kaito actually just felt more polished and that was just a dlc worth not even half of what this game is.

The ship combat is perfectly passable even though it feels like the devs weren't able to collate the systems they came up with into a proper package. The rating of your weapons will determine the outcome of a fight moreso than your combat manoeuvres or style of offense.\n\nStory is nonsensical, whimsical bullshit but doesn't play into its goofyness and instead tries really hard to get you to care about the most bland-ass, PG12 rated characters and plot you've ever witnessed. Terrible writing, objectively one of the worst written RGG games ever.\n\nI have to sit here and admit I lost the energy to finish playing this game around halfway through. You need to do some grindy combat nonsense to upgrade the numbers on your equipment and frankly I don't have the energy for that nowadays. \n\nPretty big disappointment but at least RGG tried something different.",

The new combat mechanics can feel solid at first, but they get boring fast. The fights themselves feel terrible. Remember Clan Creator, or those colosseum minigames in past Yakuza games where you fight a hundred people? That’s basically this game’s entire combat system.\n\nThe fight scenes can look cool, there are some decent character moments, and the ship sections can be fun at times. But that’s about all I can say in its favor.\n\nThe biggest problem for me is the lighting. It actually hurts my eyes. If you have any form of photosensitivity, do NOT buy this game unless you’re planning to install a mod to fix it. I’d be lucky to leave a session with only a minor headache. Dark areas are literally pitch black, and bright areas like Honolulu’s streets in the morning are blindingly white. I don’t know what went wrong here. Maybe it’s just me, but I’ve seen plenty of others complain about the lighting too, and there’s even a mod dedicated to fixing it.\n\nThe game just isn’t that good. I wasn't too invested in the story because it really was a pirate spinoff instead of an actual continuation of the story (save for some moments). Don't buy this game if you're expecting a Yakuza game, because this is not it. I liked it, but if I could, I would tell myself to save the money because it's just not worth it in my opinion",

The guys at RGG have always managed to throw out quality stuff annually. Yeah, you get reused assets like animations and music in side quests, but they always make up for it with a great story and epic fist fights...\n\nThey've dropped the ball with Pirate Yakuza though.\n\nThe story was below average, the pacing and use of characters felt off, and the emotional moments never hit home.\n\nGameplay-wise, Majima's fighting styles (Mad Dog and Sea Dog) are the worst fighting styles that the series has produced thus far. They don't flow well, and feel very awkward and limited compared to past instalments. The ship battles are probably the highlight because they can get quite tense when you face harder opponents.\n\nLike others have said, there are still technical issues on PC: the visual contrast is broken and there is a micro-stuttering issue. Not game breaking, but still noticeable.\n\nHonestly, the older games had much better gameplay. We've been in this Dragon Engine since Yakuza 6 now and it's just not as good as say Yakuza 5 or 0 (best combat in the series imo). RGG won't go back though, but it would be nice if they could reinvent the wheel again for this franchise.\n\nPirate Yakuza may be a miss this time around, but I have high hopes for Stranger than Heaven and Kiwami 3.",

Y3 on legend was frustrating because the AI just blocks all day, and Ishin was janky, like every input registers a frame late and an atrocious camera. This game's combat is terrible because I felt like I was playing Dynasty Warriors. You just button mash to win, and sometimes you have to button mash because some idiot at RGG decided to have you fight huge mobs just like in DW, but since the screen becomes all cluttered with friend and foe that blocks vision of what you character model is doing, you just smash buttons and hope it works out instead of inputting deliberate combos. Then, to add oil to fire, they decided to add a jump to this game. I cannot tell you how many times I wanted to sprint, but only ended up jumping in place, or how many times my combos got messed up because I accidentally jumped.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the story, it felt really inconsequential. In Gaiden, which was also a \".5\" game, you actually felt the relationship build between Kiryu and Hanawa, and the final payoff with an emotional Kiryu at the end of the game made it so you went on a journey with a purpose. In this game, I didn't care for any one. There were too many allies in this short game to actually build a relationship with, and the enemies literally just phase in and out like a rotating roulette of villains. At the end of the game, nothing has really changed for Majima. The sad thing is, some of the characters could've really had potential. Naomi (and her interactions with Saejima) comes to mind. At this point, it should be clear that RGG don't know what to do with female characters aside from using them as plot devices.\r\n\r\nAlso, a personal \"wtf\" moment  - somehow you're tasked with chasing down the bad, evil Devil Flags for stealing someone else's treasure as a righteous hero, but then you go and steal Esperanza's treasure that belongs to the Nele islanders? \r\n\r\nFor a long time player of the series, this game was a poor effort, but if you come into it with no expectations, and no frame of reference, then this could be a buy-on-sale game to try.",

Almost no heat actions? Oh, yeah, also it is almost impossible to do a heat action because the prompt will start appearing and dissapearing all the time without giving you time to actually do it. The combat feels so bland compared to Yakuza 0, a complete downgrade, they give you new mechanics like a grapple, a gun, and like cursed tools but they literally give them to you and almost never mention or progress them never again, they give you new mechanics that you won't even use at all.\n\nSpeaking about the pirate part of the game, the ship management and combat, it is pretty weak, the combat isn't that good at all and you cant assault every ship you want, just specific ones from the story or basically the \"strongest\" ships.\n\nThe laziest part of this game, is basically the entire game literally, Honolulu is back with exactly the same map, like almost 95% of the models and everything is reused, the seconday missions are literally the same as in Infinite Wealth, with almost no new variation.\n\nI honestly don't have the strength to finish this game and I feel so sad because I was so hyped to see a new Yakuza game where the main character is Majima and the game going back to the beat 'em up factor, but it was a terrible experience, I only liked the game at the beginning, it started pretty strong for me, but fell off so hard and early...",

Combat has seen the biggest downgrade - forget combos, positioning, and strategy, now that every brawl is against a small army of foes, the most efficient way to beat em' down is to just spam X and Y. Pile on top the sheer number of battles thrown at you to pad out the game's length and you have the perfect recipe for tedium. It get's old very fast, and as the story slowly drags itself along, requiring you to go to A to B and back to A just for the heck of it, you really start to question what makes this experience worth it.\n\nSo what does? The naval combat? No. Like all Yakuza minigames, the naval combat is just an under-baked gimmick; it's fun for a while and certainly adds to the experience, but you are just simply never going to spend hours drifting around the ocean shooting cannonballs and lasers at pirate ships over and over, outside of when you're required to, when the only rewards are: money (to make you more lethal in brawls) and rings (to make you more lethal in brawls). Who in their right mind is going to spend hours grinding repetitive naval battles to make the repetitive but already easy brawling even easier?\n\nThere really isn't that much to like here, and I say that as someone who has played every game in this series. The gameplay is boring, the narrative serves no purpose, and literally everything feels low quality, low effort, and outdated. Don't believe me? Take one look at a Madlantis to see the disgustingly high-contrast lighting and the most egregious and inconsiderate asset flipping this series has seen to date. \n\nHow could I possibly recommend a game where it feels like not even a single thought was put into any of it's design?

He becomes embroiled with a Yakuza story but the Mad dog of shimano is never really a factor. \n\nThe story isn't all that great, and the combat also feels very lacking. I mentionned Devil May cry earlier, and it's because this game really tries to make Majima into a weird Nero, moveset wise. Moverset wise, he's got a devil bringer, blue rose, round trip, and the gameplay really wants you to start juggling bodies but it doesn't have nearly the depth that DMC has. Instead of the classic X > X > X > Y > Y combos for examples, i'd have liked it better if we had DMC's motion inputs, where holding back while doing the combots throws enemies into the air. \n\nIt's also too easy. I didn't do a lot of sidequestion and I completely rolled on everything with little to no difficulty. Just use mad dog style for individual fights and sea dog for group fights. \n\nIt could have been way better if they went and made more changes to the formula we're all to familiar with.

I love majima, as Yakuza 0 was my first game then played every single entry after that ( through Xbox pc not on my steam ) and even though 3 had terrible combat, still had a much more compelling story than this game. The board gameplay gets very old very fast, the two styles are a huge shame as for example Lost judgment which is one of my favourites had four battle styles than an additional 2 with the DLC (Kaito) and Kaito actually just felt more polished and that was just a dlc worth not even half of what this game is. The graphics are nice as always, but very bright and washed out in some areas (5090 so no excuse for my rig). The new characters were alright like Jason for example, however having a literal child follow you every where in this game totally took me right out of the story. I just wish I didn’t have this annoying child who shouldn’t even be on this journey in the first place follow me for majority of the game, which severally let me down throughout the entirety of the story. I don’t just love these games for the gameplay, I love them for the story as well and this game definitely has the weakest story of any Yakuza game so far. I just finished through lost judgment on detective mode and will go back to 100% and when you compare these two games, Pirate in Hawaii in just such a huge disappoint in every aspect compared to that game except of course Majima which is a top tier Yakuza character. Hence why this game hurts my soul so much, for his own game I really wish the would have done a better job, with a much grittier storyline. This game is not worth 80$ at all especially for five acts. Kaito files had four acts and is 30 bucks and some change yet that story was miles and miles better and more compelling than this game. I don’t think this studio has lost their touch with game making at all, I just think this is a weaker entry to date and I really hope Kiwami 3. Is better than this game as they are the same price. I wouldn’t call this a bad game, but I can’t recommend either. Just very disappointed in general and 20 hours to finish the story and a lot of side content? For 80 bucks?

Everything looks nice, its well optimized and runs smoothly with almost every setting, even on my potato PC. The minigames are fun, the combat is satisfying if a bit simple, and the characters are well written and lovable. I just cant play the damn thing! I know it says 10 hours on my profile, but my actual time in game is around 3. everything else was me trying my damnedest to get it to run properly. Even on the lowest possible settings, it still crashes every time in the exact same spot (the Keith fight when you visit Madlantis for the first time) and no matter what I do I just can't get it to run properly. No warning either, no stuttering whatsoever until out of nowhere it freezes and closes to desktop. And i hope to God they actually will fix it because the last update was months ago :(",

      "review": "I can't in good faith recommend this entry. It’s not really a Yakuza game, it’s a pirate game with Yakuza references. The new combat mechanics can feel solid at first, but they get boring fast. The fights themselves feel terrible. Remember Clan Creator, or those colosseum minigames in past Yakuza games where you fight a hundred people? That’s basically this game’s entire combat system.\n\nThe fight scenes can look cool, there are some decent character moments, and the ship sections can be fun at times. But that’s about all I can say in its favor.\n\nThe biggest problem for me is the lighting. It actually hurts my eyes. If you have any form of photosensitivity, do NOT buy this game unless you’re planning to install a mod to fix it. I’d be lucky to leave a session with only a minor headache. Dark areas are literally pitch black, and bright areas like Honolulu’s streets in the morning are blindingly white. I don’t know what went wrong here. Maybe it’s just me, but I’ve seen plenty of others complain about the lighting too, and there’s even a mod dedicated to fixing it.\n\nThe game just isn’t that good. I wasn't too invested in the story because it really was a pirate spinoff instead of an actual continuation of the story (save for some moments). Don't buy this game if you're expecting a Yakuza game, because this is not it. I liked it, but if I could, I would tell myself to save the money because it's just not worth it in my opinion",

The dialogue is stupid, the setting and levels look rushed compared to the other recent games. Crashes to desktop with no warning randomly.\n\nANNOYING ASS CHILD CHARACTER IN EVERY DIALOGUE, I don't mind haruka in the older games but god damn I just started skipping all the parts with Noah (so basically all of it), why bother playing a yakuza game at that point.\n\nThis just feels like they cut one of the business minigames off of infinite wealth and made a stand alone game with it. If I didn't get it on sale I would be trying to get a refund right now.",

      "review": "It's not good, guys.\n\nFirst of all, I'd like to say that the Yakuza/Like a Dragon franchise is my favourite video game series out there. The guys at RGG have always managed to throw out quality stuff annually. Yeah, you get reused assets like animations and music in side quests, but they always make up for it with a great story and epic fist fights...\n\nThey've dropped the ball with Pirate Yakuza though.\n\nThe story was below average, the pacing and use of characters felt off, and the emotional moments never hit home.\n\nGameplay-wise, Majima's fighting styles (Mad Dog and Sea Dog) are the worst fighting styles that the series has produced thus far. They don't flow well, and feel very awkward and limited compared to past instalments. The ship battles are probably the highlight because they can get quite tense when you face harder opponents.\n\nLike others have said, there are still technical issues on PC: the visual contrast is broken and there is a micro-stuttering issue. Not game breaking, but still noticeable.\n\nHonestly, the older games had much better gameplay. We've been in this Dragon Engine since Yakuza 6 now and it's just not as good as say Yakuza 5 or 0 (best combat in the series imo). RGG won't go back though, but it would be nice if they could reinvent the wheel again for this franchise.\n\nPirate Yakuza may be a miss this time around, but I have high hopes for Stranger than Heaven and Kiwami 3.",

I got this game as pre-order…got bored at launch day and almost 6/7 months later I played it to get my money’s worth.\r\n\r\nMaybe I got spoiled by Yakuza 0's Majima...that character was well written and not to mention amazing crazy fighting styles and music tracks exclusive to him...where he pretty much eclipsed the main protagonist Kiryu! Here ALL of that is missing and seems you need to be heavily medicated or under influence of some substance to enjoy the game!?!?\r\n\r\nThere is still stuff to do in this game but nothing new apart from the pirate stuff...which at time feels like a moronic version of assassin’s creed black flag game that is trying real hard to be funny with annoying forced laugh tracks.

      "review": "Tldr: I hated this game as a series vet; it's an okay game for \"casual\" players.\r\n\r\nI have plat'd every game in the Yakuza series twice minus Ishin, originally on PS and then again when I transferred my gaming library to PC, and this game is now tied for the last place with the aforementioned Ishin spinoff. \r\n\r\nTo keep an otherwise lengthy review short, this game fails for me on two main aspects - the combat and the story.\r\n\r\nI played this game on Professional difficulty, and the combat is tied with samurai Yakuza and Yakuza 3 for the worst. Y3 on legend was frustrating because the AI just blocks all day, and Ishin was janky, like every input registers a frame late and an atrocious camera. This game's combat is terrible because I felt like I was playing Dynasty Warriors. You just button mash to win, and sometimes you have to button mash because some idiot at RGG decided to have you fight huge mobs just like in DW, but since the screen becomes all cluttered with friend and foe that blocks vision of what you character model is doing, you just smash buttons and hope it works out instead of inputting deliberate combos. Then, to add oil to fire, they decided to add a jump to this game. I cannot tell you how many times I wanted to sprint, but only ended up jumping in place, or how many times my combos got messed up because I accidentally jumped.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the story, it felt really inconsequential. In Gaiden, which was also a \".5\" game, you actually felt the relationship build between Kiryu and Hanawa, and the final payoff with an emotional Kiryu at the end of the game made it so you went on a journey with a purpose. In this game, I didn't care for any one. There were too many allies in this short game to actually build a relationship with, and the enemies literally just phase in and out like a rotating roulette of villains. At the end of the game, nothing has really changed for Majima. The sad thing is, some of the characters could've really had potential. Naomi (and her interactions with Saejima) comes to mind. At this point, it should be clear that RGG don't know what to do with female characters aside from using them as plot devices.\r\n\r\nAlso, a personal \"wtf\" moment  - somehow you're tasked with chasing down the bad, evil Devil Flags for stealing someone else's treasure as a righteous hero, but then you go and steal Esperanza's treasure that belongs to the Nele islanders? \r\n\r\nFor a long time player of the series, this game was a poor effort, but if you come into it with no expectations, and no frame of reference, then this could be a buy-on-sale game to try.",
