It's a game that has a \"cartoony\" vibe with dark undertones. Think, 2d platformer smashed with a 3d dungeon crawler then add some gore. It's a stylized look, as I'm sure you can tell from the pictures. There isn't much to say about the graphics besides they are awesome if you love tarot cards.\n\nGameplay: Personally I dont give a rats ass if the game is repetitive, if you dislike repetitive games DO NOT GET THIS GAME. I've seen reviews of people talking about how they HATE the gameplay loop. Allow me to describe the game loop to you quickly. \n\nLamb (You) has a cult (Think animal crossing village), and to get materials, they need to leave the cult. Which is where the dungeon crawler comes in. \n\nYou go through an area, get your materials, come back to the cult, build shit, then leave. \n\nSeems repetitive, which it is. However there are some things I glossed over like the fact you can leave the dungeon anytime (If you have the cloak for it, a cloak upgrade is basically when you defeat a big boss you get something to get a new cloak, and an ability of one of those cloaks is you can teleport out of the dungeon whenever you want with a short windup). So you're not \"forced\" to go through the full dungeon. Plus, I've actually seen people completely skip over the dungeon crawler portion, which I find kinda insane. The dungeon crawler is a key component of the game, but you CAN avoid it, HOWEVER it is SIGNIFICANTLY more difficult to deal with your cult.\n\n Basically what I'm stating here is: If you don't like dungeon crawlers this isn't the game for you, but if you love the game enough (stubborn enough) you could avoid that part of the game. You will be missing the story however so it's not recommended. \n\nAlright lets talk about the difficulty of the dungeon crawler itself now that everyone who hates dungeon crawlers has left. \n\nThe difficulty of the dungeon crawler itself is player focused/skill. There are things that can assist, or make it more difficult for players either looking for a challenge or simplicity, which I will not get into much as that leads to spoilers. But lets simplify it, lets say you're just using vanilla lamb (basic/starter kit). Here's the basic dungeon rundown:\n\nWhen you go into a dungeon, the dungeon will show multiple types of rooms. A dungeon run is called a CRUSADE. There's 14 total types of rooms. I would highly recommend searching “Cult Of The Lamb: Level Types” if you're a visual learner. I'll list all the rooms you'll come across keeping one out for spoiler purposes. If not, I'll try to explain here. The brackets are the symbols you'll see\n\nNormal fight (Sword Symbol), Hearts (Heart), Coins (Coin), Food (The Food of that Dungeon), Lumber (Chopped Wood), Stone (Rocks), Bones (Crossbones), Tarot (Card), Shop (Shop), Event (Question Mark), New follower (Stick Figure Kneeling, Holding Hands upward), Miniboss (Skull and Crossbones). \n\nOkay Now ill briefly explain what each room actually IS;\n\nNormal Fight: I will come back to this one to not confuse you\n\nHearts: You get Health\n\nCoins: You get Money\n\nFood: You get Food for your Cult\n\nLumber: You get Wood for your Cult\n\nStone: You get Stone for your Cult\n\nBones: You get Bones for your Cult \n\nTarot: You get an NPC that gives you a temporary bonus ability ONLY for that run\n\nShop: You can buy shit there. Do you not know what a store is? Touch grass.\n\nEvent: This one basically has a chance of a few different rooms and I will avoid stating because of spoilers.\n\n\nNew Follower: You get the CHANCE to free a NPC to join your cult\n\nMiniboss: This one will ONLY EVER appear at the end of the dungeon run. It is exactly as it's said. It's a miniboss. \n\nAlright now you know what rooms are congrats. Let's go back to the Normal Fight room. You will ALWAYS start a Crusade in a Normal Fight Room. A normal fight room is basically where you go through multiple smaller rooms freeroam (you get a minimap) and you fight shit. Make sure you explore everywhere because most of the time you have the chance of running into a Tarot type room, or an NPC, or Treasure. What's Treasure? Treasure can vary. Coins, Materials, or Weapons to use in the dungeon. During the start of the Crusade when you enter the Normal Fight Room you will get 2 weapons. A physical one, and a ranged one, and yes you carry this weapon throughout your entire crusade.\n\nIf your fucking confused. Think of a Russian nesting doll. There are the General levels, which I mentioned. Then the Normal Fight Rooms.\n\nOkay enough about the gameplay, if you really need to know more search up a video stupid. \n\nAudio: The audio is heavenly, you just gotta hear it for yourself. Sadly the person who made the original music passed away. RIP your music was beautiful. \n\nPC Requirements: It's pretty average. You don't need a super computer, but you still have a decent computer. The size is workable, there really isn't much to talk about here, idk what computer you have. Figure it out yourself.\n\nGrind: There isn't a grind. UNLESS you care about achievements. If you do, Well… have fun. \n\nStory: I will not go into the story at all as this is mostly a spoiler free review. However, the story is good, and the Final Boss Fight is awesome. Highly recommended.\n\nGame Time: It gets repetitive, the game will go as long as you can go. \n\nPrice: For me it's highly worth the price, and if you don't think so, just wait for it to go on sale. It goes on sale very often. I bought it full price, with every possible DLC. (Jumping on Woolhaven the second its OFFICIALLY out).\n\nBugs: Very Minor Bugs, If you do find any, report to the discord. They deal with it pretty quickly.\n\nFor me? 10/10 I love being a psychopathic lamb that runs a cult.\n\n\nThanks for reading my essay of a review, and I hope it helps you decide if you would be interested in the game or not! (RIP to my fingers)",

The dark humor, love it.\nI like the roguelike combat, smooth and challenging but not that tryhard challenging. The management and base building are also my things. It's fun to see my base is getting bigger and my followers are having fun. The story is good and after you finished the main story, there are still things to explore and collect.\nWhile the management side isn’t overly complicated, the learning curve is reasonable even if you’re new to roguelikes / sim-management. Also I find it since the launch, the game is more stable, richer, and more polished now.",

The combat half of the game is probably the weakest area, it has enough to keep things interesting in a very hades-roguelike style, but the feel of attack/dodge/special is splashy and imprecise. The saving grace is that it isn't easy, there's enough randomness and chaos to keep you on your toes. The game shines in the base-building and cult-sim portion, which gets more and more enjoyable the more options you unlock. The cute-horror vibes and dark humor that drips from the game are endlessly fun, and the visual treatment is 10/10 total eye candy.",

Role playing the cult made it extra fun, imagining a personality and back story for each one. It becomes hard to do that as the cult grows big but the combat and resource management pulls through. I do find that food eventually becomes too much of a hassle to deal with later, especially when you just want to go on crusades.

From there, you build your following, manage your cult’s resources, explore procedurally generated dungeons, and battle rival cult leaders. The combination of base-building, follower management, and dungeon combat makes the gameplay varied and deeply satisfying.\n\nThe combat is fun and challenging, with a mix of real-time attacks, dodging, and boss battles that keep each dungeon run fresh. Meanwhile, the cult management adds layers of strategy — you feed your followers, assign tasks, and deal with moral choices that impact loyalty, keeping you invested in your little community.\n\nThe visuals and soundtrack are fantastic. The art style is adorable yet slightly sinister, giving the game a unique personality, while the music perfectly balances lighthearted charm and ominous undertones. There are also tons of secrets, upgrades, rituals, and collectibles that reward exploration and experimentation.\n\nReplay value is high thanks to multiple dungeon paths, unique items, and the challenge of maintaining a happy, loyal cult. The game balances humor, strategy, and action in a way few games do, making each session feel fresh and engaging.\n\n10/10 — Darkly charming, endlessly entertaining, and incredibly well-crafted. Cult of the Lamb is a must-play for anyone who loves creativity, strategy, and a little bit of mischief.",

The story isn't overly deep either, however, the aesthetics and the feel of the game is charming and welcoming. \n\nThe overall difficulty, especially very early can feel hard.

The music was perfect for the game, and fits everywhere its put in the game. The music director sadly passed away in April, but he will not be forgotten. The art style is amazing, and they stuck with the style from almost the beginning. The gameplay is a little repetitive, its a simulator game after all. However the story is fun to go through, and theirs a ton to do in the cult when you're not in a raid. When you are in  a crusade its a little challenging at times, but its fun. The pricing of the game, and dlc are reasonable. The new dlc that's coming in 2026 is gonna be the same price as the game, due to it being the same size as the game in content. That sounds fair to me. They are also really in touch with the community for the most part. I would totally recommend this game, and spending the full $25 if you can.",

      "review": "In my opinion, Cult of the Lamb is not a very fun or well put-together game. There are two main sections of gameplay: the dungeon runs and building up your cult. While on first glance it would seem that building up your cult could help make dungeon runs easier, that isn’t really the case. Apart from doing daily sermons to improve your weapon level, there isn’t really a meaningful way for your followers or home base to help you out during the dungeon runs. There are so many ways of improving your base, but there isn’t really any incentive to do so. There is no end goal, no grand achievement to strive for, nothing. All you need is beds for everyone, an autofarm setup, and some lumberyards; anything else does very little to help you. I was into the base expansion at first, but once I realized that it couldn’t help me on runs or lead to an ultimate goal, I lost motivation to expand it further. As for the dungeon runs themselves, they felt way too easy for me. Each run, you get random tarot cards, weapons, relics, and curses, but despite all those things, due to how easy each run was you don’t really notice the slight ways they help. The main difference between runs was the weapons, which each have quite differing attack speeds, making you have to change your attack style. Most enemies could be beaten fairly easily by the simple strategy of rolling towards them, doing a couple os attacks, then rolling back before they can attack you. The combat never really felt all that exciting or fun. And as for the bosses, most were trivially easy to beat. You can just go up to them, spam the attack button, and roll away when they telegraph an attack. Heck, if you have enough health, you don’t even have to roll away. For example, for the third boss I initially tried a strategy of staying away and dodging his attacks, then going in for a few hits after one of his big attacks. I did not get far into the fight during this attempt, especially since he had one attack that I could not figure out the dodge timing for. During my next attempt, I had full health, so I just stood next to him, offloaded a strong curse on him, and spammed the attack button, killing him in 30 seconds and barely taking any damage. The final boss fight was even worse; you could easily just spam the attack button during it and kill him fairly quickly. During his second stage, it did require a bit of dodging since he wasn’t always available to attack, but those attacks were fairly easy to dodge. I also would’ve killed him on my first attempt, but when I beat his first phase, a cutscene started playing, but his fireball attack didn’t stop, which ended up killing me during the cutscene. Anyway, all this to say that the combat in Cult of the Lamb is very basic and very easy, making it quite boring. I wasn’t having a bad time while playing the game, but upon completing the game and reflecting on my experience, I don’t think I had a lot of fun either. Heck, I originally planned to at least get all the upgrades, but after defeating the final boss and seeing the end credits, I felt satisfied enough to stop playing. I don’t think Cult of the Lamb is terrible, but there are many better base-building games and roguelikes out there, so play those instead. Combining them is a neat concept, but it didn’t really execute on that concept very well. 6.5/10",

I understand, I don't have the best hardware, but man why tf is that a problem in this game? Like even when I choose the lowest graphics settings, it still runs in what feels like less than 60 fps. It's especially noticeable when you enter a building, and suddenly the fps becomes normal and the game feels smooth. Guys, common, this isn't the type of game that should make me check the hardware requirements lets be real\n\nAnd another aspect is the gameplay loop. It decent, but not really that entertaining. Even after few hours it starts to feel grindy. The combat is ok, but that's it. Not really entertaining. The cult management is done on a basic level, where you can't even see essential stuff like, who is doing what - and that's important when you assign tasks. Overall, the game feels gimmicky more than anything else really. If it wasn't for performance, mby I would rate it a bit higher, but not significantly\n\nAlso, the price is a factor as well - I don't think it's justified. Dead Cells, Hollow Knight, Hades - they are more or less in the same price range and at least for me, they are levels beyond Cult of The Lamb if you are into action/combat. And Rimworld is just a bit more expensive, if you are looking for a colony sim",

It's not very fun, challenging, or engaging in any way. I found most rooms you can just run through with ease leaving it feeling pretty bland (played on normal difficulty). However, the few times the game did present a challenge I found that the gameplay wasn't sufficient enough for it to feel anything other than unclear hitboxes. The game has a \"pop-up\" effect on all of it's characters, which often leads to combat in the game feeling very loose and makes it hard to discern where hitboxes are. For 90% of my playthrough this wasn't an issue because the gameplay is so bland and simple that it doesn't matter. But for the 10% of the game that was somewhat difficult, I often didn't feel \"challenged\" by the difficulty but more often just sitting there thinking \"Oh, I guess that hits me.\"\r\n\r\nAs for the base building, all the mechanics here are very boring and repetitive. The game does a good job forcing you to interact with each of it's aspects. The base building often forces you to interact with the rogue-like part of the game to get the resources you need. However, this just leads to the game feeling like a chore. As I stated earlier, the combat is very uninspired (Bad Hades if you will) and the base building feels even less so. I often felt like I would unlock things super fast, but never have the resources to keep up with how fast I'd unlock stuff. There was some level of automation in the game, but I felt like the cultists were always terrible at doing their jobs, specifically farming, leading to you needing to do it for them anyways. The day night cycle often left tasks incomplete making it so that progression took much longer than it had any need to, all the while feel like your progression lightning quick with unlocking stuff.\r\n\r\nUltimately, this game is very pretty and has a goofy aesthetic but it's hollow. There is no substance here beyond \"Hey imagine if you sacrificed your animal crossing villagers.\" Go buy Hades if you think the combat looks fun, go buy literally any other base builder if that's what you're looking for.",

It’s visually interesting and occasionally lands some funny moments with its follower systems. The gameplay loop can be engaging, but it’s painfully simplistic.\n\nAs the game reveals more of its design, it quickly loses steam. The combat consists mostly of attacks, dodges, and specials. During a run you can pick up a few passive effects and a relic with an active effect, but none of it synergizes in a meaningful way, and each run feels sort of samey. The dungeon runs are unimaginative, with little variation in builds, events, or enemies that leave an impression. The management side railroads you into necessary buildings and becomes a mandatory tedium and babysitting. I ended up not caring much about either, throwing in the towel after completing two of the four major dungeons.\n\nIf you’re there just for the vibes, don’t mind a simple gameplay loop, and find the management part engaging, Cult of the Lamb might be for you.

You never get it back, you get around 100 coins out of the thousands i had.\n\nUnlocked a new ritual to resurrect your followers? JUST KIDDING! it turns them into zombies more often than not. Want to ascend your followers? Sometimes they just turn into meat for seemingly no reason instead.\n\nUnlocked heavy attack? Congratulations! Now many enemies have suddenly learned to block so you're forced to use it instead of having new enemies requiring the new skill. Half the tech tree feels like you've made a mistake by unlocking it.\n\nThere's so much to like about this game but it's simply awful to it's players.\nI, for one, have had enough",

      "review": "TLDR: Decent for Killing time I guess, 6/10 + Optimization Sucks\n\nI'm glad the game was well received and developers will have an opportunity to work on sth amazing in the future, but god this game's optimization is awful. I understand, I don't have the best hardware, but man why tf is that a problem in this game? Like even when I choose the lowest graphics settings, it still runs in what feels like less than 60 fps. It's especially noticeable when you enter a building, and suddenly the fps becomes normal and the game feels smooth. Guys, common, this isn't the type of game that should make me check the hardware requirements lets be real\n\nAnd another aspect is the gameplay loop. It decent, but not really that entertaining. Even after few hours it starts to feel grindy. The combat is ok, but that's it. Not really entertaining. The cult management is done on a basic level, where you can't even see essential stuff like, who is doing what - and that's important when you assign tasks. Overall, the game feels gimmicky more than anything else really. If it wasn't for performance, mby I would rate it a bit higher, but not significantly\n\nAlso, the price is a factor as well - I don't think it's justified. Dead Cells, Hollow Knight, Hades - they are more or less in the same price range and at least for me, they are levels beyond Cult of The Lamb if you are into action/combat. And Rimworld is just a bit more expensive, if you are looking for a colony sim",

It felt like I was missing something because of how short it was. The game tries to do a lot but doesn’t excel at anything. The civ management felt lackluster, and the roguelike combat was boring and not very intuitive. It was also surprisingly easy the only real challenge came from going for the no hit achievements. Even then, the process of reaching the boss was more annoying than engaging, since running through the regular encounters never held my interest.\nI don’t think it’s a bad game it looks good, it plays fine it just wasn’t for me, and it’s not something I’d recommend. There are other games that accomplish the same things but do them better. Honestly, the most fun I had was with the gambling mini game, Kruberknuckle, which is where I ended up spending most of my hours.\n(For context, I 100% completed the game and still felt like there was no real point.)",

      "review": "This game is almost entirely carried by it's aesthetic.\r\n\r\nIt is an isometric combat rogue-like mixed with a base builder, and it does all of those things at an alright level.\r\n\r\nThis game excels in nothing other than it's art direction, the combat gameplay is uninteresting. It's not very fun, challenging, or engaging in any way. I found most rooms you can just run through with ease leaving it feeling pretty bland (played on normal difficulty). However, the few times the game did present a challenge I found that the gameplay wasn't sufficient enough for it to feel anything other than unclear hitboxes. The game has a \"pop-up\" effect on all of it's characters, which often leads to combat in the game feeling very loose and makes it hard to discern where hitboxes are. For 90% of my playthrough this wasn't an issue because the gameplay is so bland and simple that it doesn't matter. But for the 10% of the game that was somewhat difficult, I often didn't feel \"challenged\" by the difficulty but more often just sitting there thinking \"Oh, I guess that hits me.\"\r\n\r\nAs for the base building, all the mechanics here are very boring and repetitive. The game does a good job forcing you to interact with each of it's aspects. The base building often forces you to interact with the rogue-like part of the game to get the resources you need. However, this just leads to the game feeling like a chore. As I stated earlier, the combat is very uninspired (Bad Hades if you will) and the base building feels even less so. I often felt like I would unlock things super fast, but never have the resources to keep up with how fast I'd unlock stuff. There was some level of automation in the game, but I felt like the cultists were always terrible at doing their jobs, specifically farming, leading to you needing to do it for them anyways. The day night cycle often left tasks incomplete making it so that progression took much longer than it had any need to, all the while feel like your progression lightning quick with unlocking stuff.\r\n\r\nUltimately, this game is very pretty and has a goofy aesthetic but it's hollow. There is no substance here beyond \"Hey imagine if you sacrificed your animal crossing villagers.\" Go buy Hades if you think the combat looks fun, go buy literally any other base builder if that's what you're looking for.",

I can appreciate the ambition, but I did not love the execution.\n\nOn the surface, it presents well, with a quirky, fun style and an S-tier soundtrack. It’s visually interesting and occasionally lands some funny moments with its follower systems. The gameplay loop can be engaging, but it’s painfully simplistic.\n\nAs the game reveals more of its design, it quickly loses steam. The combat consists mostly of attacks, dodges, and specials. During a run you can pick up a few passive effects and a relic with an active effect, but none of it synergizes in a meaningful way, and each run feels sort of samey. The dungeon runs are unimaginative, with little variation in builds, events, or enemies that leave an impression. The management side railroads you into necessary buildings and becomes a mandatory tedium and babysitting. I ended up not caring much about either, throwing in the towel after completing two of the four major dungeons.\n\nIf you’re there just for the vibes, don’t mind a simple gameplay loop, and find the management part engaging, Cult of the Lamb might be for you.

      "review": "In my opinion, Cult of the Lamb is not a very fun or well put-together game. There are two main sections of gameplay: the dungeon runs and building up your cult. While on first glance it would seem that building up your cult could help make dungeon runs easier, that isn’t really the case. Apart from doing daily sermons to improve your weapon level, there isn’t really a meaningful way for your followers or home base to help you out during the dungeon runs. There are so many ways of improving your base, but there isn’t really any incentive to do so. There is no end goal, no grand achievement to strive for, nothing. All you need is beds for everyone, an autofarm setup, and some lumberyards; anything else does very little to help you. I was into the base expansion at first, but once I realized that it couldn’t help me on runs or lead to an ultimate goal, I lost motivation to expand it further. As for the dungeon runs themselves, they felt way too easy for me. Each run, you get random tarot cards, weapons, relics, and curses, but despite all those things, due to how easy each run was you don’t really notice the slight ways they help. The main difference between runs was the weapons, which each have quite differing attack speeds, making you have to change your attack style. Most enemies could be beaten fairly easily by the simple strategy of rolling towards them, doing a couple os attacks, then rolling back before they can attack you. The combat never really felt all that exciting or fun. And as for the bosses, most were trivially easy to beat. You can just go up to them, spam the attack button, and roll away when they telegraph an attack. Heck, if you have enough health, you don’t even have to roll away. For example, for the third boss I initially tried a strategy of staying away and dodging his attacks, then going in for a few hits after one of his big attacks. I did not get far into the fight during this attempt, especially since he had one attack that I could not figure out the dodge timing for. During my next attempt, I had full health, so I just stood next to him, offloaded a strong curse on him, and spammed the attack button, killing him in 30 seconds and barely taking any damage. The final boss fight was even worse; you could easily just spam the attack button during it and kill him fairly quickly. During his second stage, it did require a bit of dodging since he wasn’t always available to attack, but those attacks were fairly easy to dodge. I also would’ve killed him on my first attempt, but when I beat his first phase, a cutscene started playing, but his fireball attack didn’t stop, which ended up killing me during the cutscene. Anyway, all this to say that the combat in Cult of the Lamb is very basic and very easy, making it quite boring. I wasn’t having a bad time while playing the game, but upon completing the game and reflecting on my experience, I don’t think I had a lot of fun either. Heck, I originally planned to at least get all the upgrades, but after defeating the final boss and seeing the end credits, I felt satisfied enough to stop playing. I don’t think Cult of the Lamb is terrible, but there are many better base-building games and roguelikes out there, so play those instead. Combining them is a neat concept, but it didn’t really execute on that concept very well. 6.5/10",
