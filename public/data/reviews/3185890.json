      "review": "As one of the best releases in the genre this year, I Can’t Beat the Pretty Girls (我打不过漂亮的她们) is ambitious because it is three stories in one, all focusing on the kickboxer, Shi Lei. It has strong narratives for 2/3 stories, good characters, and solid fundamentals. Some continuity issues and a lackluster third story keep it from excelling.\n\nThe three stories (redemption, revenge, retirement) are based on choices in the opening destiny chapter. In redemption, Shi Lei trains a female kickboxer while a psychologist helps him overcome demons. In revenge, you step back into the ring while two gym managers fight over becoming your representation. And the retirement story is more of a basic dating sim setup.\n\nEach story involves two primary love interests. This is grounded and offers great contrast as they can really push and pull off each other. In redemption, Zhu Yueran is a fighter while Wang Xinyuan is a healer, but both are caring. Revenge’s two managers include the ice-cold Su Xi and the down-to-earth Lu Youyou, but both have secrets. And in retirement, Zhao Xiaoqiao is immature while Wan Baoer is a man-eater, yet both have their eyes set on you.\n\nThe first two stories involve match-fixing and Shi Lei dealing with a past tragedy. The pace is slick and there are solid branching paths, although going down certain routes exposes continuity issues as it feels like important scenes are missing. Good endings require players to be aggressively one-sided, but most are worth it. The retirement story is weak compared to the other two. It seems patched together and one love interest, Xiaoqiao, is infuriatingly immature (22 going on 12). Fortunately, it is still worth playing because her counterpart is fantastic and there is crossover, as you see more of Su Xi, for example.\n\nSurprisingly, for a game about Kickboxing, there is not much actual fighting done by the player. It skips most matches to focus on character interactions. There are some minor QTEs, scene investigations, and a few conversations you have to ‘win’ but it is not much different from the genre standard in terms of mechanics.\n\nOne atypical and cool part is that all stories track two metrics. The first is favorability for each love interests, which is normal. The other is tailored per story e.g. gym alignment in revenge, or cure in redemption. The value mix of these opens or closes routes nicely. Also, good news, while there are some early endings, it generally rolls forward without interruption.\n\nAll three stories will take under 7 hours to clear and over 12 to 100%. Video quality is fine and audio is nearly all live recorded, which is awesome. English translation is good, but there are some broken subs ([url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/19Vk5761bAHW3bS02F7PNwRr_JIx-Q-tf/view?usp=sharing]fix here[/url]).

      "review": "I Can’t Beat Those Beautiful Women, developed and published by 想象颗粒 (Imagination Particles), is a distinctive full-motion video (FMV) interactive narrative game that blends romance, drama, mystery, and combat into a sprawling, branching story experience. At the center of this cinematic journey is Shi Lei, a former underground boxing champion whose life has fallen into disarray following a personal tragedy. The game picks up after the death of his girlfriend, a loss that sets in motion a chain of events dragging him back into a world filled with unresolved conflict, temptation, and haunting memories. The player’s decisions guide Shi Lei along three major narrative arcs—redemption, return to glory, or revenge—each of which unfolds in dramatically different ways, offering over 20 possible endings and substantial replay value.\n\nThe structure of the game leans heavily on its interactive film format, placing the player not in control of physical movement or combat mechanics, but rather at narrative crossroads where meaningful decisions shape the trajectory of the story. Over 600 minutes of live-action footage are woven into 19 chapters, each packed with emotionally charged scenes, tense dialogue, and moments that test the player’s moral compass. The experience relies on watching, interpreting, and choosing—engaging the player not through skill-based gameplay, but through immersive narrative depth and branching consequences. These decisions don’t merely change dialogue—they have ripple effects that can alter relationships, reveal or conceal truths, and ultimately determine who lives, who dies, and what Shi Lei becomes.\n\nVisually, the game stands out for its dedication to high-quality live-action cinematography. Scenes are shot using single-take techniques that lend an organic, almost theatrical quality to the performances. Every environment—from dimly lit back-alley boxing gyms to more intimate, emotionally charged settings—is carefully composed to pull the viewer deeper into the story. The acting, a critical pillar for any FMV experience, is generally solid, with several performances managing to evoke authentic emotion. Characters feel grounded, complex, and often morally ambiguous, which complements the game's themes of obsession, regret, and emotional entanglement.\n\nA notable strength of the game is its use of non-linear storytelling. The inclusion of a “truth map” encourages players to replay scenarios, make different choices, and dig deeper into the hidden layers of the story. This mechanic makes the game more than a one-time watch-through; it’s designed for exploration, with secrets and alternate perspectives waiting to be unlocked. Romance plays a significant role in many routes, and while this might seem superficial at first glance, the relationships are often tied directly into the game’s darker psychological themes. In many storylines, the “beautiful women” that Shi Lei cannot beat are not only romantic interests but also representations of unresolved guilt, temptation, and the consequences of past decisions.\n\nHowever, the game does come with some caveats. The reliance on visual storytelling means that players who prefer more traditional gameplay mechanics may find the experience passive. While choice is central to the experience, those who dislike long narrative segments or limited interactivity might feel detached. Some puzzles and gameplay elements exist, but they are light and infrequent. There are also moments where the dialogue can veer into melodrama, and the pacing occasionally falters during slower narrative stretches. Moreover, accessibility could be a concern; the game leans heavily on visual cues and reading comprehension, which could be challenging for players unfamiliar with Chinese (though there are English subtitles and interface translations available).\n\nIn terms of maturity, the game does not shy away from serious and at times graphic themes. Violence, language, romantic tension, references to drug use, and themes of death and trauma are all present. While these elements are not gratuitous, they do establish a more adult tone that might not be suitable for all audiences. There’s also a modest amount of AI-assisted content creation (for UI backgrounds), which is transparently disclosed by the developer.\n\nI Can’t Beat Those Beautiful Women is not just a romantic mystery or a boxing redemption story—it’s a psychological journey through grief, identity, and the complexity of human relationships. It requires players to think critically, empathize with flawed characters, and embrace the idea that there are no perfect choices—only consequences. With its bold storytelling approach, striking visual presentation, and layered branching structure, it represents a compelling evolution of the FMV genre. It may not appeal to those seeking action-heavy gameplay, but for fans of narrative-driven experiences and emotional storytelling, it offers a uniquely cinematic and immersive ride.\n\nRating: 9/10",

      "review": "I Can’t Beat Those Beautiful Women, developed and published by 想象颗粒 (Imagination Particles), is a distinctive full-motion video (FMV) interactive narrative game that blends romance, drama, mystery, and combat into a sprawling, branching story experience. At the center of this cinematic journey is Shi Lei, a former underground boxing champion whose life has fallen into disarray following a personal tragedy. The game picks up after the death of his girlfriend, a loss that sets in motion a chain of events dragging him back into a world filled with unresolved conflict, temptation, and haunting memories. The player’s decisions guide Shi Lei along three major narrative arcs—redemption, return to glory, or revenge—each of which unfolds in dramatically different ways, offering over 20 possible endings and substantial replay value.\n\nThe structure of the game leans heavily on its interactive film format, placing the player not in control of physical movement or combat mechanics, but rather at narrative crossroads where meaningful decisions shape the trajectory of the story. Over 600 minutes of live-action footage are woven into 19 chapters, each packed with emotionally charged scenes, tense dialogue, and moments that test the player’s moral compass. The experience relies on watching, interpreting, and choosing—engaging the player not through skill-based gameplay, but through immersive narrative depth and branching consequences. These decisions don’t merely change dialogue—they have ripple effects that can alter relationships, reveal or conceal truths, and ultimately determine who lives, who dies, and what Shi Lei becomes.\n\nVisually, the game stands out for its dedication to high-quality live-action cinematography. Scenes are shot using single-take techniques that lend an organic, almost theatrical quality to the performances. Every environment—from dimly lit back-alley boxing gyms to more intimate, emotionally charged settings—is carefully composed to pull the viewer deeper into the story. The acting, a critical pillar for any FMV experience, is generally solid, with several performances managing to evoke authentic emotion. Characters feel grounded, complex, and often morally ambiguous, which complements the game's themes of obsession, regret, and emotional entanglement.\n\nA notable strength of the game is its use of non-linear storytelling. The inclusion of a “truth map” encourages players to replay scenarios, make different choices, and dig deeper into the hidden layers of the story. This mechanic makes the game more than a one-time watch-through; it’s designed for exploration, with secrets and alternate perspectives waiting to be unlocked. Romance plays a significant role in many routes, and while this might seem superficial at first glance, the relationships are often tied directly into the game’s darker psychological themes. In many storylines, the “beautiful women” that Shi Lei cannot beat are not only romantic interests but also representations of unresolved guilt, temptation, and the consequences of past decisions.\n\nHowever, the game does come with some caveats. The reliance on visual storytelling means that players who prefer more traditional gameplay mechanics may find the experience passive. While choice is central to the experience, those who dislike long narrative segments or limited interactivity might feel detached. Some puzzles and gameplay elements exist, but they are light and infrequent. There are also moments where the dialogue can veer into melodrama, and the pacing occasionally falters during slower narrative stretches. Moreover, accessibility could be a concern; the game leans heavily on visual cues and reading comprehension, which could be challenging for players unfamiliar with Chinese (though there are English subtitles and interface translations available).\n\nIn terms of maturity, the game does not shy away from serious and at times graphic themes. Violence, language, romantic tension, references to drug use, and themes of death and trauma are all present. While these elements are not gratuitous, they do establish a more adult tone that might not be suitable for all audiences. There’s also a modest amount of AI-assisted content creation (for UI backgrounds), which is transparently disclosed by the developer.\n\nI Can’t Beat Those Beautiful Women is not just a romantic mystery or a boxing redemption story—it’s a psychological journey through grief, identity, and the complexity of human relationships. It requires players to think critically, empathize with flawed characters, and embrace the idea that there are no perfect choices—only consequences. With its bold storytelling approach, striking visual presentation, and layered branching structure, it represents a compelling evolution of the FMV genre. It may not appeal to those seeking action-heavy gameplay, but for fans of narrative-driven experiences and emotional storytelling, it offers a uniquely cinematic and immersive ride.\n\nRating: 9/10",

      "review": "As one of the best releases in the genre this year, I Can’t Beat the Pretty Girls (我打不过漂亮的她们) is ambitious because it is three stories in one, all focusing on the kickboxer, Shi Lei. It has strong narratives for 2/3 stories, good characters, and solid fundamentals. Some continuity issues and a lackluster third story keep it from excelling.\n\nThe three stories (redemption, revenge, retirement) are based on choices in the opening destiny chapter. In redemption, Shi Lei trains a female kickboxer while a psychologist helps him overcome demons. In revenge, you step back into the ring while two gym managers fight over becoming your representation. And the retirement story is more of a basic dating sim setup.\n\nEach story involves two primary love interests. This is grounded and offers great contrast as they can really push and pull off each other. In redemption, Zhu Yueran is a fighter while Wang Xinyuan is a healer, but both are caring. Revenge’s two managers include the ice-cold Su Xi and the down-to-earth Lu Youyou, but both have secrets. And in retirement, Zhao Xiaoqiao is immature while Wan Baoer is a man-eater, yet both have their eyes set on you.\n\nThe first two stories involve match-fixing and Shi Lei dealing with a past tragedy. The pace is slick and there are solid branching paths, although going down certain routes exposes continuity issues as it feels like important scenes are missing. Good endings require players to be aggressively one-sided, but most are worth it. The retirement story is weak compared to the other two. It seems patched together and one love interest, Xiaoqiao, is infuriatingly immature (22 going on 12). Fortunately, it is still worth playing because her counterpart is fantastic and there is crossover, as you see more of Su Xi, for example.\n\nSurprisingly, for a game about Kickboxing, there is not much actual fighting done by the player. It skips most matches to focus on character interactions. There are some minor QTEs, scene investigations, and a few conversations you have to ‘win’ but it is not much different from the genre standard in terms of mechanics.\n\nOne atypical and cool part is that all stories track two metrics. The first is favorability for each love interests, which is normal. The other is tailored per story e.g. gym alignment in revenge, or cure in redemption. The value mix of these opens or closes routes nicely. Also, good news, while there are some early endings, it generally rolls forward without interruption.\n\nAll three stories will take under 7 hours to clear and over 12 to 100%. Video quality is fine and audio is nearly all live recorded, which is awesome. English translation is good, but there are some broken subs ([url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/19Vk5761bAHW3bS02F7PNwRr_JIx-Q-tf/view?usp=sharing]fix here[/url]). Despite a few missteps, particularly in story #3, the game lands most of its punches.",

      "review": "我打不过漂亮的她们 is one of the most impressive FMV titles of the year — lengthy, polished, and full of substance. The game features three independent storylines (redemption, revenge, and retirement), each with two distinct heroines, creating six intertwining relationships that add great emotional depth. The performances are convincing, and the actresses — especially Su Xi and Wan Bao’er — bring both beauty and complexity to their roles.\n\nThe branching narrative is the game’s strongest point. Choices truly matter, leading to different outcomes and emotional turns. Although the story revolves around kickboxing, most of the experience focuses on psychology, relationships, and moral struggle, feeling more like a dramatic film than a sports story. While the retirement route is slightly weaker and a few transitions feel abrupt, the overall storytelling remains tight and engaging, keeping players invested for more than ten hours.\n\nTechnically, 我打不过漂亮的她们 excels with cinematic visuals, strong sound design, and clear interface systems. The QTEs are minimal but well-timed, and the affection mechanics are thoughtfully implemented. It’s proof that Chinese FMV productions have reached a new level — not just about pretty faces, but about layered, emotional storytelling worth exploring.\n[quote]《我打不过漂亮的她们》可以说是今年最出色的真人互动影游之一——体量巨大，制作精良，内容饱满。游戏包含三条独立主线（救赎、复仇、归隐），每条线都有两位女主角，共六段情感纠葛，人物塑造鲜明且彼此呼应。演员表现自然，尤其是苏茜与万宝儿，既有颜值又有故事，让人印象深刻。\n\n本作的最大亮点在于多分支剧情。玩家的每个选择都能带来不同的发展与结局。虽然主题是拳击，但游戏的核心更在于心理与情感的碰撞，更像一部都市悬疑剧而非体育片。归隐线略显薄弱，部分衔接稍显生硬，但整体叙事依旧流畅扎实，十多个小时的内容完全不会乏味。\n\n在制作层面，《我打不过漂亮的她们》展现出极高的完成度：画面电影化，配乐与音效优质，UI清晰，QTE与好感度系统设计合理。它证明了国产FMV的进步——不只是“看美女”，更是在讲述复杂而动人的人性故事，值得细细品味。[/quote]\nCheck out more FMV games at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45578719]FMV Asia | 真人互动影像游戏社[/url]",

This arc reminds us that vengeance may restore pride, but it rarely restores peace.  \n[*][i]The Legend’s Exit[/i] – Letting go is harder than holding on. It faces the fading echo of his own myth, showing that legacy isn’t built on victories alone—but on how you choose to leave the ring, and who you become when the crowd stops cheering.  \n[/olist]\n\n[b]So[/b]: *我打不过漂亮的她们 / I Can’t Beat the Beautiful Ones* is a boxing FMV drenched in emotional weight and neon melancholy. With three branching arcs and a protagonist haunted by his own legend, it’s a quiet, bruised journey through memory, ambition, and identity. Recommended for players who value story over mechanics, and endings that echo long after the final bell.",

      "review": "As one of the best releases in the genre this year, I Can’t Beat the Pretty Girls (我打不过漂亮的她们) is ambitious because it is three stories in one, all focusing on the kickboxer, Shi Lei. It has strong narratives for 2/3 stories, good characters, and solid fundamentals. Some continuity issues and a lackluster third story keep it from excelling.\n\nThe three stories (redemption, revenge, retirement) are based on choices in the opening destiny chapter. In redemption, Shi Lei trains a female kickboxer while a psychologist helps him overcome demons. In revenge, you step back into the ring while two gym managers fight over becoming your representation. And the retirement story is more of a basic dating sim setup.\n\nEach story involves two primary love interests. This is grounded and offers great contrast as they can really push and pull off each other. In redemption, Zhu Yueran is a fighter while Wang Xinyuan is a healer, but both are caring. Revenge’s two managers include the ice-cold Su Xi and the down-to-earth Lu Youyou, but both have secrets. And in retirement, Zhao Xiaoqiao is immature while Wan Baoer is a man-eater, yet both have their eyes set on you.\n\nThe first two stories involve match-fixing and Shi Lei dealing with a past tragedy. The pace is slick and there are solid branching paths, although going down certain routes exposes continuity issues as it feels like important scenes are missing. Good endings require players to be aggressively one-sided, but most are worth it. The retirement story is weak compared to the other two. It seems patched together and one love interest, Xiaoqiao, is infuriatingly immature (22 going on 12). Fortunately, it is still worth playing because her counterpart is fantastic and there is crossover, as you see more of Su Xi, for example.\n\nSurprisingly, for a game about Kickboxing, there is not much actual fighting done by the player. It skips most matches to focus on character interactions. There are some minor QTEs, scene investigations, and a few conversations you have to ‘win’ but it is not much different from the genre standard in terms of mechanics.\n\nOne atypical and cool part is that all stories track two metrics. The first is favorability for each love interests, which is normal. The other is tailored per story e.g. gym alignment in revenge, or cure in redemption. The value mix of these opens or closes routes nicely. Also, good news, while there are some early endings, it generally rolls forward without interruption.\n\nAll three stories will take under 7 hours to clear and over 12 to 100%. Video quality is fine and audio is nearly all live recorded, which is awesome. English translation is good, but there are some broken subs ([url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/19Vk5761bAHW3bS02F7PNwRr_JIx-Q-tf/view?usp=sharing]fix here[/url]). Despite a few missteps, particularly in story #3, the game lands most of its punches.",

      "review": "我打不过漂亮的她们 is one of the most impressive FMV titles of the year — lengthy, polished, and full of substance. The game features three independent storylines (redemption, revenge, and retirement), each with two distinct heroines, creating six intertwining relationships that add great emotional depth. The performances are convincing, and the actresses — especially Su Xi and Wan Bao’er — bring both beauty and complexity to their roles.\n\nThe branching narrative is the game’s strongest point. Choices truly matter, leading to different outcomes and emotional turns. Although the story revolves around kickboxing, most of the experience focuses on psychology, relationships, and moral struggle, feeling more like a dramatic film than a sports story. While the retirement route is slightly weaker and a few transitions feel abrupt, the overall storytelling remains tight and engaging, keeping players invested for more than ten hours.\n\nTechnically, 我打不过漂亮的她们 excels with cinematic visuals, strong sound design, and clear interface systems. The QTEs are minimal but well-timed, and the affection mechanics are thoughtfully implemented. It’s proof that Chinese FMV productions have reached a new level — not just about pretty faces, but about layered, emotional storytelling worth exploring.\n[quote]《我打不过漂亮的她们》可以说是今年最出色的真人互动影游之一——体量巨大，制作精良，内容饱满。游戏包含三条独立主线（救赎、复仇、归隐），每条线都有两位女主角，共六段情感纠葛，人物塑造鲜明且彼此呼应。演员表现自然，尤其是苏茜与万宝儿，既有颜值又有故事，让人印象深刻。\n\n本作的最大亮点在于多分支剧情。玩家的每个选择都能带来不同的发展与结局。虽然主题是拳击，但游戏的核心更在于心理与情感的碰撞，更像一部都市悬疑剧而非体育片。归隐线略显薄弱，部分衔接稍显生硬，但整体叙事依旧流畅扎实，十多个小时的内容完全不会乏味。\n\n在制作层面，《我打不过漂亮的她们》展现出极高的完成度：画面电影化，配乐与音效优质，UI清晰，QTE与好感度系统设计合理。它证明了国产FMV的进步——不只是“看美女”，更是在讲述复杂而动人的人性故事，值得细细品味。[/quote]\nCheck out more FMV games at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45578719]FMV Asia | 真人互动影像游戏社[/url]",

Every choice feels meaningful, steering the story toward drastically different outcomes and emotional tones. Despite its boxing backdrop, the heart of the game lies in its human drama, moral conflict, broken dreams, and the quiet pain of moving on.\n\nBy the end, it’s less about winning or losing and more about understanding what truly matters.

I play the one where the MC mentors a young female boxer in fighting for a boxing championship. Definitely very satisfying to help your protégé and even pursue her romantically if you want to. \n\nWithout giving away too much spoilers I must say this is a top tier story driven fmv well worth the money and time.",

      "review": "I Can’t Beat Those Beautiful Women, developed and published by 想象颗粒 (Imagination Particles), is a distinctive full-motion video (FMV) interactive narrative game that blends romance, drama, mystery, and combat into a sprawling, branching story experience. At the center of this cinematic journey is Shi Lei, a former underground boxing champion whose life has fallen into disarray following a personal tragedy. The game picks up after the death of his girlfriend, a loss that sets in motion a chain of events dragging him back into a world filled with unresolved conflict, temptation, and haunting memories. The player’s decisions guide Shi Lei along three major narrative arcs—redemption, return to glory, or revenge—each of which unfolds in dramatically different ways, offering over 20 possible endings and substantial replay value.\n\nThe structure of the game leans heavily on its interactive film format, placing the player not in control of physical movement or combat mechanics, but rather at narrative crossroads where meaningful decisions shape the trajectory of the story. Over 600 minutes of live-action footage are woven into 19 chapters, each packed with emotionally charged scenes, tense dialogue, and moments that test the player’s moral compass. The experience relies on watching, interpreting, and choosing—engaging the player not through skill-based gameplay, but through immersive narrative depth and branching consequences. These decisions don’t merely change dialogue—they have ripple effects that can alter relationships, reveal or conceal truths, and ultimately determine who lives, who dies, and what Shi Lei becomes.\n\nVisually, the game stands out for its dedication to high-quality live-action cinematography. Scenes are shot using single-take techniques that lend an organic, almost theatrical quality to the performances. Every environment—from dimly lit back-alley boxing gyms to more intimate, emotionally charged settings—is carefully composed to pull the viewer deeper into the story. The acting, a critical pillar for any FMV experience, is generally solid, with several performances managing to evoke authentic emotion. Characters feel grounded, complex, and often morally ambiguous, which complements the game's themes of obsession, regret, and emotional entanglement.\n\nA notable strength of the game is its use of non-linear storytelling. The inclusion of a “truth map” encourages players to replay scenarios, make different choices, and dig deeper into the hidden layers of the story. This mechanic makes the game more than a one-time watch-through; it’s designed for exploration, with secrets and alternate perspectives waiting to be unlocked. Romance plays a significant role in many routes, and while this might seem superficial at first glance, the relationships are often tied directly into the game’s darker psychological themes. In many storylines, the “beautiful women” that Shi Lei cannot beat are not only romantic interests but also representations of unresolved guilt, temptation, and the consequences of past decisions.\n\nHowever, the game does come with some caveats. The reliance on visual storytelling means that players who prefer more traditional gameplay mechanics may find the experience passive. While choice is central to the experience, those who dislike long narrative segments or limited interactivity might feel detached. Some puzzles and gameplay elements exist, but they are light and infrequent. There are also moments where the dialogue can veer into melodrama, and the pacing occasionally falters during slower narrative stretches. Moreover, accessibility could be a concern; the game leans heavily on visual cues and reading comprehension, which could be challenging for players unfamiliar with Chinese (though there are English subtitles and interface translations available).\n\nIn terms of maturity, the game does not shy away from serious and at times graphic themes. Violence, language, romantic tension, references to drug use, and themes of death and trauma are all present. While these elements are not gratuitous, they do establish a more adult tone that might not be suitable for all audiences. There’s also a modest amount of AI-assisted content creation (for UI backgrounds), which is transparently disclosed by the developer.\n\nI Can’t Beat Those Beautiful Women is not just a romantic mystery or a boxing redemption story—it’s a psychological journey through grief, identity, and the complexity of human relationships. It requires players to think critically, empathize with flawed characters, and embrace the idea that there are no perfect choices—only consequences. With its bold storytelling approach, striking visual presentation, and layered branching structure, it represents a compelling evolution of the FMV genre. It may not appeal to those seeking action-heavy gameplay, but for fans of narrative-driven experiences and emotional storytelling, it offers a uniquely cinematic and immersive ride.\n\nRating: 9/10",
