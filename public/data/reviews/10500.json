      "review": "This review is written with Total War players in mind. As such, it will not adress basic gameplay that is inherent in all Total War games, such as turn based production and real time battling, but rather will compare Empire: Total War with other Total War titles.\n\nAs a Total War fan, my personal preference goes to this title, Empire. I like most Total War games, but Empire stands out to me. For one, I enjoy the historic time period. For two, it plays the most 'different' from the other titles.\n\nOlder titles, such as the first Rome: Total War game and Medieval II, heavily favour an agressive play style, with a lot of chaotic melees. Later games, such as Rome II and Shogun II, lean more towards a balanced stance between agression and response, depending on how superior your battlefield position and force is.\n\nEmpire: Total War, in contrast, is a game of patience. Instead of charging into melee, the gameplay entails meticulously positioning lines of infantry and laying down volleys of fire. Mirorring the idea of the age, it is the 'gentleman's edition' of Total War. The Fall of the Samurai expansion to Shogun II comes closest to the Empire style of play, with rifle armed infantry and gatling guns, and keeps the option to go into melee samurai charge mode, but Empire remain the only edition (excluding Napoleon: Total War) to favour a line to line exchange of fire.\n\nAnother difference is the naval battles. Granted, later editions in the Total War series incorporate these as well, but Romans or Edo era Japanese boats firing on one another with arrows pale next to the awesome power of a multiple deck ships of the line wailing away at one another. Again, Fall of Samurai introduces ironclad ships that approach this somewhat.\n\nOf course, later titles have more recent, better developed versions of some of the aspects of Empire, and there are some other downsides to Empire. As usual with a Total War title, Creative Assembly has a tendency to leaving things not as smooth as they could have been. Most bugs have been smoothed out after release, as they usually are, but some small problems remain here and there (such as batteries of cannon simply not firing unless directed to do so in a very specific way).\n\nAdditionally, while the battles themselves offer some of the most unique Total War battle experiences, the map campaign improves little on previous editions. Not that this is necessary, because the region based resources and capture cities work well for the entire series. However, there is one significant improvement to me here, and that is that the map spans the most territory of any Total War game. Where Rome II limits itself to Europe and North Africa, and Shogun II is set in Japan, Empire scopes the entire Western dominated world of the Elizabethan age: Europe, North America, Africa and the Indies. The later release Napoleon: Total War does not nearly reach the score Empire does, and its campaigns are focused on smaller scale conquest rather than the world theatre of Empire.\n\nAs for the research system, it seems that the Empire title marks the start of an overhaul, where the series starts mimicing the more traditional 'tech tree' idea that prevails in many strategy games. This is not a bad thing, but it is an addition that was perhaps not entirely necessary. All the more so because sometimes it seems like a shoehorn to introduce the game's traditional late game obstacle. Every Total War game has some sort of hindering mechanic that makes the game prgressively more difficult as time advances. In Empire, research (which you need to keep up with your modernizing rivals) introduces squalor, which makes for an unhappy populace, which makes you either have to sink money into keeping them happy or have to deal with rebellions.\n\nIf you prefer a more agressive slugfest in a game, I would suggest Rome II, Shogun II, or if you don't mind some more antiquated aestethics and graphics, Medieval II.\nIf you like your games new and crisp, the more recent titles are sure to be your thing as well. If you want a more modern game that still uses line infantry and gun batteries, Shogun II's Fall of the Samurai expansion is your ticket.\n\nBut if you want a true, professional standing army of line infantry that knows how to hold under fire as well as deliver it, if you want to be a gentleman general of standing, if you want an 18th century battlefield, then this, my friend, this is the game for you.",

      "review": "Empire Total War. Game purchased on release over 15 years ago. \n\n*2010* Intel Dual Core processor 1 or 2 gb of ram, Hard disk. Took a while to load, naval battles unplayable.\ngoing from Medieval 2 to Empire. Empire was alot more hardware demanding of a game then. Visually fresh, awaited and satisfying graphical upgrade from earlier titles. Back then it was Pure Cinema loading into your first battles.\n\n2018 Base game got upgraded to definitive edition adding all dlc and expansions to base game owners for free.\n(same with medieval 2 and Napoleon)\n\n*2025* Game is good, still looks good. It is missing some in depth detail in a few areas, one of them being the family tree aspects you know from other TW games.\nThough still a decent campaign set in the 18th century. Somehow the missing in depth details that sometimes are missing from this game, leaves a lot more room for the imagination to take charge and somehow make this game an experience that goes above. The UI and Art style also adds to that. \n\nThe AI is not great, but it leaves something for the imagination.\n\n** EmpireTW requires time and patience, battles can be long. It has the same bugs, and they can be anoying and game breaking, but can be worked around with a bit of strategy. \n\nEncountered game breaking bugs:\n\n1. Siege battle \"lag\" \n-Cause: When enemy troops stand on a wall and those walls gets destroyed, the game's AI struggles to recalculate its pathfinding in real time when the physical geometry of the fort walls change. \n-Effect: The game's performance drops dramatically, resulting in severe stuttering, low frame rates and very wicked lag. in some cases down to 1 FPS, 1000+ MS Delay. \n-Fix: Do not destroy walls that have troops standing on them, Use Mortar/howitzer explsoive/carcass shells (search youtube/google)\n\n2. Technology is researched, but can't upgrade building.\n-Cause: No idea\n-Effect: GG\n-Fix: Load previous Save.  (Keep a minimum of 5 save files or more in rotation)\n\nRecommended price:\n-2€ Must Buy \n-5€  Hmm let me try\n-10€ hmmmm\n-15€ hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\n-25€ Full price, Nah",

A game completely abandoned, almost impossible to play in the late game and impossible to play multiplayer for more than 2-5 turns. Concept-wise this Total War game is the superior one, same thing can be said about the size of the playable world (however a serious chunk of the map is unusable and many parts of it serve only as resource exploitation areas). Campaign AI is quite stupid, there will be a bridge next to them leading to the enemy's capital but your armies won't take them for some reason and they will circumvent the ENTIRE CONTINENT just to siege the city no less than 5 turns later. You send your armies after rebels, they defeat them and for some reason walk over to exactly where the rebels were which then exhausts them to the point where they can't return to their city (which usually means you'll immediately face a second rebellion the next turn because there are no armies in the city to keep watch). Rakes are unbelievably useless, I feel like they have an assassination success rate of 1/10. What's funny is that when they fail their missions in YOUR territory, they are executed. Why? Am I not the king? I ordered the mission, who could dare to execute someone enacting my orders in my kingdom? Anyways, the idiocy doesn't end there to my torment; because diplomacy AI is also incredibly stupid. You will have fought an empire off 99% of its territories and become the biggest power of Europe or perhaps even the world, and that idiot will pester you with halfwitted offers like establishing a trade agreement in exchange with your most profitable regions, even though they have no rare resources and can barely defend their current territories from you. This doesn't end until you fully invade them and makes the game feel incredibly unimmersive unfortunately and you have to plan your diplomacy around invading whoever sends you stupid offers the most. There are some nations out there that would've been great to play that you can't play. Battle maps that you can choose are too little and soldiers in simulated battles get tired faster than a couch potato that takes a walk for the first time. I guess your generals also have to bring a couple couches with them to whatever conflict you're sending them to. This game had a fantastic potential, but it didn't receive half the attention that Warhammer did and so it died. People didn't abandon this game on a whim, they had to abandon it because it feels like a permanent cash grab the way the Sega never invested in it or worked to maintain it. I would recommend it, but you can't even do a world conquest in this game anyways because of how many times it crashes so my best advice is to watch gameplay videos of it instead.",

A game completely abandoned, almost impossible to play in the late game and impossible to play multiplayer for more than 2-5 turns. Concept-wise this Total War game is the superior one, same thing can be said about the size of the playable world (however a serious chunk of the map is unusable and many parts of it serve only as resource exploitation areas). Campaign AI is quite stupid, there will be a bridge next to them leading to the enemy's capital but your armies won't take them for some reason and they will circumvent the ENTIRE CONTINENT just to siege the city no less than 5 turns later. You send your armies after rebels, they defeat them and for some reason walk over to exactly where the rebels were which then exhausts them to the point where they can't return to their city (which usually means you'll immediately face a second rebellion the next turn because there are no armies in the city to keep watch). Rakes are unbelievably useless, I feel like they have an assassination success rate of 1/10. What's funny is that when they fail their missions in YOUR territory, they are executed. Why? Am I not the king? I ordered the mission, who could dare to execute someone enacting my orders in my kingdom? Anyways, the idiocy doesn't end there to my torment; because diplomacy AI is also incredibly stupid. You will have fought an empire off 99% of its territories and become the biggest power of Europe or perhaps even the world, and that idiot will pester you with halfwitted offers like establishing a trade agreement in exchange with your most profitable regions, even though they have no rare resources and can barely defend their current territories from you. This doesn't end until you fully invade them and makes the game feel incredibly unimmersive unfortunately and you have to plan your diplomacy around invading whoever sends you stupid offers the most. There are some nations out there that would've been great to play that you can't play. Battle maps that you can choose are too little and soldiers in simulated battles get tired faster than a couch potato that takes a walk for the first time. I guess your generals also have to bring a couple couches with them to whatever conflict you're sending them to. This game had a fantastic potential, but it didn't receive half the attention that Warhammer did and so it died. People didn't abandon this game on a whim, they had to abandon it because it feels like a permanent cash grab the way the Sega never invested in it or worked to maintain it. I would recommend it, but you can't even do a world conquest in this game anyways because of how many times it crashes so my best advice is to watch gameplay videos of it instead.",

If you are not a fan of line warfare, you may prefer other Total War games but if lining up and shooting at each other tickles your fancy, this is the game for you!\n\nI just will always play knowing that my campaigns may never reach total victory due to the aforementioned issue. I guess you could say the game breaks the 4th wall by killing off your save file after 70-80 (in-game) years since no king or queen has ever ruled longer than that!",

Came back after years to find this out...\n\nThe Creative Assembly chose to misdirect its users for reasons unknown.",
