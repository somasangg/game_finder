      "review": "Killing Floor 2 is a raucous good time and a damn good sequel to perhaps the greatest co-op survival FPS ever made. Just a year after Nazi Zombies rattled the gaming world in Call of Duty: World at War in 2008, the original Killing Floor was an easy to pick-up-and-play but hard-to-master zombie survival shooter that was well-balanced and riddled with replayability. Like any good sequel, Killing Floor 2 expands greatly upon the first game's mechanics and offers a dense content-rich experience, one that's enjoyable alone and even better enjoyed with friends. \n\nThe game looks absolutely stunning with its highly detailed and refined level of graphical fidelity while its performance remains smooth as butter, even when action is at its most frantic. You can quite literally decorate entire sprawling maps with blood and gibs and it'll never disappear or affect the game's framerate. It's nothing short of a true technical marvel.\n\nThough the game is packed with micro-transactions and cosmetic foolery like most modern games, it never interferes with how the game plays or becomes a nuisance. When all is said and done, Killing Floor 2 is an incredibly fun and rewarding experience with tons of replay value. A game that truly does look as good as it plays, Killing Floor 2 is, without a doubt, the Grand Puba of co-op survival shooters.\n---\nOverall: 9.5/10",

There are simply too many other great games I would rather spend my time with at the end of this 30 hour stint.\n\n\n1. A lot of variety: weapons, explosives, support powers/equipment, playstyles, enemies, level designs.\n2. Matches tend to be pretty challenging at mid-and-high tier difficulties. Enemies are aggressive and not easy to cheese from what I could tell. You have quite a bit to manage in the moment-to-moment gameplay and each round/match as a whole too: resources, positioning, (groups of) enemies and what should be prioritized.\n3. Good QoL features, low skill floor, teamwork is rewarded, many support classes. You can share resources with other members of your team. Matches \n4. Temporary upgrades during each mission feel pretty fair relative to the ramping difficulty as the rounds get closer to the boss, and so does the meta-progression.\n5. Music is solid, fits the action-horror themes/atmosphere, and fairly unique (a lot of heavy metal) in my experience with multi-player shooters.",

      "review": "In a vacuum, KF2 is a fantastic game. Some of the most fun gunplay in the FPS genre, excellent enemy variety, decent map design, sufficient Britishness. But as a sequel to KF1? I'm not so sure.\r\n\r\nFor one, it's significantly easier. Suicidal difficulty in this game feels like hard mode in KF1. The addition of Sprint and Bash are a pretty big contributor to this. If you were surrounded by a mob of zeds in the first game, you were dead to rights and rightfully punished for having bad positioning. Now, you can just run past the horde with no consequences. Running and gunning is pretty much the way to go now since hunkering down and welding doors got a massive nerf (doors don't repair themselves after a wave and require a Support Specialist to repair them again) which sucks because the feeling of holding the line and mowing down zeds in a corridor is magical.\r\n\r\nAnother factor is that every perk and weapon is homogenized. The upgrade system means that there's no need to buy high-tier weapons since you can just upgrade your starting weapons. I really don't see the point of this? At that point your choice of weapon is meaningless since anything can be powerful. As for the perks, it's a similar situation in that all perks can do anything well. In KF1, perks had specific niches. Sharpshooter took care of large zeds, Firebug eliminated trash zeds, Field Medic (obviously) kept the team healed, etc... Now Firebug has microwave guns to kill large zeds, nearly every perk has a healing weapon of their own now, and even Demo can take an ability that eliminates his bombs' weakness to Sirens. Now that everyone is special, no one is.\r\n\r\nThe final (and most damning imo) downgrade is the aesthetic. Gone are the gritty grindhouse horror vibes of the original, now replaced with squeaky-clean sci-fi and Team Fortress 2-levels of lacking a cohesive artstyle with all the ridiculous glowing cosmetics. The grungy Industrial and Heavy Metal soundtrack was replaced with... Christian Metal? WTF? The new trader is also annoying as hell, and so are a lot of the playable characters (seriously, they NEVER SHUT UP), but they grew on me eventually (NOT THE TRADER). You can't even [INSULT PLAYERS] with the dialogue wheel anymore. Literally unplayable\r\n\r\nOkay, I've complained a lot, but I really do enjoy this game. It's just a little disappointing that it doesn't quite live up to its predecessor, which is one of the best co-op shooters of all time. Still better than whatever the fuck KF3 is lmao",

      "review": "I've only had this game for a month and a half and I've played 177 hours, including solo and co-op, and I LOVE IT! It's a great successor to KF1.\n\nThere's only three things I don't like so much - or rather, two things that annoys me and one thing I don't like. It annoys me how trying to play solo restricts your playstyle and perk selection SO MUCH. (Perk doesn't have extra movement speed? Not usually a great one to use in high-difficulty solo play!)\n\nThe thing I really don't like is the $2.50 keys to open the loot crates. In 177 hours of play, I've earned 33 crates. That would cost $82.50 to open them all. If this were a free-to-play game, I wouldn't mind that. But it isn't. This game has been out for 9 years now and the keys are still $2.50. It already has a sequel out (which absolutely bombed, but my point still stands), make the crates free (or at least cheaper) to open, please? Also, you lose more points for having such a RIDICULOUS number of cosmetic items and a 'gear equip' menu with no sorting function.\n\nThe second thing that annoys me is that you can't just have someone host a LAN multiplayer game (or even directly host a game without running a server). And if you want to play a private game with a group of people, you'd better hope the official server it picks has a good ping (we tried multiple times and the automatically selected server had a really poor connection).\n\nTL;DR: Great game! No local hosting iffy. Attempted over-monetization bad. Excessive cosmetics bad. But not bad enough to stop me from leaving a 'recommend this game.'",

Everything designed to get money from you makes this game worse, as many others.\n\nThis thing wants 95gb of disk space, around 30gb of pure cosmetic bloat.\n\nYou are a cash cow to these companies and they have no respect for you.",

It is easier to play in 6 than in 2-3, because the difficulty and reduced damage are not balanced linearly. Also sometimes weapons disappear, and the melee ones are difficult to use.",

It was 90% off so whatever, but honestly KF1 with mods is more entertaining. Combat / movement here worse in comparison and.. it's 100 gigs!!!",
