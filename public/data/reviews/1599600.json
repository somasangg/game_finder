That is this game, but with the extra benefit of making everyone who plays it super mad at one another at every turn.  The chaos that erupts from this game's relentless requirement of perfect execution is nothing short of hilarious when you gather a group of 3-4 incompetent players with worse communication skills.

This doesn't have that by default although there's some extra shenanigans that can be had for some theme maps. HOWEVER! The recipes are great and very akin to real life ones and while everything before overtime is easy for me now, it's still fun as hell! The mechanics are great and it's fun both for solo and multiplayer play!",

Rinse and repeat.\r\nBut the DEPTH and BALANCE of the game is astounding.\r\n\r\n Each recipe has its own quirks and difficulties that make them feel distinctly different - not only will a fish restaurant operate differently from a cake restaurant, but one pie restaurant may feel different from another pie restaurant just due to the RNG of options you get as your restaurant progresses through the days, leading to a unique experience every time. \r\n\r\nI play this with friends as a 4 player game, and appreciate how different the game feels in each role - if you spend all your time in the kitchen, you are playing a fundamentally different game than the person running orders to customers, or the person managing dirty plates, or the person managing any other number of tasks. All the roles are engaging, and we've all found enjoyment in different aspects of the game. \r\n\r\nIt's also just satisfying. Every time you manage to optimize the workflow just a bit more, it feels rewarding, making you feel more empowered to tackle the next big problem area. \r\nThere's also tons of content - we still haven't unlocked everything!\r\nTLDR: good game, I like",

Good luck if you choose pasta without the mod that lets you dump the water in the sink.\n\nI've had a lot of fun with friends and family, as well - more than two can get a little overwhelming, for me at least.\n\nSteam workshop mods are a great addition.\n\nIt's also very easy to run.

      "review": "Disclaimer: I've played a bit of coop, but this review is mainly about the single player experience.\n\nThis game looks a lot like Overcooked. \n\nI think that’s unfortunate, because at its heart, this is a very different game for a very different audience. PlateUp! Is a roguelike where you build up a restaurant, using increasingly more automation to serve more guest and/or more complicated recipes, basically creating a ‘human in the loop’ machine. That's why it almost feels a bit like the early game of factorio to me, which is obviously VERY different from Overcooked.\n\nWhat gives this game such replay-ability is what is arguably the most important thing for every roguelike: A catching gameplay loop where you constantly have to decide how to use your limited/given resources. To everyone regularly playing roguelikes, I don’t have to tell you how satisfying it is to create a build that works, how great it feels to role just the thing you needed. Or arguably even better, to not get the thing you needed and still make it work somehow.\n\nUse your belts to fully automate your burger production but do the serving and dishwashing fully by hand? Or use a few of your machines to optimize your dishwashing process, resulting in having to cut tomatoes by hand every now and then? Take on another recipe or more guests? Which would be more time efficient and, maybe more importantly, which can your brain handle better without f*ing up everything?",

With solo feeling like it's more about how to min-max your movement as much as possible, where as with others is more about co-operation. So if you're worried about not being able to play this because you lack people to play with, I'd still say it's worth a try if it looks interesting to you.\n\nI honestly prefer this over games like Overcooked. Sure, the graphics are a bit more basic than that game, and they share a lot of the same DNA, I enjoy how this one is a lot more focused on solely the moment to moment game play, and an emphasis on building up your restaurant, rather than jumping from level to level with various gimmicks. You really could use an extra oven, but you'll need to rearrange your kitchen to fit it. Or having to take on extra stuff your customers can order, to avoid getting overloaded with a that rush at closing time you had to take earlier in the run. It can get pretty chaotic.\n\nAnd really, any game that has a 3 player option is always a nice bonus (I have two brothers and have trouble finding games that aren't fixed at 2 or 4 player.",
