It hands you a power washer, points you toward something absolutely filthy, and lets you scrub your worries into oblivion. Every job feels like a little adventure—whether you’re cleaning a goofy playground, a muddy monster truck, or an entire haunted house that definitely has vibes. Especially with the DLC's! ♡ ໒꒱\r\n\r\nIf you love cozy, satisfying games that let you switch off your brain while still feeling weirdly accomplished, PowerWash 1 is a sparkling gem. It didn’t just clean surfaces, it cleaned my soul and mind. 🧽✨",

Planning to finish this one out first.\n\nI loved all the customization options for your outfit, and it was really fun seeing the details they put into each game location. I've already heard many of these locations get little nods in the new game and I'm looking forward to that~\n\nNotes for anyone who hasn't played and is new to the game, if you click your other mouse button, it turns the water on without you having to hold a button down, super handy! If you skip reading the controls like I did, it's a good thing to know xD\n\nAnyway, go out, PowerWash your way to serenity, or drive yourself up the wall trying to get to the top of things without using the ladders or stool just for kicks. Either way.\n\ngreat to play with friends, go ahead and use a powerful spray to slowly push them off something if they go afk for a moment, I promise I wont tell on you~",

However, there are a few quirks that make it anything but.\r\n\r\nThe game starts out simple enough and the satisfaction is there. As the game progresses it becomes increasingly more challenging and less satisfying than when you first started your journey. I was hoping for more of a sim style game where you grow a business, but all you do is clean more absurd objects as the story unfolds.\r\n\r\nBecause there is no depth to the game and all you do is clean ad nauseam I would have expected the cleaning experience to be more polished or thought out. It ends up just being a fight with the developers who put you in precarious positions almost mocking you \"Let's see if they can find this spot to clean!\"\r\n\r\nDo not let the hype of positive reviews or the appeal of the game play videos entice you if you just want a relaxing power wash sim. It was not relaxing and far from satisfying. I only played to the end out of spite for spending money on this game. \r\n\r\n-  Soap is a niche tool that can often make cleaning an area more challenging rather than easier. (Note: this is a LIMITED resource, you can buy out the shop to zero with intermittent restocks. Are you kidding me!)\r\n\r\n-Surface area calculations are inconsistent leaving you hunting for odd spots and areas to clean to obtain 100% clean\r\n\r\n-Objects are placed in weird spots making the act of cleaning frustrating instead of fun\r\n\r\n-No depth to career mode. Just keep cleaning and then it ends. Would have liked to see building a business game play here.\r\n\r\n-Equipment is one dimensional. Just 4 cleaning gun types (with progressively better stats) and same attachments that you have to keep re-purchasing over and over again for all the cleaning guns.",

      "review": "[h1]The real life version is more fun than this game and that's sad[/h1]\n\nSeeing some simulator games like PowerWash Simulator, you're intrigued. The real world version of this isn't very fun, how did they manage to make it fun in the game? While many simulator games excel at this, turning everyday chores into fun games, [b]PowerWash fails at it.[/b]\n\n[b]Throughout the entire time I played this, not one drop of Dopamine was secreted by my brain.[/b]\n\n\nYou just point at acres of stains and swirl your mouse left and right to clean it up. That's it. Your powewash has different nozzles that changes how wide water is sprayed. 0 degree nozzle for a line that is powerful, up to 40 degree nozzle which sprays a bigger surface area but is the weakest. All of this means that you have to change nozzle every now and then to get rid of tough stains or focus more on light but big grimes. In game, all of this can be summed up with one word: [b]Boring.[/b]\n\n\nYou have the option to use a soap dispenser which can clean easier and a bigger area, but it's just an option you can spend money on and not really get your money's worth. It's not like some stains [b]require[/b] soap or other liquids. No, they're all washed the same way. You can just decide to waste money on soap to [b]TRY [/b]and get some variation into gameplay, but seeing as how they run out in 10 seconds, it offers nothing.\n\n\nCompared to some simulator games like [b]Viscera Cleanup Detail[/b] (a successful cleanup game) there are no gimmicks or management.[list]\n[*] In Viscera you had to fill, empty and move around buckets of water which you would use to cleanup your mop. Knocking them over would cause a spill, messing up your work. Stepping in said mess (or any other puddle) would cause you to leave footprints. So it would create a minigame where you would try to efficiently manage your buckets.\n[*]  You had body parts with physics to collect into a crate and incinerate. Said body parts could wiggle and slap at walls during movement, covering them in blood. More management minigame.\n[*]  When removing bullet holes from surfaces you'd use the Laser Welder which could overheat and start fire, implementing another mini-game into the gameplay.\n[/list]\n\nPowerWash Simulator has [b]NOTHING[/b]! No water limit or management, no hose management, there is literally nothing to do in this game but look at walls and spray like a robot. Because Viscera had so many minigames to manage, it wouldn't cover the entire map in stains to clean. It would try keep it moderated, but because PowerWash has [b]NOTHING[/b], all it can do is cover [u][b]every single bit of surface[/b][/u] in dirt and grime in an attempt to make its level's fun, which it fails at miserably because it does the actual opposite.\n\n \nEven the locations themselves are boring. Viscera had sci-fi space stations with puzzles to solve and even areas based on pop culture, like The Thing movie. PowerWash has you cleaning boring, everyday objects that you could see just by sticking your head out your room's window.\n\n\nHow do you know how much progress you've made in the map? On the top left corner there is a percentage of how much is left. You can spend 40 minutes getting to 98% and then spend a whole 10 minutes for that last 2%. Why? Because [b]the game has no proper way of guiding you to the last bits[/b]. When you're cleaning a whole garden that has more nook and cranny than a ant's nest, [b]at the last 2% you're scouring the entire map[/b], looking under every rock to find a coin-sized stain to remove.\nThe game [b]TRIES[/b] to make it easy by telling you what the last 3 uncleaned items are, but it's a joke. Before the 3 items, you're on your own and when you get to the 3 items, it tells you 1 fence post is uncleaned, while the map contains 8. Yes, I had to inspect all 8, not find the stain and ultimately hose down all 8 again to get a hidden stain removed. F*ck me!\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI've washed a whole balcony with a power wash in real life and despite the machine requiring rest every now and then and my hands getting numb, [b]it was still more fun than this piece of crap[/b].\nThere is not a single saving grace in this game and [b]I would not recommend it, ever, even if it was free.[/b]\n\nDo NOT waste your time on this trash.",

      "review": "[h1]The real life version is more fun than this game and that's sad[/h1]\n\nSeeing some simulator games like PowerWash Simulator, you're intrigued. The real world version of this isn't very fun, how did they manage to make it fun in the game? While many simulator games excel at this, turning everyday chores into fun games, [b]PowerWash fails at it.[/b]\n\n[b]Throughout the entire time I played this, not one drop of Dopamine was secreted by my brain.[/b]\n\n\nYou just point at acres of stains and swirl your mouse left and right to clean it up. That's it. Your powewash has different nozzles that changes how wide water is sprayed. 0 degree nozzle for a line that is powerful, up to 40 degree nozzle which sprays a bigger surface area but is the weakest. All of this means that you have to change nozzle every now and then to get rid of tough stains or focus more on light but big grimes. In game, all of this can be summed up with one word: [b]Boring.[/b]\n\n\nYou have the option to use a soap dispenser which can clean easier and a bigger area, but it's just an option you can spend money on and not really get your money's worth. It's not like some stains [b]require[/b] soap or other liquids. No, they're all washed the same way. You can just decide to waste money on soap to [b]TRY [/b]and get some variation into gameplay, but seeing as how they run out in 10 seconds, it offers nothing.\n\n\nCompared to some simulator games like [b]Viscera Cleanup Detail[/b] (a successful cleanup game) there are no gimmicks or management.[list]\n[*] In Viscera you had to fill, empty and move around buckets of water which you would use to cleanup your mop. Knocking them over would cause a spill, messing up your work. Stepping in said mess (or any other puddle) would cause you to leave footprints. So it would create a minigame where you would try to efficiently manage your buckets.\n[*]  You had body parts with physics to collect into a crate and incinerate. Said body parts could wiggle and slap at walls during movement, covering them in blood. More management minigame.\n[*]  When removing bullet holes from surfaces you'd use the Laser Welder which could overheat and start fire, implementing another mini-game into the gameplay.\n[/list]\n\nPowerWash Simulator has [b]NOTHING[/b]! No water limit or management, no hose management, there is literally nothing to do in this game but look at walls and spray like a robot. Because Viscera had so many minigames to manage, it wouldn't cover the entire map in stains to clean. It would try keep it moderated, but because PowerWash has [b]NOTHING[/b], all it can do is cover [u][b]every single bit of surface[/b][/u] in dirt and grime in an attempt to make its level's fun, which it fails at miserably because it does the actual opposite.\n\n \nEven the locations themselves are boring. Viscera had sci-fi space stations with puzzles to solve and even areas based on pop culture, like The Thing movie. PowerWash has you cleaning boring, everyday objects that you could see just by sticking your head out your room's window.\n\n\nHow do you know how much progress you've made in the map? On the top left corner there is a percentage of how much is left. You can spend 40 minutes getting to 98% and then spend a whole 10 minutes for that last 2%. Why? Because [b]the game has no proper way of guiding you to the last bits[/b]. When you're cleaning a whole garden that has more nook and cranny than a ant's nest, [b]at the last 2% you're scouring the entire map[/b], looking under every rock to find a coin-sized stain to remove.\nThe game [b]TRIES[/b] to make it easy by telling you what the last 3 uncleaned items are, but it's a joke. Before the 3 items, you're on your own and when you get to the 3 items, it tells you 1 fence post is uncleaned, while the map contains 8. Yes, I had to inspect all 8, not find the stain and ultimately hose down all 8 again to get a hidden stain removed. F*ck me!\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI've washed a whole balcony with a power wash in real life and despite the machine requiring rest every now and then and my hands getting numb, [b]it was still more fun than this piece of crap[/b].\nThere is not a single saving grace in this game and [b]I would not recommend it, ever, even if it was free.[/b]\n\nDo NOT waste your time on this trash.",

      "review": "[h1]The real life version is more fun than this game and that's sad[/h1]\n\nSeeing some simulator games like PowerWash Simulator, you're intrigued. The real world version of this isn't very fun, how did they manage to make it fun in the game? While many simulator games excel at this, turning everyday chores into fun games, [b]PowerWash fails at it.[/b]\n\n[b]Throughout the entire time I played this, not one drop of Dopamine was secreted by my brain.[/b]\n\n\nYou just point at acres of stains and swirl your mouse left and right to clean it up. That's it. Your powewash has different nozzles that changes how wide water is sprayed. 0 degree nozzle for a line that is powerful, up to 40 degree nozzle which sprays a bigger surface area but is the weakest. All of this means that you have to change nozzle every now and then to get rid of tough stains or focus more on light but big grimes. In game, all of this can be summed up with one word: [b]Boring.[/b]\n\n\nYou have the option to use a soap dispenser which can clean easier and a bigger area, but it's just an option you can spend money on and not really get your money's worth. It's not like some stains [b]require[/b] soap or other liquids. No, they're all washed the same way. You can just decide to waste money on soap to [b]TRY [/b]and get some variation into gameplay, but seeing as how they run out in 10 seconds, it offers nothing.\n\n\nCompared to some simulator games like [b]Viscera Cleanup Detail[/b] (a successful cleanup game) there are no gimmicks or management.[list]\n[*] In Viscera you had to fill, empty and move around buckets of water which you would use to cleanup your mop. Knocking them over would cause a spill, messing up your work. Stepping in said mess (or any other puddle) would cause you to leave footprints. So it would create a minigame where you would try to efficiently manage your buckets.\n[*]  You had body parts with physics to collect into a crate and incinerate. Said body parts could wiggle and slap at walls during movement, covering them in blood. More management minigame.\n[*]  When removing bullet holes from surfaces you'd use the Laser Welder which could overheat and start fire, implementing another mini-game into the gameplay.\n[/list]\n\nPowerWash Simulator has [b]NOTHING[/b]! No water limit or management, no hose management, there is literally nothing to do in this game but look at walls and spray like a robot. Because Viscera had so many minigames to manage, it wouldn't cover the entire map in stains to clean. It would try keep it moderated, but because PowerWash has [b]NOTHING[/b], all it can do is cover [u][b]every single bit of surface[/b][/u] in dirt and grime in an attempt to make its level's fun, which it fails at miserably because it does the actual opposite.\n\n \nEven the locations themselves are boring. Viscera had sci-fi space stations with puzzles to solve and even areas based on pop culture, like The Thing movie. PowerWash has you cleaning boring, everyday objects that you could see just by sticking your head out your room's window.\n\n\nHow do you know how much progress you've made in the map? On the top left corner there is a percentage of how much is left. You can spend 40 minutes getting to 98% and then spend a whole 10 minutes for that last 2%. Why? Because [b]the game has no proper way of guiding you to the last bits[/b]. When you're cleaning a whole garden that has more nook and cranny than a ant's nest, [b]at the last 2% you're scouring the entire map[/b], looking under every rock to find a coin-sized stain to remove.\nThe game [b]TRIES[/b] to make it easy by telling you what the last 3 uncleaned items are, but it's a joke. Before the 3 items, you're on your own and when you get to the 3 items, it tells you 1 fence post is uncleaned, while the map contains 8. Yes, I had to inspect all 8, not find the stain and ultimately hose down all 8 again to get a hidden stain removed. F*ck me!\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI've washed a whole balcony with a power wash in real life and despite the machine requiring rest every now and then and my hands getting numb, [b]it was still more fun than this piece of crap[/b].\nThere is not a single saving grace in this game and [b]I would not recommend it, ever, even if it was free.[/b]\n\nDo NOT waste your time on this trash.",

Now in and of itself that wouldn't be a problem, they have to earn back the money from the collab, sure, we've seen that a million times, but the free DLCs don't have extra achievements. Why is that? The game is tracking your progression at all time, so connecting a simple achievement to the completion is really that hard? I think not. The DLCs are ass anyway, the only worthwhile is the Alice DLC (because it's ). I know Shrek is love, but holy hell, those maps were big and boring.",
