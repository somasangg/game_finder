I loved robbing from people and making it out without being caught was the best feeling, maybe I should even try it in real life... just joking.\n\nFor my second, newgame+, play through the progression was extremely slow. There is no point in small robberies when you are starting at max level, so you just need money, which you can't get because you start with no tools. The change to the attendants schedule is a fun twist for your second play through, but it really means that every person is just home all of the time, so the smaller houses are essentially impossible to rob efficiently without getting caught. And the pedestrians really don't care if you are running in the middle of the street with a 70-inch plasma flat screen TV, however, god forbid your car is on the sidewalk by 1 millimeter and then they can't walk by.\n\nFirst play through is really fun running around stealing stuff, only do a second play through if you want 100%, otherwise don't.",

Also, resident routines could randomize every couple weeks. That way we are forced to figure the routines out. The game does not have good replayability because once you complete a task, you can't really do it again or it's too easy going forward. Randomly generated items and changing resident routines would make it more challenging over time.",

However, If you are employed (unlike me) I don't recommend this game unless you have enough time on your hands, and are ready to grind for a long time.

Not the worst, but it did make the pacing feel a bit slow at times.\r\nI enjoyed most of the achievements, but here’s the kicker: I’m really glad I started playing during the Christmas season, because this game has seasonal challenges. That’s right—Christmas and Halloween achievements. So guess who had to wait until OCTOBER just to 100% the game? Yep, me. And I was not pleased. But hey—I did it!\r\n\r\nAll in all, Thief Simulator is a solid little stealth game with some fun moments, as long as you don’t mind waiting around in the shadows (a lot)!",
