      "review": "Skyrim Special Edition is not just a game for me—it feels like a different world, a place where I can live another life. Even after almost 900 hours of playing, I still come back to it. What makes it special isn’t the main story (to be honest, I haven’t even finished it once). What keeps pulling me back is the mods and the freedom to play Skyrim how I want, in a way no other game allows.\n\nI spend so much time just wandering the world, hunting animals, surviving the cold weather, and walking through the rain. I play with very few things on my screen—no big map, no markers, just a simple parchment map and the world around me. This makes me feel like I’m really there, trying to figure out where I am by looking at the mountains or rivers. It’s not really about survival in the game—it’s about living a life in Skyrim.\n\nSometimes I play as a survivalist, gathering food and making clothes to survive the freezing winters. Other times, I play as something darker, hunting people in the woods, hiding in the shadows, and leaving no trace behind. Combat feels dangerous, like every fight could be my last. Bandits are tough, and there are even minotaurs roaming the wilds. Every victory feels like I earned it, and it’s always satisfying.\n\nBefore I go exploring, I spend hours preparing—packing what I need, checking my gear, and making sure I’m ready for the dangers ahead. My adventures are not about getting stronger or collecting treasures. I don’t care about achievements or beating the game. I even turned off dragons completely. For me, Skyrim is about wandering, getting lost, and discovering the world at my own pace.\n\nWith mods, I’ve changed so much about the game. I’ve prayed to new gods who gave me powers that made me play in new ways. I’ve used mods that change how you level up, making it feel more realistic—like my skills improve as I use them, not just because I earn points. Every time I start a new playthrough, it feels like I’m living a completely new life, seeing Skyrim from a new perspective.\n\nSkyrim never ends for me. It’s not just a game—it’s a place I come back to again and again over the years. I’ve played so many games, but none of them give me the freedom, the immersion, or the feeling of replayability that Skyrim does.\n\nIf you’re looking for a game where you can just exist, make your own story, and explore at your own pace, Skyrim (especially with mods) is perfect.\n\n10/10 – It’s truly a timeless masterpiece.\n\nEdit 1: Reaching close to 1k hours, someone once told me there were no Minos in Skyrim, that someone does not seem to know OBIS exists, so yeah there are minos, heck you can even add murderous vampire faries if you want XD",

      "review": "Skyrim in its remastered \"Special Edition\" form feels like visiting your childhood home. All the furniture is exactly where you left it, the familiar sights and sounds are all there, and the sense of comfort is immediate. But you can't shake the feeling that it's just not the same. It's a perfect snapshot of a memory, but the magic of living there is gone.\r\n\r\nLet's be clear: Skyrim is still a fantastic game. At its core, this is the same sprawling, addictive, and wondrous adventure that captivated the world in 2011. The core gameplay loop—seeing a ruin on the horizon and arriving three hours later after clearing five dungeons, fighting two dragons, and joining a new guild—remains one of the most compelling experiences in gaming. The world is still a joy to explore, and the sheer volume of content is staggering.\r\n\r\nThe \"Special Edition\" buffs this up with all three major DLCs, a more stable 64-bit engine (a godsend for modders), and a graphical facelift. The new lighting, \"god rays,\" and improved water effects make the world feel more vibrant and alive than the somewhat washed-out original. In every technical sense, this is the definitive version of the vanilla game.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, something is missing.\r\n\r\nThe \"old charm\" Skyrim had wasn't just in its gameplay; it was in the moment it was released. It was a global phenomenon. Now, after being re-released on every conceivable platform (and some inconceivable ones, like Alexa), that specialness has been diluted. Skyrim has transcended being a \"classic\" and has become a running joke. Its constant repackaging feels less like a celebration and more like a cynical cash-grab.\r\n\r\nThat feeling is amplified by the fact that this \"remaster\" is incredibly light. The same janky animations, wooden NPCs, and hilarious, physics-defying bugs are all present and accounted for. In 2011, a giant launching you into the stratosphere was a charming, goofy bug. In a modern-day re-release, it just feels a bit lazy, a reminder that you're playing a very old game with a new coat of paint.\r\n\r\nFor a brand-new player, Skyrim Special Edition is an absolute must-buy. It is, without question, one of the most influential and enjoyable RPGs ever made.\r\n\r\nBut for veterans—and I count myself among them, with over 4000 hours logged on the Xbox 360 and another 1000+ on an old Steam account—it's a conflicting experience. For those of us who have slain Alduin multiple times and know the Thieves' Guild questline by heart, the fun is still there, but that unique, \"old\" charm has been lost to time and endless marketing. We're still the Dragonborn, but the thrill of the first shout is gone.",

      "review": "The \"Why Play in 2025?\" Factor You might be thinking, \"Why would I play a game from 2011?\" Well, the answer is yes, but with a catch: Modding is the lifeblood of this game.\n\nThe vanilla experience-especially Anniversary Edition-is great. It's an open-world sandbox where you can ignore the main quest to chase butterflies or build a house for 100 hours. But the real magic happens the moment you open Steam Workshop or Nexus Mods. The community has fixed the bugs Bethesda left in, updated the graphics to 4K standards, and added entirely new DLC-sized expansions.\n\nThe Pros:\n\nFreedom: Go anywhere, do anything. Kill a chicken? The whole town hates you. Save the world? Maybe later, I have to catch this fish.\n\nAtmosphere: The vibe of walking around snowy tundras at night with Secunda playing in the background is just unmatched in any other game.\n\nReplayability: The multiple races, builds, and moral choices can keep this playable forever.\n\nThe Cons:\n\nCombat: It floats. Melee combat lacks \"weight\" to it compared to modern games like Elden Ring. You pretty much just flail your arms around until things fall down.\n\nBugs: It's a Bethesda game. Expect flying mammoths, NPCs hovering in mid-air, and quests to break because you looked at them the wrong way. (Install the Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch immediately).\n\nVoice Acting: For 90% of the population you'll be hearing the same 5 voice actors.\n\nVerdict Skyrim is flawed, clunky and utterly essential. It's a messy masterpiece that respects your freedom more than almost any modern RPG.\n\nRating: 9/10 (10/10 with mods).",

I've been gaming for several decades - in terms of world livability, Skyrim surpasses every game I've ever played (even RDR 2). The quest text after you complete the tutorial sums it up perfectly: \"...I am now free to do as I see fit in Skyrim.\" \n\nThe world is your oyster and you can navigate it exactly as you choose. There are two major, over-arching quest lines (the Dragonborn main quest and Civil War), but there are folks with thousands of hours who haven't completed either. In Skyrim, traveling from A to B inevitably leads to exploration and detours, distractions of the best variety. So many times I've been simply hunting or collecting herbs and stumbled upon a random encounter, a dead NPC with a mysterious note, or a ruin dying to be explored. This version of Skyrim is stuffed with post-launch content: hundreds of quests, many cozy houses to build, NPCs to marry, children to adopt...it's a world you can easily get lost in for hundreds of hours. It is by far the most immersive and engaging environment in gaming. \n\nGraphical mods (of which there are plenty) breathe new life into the game. I'm using NGVO to overhaul graphics but retain vanilla systems, and it feels like a game that came out in 2025. If you haven't experienced Skyrim yet, do yourself a favor and jump in.

I like the dark brotherhood the most in the faction department due to the  stealth items it gives are insane and stealth is just a fun way to play the game. In my honest opinion the only game that is better then Skyrim is Fallout 4. To be frank, the dawn guard DLC is a very good option to because it adds a lot of cool swords and you can be a vampire. The purchase is very worth it. I also recommend Fallout 4.",

The immersion is just palpable to me, even completely vanilla. With all the lazy early-access titles we get nowadays, skyrim is my home. I encourage people to give it a legitimate shot. Find what is fun to you. Play however you want to play. Learn why this game has the cultural staying power it does. When it releases on phone, I'll be there.

Game is good for low performance pc/laptops which means everyone can play it. Graphics in a game is also simple but at the same time creates views that you will never see something even close to it in most of the games nowdays. Mechanics in the game are pretty simple which is good and bad at the same time because sometimes players want to expirience strugle but hear me out, game is designed mostly to chill and relax, game want you to go around and explore new locations (whole map is free for you to explore) talk to npc to get quests or maybe information about places that can help you to learn more magic or to get better weapon. Trust me, there are bosses in the game and they will be chalenging moments because you will fight big dragons, powerfull mages and warriors and even gods sometimes. Those are moments where you will strugle.

There are so many things to do from this game alone than just going through the main story quests alone...\n\nCHARACTER CREATION:\n- choose between different types of race that each have their own unique abilities\n- whether you're in survival mode or not, unique abilities can help you overcome many difficult challenges\n- make a name for yourself or travel the dark path; there is no absolute method for character development\n- become a powerful warrior, a grand mage, a stealthy assassin, an all-rounder, and many more\n\nSKILL TREE MECHANIC & SKILL PERK ALLOCATION:\n- for those who don't mind the grind, leveling up your skills can be done in almost any way possible\n- leveling up a skill can vary from combat, creation, interaction, and even repetition\n- you may save skill points to carefully allocate them later for the sake of your own playstyle or survival\n- spent skill points can contribute greatly to your character's skillset in the long run\n\nQUESTS COMPLETION:\n- you can find a lot of main quests and side quests throughout skyrim in many ways possible\n- no need to do a quest immediately if one is triggered as most quests don't expire nor have a timer\n- find treasures, collect bounties, gain allies, earn glory\n- you may do multiple quests at the same time whenever convenient\n\nWORLD EXPLORATION:\n- solve puzzles, conquer dungeons, uncover mysteries, and discover new locations around the map\n- whether or not the information you collected is connected to other areas, quests, or aspects is up to you\n- you can \"fast-travel\" to arrive at known locations quickly, or travel down the road yourself at a leisurely pace\n- it features probably anything you can expect in a classic medieval fantasy action RPG\n\nCONCLUSION:\nIf you are looking for an action RPG with themes centered around classic medieval fantasy, Skyrim (this version specifically) is one of the best games I would personally recommend. Even if you were to complete the main quests of this game, you would still have hundreds, maybe even thousands of other things to do that will keep you very entertained. You can maybe continue learning the lore of the game or try to uncover all its easter eggs it has to offer. And even if you've done all that, you can try experimenting with mods with help from the community fanbase. Regardless of whether you will play with mods or not, Skyrim is game that can be played and enjoyed in many ways.",

It's just so full of bugs and janky animation that it's now become completely unplayable, most of these bugs have been around for years.\n\nThis game needs a tonne of mods to at least function to a level of an indie game, let alone a once-lauded franchise. And most of the decent mods from several years ago have since been left dormant, either the modder has moved on to more sustainable pursuits or has been acquired by corporate. Keep in mind that modding is the industry's worst exploited. You're doing the job of a developer but......for free. You're a volunteer. \n\nI have two of the community's highest endorsed animation mods and I still not seeing a difference, actors janky in movement. You have to install latest ENB/shader mods to bring the poly to today's standards. But then your FPS dives making the whole thing redundant.\n\nAnd when modders actually do come up with decent overhauls that entice players, the \"developers\" [again, finger-quotes] will just 'acquire' said mod in their (ffs) Creation Club, which then leaves the mod to rot in both community and the Creation Club. Again, the EA business model (\"EA Sports: It's in the shares\").\n\nIt can be fun for 2 minutes having Serena walking around Skyrim mountains with her t*ts out, nipples the size of bullets, for god's sake (no, seriously. There is a mod for that). But, let's face it, if you have to spend your entire gaming night searching for mods and fixes just for only 5 minutes of gameplay before sheer exhaustion. Then what's the point????\n\nDon't be fooled by those Youtube influencers that display their game all glossy and bevelled with anime characters and filtered lighting. That's not the game on sale. They're industry-shills with high-end machines with top graphics  that are needed to run multiple ENB mods needed just for 8 minutes of footage. Whatever it takes to get you to buy this carcass for Bethesda to stay relevant on the stock exchange.\n\nThis used to be the industry's most awarded game that set a new level of standard. But now, years later, the market is inundated with innovative high-fantasy adventure with crafting and farming and base-building and relationships and pets, yadda-yadda, as such with Enshrouded and the up-coming Light No Fire, products that are using latest ware for their own in-house engines.\n\nJust do this game an act of mercy. Drag it out to the barn and pump a bolt-gun to it's head. It's the humane thing to do.\n\nAnd remember, it's been on a discount sale for years. FOR A REASON!\n\nThank you for your concern.",

My problem is they have now put shit behind mini-transactions for MODs and now charging you for mods for a game that is well over a decade old, and they are not regulating these mods to ensure stability. However, they are sure taking a fucking piece of the money you spend on creation points. The reason for my review after so many years, is they have broke a game of mine because I can't escape a house and there is no way to get out. I either start over from a save from 3 days ago or I quit and I quit supporting this series altogether after so many decades. I would rather not stop supporting the series but I don't think I have any choice considering the money grab Bethesda is on just like all the other developers/publishers. So much for waiting on TES6. All Bethesda titles are now blocked and will be boycotted. I have already done this for EA and 2k. It is going on 5 years since boycotting their titles.",
