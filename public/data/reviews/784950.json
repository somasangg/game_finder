This ain't chess, devs – it's sleep deprivation simulator!\r\nMonth 1: Coalitions form faster than bad Tinder dates. I ally with Brazil (we bond over memes in chat), but then Mr. \"I Spent $500 on Gold\" from Germany speed-boosts his stealth bombers and turns my empire into Swiss cheese. Pay-to-win? More like pay-to-nuke-my-hopes-and-dreams. Free players like me? We're just cannon fodder for the whales.\r\nFinally, after 45 days of checking my phone every 5 minutes (RIP social life), I launch nukes... and lose anyway 'cause the game's still running in real-time while I'm at work.

I would partially return throughout the years and see how far it has come. I started playing more this year, joined by some of my real life friends. The game has become a gold syphon pay to win, where apart from people using gold (aka real money) to produce army etc, now can also buy \"special season units\", strong enough to beat most good players with no skill required. The use of gold to produce stuff was managable at certain levels, but the introduction of these \"season elite units\" have made this game unbearable and is what stopped me and my friends from continuing here.",

But someone can be much smaller than you and can just take you over with enough gold. \n\nTHIS IS A PAY TO WIN GAME!!!! \n\nIf you want to play this game and enjoy it, Don't fool yourself into thinking that this is a free game, This is NOT a free to play game at all,  You HAVE TO pay to play this game! Otherwise, it will frustrate you and waste your time as almost EVERYONE in this game uses gold to win and you're only choice if you want to win or even play this game is to out spend them! Buy lots of gold and spend lots of money as you will need as much as you can afford and when you run out after spending a ton of money on one map, Prepare to spend even more money on gold for the next map as you'll be constantly be spending money on this game and at the end of the day, you'll never really own this game.",
