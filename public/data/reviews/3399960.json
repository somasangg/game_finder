It's fun going for max all recipies and I like that it's lightweight enough to keep open while playing other games too. The art, animations, and little collabs are really cute also!\r\nI wish that there were a couple QoL features like when selling fish or taking out of the breeding pen you could shift-click and move/take all at once instead of having to click and hold then wait for a little while each time. It would also be nice if meals in the restaurant sold while the game was closed, but I understand having it the way it is currently.\r\nMy biggest gripe is with the 100m achievement. Going for full completionist, i had everything fully upgraded, all fish, all rods, full mythic tank etc and this achievement alone added 100h of playtime still.\r\nI imagine that with more updates and areas being added (like the recent halloween one and mythic fish) this curve will seem like less of a cliff, but as it stands this one achievement literally doubled my playtime to get.\r\nAside from that though, I do highly recommend the game!!",

      "review": "Fish to Dish: Idle Sushi is a semi-idle, click-based, collection game. \n\nOver the course of several unique maps, you will attempt to fish up several sets of: common, uncommon, rare, epic, and legendary fish. You use this fish to complete your bestiary and menu, which can be displayed in your aquarium and restaurant respectively to generate gold. Gold is used to purchase upgrades such as: Improved Rods, Improved Bait, Cats that collect your fish, the size of your aquarium, the size of your fish hatchery, and Improved hatchery feed. It can also be used to purchase cosmetic upgrades, and the various maps. \n\nWith the basics of the game established, please let me explain my frustration, and why I don’t particularly recommend it based on my taste. Your's may differ, so that context is important because I think this is actually not too bad of a game. I think about games like this in terms of Steam Achievements and how close am I to completing 100% of them. For example, early game is roughly 0-45% achievements completed, middle is roughly 45-80% completion and late game is 80% and up. \n\nIn the early part of the game, you have to spend a lot of time clicking through if you want to progress into the bigger upgrades quickly. You can passively earn gold but its light and would take a few days if not weeks of daily check-ins. As you progress into the middle part of the game, things start to get automated. Your hatchery doesn’t need manual refilling anymore and neither does your bait, so realistically you can generate however much you need. It starts to take a second to do anything but it's realistically still pretty achievable under 100 hours. Late game takes some time to get to and it's potentially infinite to finish. You should finish upgrading, the bestiary, and the cooking menu right around 100-140 hours. That part's fine. Even the cats one where you have to go back and collect random fish they want isn’t that bad and I’m sure the gold one is only another dozen hours or so...HOWEVER...\n\n...Every single map has an achievement that requires you to actively watch\\click until you win the Random Number Generator (RNG) prize. \n\nIt starts off as like a starfish or a seal, you click it, it disappears, something else pops up a few minutes later. You'll notice pretty quickly though, you start to see a lot of a particular shade of starfish, or a very familiar seal, when the achievement wants a penguin. I never saw the penguin though, also, it only gives you gold anyway so its literally just for the achievement. I’m nearly 140 hours in, every upgrade and collectible is unlocked and I still need pretty much every single one from every single map. \n\nSo at this point its not really an idle game anymore because I have to actively watch and click through to increase my odds of finding it before it hit 500+ hours of game play, and that's just not it for me. Plus all my upgrades are now useless because I can't buy anything else so its just ringing for no reason. It just doesn't feel great. \n\nAnyway that's where I'm at with this. I liked it enough to play 140 hours but I'm all really frustrated that I might have to double or triple that in order to get an RNG based set of achievements. It also kind of invalidates all of the progress you make on finishing the restaurant and aquarium because the only thing left to spend gold on is cosmetics you can't use AND that particular aspect of game play literally isn't touched by any of the upgrades!!! Its just clicking and luck which felt terrible. \n\nCheers!",

You'll notice pretty quickly though, you start to see a lot of a particular shade of starfish, or a very familiar seal, when the achievement wants a penguin. I never saw the penguin though, also, it only gives you gold anyway so its literally just for the achievement. I’m nearly 140 hours in, every upgrade and collectible is unlocked and I still need pretty much every single one from every single map. \n\nSo at this point its not really an idle game anymore because I have to actively watch and click through to increase my odds of finding it before it hit 500+ hours of game play, and that's just not it for me. Plus all my upgrades are now useless because I can't buy anything else so its just ringing for no reason. It just doesn't feel great. \n\nAnyway that's where I'm at with this. I liked it enough to play 140 hours but I'm all really frustrated that I might have to double or triple that in order to get an RNG based set of achievements. It also kind of invalidates all of the progress you make on finishing the restaurant and aquarium because the only thing left to spend gold on is cosmetics you can't use AND that particular aspect of game play literally isn't touched by any of the upgrades!!! Its just clicking and luck which felt terrible. \n\nCheers!",

      "review": "Fish to Dish: Idle Sushi is a semi-idle, click-based, collection game. \n\nOver the course of several unique maps, you will attempt to fish up several sets of: common, uncommon, rare, epic, and legendary fish. You use this fish to complete your bestiary and menu, which can be displayed in your aquarium and restaurant respectively to generate gold. Gold is used to purchase upgrades such as: Improved Rods, Improved Bait, Cats that collect your fish, the size of your aquarium, the size of your fish hatchery, and Improved hatchery feed. It can also be used to purchase cosmetic upgrades, and the various maps. \n\nWith the basics of the game established, please let me explain my frustration, and why I don’t particularly recommend it based on my taste. Your's may differ, so that context is important because I think this is actually not too bad of a game. I think about games like this in terms of Steam Achievements and how close am I to completing 100% of them. For example, early game is roughly 0-45% achievements completed, middle is roughly 45-80% completion and late game is 80% and up. \n\nIn the early part of the game, you have to spend a lot of time clicking through if you want to progress into the bigger upgrades quickly. You can passively earn gold but its light and would take a few days if not weeks of daily check-ins. As you progress into the middle part of the game, things start to get automated. Your hatchery doesn’t need manual refilling anymore and neither does your bait, so realistically you can generate however much you need. It starts to take a second to do anything but it's realistically still pretty achievable under 100 hours. Late game takes some time to get to and it's potentially infinite to finish. You should finish upgrading, the bestiary, and the cooking menu right around 100-140 hours. That part's fine. Even the cats one where you have to go back and collect random fish they want isn’t that bad and I’m sure the gold one is only another dozen hours or so...HOWEVER...\n\n...Every single map has an achievement that requires you to actively watch\\click until you win the Random Number Generator (RNG) prize. \n\nIt starts off as like a starfish or a seal, you click it, it disappears, something else pops up a few minutes later.
