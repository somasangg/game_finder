I told myself I’d play a quick match before bed, and suddenly I’m Denmark launching coastal raids, puppeting cities, and realizing it’s 4AM. This game should honestly come with a warning label.\r\n\r\nWhat makes Civ V timeless is how perfectly it blends strategy with personality.\r\nEvery civ feels unique. Every map tells a new story. Every decision matters.\r\nEven when you think you’ve mastered it, the game hits you with something wild—your navy trapped behind borders, your capital starving, or that moment when the AI blindsides you with a carpet of doom.\r\n\r\nThe pacing is perfect.\r\nThe “just one more turn” addiction is REAL.\r\n\r\nEven today, the community, mods, and replayability are unmatched. And unlike some newer entries in the series, Civ V never loses focus — the mechanics are clean, readable, and incredibly satisfying.\r\n\r\nIf you like strategy, history, or losing entire weekends without noticing… get this game.\r\nYou’ll thank me later (or blame me—depending on how many hours disappear).\r\n\r\n11/10.

      "review": "I would argue pinnacle of civ. First one that really hooked me to play it for such an absurdly long amount of time after I started. I'm starting a marathon run with everything max, and now I'm seeing more than a few issues. I think plenty of things could use alteration. \n\nMy main issue is how this game is great except between 3-6 including side games, I can't say diplomacy was ever figured out. They can't keep it both simple and fun so you just always end up with either something like 5 where it's simple but also the ai makes batshit flip floppy decisions that isn't helped by warmongering status that isn't easily cleared up that will instantly make EVERYONE declare war on you. If there's a civilization made up of one city blocking you from making a coast that's been established between all your ai friends that they hate them and so you conquer them after asking them for assistance and they publicly denounce them. NO they'll all declare war on you because you're barbaric and a monster and they all HATE you. Plus in late game I don't really get why plane units need you to wait for the animation to play for every plane flight, you can't execute multiple commands with it. Late game get's really weird too. \nLike you don't really get too dynamic with the modern units as it ends up being a matter of quantity over quality added onto how large everyones empire gets at that point unless you decided to conquer most the area early game. Then you also get the issue of the U.N. being able to vote on world ruler which is determined by influence with city states and whether you follow the world religion or not. So I have lost a game where I had conquered literally the entire map save for 2 cities that ended up having 12 votes each while I had 3 because of essentially horseshit. So they put in a vote for world ruler and I wasn't very popular. \n\nI don't really get the logic of having the greatest amount of wealth, population, cities, military units, research, but you didn't win the popularity contest and you're just supposed to roll over and give up your entire civilization even if you declared war on those last two civilizations you planned on just leaving alone. Even when having spies assigned to earn a vote from those two civs which should have taken one from each. \n\nStill 3 and 4 don't really click with me which is more just due to not investing as much time and 6 goes so far into the city management and diplomacy while simplifying everything else and investing so much into environmental factors that it feels just so alien going into that especially when it changes the artstyle as much as it does.\n\nHonestly if you want a civ game that's the easiest to get into I really would recommend this. It really sells the feel and vibe of what the civ games are about while having simple to understand but hard to master strategy and enough variety with how you want to play the game and also going on sale often enough and cheap enough that there's no reason to not give it a shot. :>",

This game should come with a warning label: \"May cause you to lose entire weekends, eh.\"\n\nCivilization V is digital crack for strategy nerds. One more turn becomes one more hour becomes \"wait, is that the sun coming up?\" The hex-based gameplay is elegant, the tech tree is satisfying to climb, and there's nothing quite like nuking Gandhi before he nukes you first.\n\nLeading your civilization from humble beginnings to world domination (or cultural victory, or science victory, or... you get the idea) is endlessly replayable. Each leader plays differently, and the AI is just unpredictable enough to keep you on your toes.\n\nThe diplomacy system is a bit wonky - other civs will denounce you for literally breathing - but that's part of the charm. Making friends, breaking treaties, and backstabbing your allies is all part of the experience.\n\nWith 35 out of 286 achievements, I've barely dented this game's content. The DLC (especially Brave New World and Gods & Kings) adds even more depth.\n\nPerfect for anyone who enjoys watching numbers go up while pretending to be Alexander the Great.

No cross-platform play — just a reminder of simpler times.\n\nIt’s quick to get into and easy to understand without losing any depth.\nYes, it has its quirks — the AI behavior can be very random and often frustrating — but overall, it’s the least aggravating entry in the series.\nYou spend more time building your civilization the way you want than fighting against arbitrary constraints or random negative events.\n\nThat’s what makes this one special. You can take your Civ from the dawn of time to the future exactly how you envision it.\nIt’s not often mentioned, but that sandbox freedom is what made Civ V truly stand apart from the titles that came after.\n\nWhen people say it’s “the last good Civ,” it’s because it’s the last one that really captures the essence of Civilization: guiding a people from early settlers to futuristic domination — without the game constantly derailing you for the sake of it.\nHere, you actually get attached to your Civ. It’s yours, the one you have carefully engineered to fail or triumph.\n \nAlso you shoud get the version with all the DLCs. It's a lot better.",

I was there with Civ 1 and I have played them all, more exactly Civ1-6, with all additional material I could get my fanboy-hands on, also “Test of Time”, \"Revolution\" (PS3) and of course \"Alpha Centauri\" and even \"Beyond Earth\". \nThis series is the most important and impactful in my gaming life and I wouldn’t be the passionate gamer I am without those games. I am a history nerd and playing alternate timelines on a global dimension over and over again always caught me – over and over again. \nCiv 5 – for me – is nearly perfect in creating this special atmosphere of building an empire and competing on a global dimension throughout centuries, the music and sounds, the art style, the different mechanics – it all comes together so smoothly and naturally and the different leaders in the game are not just ridiculous caricatures of real historical figures, they have character. \n\nAnd there is, where my review shows yet another purpose, that is saying goodbye:\n\nThe first Civ, that didn’t hook me like this, was Civ 6. I didn’t have the feel of a global adventure anymore and the puzzle-aspect of citybuilding with the district system just wasn’t my cup of tea. Never say never, but with Civ 7 being out, that will be the first game of the series, I won’t buy. A few days ago I deleted Civ 7 from my wishlist – I watched at the shop page and facts are: the game is out since February this year, there are 15 buyable dlcs already and a confusing selection of bundles and packages/editions (we are in November now) – I don’t wanna comment on the state of the game, as I haven’t played it. \nI am just not part of the target group anymore, I guess, which is ok, since the franchise needs new players. I simply can’t approve of this kind of business “philosophy”, which in my opinion prioritizes tools and mechanics of greed instead of the actual gaming experience – coming from a nerd, that has bought, as I said, almost everything the series had to offer (Civ 5 was my first civ on steam, nevertheless I additionally bought Civ3, Civ4 complete again on steam). It’s not just about the money, they shall get, what they deserve, but for me it’s first and foremost about the game itself.\n\nBut I don’t want to conclude and say goodbye on a sour note. I want to thank Sid Meier and all of the people, who have worked on the series: You have enriched my gaming life more than any other game could ever have – for more than 30 years (HOLY f' MOLY). All the thousands of hours with the series were just wonderful and I have so many lovely memories that will remain, THANK YOU. \n\nWhen that civ-feeling is itching me again, I will come back to this one... just for one more turn...",

      "review": "I liked playing Civ 2/3/4 back in the day, but having played Civ 5 for the first time in 2025, it seems to me like the game was either never particularly good, or that it has aged extremely poorly in comparison to more contemporary games and designs like Crusader Kings 3 or Against the Storm.\n\nThe technical issues alone are bad enough: at a resolution of 1440p, main menu and loading screens have huge black borders, and there's no UI scaling whatsoever, so all text and buttons both in menus and in-game are absolutely tiny. This alone already makes the game an absolute chore to play.\n\nRegarding the art style, in a vacuum it's not bad, but for a strategy game I find it very hard to read. Whereas Civ 4 might look less pretty but at least one could always tell what was going on.\n\nThe game is also rather poor about presenting its information, e.g. there are a whole bunch of more or less hidden UI submenus.\n\nTutorialization is atrocious. The game is full of bizarre opaque mechanics (e.g. anything related to city states) and expects you to learn about them via pretty unhelpful advisors or the detailed in-game Civipedia which is essentially an in-game manual. Which, again, lacks any UI scaling, so the walls of text are absolutely tiny.\n\nTurns take forever to resolve: despite the default settings (small map, continents, 5 civs total) and 2025 hardware vs. a 2010 game, by turn 250 passing the turn took 20+ seconds each time. Assuming that number held constant instead of increasing as the game progressed, then for every 180 turns played you'd spend 1 hour just watching the other civs play.\n\nFinally, regarding the music, personally I really didn't like the classical soundtrack for this game, whereas Civ IV's Baba Yetu is one of my favorite video game songs of all time.\n\nI could go on, but I think I've made my point: I don't think this game has aged well, and if you haven't played a Civ game or a grand strategy game before, surely there's no way this is the best one to get into in 2025. Even if you don't like the more recent Civ games (I haven't played them), there are still other and much better grand strategy titles out there, like the aforementioned Against the Storm or Crusader Kings.",

This alone already makes the game an absolute chore to play.\n\nRegarding the art style, in a vacuum it's not bad, but for a strategy game I find it very hard to read. Whereas Civ 4 might look less pretty but at least one could always tell what was going on.\n\nThe game is also rather poor about presenting its information, e.g. there are a whole bunch of more or less hidden UI submenus.\n\nTutorialization is atrocious. The game is full of bizarre opaque mechanics (e.g. anything related to city states) and expects you to learn about them via pretty unhelpful advisors or the detailed in-game Civipedia which is essentially an in-game manual. Which, again, lacks any UI scaling, so the walls of text are absolutely tiny.\n\nTurns take forever to resolve: despite the default settings (small map, continents, 5 civs total) and 2025 hardware vs. a 2010 game, by turn 250 passing the turn took 20+ seconds each time. Assuming that number held constant instead of increasing as the game progressed, then for every 180 turns played you'd spend 1 hour just watching the other civs play.\n\nFinally, regarding the music, personally I really didn't like the classical soundtrack for this game, whereas Civ IV's Baba Yetu is one of my favorite video game songs of all time.\n\nI could go on, but I think I've made my point: I don't think this game has aged well, and if you haven't played a Civ game or a grand strategy game before, surely there's no way this is the best one to get into in 2025. Even if you don't like the more recent Civ games (I haven't played them), there are still other and much better grand strategy titles out there, like the aforementioned Against the Storm or Crusader Kings.",

When I tried to redownload this game, the launcher was totally broken and I had to follow a guide with multiple steps that required retrying over and over again to get it working again. Other people have run into the same issue as you can see in other reviews.\r\nSo yes I love the game, but if you try to buy it now you may have difficulties getting it to even run.",

Good Job Take-Two Interactive i am 100% sure loyal Customers and fans of games like GTA or RDR (one of the very very few games in the gaming industry which have the quality for gamers to must have and must play, cant wait for them to be released etc.) will absolutley loving such methods and practice and will buy ur products nevermind.

But I never expected 2K to update its user terms, forcing me to allow programs to steal my personal information while I'm playing. I can't imagine what a game company's purpose would be in setting such terms.\n\nTherefore, I strongly suggest you carefully consider this factor before purchasing and patiently read other people's reviews. If those reviews make you hesitant to buy any 2K game, please trust them.\n\n文明系列游戏我已经玩了超过12年了，因此，我曾经相信文明每一代能够逐渐变得更好。但万万没想到，2K更新了它的用户条款，迫使我允许程序在我游玩的时候偷取我的个人信息。我无法想象一个游戏公司是出于什么目的设置这样的条款。\n\n在此，我强烈建议你在购买前慎重地考虑这个因素，并耐心读读其他人的评价。如果那些评价让你对购买任何2K的游戏产生了顾虑，请一定要相信他们。",

It loves to pin you in the most unfair of positions and expect you to somehow recover from the constant nonsense only you are facing. You will manage to catapult yourself to the renaissance era before CE and somehow EVERY enemy will still have 2x your resources, standing with city states, income, food, happiness, and units. Playing a larger game type? All 7 other opponents on the map are now hostile towards you! Smaller game? All 3! Barbarians? Yes YES! Only for you my friend! Endless endless barbarians just for you!\r\nIf you have friends to play this game with, it is a blast!  If you do not, I do not recommend this game to you. I do not recommend this game for those looking for a casual, (or even balanced) strategy game as you will have to disable so many \"features\" before you successfully win a game. If you're willing to put in the hours and time in order to \"get good\" to cover the skill gap to compete with the sometimes unforgiving AI, and have no interest in real time strategy games, or strictly war based games, this might be for you. 3/5",
