A game, that is free.\nI find the price increase suspicious and It would make me unable to access it back then.\n\nBut, if you play VRChat a lot and still don't have this, I do recommend it.\nAnd if you got it for free I recommend donating if you can, maybe it could become free again and allow it to be accessible for all the newer players.",

I only use it for the playspace drag and vrchat and tbh when like a product like this was free for a long time just to shift it to a paid product is just shady and I cannot really give a trusting review about this anymore.",

After using it as long as I have, I can tell you with full confidence that it's not worth the $12 they ask for it.\n\nI only use 2 of the many settings OVR Advanced Settings adds, and I really cannot think of many other use-cases where I'd be using more of them, in-fact, for most cases I'd be using less of them.\n\nI have no idea why they suddenly decided to make this a paid product. For just a little extra money, you could buy a Zinger Box. That's far more worth the money than this despite being temporary.",
