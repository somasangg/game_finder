      "review": "I have played this game for a little over 40 hours, focusing almost entirely on Career Mode, as I generally avoid online modes like FUT due to EA’s servers feeling unstable at times. From an offline perspective, EA FC 26 delivers strong presentation, improved animations, and enjoyable gameplay when everything functions as intended.\r\n\r\nHowever, as you progress deeper into Manager Career Mode, more unresolved bugs begin to appear. Contract negotiations often behave incorrectly — for example, players requesting extensions despite still having four years remaining on their deals, or demanding unrealistically high salaries without performance justification. On top of that, AI behavior can be inconsistent, tactical instructions may not apply properly, cutscenes become repetitive, and simulation or transfer logic can break immersion. These issues don’t make the mode unplayable, but they do highlight a lack of refinement for offline-focused players.\r\n\r\nDespite these shortcomings, this is still the best football game available today, and for that reason alone, there is no justification for giving it a harsh rating.\r\n\r\nScore: 3/5 – A solid experience, though Career Mode clearly needs more attention and stability improvements.",

This game has got a much, much better atmosphere(if i spelt it correctly), it's much easier to score goals, mainly bangers and headers and the goalkeepers are much more realistic. The only thing that makes this game somewhat bad is the passing and the lag. I say you wait until there's an offer, because it's worth less than 70 euros.",

      "review": "If we compare fifa 23 and ea fc 26 i have to say the two games are whole different level, first of all ea fc 26 feels 30x harder to play on keyboard, like even if i play on semi-pro it feels insane in gameplay because they ruined defending a lot, in fifa 23 u could just run into player and steal ball and run and score, here in ea fc 26 u can't even get ball like that and even if u use defending it's hard even with tackling to get a ball ofc it feels kinda realistic more and a lot better then fifa 23 but still that's something that's hard and i've noticed, next thing is ea fc 26 still bugs like even if i lock fps and get max fps the cut-scenes are bugging on career modes or ultimate team etc it feels kinda choppy but not a lot ofc it's still playable ofc. I payed 35$ for this game cus i've waited discount to get ea fc 26 since i am big football enthusiast and generally fifa is my favourite football game ever since i was a kid. Also it took me 3 hours to do objectives to unlock transfer market just to realise i had to wait 48 hours more due to pc user and something but okey i forgive that tbh that's not bad overall. For career mode it's very good i mean probably there is a lot mistakes. For Ultimate team i kinda hate that people in 2-3 months grinded and nolifed this game so in division 10 rivals i already get people with 33/33 chemistry squads and even gold players with 83+ which is kinda insane and hard to play against as a totally keyboard gamer begginer. Would i recommend this game? Yeah there is no doubt but i understand all fans and players that say the fifa is getting worse and worser bcs it really does feels like that i can't imagine how much they ruined defending atleast on keyboard idk for joystick controllers tho. But if u football fan and feel like u want it it's okey just in my case doesn't worth even 35$ not to mention full original price is 70$ definitely don't pay that much guys.",

I never thought I'd buy another fifa unless it's super cheap on sale, but after playing fc25 for many hrs and then trying fc26 on ea play trial, I was sold. The authentic gameplay is one the main reasons I've bought as I mostly play career mode and pro clubs and I must say it's closest EA has gotten to making the gameplay realistic. \r\n\r\nThe visuals and stadium lighting have improved, gameplay feels smoother and this time instead of just changing sliders to simulate a realistic feel, authentic gameplay actually changes the animations and response times of players. You can no longer sprint your way into midfield and score and are forced to use tactics, pass your way around to score which feels very rewarding. Most of the problems that plague this franchise still remains but it's a breath of fresh air to see the changes in this edition. \r\n\r\nThere is an issue where the menu lags terribly after half time that has a workaround of driver level capping your fps which worked for me but it can be something game breaking if this doesn't fix it for you. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, I must admit after probably nextgen fifa 15 or ucl liscenced fifa 19, this is one fifa I can say is worth buying on at least 50% sale.

Ultimate Team remains fun, but the reward system often makes you feel like you're working too hard for too little.

      "review": "The common yearly complaint that EA Sports FC 26 is 'the same game' simply isn't true, especially coming from a player who has bought the series since 2017. This year delivers a vital structural upgrade by introducing Dual Gameplay Modes: an Authentic preset for slow, realistic Career Mode play, and a Competitive preset for fast, skill-based Ultimate Team matches, effectively giving you two distinct football experiences in one. On the pitch, movement feels instantly better thanks to tighter, more responsive dribbling, and the Goalkeeper AI is noticeably smarter, making fewer mistakes and controlling deflections effectively. This relentless dedication to evolving the core experience is why, year after year, the series stands out as one of the most well-made and continuously refined sports game franchises ever created. Furthermore, the Deeper Modes keep things fresh, with the Manager Market adding real-world tension to single-player careers and the new Challengers League in Ultimate Team offering a rewarding competitive space for all skill levels. If you love football sims, these meaningful, core improvements prove that FC 26 is the evolution we needed and definitely worth the annual purchase.\r\n\r\nI still hate the AI of Clubs. and the Handicap of ultimate team. and how my teamates miss  30 EASY shots to net.",

Then, despite turning off a lot of the optional stuff at the start of my career mode, I still get an ungodly amount of pop ups.\n\nIn my first press conference I was asked 3 questions about my previous pre-season game. They were as follows.\n1. \"Enzo Fernandez completed 15 passes at 96%. Do you think he can do better?\"\n2. \"Cole Palmer completed 15 passes at 94%. Do you think he can do better?\"\n3. \"Enzo Fernandez completed 5 passes at 56%. Do you think he can do better?\"\n\nI'm sorry, what? You asked me 3 of the same question, with the last question contradicting the first.\n\nWhile the gameplay is (mostly) more realistic and much less arcadey, they failed to strike a fun balance between too ridiculous and outright boring. The game just isn't fun and I can only play 2 matches before I get too bored to continue.\n\nI say \"mostly realistic\" since the biggest disgrace is the removal of the offside rule. I can score goals while being miles offside and the linesman will never raise his flag. I don't see the point in rendering a whole linesman to not have him do his job. In addition, Crossing has been nerfed again, so much so, that every cross will go straight to the opposing GK.\n\nHere's some other issues.\n1. Goal replays are terrible. Instead of showing the goal, you get a beautiful top down view of the half way line! Nice.\n2. The match intros are marred by an extremely blurry and non-colour graded Google maps image of whatever stadium you're playing in, complete with the Google logo to let you know where they got it from and how little effort they put in to rendering their own intro.\n3. And the most disgusting offense, an ACHIEVEMENT FOR BUYING A MICROTRANSACTION!!! which, thank God, only 0.2% of players have. My faith in humanity has been restored.\n\nI haven't even gotten to the point where I even want to play Clubs because I know that's going to have it's own issues, but the single player, as it is, is unacceptable for a £30 50% off price from a billion dollar company. Too late for me to refund but do yourself a favour and just don't buy. Better games out there for £30 and less.",

But after playing one match, the performance suddenly collapses for no reason. FPS drops to 20–30 during gameplay, animations stutter, and everything becomes extremely laggy. Restarting the game sometimes helps temporarily, but the issue always returns after the next match.\r\n\r\nI’ve tried everything:\r\n– updating GPU drivers\r\n– cleaning cache and shaders\r\n– switching between DX11 and DX12\r\n– disabling V-Sync\r\n– checking temperatures (which are normal)\r\n– repairing or reinstalling the game\r\n\r\nNothing provides a permanent fix.\r\nIt feels like the game breaks its own performance after each match, even though no settings are changed.\r\n\r\nConsidering the price of the game, these stability issues are unacceptable.

His team walked out looking like they were forged in a diamond mine. Meanwhile, my squad assembled through hard work, daily challenges, and sheer human perseverance looked like they’d just escaped a discount bin at a Sunday yard sale.\r\n\r\nGameplay Highlights:\r\n\r\nWent 0–6 because my opponent apparently unlocked the “Physics Don’t Apply to Me” DLC.\r\n\r\nMy striker broke his ankle trying to turn.

The opponents used to play according to their team quality — stronger teams felt organized and dangerous, while weaker teams were more balanced and realistic. That variety made the gameplay fun, immersive, and authentic.\r\n\r\nAfter the latest update, though, the AI feels completely broken. Now every team plays like prime Brazil 2002, and every player turns into Messi. There’s no difference between small clubs and top-tier teams anymore — everyone dribbles perfectly, never misses passes, and constantly pulls off unrealistic moves.\r\n\r\nEven worse, the gameplay has become way too negative and boring. The AI keeps passing the ball backwards, holding possession for no reason, instead of trying to attack or win. It’s frustrating and kills the whole experience.\r\n\r\nIt feels like the developers are listening to a very small portion of the community, ignoring the majority of players who prefer realistic, competitive, and enjoyable football.\r\nAs someone who mainly plays offline Career Mode as a manager, I want to experience football that feels real — not a game where the AI just passes around endlessly like it’s trying to waste time.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I really hope EA reconsiders the direction they’re taking. The previous version had much better balance, realism, and fun. Right now, it just feels disappointing and not enjoyable at all.",

Any enjoyment the game might offer is buried under constant crashes, freezes, and technical issues that make it feel more like an unstable early beta than a finished product.\r\n\r\nMatches frequently crash mid-game, menus lock up without warning, and even simple tasks like adjusting settings can send the whole program spiraling into a forced restart.

The input delay is unbearable — every pass, shot, or tackle feels like it takes a full second to register. Defending is a complete disaster; it’s sluggish, unresponsive, and makes matches feel like a coin toss rather than skill-based gameplay.\nThis isn’t what players expect from a flagship football title. We spend our hard-earned money expecting a polished experience, not something that feels like it skipped basic testing. Right now, FC26 is frustrating instead of fun, and it’s insulting to loyal fans who keep supporting your franchise year after year.\nFix the responsiveness, fix the defending mechanics, and stop releasing games in this state. Until then, FC26 is nothing more than a disappointment.\nAngrily,\nInfamousMax",

      "review": "I seldom write reviews for any games but this time I feel like I need to.\n\nCons:\n- First week of the game was actually pretty good. Most of the issues EA addressed during their promo video pre-release of the game was actually there. Ball retention after a tackle was better. Fewer bounce backs. Smarter goal keeper positioning and more nuanced ways to pass and attack with the ball. Fast forward to 2-3 patches after? All gone. In fact its somehow even worse than FC25 AT ITS WORST!\n\n-Attacking AI is horrible. The game does not promote tactical creativity. This is in both Career mode and Ultimate team. It feels like there is only one correct way to play the game and any other formation is just there so EA can say hey we gave you options. Even if you are using the \"Meta\" formation it doesn't matter. If you do not have the players then it still doesn't work. Yes I am talking to you Claudia Pina enjoyers out there...... There is no authentic movement. There is no use having the attacking positioning stat because players will not occupy space or do any off the ball movement without me player locking or spamming runs or trying to flick every single player into positions they should naturally find themselves in.\n\n-Rewards. At my peak I was consistently a Div 1 - Elite player from FIfa 23-25. I am not here to say I am great at the game. I grinded alot and eventually found a consistent formation with several players I really gel with. Pack weight and luck has always been hit or miss but its nice to occasionally pack someone worthwhile and try to fit them into my team. This year, the rewards are meaningless. The promos make 0 sense its as if EA are watching football upside down. The rewards for everything are terrible. The cards are meaningless. Even if you pack a card that looks great on paper it does not translate one bit onto the pitch. There is no motivation to try new cards or new formations because there are only a handful of \"correct\" cards you should play with. Nothing else.\n\n-Animations. Wow... I don't even know where to start. Adding animations on top of broken animations to break something that is already broken. Not much to say here but, how can Fifa 10,11,12 have more authentic looking animations than this game? Any sort of animation is broken. Goalkeepers attempting saves with t-rex arms. Defenders lifting their legs slightly to go into a tackle. Strikers kicking at nothing and tripping over themselves for the fun of it. Stop adding animations and fix the existing ones that have been broken since FC 24.\n\n-Playstyles. I truly believe playstyles ruined the game. This was just another greedy way for EA to sell you \"useable\" cards. Why do I say this? Because without playstyles you cannot do the most simple pass. Without incisive, the through ball is a direct pass to the opponent. Without anticipate your defender attempts a tackle in the opposite direction of the opponent. Without quick step or rapid, it does not matter if your player has 90+ pace, regardless of whatever body type. They will not run. If you pay attention to promo releases, EA will deliberately save cards with \"useable\" playstyles during TOTY or TOTS or FUTTIES. Just so they can squeeze an extra buck out of you. Playstyles have ruined the game. I truly do not believe a professional footballer that gets paid thousands a week cannot make a simple through ball without having \"incisive\". I am not even talking about to break the defence with one pass. \n\nTLDR: This is a nothing game. Canadians should not be allowed to make a football game. Stick to Hockey please. Or some lumberjack simulation game where the reward is a large jug of maple syrup. \n\nPros:\n\nThe graphics and facial scans of real players do look pretty nice :)",

The rest of the time the game boots you off if you're a PC player randomly, UT is the only game mode which is at all interesting because career mode is shit and pro clubs is too buggy to take seriously. The game suffers horrendously from 'mechanic creep' where they've added 'interesting gameplay elements' over the years that nobody asked for to the point where singleplayer modes are ruined entirely and multiplayer boils down to who has the most meta team and who kicks off first. UT rewards don't works half the time, you're not even allowed to use the transfer market until you complete buggy objectives that don't activate when they should.

But now every match feels 5/95 .. Hope they fix this soon",

Forwards press and steal better than Defenders. Scoring is way easier than defending since your AI teammates will just give them open space. It still has bugs on PC relating to disconnects and controller issues. The lag is better but still shows up. There lots of game features, Its visually amazing and the highlights are great, but I still don't recommend it.",

But after the second update, everything went downhill fast. Now the game feels scripted again: the ball constantly bounces off your players and straight to your opponent, who somehow scores goals that make zero sense.\n\nThere’s also a really annoying bug where you can’t swap your starting players with subs during matches. It’s been around for a while, and it still isn’t fixed.\n\nTo make things worse, hackers are everywhere even in FUT Champions. No matter how well you play, you’ll end up losing to cheaters way too often.\n\nHonestly, I can only recommend FC26 if you’re planning to stick with Career Mode or other offline modes. For online play, it’s just not fun anymore.\n\nRating: 2/10!",

It's  not fun to play at all, the A.I just has to run in to you to gain the ball, passes are awful again and it's heavily reliant on Playstyles once again, you basically play EA FC 25 again after all these updates it has gone worse, the game was okay when it got released, of course it had some issues too but all the updates made this game worse and partially it's the community's fault too for crying about every minor change.  \n\nThis game has nothing to do with Football at all the stats are a lie. Playstyles are way too important once again just like last years EA FC again, you have to spin around hundred times and use tricks to pass players and that is not fun at all especially when passes aren't connecting at all, the game feels slow and clunky and unless you play like a coward and use cheap tricks you  won't win.",
