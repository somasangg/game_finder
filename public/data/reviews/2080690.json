      "review": "Sunkenland sets up its world with a simple premise: water won, and everything familiar slid under. The game asks you to build meaning out of whatever debris you can pull from the sea. What keeps the experience steady is the tension between fragile security and constant need. Nothing feels theatrical; it’s all stripped back to procedure and consequence.\n\nIntroduction:\nThe first moments tell you exactly what you’re working with: limited tools, resources, and a skyline made of half-drowned structures. The setting frames every decision. Supplies are scarce, space is tight, and threats carry no dramatic speeches ; just presence. The appeal comes from how you respond to that structure, not from any spoon-fed narrative.\n\nExamination of core loop:\nThe game asks you to pull resources from wrecks, patch together equipment, and assemble a base that can actually withstand raids. These steps may look routine on paper, but the atmosphere shifts the routine into something sharper. When you move gear through the waterlogged corridors of a broken tower, you track your oxygen, watch your footing, and rely on simple tools. Nothing feels ornamental. Every action has a clear context: get materials, keep breathing, get home intact.\n\nBase construction:\nBuilding works well because the game gives you enough structure to make choices matter without forcing you into narrow templates. When you fit walls onto platforms, or slot machines into cramped rooms, the resulting structure says something about your priorities. The base is not just decoration; it’s a long-term strategy problem disguised as a workshop.  You can also find decorations such as paintings, neon signs and random stuff like rubber ducks and designer purses to display in your base..which I honestly loved.\n\nProgression and travel:\nUpgraded boats change the game’s rhythm. Once you install engines onto a new hull, the world widens. You reach new towers, encounter new groups, and take on supply routes that feel more coordinated. Movement isn’t flashy, but it’s purposeful: distance becomes a planning issue rather than a chore.\n\nCombat and AI:\nCombat is serviceable: practical, simple, and sometimes messy. Enemies behave in ways that occasionally break your expectations, but rarely in a way that derails the loop. The rough edges show up, but they don’t drag the experience down.\n\nSystems and limitations:\nInventory friction remains one of the more noticeable Limitations. Some menus require an extra step or two, and item stacks fill up earlier than expected. AI inconsistencies pop up here and there, but they’re more of a side note than a hazard. The game has one Issue that’s worth a clear statement: achievements do not register. It’s annoying if you track Data or completion checklists, but it doesn’t affect the actual play experience.\n\nAtmosphere and tension:\nWhere Sunkenland stands apart is how it builds pressure without spectacle. You don’t need dramatic music or cutscenes. You just need the sound of a shark brushing past a hull, the quiet of a flooded hallway, or the sight of your half-finished base holding up against a raid. The atmosphere comes from simple Observations: how light hits water, how sound carries, how your tools strain under repeated use.\n\nCo-op considerations:\nPlaying with others changes the structure of the game. Roles fall into place naturally: one person collects supplies, another reinforces the base, another handles routes. When you pass materials between teammates, the loop becomes smoother and more tactical. It’s a clean example of cooperative systems working through player agency rather than scripted coordination.\n\nConclusion:\nSunkenland doesn’t try to charm you with speeches, marketing gloss, or staged heroism. It gives you a world, a set of problems, and room to build your own direction. What you take from it depends on how you treat the work: gather parts, hold the line, build something that lasts, and keep going. It’s rough in places, yes, but the roughness fits the Context. The setting is worn down; the systems reflect that; the rhythm reinforces it.\n\nIf you want a survival game grounded in practical decisions, quiet tension, and a steady rhythm of risk and reward, Sunkenland holds up well. It’s not polished into sterility, and it doesn’t pretend otherwise. That honesty is part of what makes it worth the time.\n\nI'm excited to see how this game develops over time!",

      "review": "I am reviewing this based on beta version 7.02. It is my understanding that v7 added warships and also many of the points of interest have been updated as well as various other additions and improvements.\n\nFirstly as an early access game this is perfectly playable and well formed and even in the beta version i only found a couple of minor bugs...second time i loaded the game all the points of interest went from being \"?\" to being discovered which didn't break the game for me and i noticed when taking a full battery out of the head torch it would frequently become half full.\n\nOverall this a good quality survival game with pretty good graphics, systems and mechanincs although there a few things which don't seem quite right...this is early access and the game is actively under development. I have played just over 100hrs and 'completed' the game and mostly enjoyed the experieince, thus it has been great value for money and i would certainly recommend it.\n\nSome improvements i would suggest are;\n\nIf you follow the suggested levels of locations the game starts off more as an underwater exploration game and ends up as an island raiding game where by the time you get kitted out for a some underwater exploration with big air tanks and a 'seaglide' (see subnautica) there is no longer any underwater points of interest. The map is actually quite large so there is plenty of space to add more underwater points of interest in the future. The 'seaglide' is most useful kept at your home base in case you die raiding an island so you can get back to the island fast and then just store it in your inventory.\n\nThe progression system could do with some tweaking. Looking at boats it is pretty easy to jump straight to the motor boat, avoiding the peddle boat and sail boat all together which are only really useful for their storage space when looting points of interest. The jet ski has no real purpose or niche, seeming slower and less manouverable than the marine fast boat/bowrider and also has zero storage.\n\nThe welding torch is kind of a side grade as while it significantly speeds up repairs you can't disassemble with it so still need the hammer.\n\nEvery boat you own and island you capture has a marker...which can't be turned off. Later in the game one of the biggest difficulties with combat is your screen full of markers so you can see enemies.\n\nSniper rifle, with maximum sigh and red dot seems 'iffy' to use. Even my wife, who likes to watch noticed how 'inaccurate' it seemed. In the end i chose to make a high capacity magazine fast firing sniper rifle and use it more like a long range assault rifle, using bursts of shots rather than a 1 shot 1 kill approach.\n\nWill finish with some notable good points;\nThe game is visually very nice\nWeaponry seems solid, with special mention going to grenades...I often skip grenades in shooters as they often seem more like an afterthought and unreliable. After trying grenades in Sunkenland they became one of my go to weapons.\nThere are some nice QoL aspects for inventory such as being able to move all similar items into a container as well as an inventory sort maching you can make later on.\nCan name storage (although does not make an actual lable, just shows the name when hovering over)",

I will admit a lot of the playtime is in the play test version so your mileage may very if you stick to just the base game. They graphics may not be the best but it still has its charm and can still have some very pretty moments. If you are itching for a new survival crafting game I would highly recommend it. at the price point of 20 USD I do not feel as though it owes me anything.

      "review": "Sunkenland is an ambitious survival game set in a flooded, post-apocalyptic world that feels like a mix of Waterworld and Subnautica. After several hours of gameplay, I can say I’m quite satisfied with the experience so far — but there’s still a lot of room for growth.\r\n\r\nThe world design and atmosphere are impressive, and diving through submerged ruins or exploring wrecks feels genuinely rewarding. However, the game currently offers only a limited variety of fish and underwater creatures, which makes the ocean feel a bit emptier than it should. The AI enemies are also quite weak — they often react slowly or behave unpredictably — yet their gunfire is extremely punishing when it hits, which keeps combat tense despite the simplicity.\r\n\r\nBase building and resource gathering are enjoyable and already well-developed for an Early Access title. Crafting feels satisfying, and there’s a good sense of progress as you unlock new blueprints and upgrades. Still, some areas could use more polish, especially enemy pathfinding and the diversity of environments and loot.\r\n\r\nOverall, Sunkenland shows great promise. It’s beautiful, runs fairly smoothly, and has a strong foundation for more content to come. For an Early Access game, it’s already engaging and fun, but I’m looking forward to deeper AI behavior, more sea life types, and expanded content in future updates.\r\n\r\nRating: ★★★★☆ (4 out of 5)\r\nVerdict: A solid survival experience with great potential, only held back by some Early Access limitations.",

I feel like it would be fair for whatever is in your hotbar stays when sorting but that isn't the case here when you auto fill to a bin, it takes anything relevant so Im constantly having to fetch my belongings and place them back into my hotbar. The furnace is my biggest ick of this game, the fact we can't put a stack of ore in there to be smelted is horrible. It requires you to have to stand there and do each one individually which takes time away from being able to explore. It would be so much better if you could put 5 ore in and have it run on a timer basis and leave it to go loot then come back to having an output of 5 iron ingots etc. Either way overall this game has so much potential and I will continue to play, just hope it improves over time.",

It's no Subnautica. \nThe setting feels a lot like the movie Water World, which makes base building and trading rather fun. The other thing I appreciate is that there's an actual purpose for having a base, outside of simply being a building/decorating sim. Hostile npcs from neighboring islands will occasionally raid your settlement, and they become more numerous with each attack. A lot of survival games miss the mark there and fail to implement a driving reason to bother with building.\nScavenging under water becomes a bit repetitive and boring after a few in-game days. Dive down, grab up all the metal and wood you can see, avoid schools of sharks (that don't even really roam around, they stay in one spot) and come back up before you run out of air. You CAN technically build under water bases which is kinda cool but at the same time, I'd just go play Subnautica for that because the ocean in Sunkenland just doesn't compare to Subnautica's oceans, which are teeming with life and danger.\nFor what it is and the price tag, I give it a thumb's up.

I -HATE- this mechanic in games.\nThink about it, you died somewhere.... now you need to go back there, without all your stuff, to loot a container, while the things that killed you are still there. Deeply exhausting.\n\nOther than this, the game is okay... there's durability, which I also wish I could turn off, because quite frankly it's just kinda boring to have to keep repairing things. The thirst and hunger, even when turned to low, are pretty wild. Eat 5 crabs in one day? That's enough to fill you up in real life, hell, in real life, that's too much food.... In game however, no. This does barely anything.\nWater at least gets sated fairly quickly.\n\nBuilding is pretty good, You can build fantastic bases. There's a lot of decorations and I definitely made my house too small. But still, my rubber ducks were happy on their bed.\nYou can plant a bunch of trees to get wood, or just go exploring for wood. I did plant food, but got mad with the game before it gave me anything. And I discovered you can eat raw meat just fine.\n\nThe combat is abysmal.... Enemies will snipe you from miles away, with shockingly good accuracy. I had it on easy.... It's possible that I just suck at it... hell, I definitely do... But when you're swimming up to an island, and they're using guns to shoot you, there's not a lot you can do...

I -HATE- this mechanic in games.\nThink about it, you died somewhere.... now you need to go back there, without all your stuff, to loot a container, while the things that killed you are still there. Deeply exhausting.\n\nOther than this, the game is okay... there's durability, which I also wish I could turn off, because quite frankly it's just kinda boring to have to keep repairing things. The thirst and hunger, even when turned to low, are pretty wild. Eat 5 crabs in one day? That's enough to fill you up in real life, hell, in real life, that's too much food.... In game however, no. This does barely anything.\nWater at least gets sated fairly quickly.\n\nBuilding is pretty good, You can build fantastic bases. There's a lot of decorations and I definitely made my house too small. But still, my rubber ducks were happy on their bed.\nYou can plant a bunch of trees to get wood, or just go exploring for wood. I did plant food, but got mad with the game before it gave me anything. And I discovered you can eat raw meat just fine.\n\nThe combat is abysmal.... Enemies will snipe you from miles away, with shockingly good accuracy. I had it on easy.... It's possible that I just suck at it... hell, I definitely do... But when you're swimming up to an island, and they're using guns to shoot you, there's not a lot you can do... And then you have to get back to your stuff when you die... They camp your corpse. This is why I won't bother playing the game again, because quite frankly, this just kills the game for me. \n\nMaybe you'll like the game more than I did, but I cannot recommend it, because quite frankly, I didn't enjoy my time. The base building is good, so if you want to tough out the rest of the game just to build a metropolis, I wouldn't blame you.\n\nRegardless of whether or not you found my review helpful, I hope you have a lovely day. <3",

Crafting for instance is lacking, in a lot of areas, tell me why I have to by the 'Brick Embryos' only way to get them is through a purchase. You'll let me find black powder, dry at that, and in mass, but can't make a simple brick to build a decent wall. Yeah, not cool. \n\nTurning raw ore (Copper, Iron) into ingots.. time consuming, or space waste, your call. You need a LOT of room and a ton of wood to pull off a rapid change from raw ore to ingots, because you can only do 1 at a time per furnace. No way to stack and be able to walk away from it and let it do its thing. Not really cool with that.\n\nNow, I haven't enabled mobs, yet, I like to get to the physics of the game, and thus far, it takes too long to get where I'm at, now, that would change if I restart, but.. \n\nI'll wait and see how they continue to adjust the game and see if they make it more polished as they go along or not, for now, I have to give this a thumbs down, until they give more updates.",

First off before anything else, the controls make absolutely no sense and drive you crazy. You can rebind them for keyboard, but not for controller. Secondly, the mouse/joystick sensitivity is HORRIBLE and even when adjusted, its crap. The game is gorgeous from my really really short interaction, however I had to drop it in minutes because the controls and sensitivity make no sense. There is no shift transfer for items, jumping with a controller is for some reason clicking with the left joystick and interaction control is the right joystick instead of the left while in a menu, the interaction button on keyboard is by default \"F\" along with some other controls being goofy, and going even further, you are literally just dropped into this world with ABSOLUTELY no direction. With some serious tweaks including THE OPTION TO REPORT ISSUES OR SUGGEST IN-GAME, I would love to revisit this game and give a better review. Till then, I can not recommend it.",

But.\nI also wanted to hunt all of does achievements, I saw that there were over 100.\nso I was really hype to fight for it, but after learn it was not working, last main version is almost a year ago now.\nsome devs are mostly likely working on a testing build but still main game has not even just got fix patch.\nnothing for 11 months.\n\nBecauseo of does no-working achievements I will not recommend it.\nbasic false advertising, i was stupid and waited to long before playing and testing.\nso my refund window was out, but yeah that's on me.\nHoped the would fix does things, but for me it kinda looks like a dead game on terms of updates.\n\nPure gameplay is very close to stranded so that's kinda nice.\na bit more diving but it's in the name os it's fine.",

I -HATE- this mechanic in games.\nThink about it, you died somewhere.... now you need to go back there, without all your stuff, to loot a container, while the things that killed you are still there. Deeply exhausting.\n\nOther than this, the game is okay... there's durability, which I also wish I could turn off, because quite frankly it's just kinda boring to have to keep repairing things. The thirst and hunger, even when turned to low, are pretty wild. Eat 5 crabs in one day? That's enough to fill you up in real life, hell, in real life, that's too much food.... In game however, no. This does barely anything.\nWater at least gets sated fairly quickly.\n\nBuilding is pretty good, You can build fantastic bases. There's a lot of decorations and I definitely made my house too small. But still, my rubber ducks were happy on their bed.\nYou can plant a bunch of trees to get wood, or just go exploring for wood. I did plant food, but got mad with the game before it gave me anything. And I discovered you can eat raw meat just fine.\n\nThe combat is abysmal.... Enemies will snipe you from miles away, with shockingly good accuracy. I had it on easy.... It's possible that I just suck at it... hell, I definitely do... But when you're swimming up to an island, and they're using guns to shoot you, there's not a lot you can do... And then you have to get back to your stuff when you die... They camp your corpse. This is why I won't bother playing the game again, because quite frankly, this just kills the game for me. \n\nMaybe you'll like the game more than I did, but I cannot recommend it, because quite frankly, I didn't enjoy my time. The base building is good, so if you want to tough out the rest of the game just to build a metropolis, I wouldn't blame you.\n\nRegardless of whether or not you found my review helpful, I hope you have a lovely day. <3",

Granted, this is Early Access, and I'm fine with that, but, in that same breath, there are things that should be a little more polished than they are. Crafting for instance is lacking, in a lot of areas, tell me why I have to by the 'Brick Embryos' only way to get them is through a purchase. You'll let me find black powder, dry at that, and in mass, but can't make a simple brick to build a decent wall. Yeah, not cool. \n\nTurning raw ore (Copper, Iron) into ingots.. time consuming, or space waste, your call. You need a LOT of room and a ton of wood to pull off a rapid change from raw ore to ingots, because you can only do 1 at a time per furnace. No way to stack and be able to walk away from it and let it do its thing. Not really cool with that.\n\nNow, I haven't enabled mobs, yet, I like to get to the physics of the game, and thus far, it takes too long to get where I'm at, now, that would change if I restart, but.. \n\nI'll wait and see how they continue to adjust the game and see if they make it more polished as they go along or not, for now, I have to give this a thumbs down, until they give more updates.",

First off before anything else, the controls make absolutely no sense and drive you crazy. You can rebind them for keyboard, but not for controller. Secondly, the mouse/joystick sensitivity is HORRIBLE and even when adjusted, its crap. The game is gorgeous from my really really short interaction, however I had to drop it in minutes because the controls and sensitivity make no sense. There is no shift transfer for items, jumping with a controller is for some reason clicking with the left joystick and interaction control is the right joystick instead of the left while in a menu, the interaction button on keyboard is by default \"F\" along with some other controls being goofy, and going even further, you are literally just dropped into this world with ABSOLUTELY no direction. With some serious tweaks including THE OPTION TO REPORT ISSUES OR SUGGEST IN-GAME, I would love to revisit this game and give a better review. Till then, I can not recommend it.",

Instead of adding more and more boats, their main focus should be on creating more islands, adjusting hit boxes, and god forbid, some form of end game as there currently is not one.  Once you take over the islands, which is not hard by any means, the game just becomes grinding and shooing away the random attack on your base by NPC's that make Gomer Pyle look like a navy seal.\nThose who enjoy creating cool decorated bases might find this enjoyable, but I personally think the code making your base look pretty could be VERY well spent in other areas of the game.",

There's no sneak on enemies unless you're really far away and they all know where you are no matter what happens. \n\nItems made in the menu or inventory items don't show up unless you exit the inventory. The organization button doesn't make much sense with sorting. \n\nThe button placements on the controller are rough, I don't know how else to describe it as other than being the exact opposite of what the average gamer is used too. There's not enough buttons on the controller so you have to use a mouse and keyboard with or stand alone. \n\nThe game is big, neat idea but empty and boring.

And after you reach ores, you're in for even more hassle.

During first few hours, everything was fine, exploring the world crafting basic stuff. \n\nThe problems stared to show after more time in the game. The gameplay becomes repetitve very quickly – arrive at an island, fight NPCs, and thats where the frustration begins. NPC acts like they have aimbot and at the same time wallhack. They can shoot you throught objects. Enemy with a simple pistol call fire a full voley of bullets at the player without any pause (till he reloads), which feels unfair and frustrating. When you arrive at the any island the enemies knows right away where are you and start shooting full blast, throwing grenades etc..  \nAlso the achievments doesnt work, but it didnt concern me.\n\nI personally ragequit the game, because i didnt see any point why to continue playing.

This blog points players with instructions on how to load the test beta branch in Steam for sunkenlands along with information about the updates for Public Test Branch which are dated 2024.  Also to subscribe for future updates.\r\n\r\nWhile I continue to think Sunkenlands is a clunky good game with lots of potential.  A diamond in the rough.

The core gameplay loop involves you scavenging and raiding enemy bases, which in theory could be fun if executed properly. It is not executed properly. The gameplay alone feels clunky, which is not a turn off right away. The real issue presents itself in combat with enemy human AI. This is core to the gameplay loop in Sunkenland, and you will fight enemy AI whether you like it or not to progress. The combat is not fun, it feels clunky and not finished. The AI shoot at you through walls, they move in odd ways, they face away from you in combat. It just needs a lot of work, and for something that is core to the game you would think they would want to refine it a little better. \n\nThrough my ranting, overall I do not recommend this game. It needs time and work, and I don't mean to put the developers down, I simply wish to share constructive criticism.
