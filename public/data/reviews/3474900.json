But this is my review on it as a basic user, Idk how to even code or make any of this and I explored only of what I understood in the main menu.\n\nFirstly it feels like its way too unoptimised, when loading an gif it takes a bit and feels like its going to crash.\nThe start up has a massive popup that you cannot minimise on your screen.\nThe settings for gifs don't save, for example when I had 2 gifs from workshop loaded they had different speeds so I had to lower the frames for ones that are faster, but when you want to load in another gif you need to once again change it to match.\n\nImprovements that I think could be made.\n- Optimization of the software so it doesn't want to feel like freezing or its going to crash\n- The splash screen when loading show be able to be minimized or make it small in a corner\n- Allow the changes made to gifs like size or speed be saved to each one (could also add like scrolls of buttons)\n- From what I found you can only spawn primary and then dupes, it would be better if there were like drop down folders that have slots for each gif so it'd be possible to modify each one without interacting with other gifs.\n\nThis is just my personal thoughts on software, I like what it is but at the moment it's not really worth getting, I will be refunding it for now and keep my eye on it just in case it becomes an abandonded project willingly or not. If it does improve in the future an edit will be made, I will leave this till around the same time next year or if big changes have been made addressing the issues.",
