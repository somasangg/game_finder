Report system is not the best and customer support is not helpful. \r\n\r\n\r\n[h3] Recommendations for the developer team [/h3]\r\n\r\n[b] Community [/b] \r\nThe game content is very good , slow but very good enjoyable and well suited for such game. The rules and system of the that is connected with community. It needs balance and the main interest is mixed which means the Audience are looking for something compatitive but also with rules that apply for everyone. \r\n\r\n[b] Reporting / Violations / EULA [/b] \r\nThe game has a lack of strict rules which will limit player abuse with psychology and verbal abuse to players such as : sexism , racism , body image , cheating , toxic behaviour. Reporting system in-game is broke up to the point players  need to report manually from discord server or VK ( russian facebook) support mail .  The problem comes from the mass reports from players which some are just not actual reports and some are reports of real cheaters in the game. \r\n\r\n-  Filtering the reports dynamically.  ID tracing technology which can identifies the violator. \r\n-  Discord Rules with moderators and stuff \r\n-  Updated Guidelines which will support everybody ( race , beliefs , anything) \r\n\r\nI recommend it to try the game out but it lacks of rules that protect players with different interests in the game.",

This function was very useful, and although it didn't appear in the control settings menu, it was a default game action.\nCurrently, this function seems to be inoperative. When I press the X key, nothing happens.\nI would like to know if this functionality has been intentionally removed in a recent update, if it has been reassigned to another key, or if this is an unintentional error (bug). I would greatly appreciate any clarification you can provide on this.\nThank you very much for your attention.\nBest regards.",

Just like Fallen Angel: Hell Survival proved that even a myth and magic setting works with this genre.  They don’t always have to be about forests and zombies. \n \nThe world is ok and atmospheric.  The graphics are ok, but the character models and animations are a bit janky. \n\nThe user interface is good and easy to get used to. \n\nStarting out is a bit perplexing, especially with the initial panic of how to keep fed and watered.  It really sucks and doesn’t make sense that you can’t sell raw chicken meat and eggs to the barman, but he haply accepts raw rat meat. Hmph??  You’d think he would want it to cook the chicken and sell on, but no.  This would be a nice little thing to be able to do, especially early game to help afford to keep fed and watered easier.  \n\nThe quick select number keys to change weapons didn’t work for me half the time.  \n\nThe combat seems to be very hit and miss and highly effected by lag spikes.  There was one time I just could not hit a rat at all, but it had no issues attacking and killing me.  I don’t know if that was lag or a bug, but it was a huge put off.  Could be a netcode issue.  Having read some other negative reviews it looks others have had similar issues, so could be a netcode issue and my ping was decent.  I certainly don’t have issues with all multiplayer games, especially when the ping seems to be ok.  I would like to suggest to the devs to create an offline single player option.  Some of us prefer playing these games solo anyway. \n\nThe quests are your typical dull fetch quests you get in MMORPG’s.  So if you like that sort of thing, you may like this, but not me.  I’d rather have no quests at all and just sandbox it, like in Minecraft and Fallen Angel: Hell Survival.  \n\nI think this game needs a lot of work.  Maybe I will return to it at a later date and see how it’s going, since it’s in early access, there’s a chance it could improve greatly over time.   I can see this having the potential to be better than 7 Days to Die, which btw imo has only gotten worse over the years.  All the devs need to do is maybe get the netcode fixed or just give up and make it singleplayer and improve the combat and I would probably already prefer it.",

I would have been really mad if I had spent money on this.",
