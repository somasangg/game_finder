      "review": "I would like to offer the following observations and suggestions, hoping they can serve as a reference for future optimizations:\n\nI. Regarding the use of art assets (a truly regrettable aspect)\n\nI noticed that many high-quality art assets in the game are not being fully utilized, which I find regrettable.\n\nThe display time for hit-and-run illustrations is too short: Each character has a beautifully drawn illustration when attacked, but these are displayed on the field for less than a second, making them difficult for players to see clearly.\n\nMonster illustrations have low utilization: You have drawn exquisite illustrations for each Boss and monster, but these illustrations can only be fully viewed when clicking on the \"Encyclopedia.\" In actual combat, monster attacks are displayed as small icons. Suggestion: It is hoped that these existing art assets can be better displayed in combat, allowing players to directly experience the art team's hard work, rather than just being hidden in the encyclopedia.\n\nII. The combat pacing issue that seriously affects the experience\n\nThis is currently the most detrimental aspect to my playability: the turns occupied by monsters are far too long.\n\nIn the late game, there are often more than 10 monsters, and players must wait for them to roll the dice, move, and attack one by one, taking about one second each.\n\nIn multiplayer mode, all players must watch other players \"watch monster animations,\" resulting in two-thirds of the game time being spent waiting (commonly known as \"garbage time\"). Actual gameplay time is very limited, making it extremely tiring. An average game lasting over an hour and a half is simply outrageous.\n\nIII. Specific Improvement Proposal: Synchronizing Enemy Turns\nTo address the aforementioned pacing issue, I propose separating the turn mechanics of \"minions\" and \"bosses.\"\n\nMinion Turn Synchronization: All minions complete their actions simultaneously within the same turn.\n\nFour-Panel Screen Display: During a minion's turn, the screen can be divided into four panels (or other division methods corresponding to the number of players), displaying the animation of each player being attacked by a minion. This preserves the visual presentation of the animations while significantly reducing waiting time, allowing everyone to complete a minion turn as quickly as possible. The boss can maintain independent actions to highlight its importance.\n\nIV. Other Interface and Localization Issues\n\nThe most significant factor affecting my willingness to play is the excessively long turn time taken up by monsters.\n\nThe card description font is too small: While you might get used to it after playing for a while, it's not user-friendly for new players or those who struggle with reading.\n\nThe Traditional Chinese localization is incomplete: The current Traditional Chinese version still contains many Simplified Chinese characters. These details may seem minor, but they accumulate over time and affect the game's overall refinement and reputation.\n\nThank you again for developing this game; I sincerely hope it continues to improve.\n================(中文)================\n我想提出以下幾點觀察與建議，希望能作為未來優化的參考：\n\n一、 關於美術資源的運用（覺得非常可惜的部分）\n我注意到遊戲中有許多高品質的美術資源未能被充分利用，這點讓我覺得很可惜。\n\n受擊立繪展示時間過短：每一個角色在被攻擊時都有專屬繪製的精美立繪，但它們在場上顯示的時間甚至不到一秒，玩家很難看清楚。\n\n怪物立繪利用率低：你們為每一個 Boss 和怪物都繪製了精緻的圖案，但這些圖卻只有在點擊「圖鑑」時才能完整欣賞。在實際戰鬥中，怪物攻擊時顯示的卻是一般的小圖標。 建議：希望能在戰鬥中更好地展示這些既有的美術資源，讓玩家能更直接地感受到美術團隊的心血，而不僅僅是藏在圖鑑裡。\n\n二、 嚴重影響體驗的戰鬥節奏問題\n這是目前最影響我遊玩意願的一點：怪物佔用的回合時間實在太長了。\n\n遊戲後期往往有 10 隻以上的怪物，玩家必須等待它們一隻接一隻地花費約 1 秒鐘骰骰子、移動、攻擊。\n\n在多人遊玩時，所有玩家都必須看著其他玩家「看怪物跑動畫」，這導致遊戲有三分之二的時間都是在等待中度過（俗稱垃圾時間），實際操作時間非常少，非常累人，平均一次遊戲要打超過一個半小時實在太誇張。\n\n三、 具體改善提案：同步化敵方回合\n針對上述節奏問題，我有一個提案：將「小怪」與「Boss」的回合機制分開處理。\n\n小怪回合同步化：所有小怪在同一回合內同時完成動作。\n\n四格畫面呈現：在小怪動作回合，畫面可以分割為四格（或其他對應玩家數量的分割方式），分別顯示每位玩家當下被小怪攻擊的動畫。 這樣既能保留美術動畫的展示，又能大幅縮短等待時間，讓所有人以最快速度度過小怪回合。Boss 則可以維持單獨行動，以凸顯其重要性。\n\n四、 其他介面與在地化問題\n是目前最影響我遊玩意願的一點：怪物佔用的回合時間實在太長了。\n\n卡牌敘述字體過小：雖然玩久了會習慣，但對新玩家或閱讀較吃力的玩家來說並不友善。\n\n繁體中文在地化不完整：目前的繁體中文版本中，仍夾雜許多簡體字。這些細節雖然微小，但長期累積下來會影響遊戲的精緻度與評價。\n\n再次感謝你們開發了這款遊戲，真心希望它能越來越好。",

Ich hab Astral Party nur aus Neugier installiert – und jetzt sitze ich hier, mit drei Freunden, einer kaputten Freundschaft und 200 Stunden Spielzeit später.\nDas Ding ist purer, animierter Wahnsinn.\nWenn Mario Party und ein Anime-Gacha ein Kind bekommen hätten, dann wär’s genau das hier – nur dass das Kind hyperaktiv, stylish und irgendwie süchtig machend ist.\n\n\n\n\nDer Vibe:\n\nDu würfelst, sammelst Münzen, benutzt Karten, zerstörst Freundschaften – klassische Partylogik, aber mit Anime-Charakteren, die zu gut aussehen, um sie anzugreifen (was dich natürlich nicht davon abhält).\nUnd dann diese Animationen.\nIch schwöre, manche Charaktere haben mehr Ausdruck als 90 % meiner Steam-Bibliothek.\n\nDie Designs sind Zucker, die Stimmen perfekt drüber, und das UI hat diesen cleanen, knalligen Look, der dir permanent schreit:\n👉 “Ja, du bist in einem Anime-Chaos-Brettspiel – genieß es!”\n\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nWürfeln, sabotieren, lachen, weinen.\n\nKarten ziehen, um Gegner aus dem Leben zu kicken oder dir selbst das Karma zu ruinieren.\n\nUnd das Beste: F2P-freundlich. Du musst nicht gleich dein Konto opfern, um Spaß zu haben.\n\n\nJede Runde läuft komplett anders – einer rennt mit 0 Münzen durchs Brett, der andere explodiert einfach aus Prinzip, und dann kommt der Dritte, würfelt ’ne 1, trifft dich und gewinnt alles.\nPure Emotionen. Pure Ungerechtigkeit. Pure Unterhaltung.\n\n\nMit Freunden:\n\nIch sag’s so:\nAstral Party ist kein Spiel, um Freundschaften zu festigen.\nEs ist ein Spiel, um herauszufinden, wer deine echten Freunde sind, wenn du ihnen zum dritten Mal in Folge ihre Sterne klaust.\nPerfekt für Discord-Abende, Screaming-Sessions oder den “Warum sind wir eigentlich befreundet?”-Moment um 3 Uhr morgens.\n\nDevs und DLC:\n\nDie Devs (STAR ENGINE PROJECT) sind tatsächlich aktiv, hören auf Feedback, patchen Bugs, bringen neue Inhalte – du merkst, da steckt Liebe drin.\nUnd die DLCs? Nicht Pay-to-Win, sondern Pay-to-Look-Fancy.\nIch bin dafür.\n\n\nEinziger Kritikpunkt:\n\nManchmal dauern die Matches etwas lange – aber ganz ehrlich, wenn du mit der richtigen Crew zockst, willst du eh nicht, dass es endet.\n(Und wenn du solo spielst… mach dich auf viel inneres Weinen gefasst.)",

      "review": "This is a fun, casual party game featuring anime characters — kind of like Mario Party, but with cards, unique character abilities, and a bit of strategy. It can feel a little overwhelming at first since every character has its own mechanics, but after a few rounds (or a quick look at the wiki), it starts to make sense.\r\n\r\nThere’s a tutorial mode with bots, which I recommend if you're just starting out. Once you get the hang of the abilities and cards, the game becomes pretty relaxed. It’s not too stressful, but you do need to think a few moves ahead.\r\n\r\nThe character roster is diverse, and you're likely to find someone who fits your playstyle. Some characters definitely feel stronger or easier to use than others, and not everyone will enjoy every character — but that’s part of the fun. I like rotating through all of them to keep things interesting.\r\n\r\nThere are two main modes: PvP and PvE (co-op). PvP is... fine. It’s definitely more enjoyable with friends. Playing with randoms can be frustrating, and if your username isn’t in Chinese, you might notice you get targeted more often — which can really take the fun out of it. I’d only recommend PvP if you’re going in with a group.\r\n\r\nPvE is where the game shines. Co-op sessions can be really fun and engaging — when they go well. The downside is that some teammates go AFK or rage-quit when things aren’t going their way. As someone who mostly plays solo, that’s a big downside. It wastes time, especially when you’re just trying to complete daily missions.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of dailies, the tasks are pretty low-effort. One session per day is usually enough. Depending on your team and how things play out, matches can take anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour.\r\nPerformance-wise, the game is lightweight and runs smoothly. You can resize the window freely, which is great if you like to multitask or just want to play casually in the background.\r\n\r\nNow, yes — there is a gacha mechanic. You won’t have access to every character from the start. But in my experience, the gacha rates are pretty generous. I was able to unlock most of the characters quickly (within a week of playing daily) just by completing missions and dailies. Of course, that’s just my experience, so take it with a grain of salt.\r\n\r\nOne more thing to note: the game also has limited-time offers for skins and certain collaborative characters. Once these offers expire, those items are gone for good. Keep that in mind if you’re interested — it’s a gacha game after all.\r\n\r\nOh, and people seem to be comparing this to 100% Orange Juice, which I can’t say much about since I don’t play 100% Orange Juice. 😭\r\n\r\nOverall, if you’re into free anime aesthetics, card-based gameplay, and casual co-op, this is a fun, low-pressure game that’s easy to pick up and gradually rewarding as you get more familiar with the mechanics. Just be aware of the gacha.\r\n\r\nI still play this game for now, but in the future, I'll probably drop it when I lose interest or it gets too much content and a heavy load.",

Here comes the big list (Disclaimer: I barely played the PvP mode which is mostly dead, this review solely focuses on PvE mode which is where playerbase is actually active): \nNumber 1: No unlockable cards, all non-character-specific cards are already drawable without any need to unlock them through gacha similar to 100OJ. \nNumber 2: Really fun gameplay with a cool level-up system with huge variety of enchantments which make really dope synergies both together AND with character specific skills. Getting the right build of encahntments can be a gamechanger, making the game feel a bit rogue-like-ish. \nNumber 3: REALLY cool, cute and quirky aesthetics and art-style plus a SUPER good OST which remind me to that of DohnaDohna. \nNumber 4: Really well designed characters with both a full body art and in-game chibi art (unlike OJ which only has the chibi) \nNumber 5: SUPER F2P friendly; out of all the gacha games I currently play (Riichi City, Mahjong Soul and ZZZ) this one is by far more generous with its gacha. I already pulled 4 characters which one of them I had an eye for (Al) and I also unlocked Jill the crossover character after a few days of daily login. No other games would give you a CROSSOVER character THIS easily for simply playing the game (while OJ is also really generous with its rewards, keep in mind that OJ is still a paid game while this one is F2P) \nNumber 6: THE EMOTES MAN! OMG The emotes are so goddamn funny! They are mostly refrences to famous anime frames or memes in general. And they work great. Everyone should embrace the memes. \nNumber 7: Did I mention how cool the enchantment synergies are?\n\nNow for the downsides: \nNumber 1: Seemingly smaller playerbase which could be the result of some brain-dead wokies review bombing the game (Explains why the game is tagged as \"hentai\" while it clearly isn't lol) The PvE (co-op) mode is always active but almost no-one plays the PvP mode. Which isn't that much of an issue, since I feel like PvE is just more fun than PvP and even if you really wanted to play PvP, you could just do it with your friends (Personally I think PvE is just a lot more fun but it's a matter of taste) As you can say, this isn't that much of a con since it's a community issue rather than a problem with the game itself.\n......aaand that's about it for all the real cons.\n\nMixed features: This section is for the features that could be interpretated as both a downside and an upside depending on how you look at it. \nNumber 1: There is no free chat in this game like OJ. You can only send emojis and some default messages like \"thank you\" or \"heal me please\". While it removes the ability to properly communicate with team members during matches and set strategy, I feel like it makes the environment FAR more pure and less toxic than OJ so people can never show their ugly side and every seem pure as the anime girls they are playing as which is really heartwarming. And tbf, I don't think most players need advice on how to play the game as it's both easy to understand and bosses are also a piece of cake as long as there is one player who accumulated enough damage to take it down. So imo, the limit of chatting is more of an upside than a downside.\nNumber 2: Gameplay kind of slow. Why is it mixed? Because with slow gameplay, you can actually relax and read the description of every card and enchantment and calmly make good decisions, making the game super newbie friendly compared to OJ. And usually no one rushes you unless you take extra long time to finish your turn which even if you do, game starts to shorten your timer for the next turn. This one, is also more of an upside in my opinion.\n\nOverall, a 10/10 hella fun game to play, either with randoms or friends. I mostly play with randoms and still have tons of fun. Admittedly I haven't even opened 100%OJ since I started playing this game. Not to say OJ is bad, it's just that this game does it much better. So yeah, highly recommend this one to anyone looking for something similar to 100% Orange Juice.",

You have some many rounds to finish the objectives and there is special rounds that have effects (Has a monsters face instead of a number, which you can click to read what event will occur) The bosses are unique to the stages as well.

      "review": "I would like to offer the following observations and suggestions, hoping they can serve as a reference for future optimizations:\n\nI. Regarding the use of art assets (a truly regrettable aspect)\n\nI noticed that many high-quality art assets in the game are not being fully utilized, which I find regrettable.\n\nThe display time for hit-and-run illustrations is too short: Each character has a beautifully drawn illustration when attacked, but these are displayed on the field for less than a second, making them difficult for players to see clearly.\n\nMonster illustrations have low utilization: You have drawn exquisite illustrations for each Boss and monster, but these illustrations can only be fully viewed when clicking on the \"Encyclopedia.\" In actual combat, monster attacks are displayed as small icons. Suggestion: It is hoped that these existing art assets can be better displayed in combat, allowing players to directly experience the art team's hard work, rather than just being hidden in the encyclopedia.\n\nII. The combat pacing issue that seriously affects the experience\n\nThis is currently the most detrimental aspect to my playability: the turns occupied by monsters are far too long.\n\nIn the late game, there are often more than 10 monsters, and players must wait for them to roll the dice, move, and attack one by one, taking about one second each.\n\nIn multiplayer mode, all players must watch other players \"watch monster animations,\" resulting in two-thirds of the game time being spent waiting (commonly known as \"garbage time\"). Actual gameplay time is very limited, making it extremely tiring. An average game lasting over an hour and a half is simply outrageous.\n\nIII. Specific Improvement Proposal: Synchronizing Enemy Turns\nTo address the aforementioned pacing issue, I propose separating the turn mechanics of \"minions\" and \"bosses.\"\n\nMinion Turn Synchronization: All minions complete their actions simultaneously within the same turn.\n\nFour-Panel Screen Display: During a minion's turn, the screen can be divided into four panels (or other division methods corresponding to the number of players), displaying the animation of each player being attacked by a minion. This preserves the visual presentation of the animations while significantly reducing waiting time, allowing everyone to complete a minion turn as quickly as possible. The boss can maintain independent actions to highlight its importance.\n\nIV. Other Interface and Localization Issues\n\nThe most significant factor affecting my willingness to play is the excessively long turn time taken up by monsters.\n\nThe card description font is too small: While you might get used to it after playing for a while, it's not user-friendly for new players or those who struggle with reading.\n\nThe Traditional Chinese localization is incomplete: The current Traditional Chinese version still contains many Simplified Chinese characters. These details may seem minor, but they accumulate over time and affect the game's overall refinement and reputation.\n\nThank you again for developing this game; I sincerely hope it continues to improve.\n================(中文)================\n我想提出以下幾點觀察與建議，希望能作為未來優化的參考：\n\n一、 關於美術資源的運用（覺得非常可惜的部分）\n我注意到遊戲中有許多高品質的美術資源未能被充分利用，這點讓我覺得很可惜。\n\n受擊立繪展示時間過短：每一個角色在被攻擊時都有專屬繪製的精美立繪，但它們在場上顯示的時間甚至不到一秒，玩家很難看清楚。\n\n怪物立繪利用率低：你們為每一個 Boss 和怪物都繪製了精緻的圖案，但這些圖卻只有在點擊「圖鑑」時才能完整欣賞。在實際戰鬥中，怪物攻擊時顯示的卻是一般的小圖標。 建議：希望能在戰鬥中更好地展示這些既有的美術資源，讓玩家能更直接地感受到美術團隊的心血，而不僅僅是藏在圖鑑裡。\n\n二、 嚴重影響體驗的戰鬥節奏問題\n這是目前最影響我遊玩意願的一點：怪物佔用的回合時間實在太長了。\n\n遊戲後期往往有 10 隻以上的怪物，玩家必須等待它們一隻接一隻地花費約 1 秒鐘骰骰子、移動、攻擊。\n\n在多人遊玩時，所有玩家都必須看著其他玩家「看怪物跑動畫」，這導致遊戲有三分之二的時間都是在等待中度過（俗稱垃圾時間），實際操作時間非常少，非常累人，平均一次遊戲要打超過一個半小時實在太誇張。\n\n三、 具體改善提案：同步化敵方回合\n針對上述節奏問題，我有一個提案：將「小怪」與「Boss」的回合機制分開處理。\n\n小怪回合同步化：所有小怪在同一回合內同時完成動作。\n\n四格畫面呈現：在小怪動作回合，畫面可以分割為四格（或其他對應玩家數量的分割方式），分別顯示每位玩家當下被小怪攻擊的動畫。 這樣既能保留美術動畫的展示，又能大幅縮短等待時間，讓所有人以最快速度度過小怪回合。Boss 則可以維持單獨行動，以凸顯其重要性。\n\n四、 其他介面與在地化問題\n是目前最影響我遊玩意願的一點：怪物佔用的回合時間實在太長了。\n\n卡牌敘述字體過小：雖然玩久了會習慣，但對新玩家或閱讀較吃力的玩家來說並不友善。\n\n繁體中文在地化不完整：目前的繁體中文版本中，仍夾雜許多簡體字。這些細節雖然微小，但長期累積下來會影響遊戲的精緻度與評價。\n\n再次感謝你們開發了這款遊戲，真心希望它能越來越好。",

Ich hab Astral Party nur aus Neugier installiert – und jetzt sitze ich hier, mit drei Freunden, einer kaputten Freundschaft und 200 Stunden Spielzeit später.\nDas Ding ist purer, animierter Wahnsinn.\nWenn Mario Party und ein Anime-Gacha ein Kind bekommen hätten, dann wär’s genau das hier – nur dass das Kind hyperaktiv, stylish und irgendwie süchtig machend ist.\n\n\n\n\nDer Vibe:\n\nDu würfelst, sammelst Münzen, benutzt Karten, zerstörst Freundschaften – klassische Partylogik, aber mit Anime-Charakteren, die zu gut aussehen, um sie anzugreifen (was dich natürlich nicht davon abhält).\nUnd dann diese Animationen.\nIch schwöre, manche Charaktere haben mehr Ausdruck als 90 % meiner Steam-Bibliothek.\n\nDie Designs sind Zucker, die Stimmen perfekt drüber, und das UI hat diesen cleanen, knalligen Look, der dir permanent schreit:\n👉 “Ja, du bist in einem Anime-Chaos-Brettspiel – genieß es!”\n\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nWürfeln, sabotieren, lachen, weinen.\n\nKarten ziehen, um Gegner aus dem Leben zu kicken oder dir selbst das Karma zu ruinieren.\n\nUnd das Beste: F2P-freundlich. Du musst nicht gleich dein Konto opfern, um Spaß zu haben.\n\n\nJede Runde läuft komplett anders – einer rennt mit 0 Münzen durchs Brett, der andere explodiert einfach aus Prinzip, und dann kommt der Dritte, würfelt ’ne 1, trifft dich und gewinnt alles.\nPure Emotionen. Pure Ungerechtigkeit. Pure Unterhaltung.\n\n\nMit Freunden:\n\nIch sag’s so:\nAstral Party ist kein Spiel, um Freundschaften zu festigen.\nEs ist ein Spiel, um herauszufinden, wer deine echten Freunde sind, wenn du ihnen zum dritten Mal in Folge ihre Sterne klaust.\nPerfekt für Discord-Abende, Screaming-Sessions oder den “Warum sind wir eigentlich befreundet?”-Moment um 3 Uhr morgens.\n\nDevs und DLC:\n\nDie Devs (STAR ENGINE PROJECT) sind tatsächlich aktiv, hören auf Feedback, patchen Bugs, bringen neue Inhalte – du merkst, da steckt Liebe drin.\nUnd die DLCs? Nicht Pay-to-Win, sondern Pay-to-Look-Fancy.\nIch bin dafür.\n\n\nEinziger Kritikpunkt:\n\nManchmal dauern die Matches etwas lange – aber ganz ehrlich, wenn du mit der richtigen Crew zockst, willst du eh nicht, dass es endet.\n(Und wenn du solo spielst… mach dich auf viel inneres Weinen gefasst.)",

      "review": "This is a fun, casual party game featuring anime characters — kind of like Mario Party, but with cards, unique character abilities, and a bit of strategy. It can feel a little overwhelming at first since every character has its own mechanics, but after a few rounds (or a quick look at the wiki), it starts to make sense.\r\n\r\nThere’s a tutorial mode with bots, which I recommend if you're just starting out. Once you get the hang of the abilities and cards, the game becomes pretty relaxed. It’s not too stressful, but you do need to think a few moves ahead.\r\n\r\nThe character roster is diverse, and you're likely to find someone who fits your playstyle. Some characters definitely feel stronger or easier to use than others, and not everyone will enjoy every character — but that’s part of the fun. I like rotating through all of them to keep things interesting.\r\n\r\nThere are two main modes: PvP and PvE (co-op). PvP is... fine. It’s definitely more enjoyable with friends. Playing with randoms can be frustrating, and if your username isn’t in Chinese, you might notice you get targeted more often — which can really take the fun out of it. I’d only recommend PvP if you’re going in with a group.\r\n\r\nPvE is where the game shines. Co-op sessions can be really fun and engaging — when they go well. The downside is that some teammates go AFK or rage-quit when things aren’t going their way. As someone who mostly plays solo, that’s a big downside. It wastes time, especially when you’re just trying to complete daily missions.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of dailies, the tasks are pretty low-effort. One session per day is usually enough. Depending on your team and how things play out, matches can take anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour.\r\nPerformance-wise, the game is lightweight and runs smoothly. You can resize the window freely, which is great if you like to multitask or just want to play casually in the background.\r\n\r\nNow, yes — there is a gacha mechanic. You won’t have access to every character from the start. But in my experience, the gacha rates are pretty generous. I was able to unlock most of the characters quickly (within a week of playing daily) just by completing missions and dailies. Of course, that’s just my experience, so take it with a grain of salt.\r\n\r\nOne more thing to note: the game also has limited-time offers for skins and certain collaborative characters. Once these offers expire, those items are gone for good. Keep that in mind if you’re interested — it’s a gacha game after all.\r\n\r\nOh, and people seem to be comparing this to 100% Orange Juice, which I can’t say much about since I don’t play 100% Orange Juice. 😭\r\n\r\nOverall, if you’re into free anime aesthetics, card-based gameplay, and casual co-op, this is a fun, low-pressure game that’s easy to pick up and gradually rewarding as you get more familiar with the mechanics. Just be aware of the gacha.\r\n\r\nI still play this game for now, but in the future, I'll probably drop it when I lose interest or it gets too much content and a heavy load.",

      "review": "I was really excited for this game when it was announced, it seemed like a more modern version of 100% Orange Juice, the character designs are extremely appealing, and on top of that, there were hints that this would eventually release as a mobile game (I've always wanted a version of 100%OJ that could be played on the go).\n\nWhen the demo dropped, I was very underwhelmed, the game was clearly far from finished, there were a lot of translation bugs, things that are essential for card games like a card history are simply missing, and the UI is far from polished (some menus literally use default Unity UI elements, ffs), but, worst of all, there was no setting to adjust the game speed, I'll talk more about this later because it's very important for this kind of game, but the main point is, it didn't seem like a game that was supposed to launch a month later, heck, I'd even dare to say it needed at least a year of polish before being in a presentable state for an official launch,\n\nI thought to myself \"there is no way this demo represents the current stage of development of the game, it surely must have been compiled a few months ago\", and \"maybe they will collect feedback from the demo and most problems should be fixed by release\". Boy was I wrong.\n\nWhere do I start? Most of the game is exactly the same as the demo, the translation errors still remain, card history is still missing, the UI is still hot garbage, and the gameplay itself is still painfully slow, with no option to accelerate it. The only thing that changed between the demo and the official release was the inclusion of the gacha mechanic and other F2P elements.\n\nLet me start by saying I have no problem with the gacha mechanic itself, after all this is a F2P game, it must make money somehow, although I can't avoid thinking it's kind of a cash grab since the game itself is crowdfunded on top of that, especially since the prices are outrageous: almost 15 USD for 10 rolls. You can only buy rolls with real currency btw, no option to use the in-game premium currency (which you can also buy with real money). Speaking of currencies, there are like SEVEN different in-game currencies, and the game makes almost 0 effort in trying to explain you what each one is for or how to get them, you'll have to figure that out by yourself.\n\nMost of the issues I just described are no big deal, because both the premium currency and the gacha rolls can be grinded by playing and completing missions, so as long as the gameplay is fun, everything is fine, right?\n\nThis is where I come back to the point I made about the game speed. The game is horribly slow, a single match can go for upwards of an hour, and you're forced to sit through long and slow movement animations, not to mention the laughably short background music that loops every 30 seconds, making you go insane. Playing this game, even if you're not grinding for characters or items, quickly becomes a chore. You feel like you're being held hostage by the game, and just want it to end as soon as possible, I've even gone as far as helping someone else win because I just wanted it to be over. This is really not an enjoyable experience for anyone involved.\n\nIf just playing the game for fun already feels like a chore, imagine trying to grind for characters or items, It would be literally torture. This game need a speed slider ASAP, I think this is the biggest issue the devs need to address, and it shouldn't take them too long considering they are using Unity, just change the global animation speed multiplier and you'll instantly make this a more enjoyable experience.\n\nThe devs should really aim for 15 minute matches if they want this game to succeed, ESPECIALLY if they plan to make this a mobile game. This is the kind of game you'll want to play in between work shifts, during short breaks or during your commute, having matches go on for longer than 15 minutes is simply unacceptable in those contexts, let alone 1 hour.\n\nI really can't recommend this game in its current state, even early access games are usually far more polished than this, this really feels like a prototype more than an official release. However, the core gameplay is really fun and I think this game as a lot of potential, so if/when the devs fix the issues described here (especially the speed, PLEASE), I'll change my review to match. Until then, I won't play or recommend this game.\n\nTL;DR: VERY unpolished game, matches are too long and feel like a chore, confusing gacha mechanics. Has potential if it fixes those issues, but overall it was released TOO early.",

I feel like they have a lot of building blocks for making a great game but it's not living up to its potential. The main gripe I have is with how unpolished the English UI is. There's spacing issues, obvious translation mistakes/oddities that hiring ONE fluent English speaker could iron out. I also don't like how you can't zoom the board out more, I had a hard time learning what's going on by playing and planning out was a bit harder as a result. I also had a hard time really understanding the combat system? I understood 100% orange juice's (a game which is impossible NOT to mention in a review for this game) combat system in a snap, but  this games' just didn't make sense. It feel like you roll a die then you get your attack buffs and then it triggers a third time where sometimes the attack goes up and sometimes doesn't? It's weird.\n\nStrangely the main game mode is PvE, seems like that's what all the events want you to play and most lobbies are open for that game mode. The game felt SO slow though. Compared to 100% Orange Juice the games felt like they took FOREVER, even though every action has a timer. I would take my turn then hop on my phone for a few minutes until it was my turn again. It was very slow paced.\n\nCan't speak on the monetization since these are mostly first impressions but I appreciate that characters can be unlocked through events and not just the gacha system. Of course, just selling the characters outright would be less predatory but welcome to 2025.\n\nThese are first impressions, I'm gonna stick out until I finish the VA11HALLA collab to give more insight but overall I wish the game was better than it is.",

      "review": "I was really excited for this game when it was announced, it seemed like a more modern version of 100% Orange Juice, the character designs are extremely appealing, and on top of that, there were hints that this would eventually release as a mobile game (I've always wanted a version of 100%OJ that could be played on the go).\n\nWhen the demo dropped, I was very underwhelmed, the game was clearly far from finished, there were a lot of translation bugs, things that are essential for card games like a card history are simply missing, and the UI is far from polished (some menus literally use default Unity UI elements, ffs), but, worst of all, there was no setting to adjust the game speed, I'll talk more about this later because it's very important for this kind of game, but the main point is, it didn't seem like a game that was supposed to launch a month later, heck, I'd even dare to say it needed at least a year of polish before being in a presentable state for an official launch,\n\nI thought to myself \"there is no way this demo represents the current stage of development of the game, it surely must have been compiled a few months ago\", and \"maybe they will collect feedback from the demo and most problems should be fixed by release\". Boy was I wrong.\n\nWhere do I start? Most of the game is exactly the same as the demo, the translation errors still remain, card history is still missing, the UI is still hot garbage, and the gameplay itself is still painfully slow, with no option to accelerate it. The only thing that changed between the demo and the official release was the inclusion of the gacha mechanic and other F2P elements.\n\nLet me start by saying I have no problem with the gacha mechanic itself, after all this is a F2P game, it must make money somehow, although I can't avoid thinking it's kind of a cash grab since the game itself is crowdfunded on top of that, especially since the prices are outrageous: almost 15 USD for 10 rolls. You can only buy rolls with real currency btw, no option to use the in-game premium currency (which you can also buy with real money). Speaking of currencies, there are like SEVEN different in-game currencies, and the game makes almost 0 effort in trying to explain you what each one is for or how to get them, you'll have to figure that out by yourself.\n\nMost of the issues I just described are no big deal, because both the premium currency and the gacha rolls can be grinded by playing and completing missions, so as long as the gameplay is fun, everything is fine, right?\n\nThis is where I come back to the point I made about the game speed. The game is horribly slow, a single match can go for upwards of an hour, and you're forced to sit through long and slow movement animations, not to mention the laughably short background music that loops every 30 seconds, making you go insane. Playing this game, even if you're not grinding for characters or items, quickly becomes a chore. You feel like you're being held hostage by the game, and just want it to end as soon as possible, I've even gone as far as helping someone else win because I just wanted it to be over. This is really not an enjoyable experience for anyone involved.\n\nIf just playing the game for fun already feels like a chore, imagine trying to grind for characters or items, It would be literally torture. This game need a speed slider ASAP, I think this is the biggest issue the devs need to address, and it shouldn't take them too long considering they are using Unity, just change the global animation speed multiplier and you'll instantly make this a more enjoyable experience.\n\nThe devs should really aim for 15 minute matches if they want this game to succeed, ESPECIALLY if they plan to make this a mobile game. This is the kind of game you'll want to play in between work shifts, during short breaks or during your commute, having matches go on for longer than 15 minutes is simply unacceptable in those contexts, let alone 1 hour.\n\nI really can't recommend this game in its current state, even early access games are usually far more polished than this, this really feels like a prototype more than an official release. However, the core gameplay is really fun and I think this game as a lot of potential, so if/when the devs fix the issues described here (especially the speed, PLEASE), I'll change my review to match. Until then, I won't play or recommend this game.\n\nTL;DR: VERY unpolished game, matches are too long and feel like a chore, confusing gacha mechanics. Has potential if it fixes those issues, but overall it was released TOO early.",

I feel like they have a lot of building blocks for making a great game but it's not living up to its potential. The main gripe I have is with how unpolished the English UI is. There's spacing issues, obvious translation mistakes/oddities that hiring ONE fluent English speaker could iron out. I also don't like how you can't zoom the board out more, I had a hard time learning what's going on by playing and planning out was a bit harder as a result. I also had a hard time really understanding the combat system? I understood 100% orange juice's (a game which is impossible NOT to mention in a review for this game) combat system in a snap, but  this games' just didn't make sense. It feel like you roll a die then you get your attack buffs and then it triggers a third time where sometimes the attack goes up and sometimes doesn't? It's weird.\n\nStrangely the main game mode is PvE, seems like that's what all the events want you to play and most lobbies are open for that game mode. The game felt SO slow though. Compared to 100% Orange Juice the games felt like they took FOREVER, even though every action has a timer. I would take my turn then hop on my phone for a few minutes until it was my turn again. It was very slow paced.\n\nCan't speak on the monetization since these are mostly first impressions but I appreciate that characters can be unlocked through events and not just the gacha system. Of course, just selling the characters outright would be less predatory but welcome to 2025.\n\nThese are first impressions, I'm gonna stick out until I finish the VA11HALLA collab to give more insight but overall I wish the game was better than it is.",

However, the core gameplay is really fun and I think this game as a lot of potential, so if/when the devs fix the issues described here (especially the speed, PLEASE), I'll change my review to match. Until then, I won't play or recommend this game.\n\nTL;DR: VERY unpolished game, matches are too long and feel like a chore, confusing gacha mechanics. Has potential if it fixes those issues, but overall it was released TOO early.",

      "review": "I hopped on to play a bit with the VA11HALLA collab and I was kinda disappointed. I feel like they have a lot of building blocks for making a great game but it's not living up to its potential. The main gripe I have is with how unpolished the English UI is. There's spacing issues, obvious translation mistakes/oddities that hiring ONE fluent English speaker could iron out. I also don't like how you can't zoom the board out more, I had a hard time learning what's going on by playing and planning out was a bit harder as a result. I also had a hard time really understanding the combat system? I understood 100% orange juice's (a game which is impossible NOT to mention in a review for this game) combat system in a snap, but  this games' just didn't make sense. It feel like you roll a die then you get your attack buffs and then it triggers a third time where sometimes the attack goes up and sometimes doesn't? It's weird.\n\nStrangely the main game mode is PvE, seems like that's what all the events want you to play and most lobbies are open for that game mode. The game felt SO slow though. Compared to 100% Orange Juice the games felt like they took FOREVER, even though every action has a timer. I would take my turn then hop on my phone for a few minutes until it was my turn again. It was very slow paced.\n\nCan't speak on the monetization since these are mostly first impressions but I appreciate that characters can be unlocked through events and not just the gacha system. Of course, just selling the characters outright would be less predatory but welcome to 2025.\n\nThese are first impressions, I'm gonna stick out until I finish the VA11HALLA collab to give more insight but overall I wish the game was better than it is.",

You had prices in USD for a skin, and last patch replaced this honest model with the good ol' gacha slop. \n\nSkin? 666 credits\nRecharge? 680 credits.\n\nScrew you.

The PvP was my favourite game mode because of how chaotic and political it can get, but the devs left behind PvP to focus on PvE because they realize people don't like \"minigames\" that's just glorified dice rolling. Even Mario Party had better PvP content than this.\r\n\r\nYou play the game for the PvE more. And if you don't like PvE, there's nothing here for you.\r\n\r\nThe only good thing about this game is artstyle and general art direction (AL best character)",

And a 6 on evade will always work (so at least you always have at least 1/6 chance to survive)",
