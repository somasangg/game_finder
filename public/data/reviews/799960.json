Dungeon, Raids, Farming, Sleepless Nights? Yes. Played this game for a few years from it's inception on multiple platforms/regions. Only thing is that this game has and is still very p2w with a lot of gambling/opening \"loot boxes\" (Mobile type practices), so if you are a parent be careful not to let your kids play this.",

      "review": "Despite their best and constant efforts to make the outdated beginning of the game meet their modern standards, the game is still pretty rough to get past the beginning of especially if you aren't totally sold on the deckbuilding or the basic concept of the game's world. The story of this game is actually REALLY good, unexpectedly so. The combat? It can get a little monotonous if you over-optimize the fun out of it, but... you control the buttons you press. Not a fan of buff + big aoe solving most fights? Then just don't do that unless you have a team of strangers relying on you to do that exact thing.\n\nThe graphics, acting, gameplay, all grow and improve as you play the game as this game released in 2008. You can look up spell animations and music from then and now and see the huge difference. (Music was always good, but it's taken on a notably different style and tone in recent years)\n\nWorth playing, but maybe find a friend to help you out who hasn't experienced it either. Someone too high level who's already played the game to death will tear through everything, but a friend who's just as fresh as you are will keep your questing interesting. Lots to do outside of main story quests, tons to collect... If you can get past your reservations about the childish nature of it's early game, you have a surprisingly mature story with complex rpg and deckbuilder mechanics that will keep you hooked. Subscriptions are cheaper than other mmo's per month and free to play weekends happen... sparsely, but they do happen. One usually lands around christmas, so it's not a bad time to try the game.",

Unfortunately a lot of the game is paywalled to a steep monthly subscription, but considering how much game there is I think its acceptable if you do it for maybe a month or two per year to scratch the itch this game gives. I'd still love to see them release all of Act 1 for free so newer players can actually get a grasp of the game.",

Zones, packs, cosmetics, mounts, houses—if it exists, someone has put it in a crown shop and given it 0.8% drop chance.\r\n* PvP balance is a spiritual experience where numbers don’t matter and trauma is the real rank.\r\n* Deck management at high level turns into “spreadsheet but with unicorns.” You WILL draw the wrong pip at the wrong time.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Peak Wizard101 Moments\r\n\r\n* Getting crit on by a random street mob and realizing the tutorial days are over.\r\n* Solo questing, misreading the dialogue, and chain-pulling three mobs because you walked two inches too far.\r\n* Spending an hour in housing preview just to buy the same old dorm room because you’re broke.\r\n* Coming back “just to see what’s new,” logging off 5 hours later from a world you didn’t know existed, with three new pets and no idea what the main quest is anymore.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n9/10\r\nKid-friendly art style, boomer MMO monetization, and genuinely great card combat wrapped into one dangerously nostalgic package.\r\n\r\nWould once again enroll in Ravenwood, defeat 14 gods between classes, and still get told to bring cyclops eye drops to some random NPC again.",

      "review": "Hello, all! Regardless of what the timer says, I’ve been playing Wizard101 since December 2008. It’s been a very long road and I still love the game to this day. So I’m here to leave a review for Wizard101 given a decade of playing. This is a membership game. Not free to play past Triton Avenue. Be wary.\r\n\r\nPROS\r\nGraphics (pre and post update)\r\nPersonally, I love the way the game looks. It’s cartoony in a way that’s pleasing to the eyes but also cool to look at. I’ve always loved the way the worlds look aesthetically even if they are a bit outdated (especially in Mooshu and I loved MooShu each time I went through it). I’ve seen the game go through graphics changes that occurred in world design and spells and it’s awesome to see the progression. It’s sort of the evolution of the game’s looks in combat and exploration. If you go through Classic-looking WC through Khrysalis, you can definitely see this evolution. While the graphics in some places are definitely outdated, they aren't disgusting to the eye in any way.\r\n\r\nSpells\r\nThe spells in this game are critical considering you look at them all the time when you fight. They are still fun to look at even if you see them a billion times. The later spells like Ra, Celestial Calendar, and Call of Khrulu are especially awesome and fun to watch. Combat, however, has always been a mixed bag for me. I love the turn-based stuff but I feel the combat could be changed more radically due to how slow it can become.\r\n\r\nMusic\r\nThe music in this game is a gem. I actually have some of the music saved to my phone, so I can listen to the tracks at work. The music accompanying the worlds is extremely fitting and really helps you get immersed in the environment. Sometimes I like to just stand in one spot and listen to the music.\r\n\r\nWorlds\r\nInstead of a giant landmass, the zones in this game are divided into worlds with their own themes to accompany them. Krokotopia is Egyptian based, Marleybone is Victorian London based, Mooshu is Japanese-Chinese mixed, Celestia is Atlantis themed, Azteca is Aztecan and Mayan themed, and many more. There are plenty of worlds to quest in and plenty to do in them. To access a new world, you need a Spiral Key specific to that world. I’ve never really hated any of the worlds except for Polaris. The rest of the worlds always look amazing and have a fun storyline to accompany them.\r\n\r\nContent-a-plenty\r\nThere’s quite a lot to do in this game from crafting to pet training to side quests to mini-games to house parties to various other things. It’s always good to have something to do in the game especially when the modern MMO has trouble staying afloat. You’ll find no shortage of things to do unless you put that much time down to finish all the content.\r\n\r\nExperience\r\nThe way the game works leveling wise is you are on a path of quests. Every now and then, you level up and can learn new spells. What Wizard101 manages to do well is keep your wizard at an appropriate level despite being a few levels higher than what the region is intended for as this will likely happen in the later worlds. As a former WoW player, it always irked me that your character could out level a zone in a matter of a few hours. Wizard101 seems to keep it on track… mostly.\r\n\r\nPhotomancy\r\nThe game gives you the ability to take your own in-game photos that it saves for you. You could do this before, but it was just a single button that saved to an outside folder. Now you can edit those photos in the game with decals, text, and add funny stuff to them. Makes taking photos a bit more special to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONS\r\n\r\nPrimitive World Design in the Early Worlds\r\nI know I said the worlds look great, but I can’t not mention this: Wizard City through Dragonspyre (arc 1) have bad street design. Each street is named something specific such as “Royal Hall” or “Unicorn Way” or “Kimishe Village” or “The Forum” but those streets are all unnecessarily long corridors that all point to a specific spot in the center of that map which is why the street is named after it. For example, the Forum in Dragonspyre is just a small area on the street but most of the area is just a long roadway. This always annoyed me and was thankfully phased out in the later years. The areas of Grizzleheim and Celestia onward had much more character to them.\r\n\r\nCheating Bosses\r\nI don’t have a problem with bosses that cheat per se. It adds flavor to the boss fights, so we aren’t repeating the same stuff over and over. However, I hate boss fights with bosses whose cheats are activated from so much as breathing in the wrong direction. It feels like I’m being punished for playing the game. It also ruins the fun in boss fights. #gitgud\r\n\r\nMyth Meta is terrible\r\nI have played a myth wizard since 2008, then 2012, then 2018 (yes, three separate myth wizards PLUS a few other classes; don't worry, I don't have all three still). There is a need for this class to have an overhaul. The Myth identity is Minions and double attack, which are both essentially gone now. Minions become useless in the later worlds as you become a more independent duelist so you have no need of them. Not to mention they act like normal AI when you summon them which makes them a huge hindrance in combat.\r\n\r\nCrown Shop\r\nThe Crown Shop is mostly an okay place to spend real money on the game, but it is sometimes excessive. Yes, you can buy gear from the shop but the gear in game is leagues better than what's in the shop. However, stuff like extra character slots, extra house slots, henchman (AIs who help you in one combat), house blocks, and an XP elixir are all locked behind crowns which need to be bought with real money. I wouldn't mind this so much if there were no membership AND/OR there were a way to get those items. Like for real, making me buy extra character slots or extra housing slots? We did just get two extra character slots for free, but we have to pay more if we want more. Seems like a ♥♥♥♥ move to me.\r\n\r\nRevered Crafting requires you to PVP\r\nAs much as I love my Revered Wand on my maxed wizard, you should not force players to PVP for ingredients. Players who don’t PVP but want the wand will get creamed every time. Sure, they can do tournaments, but that’s a large sum of gold down the drain and a waste of time for players who do not PVP like me. This isn't a quest you HAVE to do, but PVP materials for non-PVP crafted gear can set a bad precedent in the future and that needs to be pointed out.\r\n\r\nLack of Quest Variety\r\nThe story of the game isn't the problem. It's the quests, especially in the later worlds. There isn't enough variety in them. Quests usually boil down to collect this, defeat the enemy and collect this, talk to this NPC, kill this boss, defeat X of this enemy, or some combination or just one of the above. Empyrea tried to remedy this with a quest that involved a pipe puzzle. Krokotopia and Marleybone also had puzzles you had to complete in order to move and I wish those would come back in some meaningful way.\r\n\r\nMana isn't useful in the late-game\r\nMana becomes very plentiful in the late stages of the game. Many wizards have 500+ mana. With a constant refresh of so much mana and spells not taking that much mana away to begin with, it sort of negates Mana's reason for existing.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy gripes are sorta small. I do love this game as it has given me many fond memories over the years and it still provides me with more. If you have $10 to spare and want to give a new game a try, then give this game a go. I'd prefer no membership but hey. If you like fantasy, turn-based combat, fun spells, and interesting side activities, then this game is for you!",

Back then I was leaving elementary school and couldn't afford a membership, nor did I have my parents approval to have them pay for a monthly membership. I'd save up and ride my bike to Family Dollar to buy a month of membership as a treat, but it wasn't something I could sustain.\n\nNow I can play as far as I want, but the game can't hold my attention for long. [b]What I want is the version of Wizard101 I couldn't fully experience as a kid, but that game doesn't exist anymore[/b]. The tightly knit friend groups are gone unless you seek them outside the game. School identities have blurred, and in the late game all schools end up playing the same way.\n\nI've always liked playing Ice. The spells look cool, I enjoy have a massive health pool, and I like the idea of being the tank for my team, like the game originally advertised. But now Life actually gets the most health. Okay, fine, I'll try to be a support wizard. Except Balance and Death do that better. So I guess I'll go offensive? But Myth, Fire, and Storm are all better damage options. So what is Ice good at? Existing, I guess.\n\nAnd it's not just Ice. This is how I feel about every school. Ever since the \"roshambo\" update, which shifted the top stat from critical to damage, schools don't have unique battle roles anymore. It helped the game in some ways; it made things easier and more accessible, and it reduced randomness. But it also hurt identity. Every school now just stacks buffs and uses AoE hits. If I tried to shield teammates and taunt enemies like a proper tank (assuming taunts event work), I'd only be slowing the fight instead of just hitting the enemy myself.\n\nAs I quest through older worlds, it's harder and harder to find players who share my philosophy: not playing strictly to the meta, using underused spells, and enjoying the journey instead of speed-running it. I end up playing solo whether I want to or not. I don't want to blitz through the game in a week or get carried by a max-level player; I just want someone to enjoy the game with. When I play alone, my mind wanders or I get bored, and I fall into the same cycle: play for 15 minutes, quit, return months later, repeat.\n\nThat's not to say that I think the game is entirely terrible. KingsIsle is clearly doing something right. The game is still alive after more than a decade. Whether by luck or trial and error (because they rarely get things right the first time), the player count has gone up, and the game looks livelier than it has in years, especially after launching on console. Updates also keep being pushed, whether I think they're good or not.\n\nBut honestly, the game is a cash grab. The amount of content locked behind paywalls is wild. Memberships, bundles, gauntlets, the entire crown shop; it's all designed to squeeze more money out of players. There's even a $10 DLC for a single item. You [i]can[/i] grind for things, which I do, but it's a drag. The amount of time spent grinding is often not equal to the rewards you get or were expecting to get.  Years ago, when I didn't have a membership, I used to visit other players' castles to use their gauntlets. KingsIsle eventually shut that down because it meant fewer people buying their own, and now gauntlets are restricted to friends of the owner or the owner themselves.\n\nMaybe the game is losing its appeal because I'm burned out, or maybe it's simply not the same game I grew up with. But the gameplay no longer engages me, I can't find people to play with, and I don't want to keep spending money just to fight for the urge to play.",

Everything beyond Wizard City demands Crowns or a subscription.

Memberships, bundles, gauntlets, the entire crown shop; it's all designed to squeeze more money out of players. There's even a $10 DLC for a single item. You [i]can[/i] grind for things, which I do, but it's a drag. The amount of time spent grinding is often not equal to the rewards you get or were expecting to get.  Years ago, when I didn't have a membership, I used to visit other players' castles to use their gauntlets. KingsIsle eventually shut that down because it meant fewer people buying their own, and now gauntlets are restricted to friends of the owner or the owner themselves.\n\nMaybe the game is losing its appeal because I'm burned out, or maybe it's simply not the same game I grew up with. But the gameplay no longer engages me, I can't find people to play with, and I don't want to keep spending money just to fight for the urge to play.",

Instead, it’s become a predatory grind machine.\r\n\r\nThe game pretends to be free, but after the first few zones you slam into a paywall. Everything beyond Wizard City demands Crowns or a subscription. And even if you do pay, you’ll quickly realize the grind has been designed to push you toward the shop.\r\n\r\nDrop rates are abysmal, crafting takes forever, energy refills crawl at a snail’s pace, and basic progress like farming for gear or hatching pets feels intentionally miserable unless you spend real money. It’s not “challenging” — it’s exhausting by design, a psychological nudge to make you buy your way out of the pain.\r\n\r\nPacks sell overpowered items and “limited-time” mounts, turning what should be a magical kids’ MMO into a casino. It’s especially gross considering how many players are young and easily pressured by fear of missing out.\r\n\r\nI loved this game when it was about wizards and adventure. Now it’s about credit cards and artificial scarcity.\r\n\r\nVerdict:\r\nFun spellcasting, buried under paywalls.\r\nGrinding isn’t gameplay — it’s bait.\r\n1/10 – The magic’s gone, replaced by monetization.",

      "review": "[i]Written for Steam Awards 2025 Labor of Love Nomination[/i]\n\nI only play Wizard101 for nostalgia, not because I think it's \"fun\" or because I enjoy the increasingly complicated mechanics.\n\nI started playing Wizard101 around 2013, right before or during the release of Khrysalis. Back then I was leaving elementary school and couldn't afford a membership, nor did I have my parents approval to have them pay for a monthly membership. I'd save up and ride my bike to Family Dollar to buy a month of membership as a treat, but it wasn't something I could sustain.\n\nNow I can play as far as I want, but the game can't hold my attention for long. [b]What I want is the version of Wizard101 I couldn't fully experience as a kid, but that game doesn't exist anymore[/b]. The tightly knit friend groups are gone unless you seek them outside the game. School identities have blurred, and in the late game all schools end up playing the same way.\n\nI've always liked playing Ice. The spells look cool, I enjoy have a massive health pool, and I like the idea of being the tank for my team, like the game originally advertised. But now Life actually gets the most health. Okay, fine, I'll try to be a support wizard. Except Balance and Death do that better. So I guess I'll go offensive? But Myth, Fire, and Storm are all better damage options. So what is Ice good at? Existing, I guess.\n\nAnd it's not just Ice. This is how I feel about every school. Ever since the \"roshambo\" update, which shifted the top stat from critical to damage, schools don't have unique battle roles anymore. It helped the game in some ways; it made things easier and more accessible, and it reduced randomness. But it also hurt identity. Every school now just stacks buffs and uses AoE hits. If I tried to shield teammates and taunt enemies like a proper tank (assuming taunts event work), I'd only be slowing the fight instead of just hitting the enemy myself.\n\nAs I quest through older worlds, it's harder and harder to find players who share my philosophy: not playing strictly to the meta, using underused spells, and enjoying the journey instead of speed-running it. I end up playing solo whether I want to or not. I don't want to blitz through the game in a week or get carried by a max-level player; I just want someone to enjoy the game with. When I play alone, my mind wanders or I get bored, and I fall into the same cycle: play for 15 minutes, quit, return months later, repeat.\n\nThat's not to say that I think the game is entirely terrible.

      "review": "Wizard101 could’ve been a timeless classic — a cozy, magical adventure full of charm and creativity. Instead, it’s become a predatory grind machine.\r\n\r\nThe game pretends to be free, but after the first few zones you slam into a paywall. Everything beyond Wizard City demands Crowns or a subscription. And even if you do pay, you’ll quickly realize the grind has been designed to push you toward the shop.\r\n\r\nDrop rates are abysmal, crafting takes forever, energy refills crawl at a snail’s pace, and basic progress like farming for gear or hatching pets feels intentionally miserable unless you spend real money. It’s not “challenging” — it’s exhausting by design, a psychological nudge to make you buy your way out of the pain.\r\n\r\nPacks sell overpowered items and “limited-time” mounts, turning what should be a magical kids’ MMO into a casino. It’s especially gross considering how many players are young and easily pressured by fear of missing out.\r\n\r\nI loved this game when it was about wizards and adventure. Now it’s about credit cards and artificial scarcity.\r\n\r\nVerdict:\r\nFun spellcasting, buried under paywalls.\r\nGrinding isn’t gameplay — it’s bait.\r\n1/10 – The magic’s gone, replaced by monetization.",

I had come back after two years of inactivity to find that they had charged me for about four months of membership while i wasn’t playing, no big deal, but when i switched banks without knowing i was still subscribed, the transaction was denied, and my account was banned for “Fraud”. After pleading with support, i was told i needed to mail cash, or a check, along with a letter to their P.o. box to have my account reinstated. $100. Not even about the money, but the fact i had to have a 3 day conversation juts to basically be told to pay a ransom or go fuck myself, makes me quite literally hope this game is bought out by fucking dogshit EA because at least EA has the decency of leniency on accounts that have spent money on their platform with no priors.

      "review": "[i]Written for Steam Awards 2025 Labor of Love Nomination[/i]\n\nI only play Wizard101 for nostalgia, not because I think it's \"fun\" or because I enjoy the increasingly complicated mechanics.\n\nI started playing Wizard101 around 2013, right before or during the release of Khrysalis. Back then I was leaving elementary school and couldn't afford a membership, nor did I have my parents approval to have them pay for a monthly membership. I'd save up and ride my bike to Family Dollar to buy a month of membership as a treat, but it wasn't something I could sustain.\n\nNow I can play as far as I want, but the game can't hold my attention for long. [b]What I want is the version of Wizard101 I couldn't fully experience as a kid, but that game doesn't exist anymore[/b]. The tightly knit friend groups are gone unless you seek them outside the game. School identities have blurred, and in the late game all schools end up playing the same way.\n\nI've always liked playing Ice. The spells look cool, I enjoy have a massive health pool, and I like the idea of being the tank for my team, like the game originally advertised. But now Life actually gets the most health. Okay, fine, I'll try to be a support wizard. Except Balance and Death do that better. So I guess I'll go offensive? But Myth, Fire, and Storm are all better damage options. So what is Ice good at? Existing, I guess.\n\nAnd it's not just Ice. This is how I feel about every school. Ever since the \"roshambo\" update, which shifted the top stat from critical to damage, schools don't have unique battle roles anymore. It helped the game in some ways; it made things easier and more accessible, and it reduced randomness. But it also hurt identity. Every school now just stacks buffs and uses AoE hits. If I tried to shield teammates and taunt enemies like a proper tank (assuming taunts event work), I'd only be slowing the fight instead of just hitting the enemy myself.\n\nAs I quest through older worlds, it's harder and harder to find players who share my philosophy: not playing strictly to the meta, using underused spells, and enjoying the journey instead of speed-running it. I end up playing solo whether I want to or not. I don't want to blitz through the game in a week or get carried by a max-level player; I just want someone to enjoy the game with. When I play alone, my mind wanders or I get bored, and I fall into the same cycle: play for 15 minutes, quit, return months later, repeat.\n\nThat's not to say that I think the game is entirely terrible. KingsIsle is clearly doing something right. The game is still alive after more than a decade. Whether by luck or trial and error (because they rarely get things right the first time), the player count has gone up, and the game looks livelier than it has in years, especially after launching on console. Updates also keep being pushed, whether I think they're good or not.\n\nBut honestly, the game is a cash grab. The amount of content locked behind paywalls is wild. Memberships, bundles, gauntlets, the entire crown shop; it's all designed to squeeze more money out of players. There's even a $10 DLC for a single item. You [i]can[/i] grind for things, which I do, but it's a drag. The amount of time spent grinding is often not equal to the rewards you get or were expecting to get.  Years ago, when I didn't have a membership, I used to visit other players' castles to use their gauntlets. KingsIsle eventually shut that down because it meant fewer people buying their own, and now gauntlets are restricted to friends of the owner or the owner themselves.\n\nMaybe the game is losing its appeal because I'm burned out, or maybe it's simply not the same game I grew up with. But the gameplay no longer engages me, I can't find people to play with, and I don't want to keep spending money just to fight for the urge to play.",
