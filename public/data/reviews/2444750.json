Every skill feels purposeful, the learning curve is rewarding, and the game constantly gives you new layers to discover instead of just bigger numbers to chase. It’s surprisingly deep, but never overwhelming. There’s enough content to sink hours into, but it never feels like it’s padding for the sake of it. I kept thinking “just one more run” and then it was suddenly 3AM.",

Every run feels unique because of how many ability paths you can explore — swapping and combining powers mid-run keeps the game play fresh and encourages experimentation.\n\nThe dream-world theme is executed beautifully. Environments feel fluid and alive, shifting colours and layouts in ways that make the world feel mysterious rather than random. It’s one of the few roguelites where repeating areas never feels stale because of how atmospheric they are.\n\nCombat has weight without ever feeling clunky. Movement is smooth, hit feedback is excellent, and enemies telegraph attacks well, making it skill-based but approachable. Boss fights are memorable — fun, varied, and visually striking without overstaying their welcome.\n\nThe audio direction deserves a mention: soothing music, crisp effects, and ambient sounds create an almost meditative experience. Even chaotic fights feel calming thanks to the score.\n\nThe progression system is well designed: upgrades feel impactful, unlocks come at a steady pace, and returning for “just one more run” is effortless. There’s always something new to tweak or try, making it easy to sink multiple hours in without noticing.\n\nA rare combination of depth, beauty, and comfort.

The game had very few bugs at release, and they were very quickly addressed, every character can be viable and strong given a good build and getting certain abilities that complement their playstyle. I have to give props to the devs for including an out-of-run method of augmenting your run through the perks tree system. You can purchase and upgrade perks using a currency you acquire on runs, and it's not lost on death, and also use this currency to get cosmetics for your characters. It's very nice of them not to lock that behind microtransactions, like your typical AAA game would do without much thought.\n   My only possible complaint for the game is that there could be greater map variety, especially near the end of the run where there is only one possible map you will get sent to, instead of a selection of two which the rest of the run does send you through. I think changing that and also having an alternate starting map at the start of the run could add more fun and variety to the already very satisfying gameplay.",

If you play well and get a good build going you will feel powerful and rewarded, which is one of the things I'm looking for in these types of game. \n\nAs for replayability, I haven't grown bored yet. The multiple heroes give different playstyles, and the random abilities that you find throughout your run make the game different each time you play. The random biomes make the game feel fresher too. As opposed to all the hades clones out there, there are no rerolls from what I see, and most upgrades are purchased with resources. So you can't plan out your build, you get whatever the game throws at you and adapt. Which ultimately is a good thing in my opinion.\n\nIf you like arpgs and want to play a roguelike one, play it.

Otherwise, it's not a MOBA at all. It's a rogue-like beat-em-up game you can play in coop with friends. Thank you for that: coop PVE games that are not survival games are very rare it seems. \nI like the idea of having a champion defined by only two spells + a dodge + a passive, and then you can complement this identity with two more spells, twelve essences that you find in game, and one build you can define before entering the game. I feel most champions have two main builds, but the randomness of the spells and essences makes each run interesting. \nAt the time of writing, I do one run every day, and I'm still having fun. Mist is my favourite, I feel like I can finally properly play Fiora from League of Legends. Even if Mist is my favourite, I have lots of fun playing the other champions, since they all feel very different yet accessible. \n\nI have a few critics that are mainly nitpicking; these are little flaws that require polishing, and not big issues that ruin the fun.\n1. Mist and Vesper feel pretty useless when you have ranged champions in your team; what usually happens is that ranged champions will kill all the enemies before Mist or Vesper can reach them.\n2. Some hitboxes are a bit bigger than the zone shown on screen, in particular the red circle of ice golems. The meteor spell of the final boss has very questionable hitboxes as well.\n3. In World 4 (the one with fishes, mosquitoes and rats), it took me ~80 hours to understand what damages me. The rats explode after death and it's hard to see. Similarly, some projectiles shot by the mosquitoes are hard to see. \n4. You can beat most bosses with basically any build, provided you can click, and this is good. The only exception is the final boss, who requires a specific set of spells: at least one more dash (or a parry or something to move faster) and one consistent (and I mean, CONSISTENT) way to heal. 90% of the game can be beaten with any build, but the final boss favours only one.

Best thing is, if ya try hard enough, you can scale it to work to some extent.\r\n\r\nThe upgrade system is fantastic too because instead of just a set amount of rewards at the end of a room or constantly spamming you with level up screens, it's a combination of end-of-room rewards and currency exchange in place of xp. The best part is due to this system, coop is really very cooperative as you exchange power ups with friends and expedite each other's builds coming online.\r\n\r\nWith a few exceptions, the game has really good visual clarity for 'don't stand in danger' indicators. Even when there's crap shooting off from all over it's clear enough to know when a hit is coming. The timing might be a little too tight on some of it, but at least it's identifiable.\r\n\r\nThe unlocks are very impactful and really open up build variety as more things are unlocked. The normally boring +% stuff is tuned in a way that feels very impactful and the limit to at most 5 ish levels of upgrades on the skill tree stuff makes it feel less grindy. Especially since some of the unlocks are shared across the characters.\r\n\r\nA not-so-great-thing, the character balance is all over the place. Autoattack book child is stupidly strong compared to everyone else and robutt hat sword feels overly complicated and weak. Snipey pew pew cowboy feels quite balanced starting off pretty strong and scaling really well. And you can do some stupid stuff with totally-not-escanor and hurty healy.\r\n\r\nLong story short, great fun, take time to read things the first time then get progressively stupider with building characters that do silly things blowing up the screen. Better with friends but almost just as much fun solo.",

Forget boring stuff—this adventure is all about the cool vibes, absolutely mind-blowing looks, and amazing music.\n\nThe art style is truly breathtaking. It’s like a cartoon mixed with a masterpiece, and it makes everything you see feel special. The puzzles are brilliantly clever and super fun, making you think outside the box to keep the story moving. They fit perfectly into the dream theme!\n\nIf you want a chill, beautiful, and totally unique indie game that sticks with you long after you play, grab Shape of Dream. It’s a perfect 10/10 dream trip!",

      "review": "- Great visual style, combat feel\r\n - This is definitely not Hades 2.0, it is much more limited than that as it is trying to emulate the control feel of a MOBA (which makes sense as it is a Korean game) but it feels very satisfied to play.\r\n - Bosses and enemies have interesting patterns, but the difficulty needs a bit tuning since some have very cheap tactics to get you cornered or drain your health unless you go for a very specific build\r\n - Music and sound design is phenomenal.\r\n\r\nOverall this is a 8.5/10, i highly recommend it. I don't have any fancy words to say here this time in this review since well, this is a \"fine\" game and if that's your cup of tea, it's well worth the money.",

I think a slower-paced game setting would work really well with the gameplay too, but there's nothing like that currently. \nThe game is very story/lore light. Can completely ignore any lore very easily if you want to, but there's not much there if it's important to you. \nTechnically, I've definitely had FPS issues. The game struggles to keep a steady framerate in high intensity situations late-game, and especially in the Japanese/asian-themed world. Multiplayer wise, I've played plenty as the host in 2-player coop. The only issues we've had is my friend occasionally crashing, but we're able to get him back in the game without losing any progress other than whatever exp he might have missed in the room. \n\n\nBalance is not perfect, some things are strong to the point of me not taking them anymore because they scale your damage/survivability too hard. Some things feel like worse versions of other (usually less rare) things, the bump in rarity doesn't always mean it's more powerful. Some abilities are nigh unusable in high difficulty due to animation lock / slowdowns. \n\nThe game is very fun though. I definitely recommend it if it sounds interesting. I think if you play the game knowing that some things are just super overpowered, and avoid using them all the time, you can get a lot of enjoyment out of it. There's enough there that I'm still playing after having unlocked everything, and even enjoying it more now that I'm not trying to force specific stuff for unlocks. \nThe Devs have balance/difficulty, late-game content, and workshop support for mods next up on their roadmap. So if you're really worried about a game that's balanced with a fine-tooth comb, might want to wait and see. Lot of fun to be had now though.",

      "review": "This is a fake review I guess.\n\nEdit: Two weeks later, achievements are still bugged, some lucid dreams can still not be unlocked for some player\n\nI had 72 hours in the Prologue version of this game and so I had to buy it, felt like I owed it to the devs on the one hand and was really excited what they had in store for us...\n\nHonestly: There is like extra 2 or 3 mechanics/memories I enjoy (Lizard is a nice idea and more characters with different playstyles is obviously great). The game is good and the new map environments do look genuinly amazing. I mean I had spent so much time with it already, so I guess it is worth the money as well if I was a new player.\n\nBut actually honestly, if this was the Prologue version, I think I wouldn´t have spent that same time with the game.\nI unforunately have to agree, despite the rabid dog fans of this game (it caters to league of legends players after all so nothing else is expected) but the grind system is basically busy work. You can´t play the higher difficulties of the game, not because of your abilities, but because you don´t have the stats. \nThe Prologue may have done much less and simpler things but the new system also barely adds anything interesting. It´s a roguelite for the hell of it. Most stats are basic statstick things, not something that customizes the playstyles. The worst part of that is probably the \"improvements\" to the basic skills. A lot of work went into that clearly, but IF I were to find something useful, I basically get rid of 80% of the basic skills the first chance I get.\nThe new memories added might be fun for one playthrough to try it out...before you realize \"oh yeah this is horrible to use against certain enemies so I will never use that skill again\" and that is about all of the new memories added apart from a handful.\nEven worse, because of how many skills there are now, it is simply harder to find the useful ones. Many of them don´t work together. There is usually no good synergies, so you basically always want to take the same few.\nAnd what is the height of it, is that you find a lot of memories that sacrifice current health without finding a reliable way of healing. So unless you already have a way to heal, you lock even more skills away because it is completely unviable to use those otherwise since they don´t interact with barriers or invulnerability.\n\nBasically: Memories are the meat of the game and they are not any better than they were a year ago in the Prologue version.\nEssences...got completely forgotten. I don´t even know if they worked on them at all since then.\n\nThings I would have wished for: Some secrets, maybe extra pathways or secrets nodes you could find with explorations on the map, maybe some things you could only reach with certain skills. Something that rewards exploration or observation. Some way to change the map layout. Some way to break the essence limit on skills with some penalty. Some way of equipping the same essences multiple times with a penalty (suddenly so many more builds would be viable). Some more enemy variety for the third world. Some ways to change the base element of memories. A FRIGGIN STORY (literally everything they have in that regard was already in the Prologue so they didn´t work on that at all in the last year). I get that MOBAs don´t have a story, but if you wanna be a roguelite I expect at least something to unlock beyond the starting sequence. Yeah, none of that.\n\nMeanwhile they made the game actively worse with enemy tracking on ranged attacks where you now need to actively spam dodges. Sounds sensible? Yeah...but it is neither more difficult nor more fun this way. Just let me learn how to path instead of forcing me to spam dodges.\nIn the Prologue I had a fully decked out build before the world 3 boss, now I can be happy if I find enough useable stuff for two skills and then only half of their essences are even leveled. And like said - with more trash stuff I have even less ability to play builds I want to build. Infact, some runs you can just give up if you stand around in world 2 with a hand full of trash and know you will not get anything going before the enemies scale beyond you unless you play on the lower difficulties.\nAnd while yes, stacking health with cold essence was an amazing exploit in the Prologue - in a full game release I am expecting them to do something more than basically trying to get you to wait 5 seconds between attacks for \"optimal play\". Another sign that no work was done on the essences in the last year.\n\nSpeaking of difficulty...the game is not hard. If you play on nightmare you have some ability to make the game harder for yourself with lucid dreams, but that is basically self punishment, not the game giving you a challenge. I almost had beaten Nightmare after 4 hours just because I got one working build and then you roll your face over the keyboard. Guess what, it was the same build I played in the Prologue already just in worse.\n\nIn return, sometimes you simply get worse maps that allow for less exploration because of a bad layout or putting a curse shrine right in front of the boss or putting all upgrade wells on one side of the map.\n\nAnd the rewards...well if you play single player you constantly have to reroll Ko-op missions. Why? \n\nCurses (the potent and intense ones) are not difficult challenges, they are straight up run enders. (oh cool I can´t move without taking damage that goes through shields - oh cool I can´t use my abilities without taking damage before shields get activated - oh cool I run into extra challenge maps while I´m cursed with some impossible combination like no dodging and ambush)\nActual damage numbers are completely arbitrary, as you do not have a compendium at your disposal, so you do not know how much damage your skills will actually do, the shown numbers are more suggestions.\n\nVisual clutter like Hunter threat level ground effects overlapping each other despite being oneshot abilities. Final boss hitboxes not matching his visuals in the second phase.\n\nAnd appearently there is shady stuff going on with device observation in the EULA as well and the optimization is mostly ass. For example when you don´t have the shader running on highest setting, suddenly the whole forest will start to flicker - no wonder they gave a seizure warning, just not the way they were expecting it.\n\n[b] So yes, buy the game. At least with a 30% discount it´s still worth it. But I am disappointed. I had literally more fun in the Prologue version of this. Any anticipation for extra content I had was basically canned within hours. No new story, no new interesting builds, half of the unlockables are busywork or useless, builds are less flexible despite more memories and new mechanics were basically not added. I´m just disappointed over the last year of waiting and will change to positive once I get over that feeling. But its still fine I guess *sigh* It could have been so much more tho.... [/b]",

NORMAL DIFFICULTY BTW.\nThe only viable builds able to finish the game are total cancer overhealing cheese. \nIf you can't heal 400+ hp per second you won't beat the game.\nThose builds basically facetank all damage neglecting anything outside of using dodge to avoid 1! out of ~30 attack moves of the boss. \n[b]This is the main and major flaw of the game.[/b]\n\n[i]There are also some minor issues like:[/i] \nInconsistent drops through the game: sometimes you have enough upgrades, other time you barely get stuff for your build to function properly. \nBoss attacks are really hard to avoid constantly (therefore, there is a major flaw I describe above). \nLagging and stuttering in COOP mode.",
