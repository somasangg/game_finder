      "review": "I wasn’t expecting it to be as good as it is. As a long time Hitman fan, this was superb. I had never played the fourth entry before, though I went through the first three, which were solid but lacked the incredible environmental design found here. Some of these missions have the best layouts I’ve ever played, and the third mission genuinely stunned me. It hooked me the same way Hitman does making me want to revisit each location to explore it more thoroughly, since I usually don’t the first time around. The level layouts make sense, and the scale is absolutely impressive. The freedom to approach objectives in multiple ways really enhances the experience, making each mission unique which was awesome might I add and coming from the third game that surprised me.\r\n\r\nThe gunplay is excellent the sniping feels impactful, and the iconic kill cam is as satisfying as ever. Its just the medium range that lacks finesse so usually the best option is either close up or long range which suits the game and guns ablazing is possible but not without the right loadout. The ability to customize weapons is always appreciated and my god are there a lot of options available to you, even a testing range to try out your combinations, and you will want to replay missions to unlock new weapons since only a limited amount of armaments are available from the beginning. However, it’s not without flaws. The story is your usual fan fare and characters aren’t particularly strong they mostly serve as background for the gameplay. The AI can be inconsistent, sometimes reacting unrealistically, and there are moments where close quarters combat overshadows the sniping focus. All in all, it’s much better than I expected, and I’d wholeheartedly recommend everyone give it a try especially since it’s often available at a steep discount.",

Previous games I played, levels may take 1 hour, 1.5 hours. These maps are HUGE with so many things to do. Don't get me wrong, I actually enjoy it. But be prepared for this since you won't be finishing this game anytime soon. Again, for a single player game, is a GREAT thing to me. So, it's not a complaint. If anything, I want to say it's a good thing given the draught of single player games/campaigns that don't last long.\r\nReplayability - yes. definitely yes. I love going back and replaying the maps. To either find more collections, try to beat the level more quickly, or just to have fun.\r\nLastly - Hey, I'm American. I gotta keep playing this game until it might become illegal based on our government.\r\n\r\nLastly lastly - Kill all Nazis.\r\n\r\nTLDR - This is a great franchise that I've always enjoyed.

I first started with Sniper Elite 4, and I had such a wonderful time with that game. And then proceeded to buy Sniper Elite 5 straight after. \n\nI know the general consensus is that Sniper Elite 5 isn't held as high as the previous entry, but I'm actually on the opposite spectrum. SE5 has kept me glued consistently from start to finish across 3 seperate runs. Currently nearing the end of my Authentic run, and this game has to be the most rewarding Sniper/stealth games I've played. \n\nRebellion has nailed the formula for the series, with a few minor step backs here eg No trip mines, no crouch sprint and less varied map design, but some of the more enhanced gameplay improvements make up for it. Gun customisation is here, stealth is improved, and even 2nd or 3rd primary weapons feel punchier and satisfying than ever. \n\nFor anyone starting a first run, I'd highly recommend going Sniper Elite difficulty first and turning empty lung assist to minimal to remove the red diamond aid. This game will having you coming back once you start to slowly master your shots and gauging winds and bullet drop.",

      "review": "Well this was a really pleasant surprise. This is the most fun I’ve had in a stealth/action game for years. It reminded me a lot of Hidden & Dangerous 2 for some reason, but without the bugs.\n\nAs far as I can recall, I’ve only played the 1st one and can’t quite remember if I ended up completing it, but remember really liking it at the time, which is why I picked this one up on a recent sale (I just realised that I also purchased SE3 on a sale in 2017 but never played it for some reason).\n\nThe graphics in the game are absolutely stunning, with the developers delivering an outstanding job on the environments. Each area you encounter is visually distinct, offering a lot of variety as you progress. Although there are only eight main missions, most of them are very large and provide a great deal of gameplay flexibility, allowing for different approaches and tactics. There are also optional and hidden objectives, and there are numerous paths available through each map, which will probably be ideal for subsequent plays.\n\nI played most of the game using stealth, blackjacking/stabbing enemies and snipering key enemies from afar. It wasn't until mid game or so that I started experimenting more with the various tools and equipment, targeting groups of enemies, environmental hazards, and vehicles. During these moments, some limitations of the game’s AI became apparent. While the AI is generally solid and has clearly been adjusted to be forgiving (making stealth more enjoyable without requiring constant save-scumming) they can remain on high alert for an extended period after being triggered. Sometimes, the alert status persists almost indefinitely, especially if a soldier discovers a new dead body or another suspicious event, which can prolong the alert phase even further.\n\nThe story is a standard WW2 plot, adequate but not memorable, so I skipped most cutscenes.",

Comparing it to previous entries, even though I have only played Sniper Elite 2 a bit which never really hooked me, I loved the large scale maps with many ways to tackle an objective and the many graphical details found all around which really give the game a sense of a living environment. Axis Invasions is the most entertaining mode in the game to me, invading an other player's campaign and hunting them is amazing. Every invasion feels fresh and challenging, reminds me of the Dark Souls invasions which were also a lot of fun but with the \"cat and mouse\" mechanisms absent in DS.\n\nThe graphics are gorgeous and so is the art style, particularly the lighting and water effects. The in-house Rebellion engine truly shines in the optimization department, running well even on older systems. Can't recommend enough especially on sale.",

There’s something here of Barry Pepper’s icy sprint in Saving Private Ryan, and something of that predatory silence in the ruins of Stalingrad from Enemy at the Gates—moments when the very landscape becomes an adversary. This is a game that refuses to let you relax, even for a heartbeat.\n\nEach mission unfolds like a new act in a grand wartime production, staged with an almost documentary devotion to the era. The locations are unique, diverse, and unforgiving in their own elegant ways.\n\nYou’ll navigate coastal fortifications where the wind claws sound into shreds, and where every fold of terrain turns into a natural rampart or trap.\nYou’ll move through French manors with shaded avenues and cold stone walls, behind which patrols, spotlights, and hidden routes are woven into a dark, intricate tapestry.\nYou’ll infiltrate industrial districts where metal sings at the touch of the wind, and where the maze of warehouses and workshops operates like a multi-layered chessboard—one in which verticality matters as much as the horizontal plane.\nYou’ll descend into ancient fortresses wrapped in heavy historical silence, where each corridor resembles the throat of a beast, and the shadows whisper of those who walked there before you.\nYou’ll operate within coastal towns where promenades echo with distant footsteps, and where wealthy homes and narrow alleyways form a geometry of risk, refuge, and endless tactical permutations.\n\nThis is a world where the horizon is layered, where each hill is an opportunity, every tower a point of power, and every sound a potential fuse to your undoing.\n\nIn Sniper Elite 5, missions are not tasks—they are wide, branching meadows of decisions.\nYour entry point, your exit route, your elevation, pacing, distance—everything belongs to you. The game seems to whisper, “Choose your path. Choose your rhythm. See how far you’re willing to go.”\nThey’re vast as a river in flood, yet precise and clockwork in their internal logic.\n\nPlaying on the highest difficulty becomes its own form of self-awareness.\nDistance turns into a philosophical variable.\nWind becomes a fluctuation of fate.\nA bullet becomes your signature under a decision you cannot retract.\nAny step may be your last—yet it’s this fragility that creates the sense of truth. You feel every second, every breath, as if you were not in a game but in someone else’s war, compelled to see it through.\n\nSniper Elite 5 possesses a rare quality: it fuses you with your character.\nWith every mission you begin to feel the weight of the rifle, the cold edge of the scope beneath your fingers, the dry crackle of grass beneath your elbow. You start breathing in sync with this world—its winds, its echoes, its danger. And at some point, almost imperceptibly, you realize: you are no longer just playing.\nYou’ve stepped onto that terrible page of history where everything—absolutely everything—hinges on a single, solitary shot.",

      "review": "🎯 Sniper Elite 5\nRating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (9/10)\n\n🎨 A Sharpshooter’s Evolution\nSniper Elite 5 feels like the point where the series finally steps into its prime. Rebellion takes everything that’s worked across the franchise — the tension, the open-ended missions, the glorious X-ray kills — and elevates it into one of the most polished sniping experiences to date. It’s not just another entry; it’s the series hitting a confident stride, refined and razor-sharp.\n\n🎮 Gameplay\nCore Experience:\nEvery mission feels like a sandbox built specifically for creativity. Multiple infiltration routes, detailed maps, and dynamic enemy patrols give you the freedom to play like a ghost in the shadows or a long-range executioner perched hundreds of meters away. And when that bullet leaves the barrel? The impact is still unmatched. The X-ray cam remains brutal, cinematic, and endlessly satisfying.\n\nMechanics & Feel:\nMovement is smoother, stealth feels more flexible, and weapon customization adds a depth that earlier games only hinted at. Compared to Sniper Ghost Warrior or older Sniper Elite titles, the AI is smarter and the levels feel alive. Every adjustment — wind, distance, timing — contributes to that perfect shot, and the game makes each one feel worth the setup.\n\n❤️ For Fans of the Long Shot\nHaving played Sniper Elite games, Sniper Ghost Warrior, and even Zombie Army, this one feels like a culmination of everything I’ve loved across those series. The precision of Ghost Warrior, the creativity of Zombie Army’s action moments, and the classic Elite tactical charm all show up here — but more polished, more ambitious, and more confident. It’s familiar in the best way, yet fresh enough to stand out.\n\n📊 A Beautiful, Brutal Battlefield\nThe environments are some of the best the series has seen — lush countryside, fortified bunkers, sprawling villages — all crafted with detail and purpose. Performance is steady, the sound design pops with tension, and the soundtrack walks the line between subtle and dramatic. It all supports the core fantasy: being a lone marksman shaping the battlefield from afar.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nSniper Elite 5 is an awesome game — a near-perfect blend of stealth, tactical shooting, and satisfying sniping. It raises the bar for the series, delivering both nostalgia and innovation in a single clean shot. For anyone who’s followed sniping games over the years, this one feels like the reward for sticking with the genre.\n\n⚔️ Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (9/10)",

In Sniper Elite 5, if you whistle from big grass, and infantry is in Trench he would not jump over it and come check it, in SE4 especially in SE3 he will jump over anything to check it. I just tested this in different maps and Infantry just dont care, he looks from the Trench to the Grass and just dont give a damn. So IS Sniper elite 5 worth Playing, Yes completely , but is it big imrovement over SE4, no, not at all, i just like that they added Multyplayer, witch is Alive today, really alive, playing it for horus, but SE 5 is Far from Perfect, also Rebellion dont give a freak ass about Hackers in Multiplayer games, there is allot of them, no really strong hacker, but ye there is WH, CLIPING over the map and comeing from the outside of the map, it's so called teleport or Clip trough, there is also Aimbot, but we have to kick the player, Easy Anty Cheat sucks, it's just there to bother you, EAC also decide will you play with friend CO OP or not, sometimes when he feels right he let you join Lobby sometimes you are just stuck in Joining lobby and after that Connection timed out 12011 damn i remembered the code of the error even, so EAC is BAD totally, they think that it's working like it should but no EAC does not work at all, and there is no GMs or something becasue games are hosted by actual players, so it's basically peer 2 peer and EAC can decide to not let you play for some time, just because it can. BATTLE EYE was really good thing idk why they change it to EAC. But nwm about Multy player, game is worth to play, there is allot things to do , there is also Authetic difficulty witch i like allot.

Full stealth and careful planning are rewarded with easier times, though one map forces melee-only stealth in a small linear spawn area.\n\nTraps can be inconsistent near staircases, random enemy spawns feel unfair at times, and Schu-mines are mostly ineffective. Silenced rifles are DLC-only pre finishing the game, and base-game sniper upgrades require finding the workbench on each map. Early satchels are scarce, and you often need to finish the campaign to have them in your inventory to handle tanks, anti-air personnel, and optional objectives without hunting for satchels.\n\nDespite these quirks, long-range shots, tactical positioning, and mission variety make this a standout sniper experience. Tanks require either two Panzerfaust hits to destroy, or one from the rear for partial damage + gunning the exposed area, all in all enjoyable game.",

One thing I didn't liked before in the previous games were the level designs, especially in Sniper Elite 2 and 3 you feel very constrained on the path you should go while the decision to have open levels made the game feel more dynamic and fun. \nThe mechanics actually are the best, even tho I am still upset that you can't destroy anymore tanks with just 2 bullets like in the previous titles, I don't have anything to complain about.\nMultiplayer is actually fun, the survivor mode doesn't feel too difficult and the new game mode of Axis Invader actually makes the campaign more exciting and thrilling when you know that another player joined your campaign mission and they are hunting you. \n\nOverall I can fairly say this might be the best title in the series so far!",

Pulling off long shots feels extremely rewarding and the stealth mechanics are pretty straight forward and easy to get a hold of. The maps are beautiful and each one is pretty unique in terms of environment. Even though this isn't your typical WW2 combat game it does a really good job of capturing the gritty war torn state of the Western Front. Overall I'd give this game a solid thumbs up. Definitely worth a couple playthroughs and a quick dip or two into some of the multiplayer content.",

      "review": "Overall it's still a fun entry, but feels somewhat confused. SE4 still felt like a Sniper Elite game that also happened to improve enough of the stealth mechanics to be played like a stealth game as a bonus. Comparatively, 5 feels like a stealth game that just happens to have Sniper Elite mechanics. That may not sound like a bad thing on paper, but it means I was looking at the stealth mechanics with more scrutiny and a lot of them feel very frivolous. Like, Rebellion just looked at a bunch of other stealth games over the past few years and went, \"Oh yeah, add that in there,\" for the sake of it (MGSV probably being the biggest one).\n\nThe inclusion of a non-lethal playstyle sort of embodies the feeling of adding mechanics for the sake of having them. I'm usually not one to balk at more player choice in a stealth game, but in here it mechanically does not serve a purpose. You get LESS XP for knocking somebody out than using a lethal takedown (unless you intend to kill the enemy right after), both takedown types are quiet, you don't have to worry about something like a blood trail coming out of a corpse if relocating a body, and a patrolling enemy finding a body unconscious is identical to finding them dead (they'll check the body and become partially alerted). There are a lot of opportunities Rebellion could've taken to make non-lethal an actual ideal option depending on enemy layouts (have enemies immediately go for an alarm if they see a dead body, make lethal takedowns loud, etc.) and they took none of them. And of course narratively speaking (I know, it's Sniper Elite, who cares, shut up), it just doesn't make much sense at all because 5 takes place after 3 and 4. Karl has a corpse pile of god knows how many Nazis and fascists under his belt at this point in the war, why would he care now?\n\nAlso the levels in 5 are much larger than 4 which isn't a bad thing on its own, but it just makes it stick out incredibly hard when Karl is incapable of moving through invisible walls portrayed by bushes or a wall he should be very capable of mantling, because the developers wanted the player to go through more intended routes.\n\nStill, at the end of the day, it's more Sniper Elite fun, if diluted a little ironically because of them attempting to add new features. The new Invasion mode at the very least is an actual fun inclusion that adds newfound tension that normally wouldn't be in the game otherwise.",

You either get one of two matches: A brand new player who has no idea what is going on who either gets killed super fast or hides the entire time you hunt them / An extremely sweaty player who has either booby trapped the entire map in random spots or again camps waiting on you to die of boredom or traps. I kid you not I have been able to mark every friendly AI on multiple maps while waiting for the player to make a move. Not to mention I have seen a guy set up an entire spawn area with TNT and mines EVERYWHERE so you can't move and then I see 30 glints from decoys back at the start of the map. The guns on the axis side seem to get worse over time to the point I have shot people 3 times with a rifle and they live as they drop me in one shot. There's just a plethora of problems in multiplayer overall. The Campaign is okay enough and I guess has enough replay value if you like to challenge yourself.

This is really unfortunate because the game does give you multiple starting positions. But why ever use them? I easily got everything from one single playthrough on the hardest difficulty. (aside from when it forced me to restart due to those bugs)",

      "review": "-Scope glint is actually incredibly rare, especially at night or in the shade. The game turns your rifle into a spotlight, every time you look through the scope. Doing this for your enemies also takes the skill out of the hunt. \n\n-giving away a players position with the phone is dumb, and lazy. it also has no historic basis in real sniper duels. Now, talking to the people in the area and them having told you what they've seen and heard, or the lack there of, is realistic. but the game doesn't do it, so fuck them.\n\n-i don't need enemies tagged; its called memory. YOU REMEMBER what you saw and where you saw it. Then you make deductions and tactical decisions, based on it. Tagging is lazy, impossible in real life,  and often distracting from immersive gameplay. what i would like to do is be able to use the binos to range any object i want, or use the reticle in my scope to do it, assuming it doesn't light my position up like a small supernova; again, unrealistic.\n\n-walking intentionally around a trap doesn't trigger it in the 1940s. In the game, it does. If im being too demanding, then make the traps more deadly when you actually do step on them. But even then, no one person is going into a mission AO, and booby trapping the entire countryside. Its one thing when you're holding an area and preparing it for defense, over days or weeks; its entirely different when you've invaded Normandy that very night. make the trap setting realistically limited. The game only lets the invader use one mine. Why not limit allied players mines to no more than 5? \n\n-having 3 weapons on you at once, is as difficult as treading water. It creates more problems than it solves. When you're the invader its especially pointless. Its a sniping game. running around like a moron and getting into firefights with everyone you see isn't sniping, or smart. If you absolutely have to have 25 lbs of guns and 20 lbs of ammo, then decrease the stamina, dexterity, silence, and speed the player can travel at. If they want, they can drop the other gun/s  and ammo at any time. it seems pretty simple to me. believe me, a sniper rifle is pretty darn effective enough. the game doesn't capture its effect at all.\n\n-walking makes noise. climbing makes noise. reloading makes noise. Doing anything in the physical world makes noise, no matter how \"elite\" you are; Fix it.\n\n-wind doesn't make a 30-06 drift all that far at 300 yards. You barely notice the effect of a 10+ mph wind at the ranges the game simulates. It tries to simulate distance by making your ballistics garbage. Its bad form, at best.\n\n-dudes are going to react when a firefight breaks out, 100 yards away. At the very least, they are going to be lazer focused. Your'e not going to just go from hedge to hedge or street to street, mopping up baddies. Plus, where are the mortars? Why are AI snipers hanging out in towers, STANDING AS TALL AS POSSIBLE!!!??? Make less snipers, and make them more sniper like.\n\n-take the third person view away, and replace it with a parascope or even a careful peek. If you need paripheral vision, there are ways to do that.I cant fathom why third person is still a thing in shooters. Its possibly the most absurd feature of this game, and that's saying something.\n\n-Whats with the stupid guns? Why do you need to customize them? Why does everyone have a suppressor and night vision? Again, its the 1940s and if your rifle handles like shit, or is too weak to do the job, you cant really do much to fix that. That being said, getting hit by just about any gun is going to knock you on your ass and make you bleed out. Just give the guns their realistic abilities.\n\n-where are all the allied troops, and there's no way that many germans troops would just be sitting there with their thumb up their ass. The first time you took a shot, half the map would take to the bushes, walls, windows, ditches, and so on. If you shot one or two dudes, and then crawled up to the spot they were patrolling, you'd get zapped from the bushes by some private. THAT'S NOT HOW SNIPING WORKS.\n\n-I also have a suspicion that people are still able to cheat. I manage to kill half of them, because i now just assume they made that seemingly absurd decision because they saw me behind the giant stone barn. When I can routinely win by assuming the other player is cheating, or cant even come close to winning after 100 rematches, that's pretty much a guarantee that the game is dropping the ball. \n\nlook, I enjoy messing with people on invasion mode, well enough. But i'm not going to pretend this game lives up to its namesake. There's next to no sniping in it, and it doesn't even provide the options that \"elite\" snipers would rely on, then alone choose. The plot is super dumb, and unnecessary. its just a garbage game.",

You can boot the game using Vulcan, but then the game will randomly crash while zoomed in.  This is a known issue since launch that the devs failed to address before moving on to the next entry.",

I can be pretty tolerant when it comes to things, but the cutscenes in this game are so damn corny it genuinely hurts to listen to, I couldn't help but cringe at most of the cutscene until I finally had to skip it. Thank God that i got this game on sale for cheap instead of the normal staggering 50 dollars!",

(which still sucks because you can't get 3 stars) Other times it will be a main objective which stops you from finishing completing the level entirely. I have had major quest items simply not spawn in nor be given to me when I should get them. It IS a fun game, but these bugs really let it down. I wouldn't consider paying for this unless you are willing to pointlessly play through the levels multiple times with only high hopes to complete them.\n\nBeyond the GAMEBREAKING bugs, the game does have well designed maps/levels, however, there isn't much of a reason to replay the levels. This is really unfortunate because the game does give you multiple starting positions. But why ever use them? I easily got everything from one single playthrough on the hardest difficulty. (aside from when it forced me to restart due to those bugs)",

      "review": "-Scope glint is actually incredibly rare, especially at night or in the shade. The game turns your rifle into a spotlight, every time you look through the scope. Doing this for your enemies also takes the skill out of the hunt. \n\n-giving away a players position with the phone is dumb, and lazy. it also has no historic basis in real sniper duels. Now, talking to the people in the area and them having told you what they've seen and heard, or the lack there of, is realistic. but the game doesn't do it, so fuck them.\n\n-i don't need enemies tagged; its called memory. YOU REMEMBER what you saw and where you saw it. Then you make deductions and tactical decisions, based on it. Tagging is lazy, impossible in real life,  and often distracting from immersive gameplay. what i would like to do is be able to use the binos to range any object i want, or use the reticle in my scope to do it, assuming it doesn't light my position up like a small supernova; again, unrealistic.\n\n-walking intentionally around a trap doesn't trigger it in the 1940s. In the game, it does. If im being too demanding, then make the traps more deadly when you actually do step on them. But even then, no one person is going into a mission AO, and booby trapping the entire countryside. Its one thing when you're holding an area and preparing it for defense, over days or weeks; its entirely different when you've invaded Normandy that very night. make the trap setting realistically limited. The game only lets the invader use one mine. Why not limit allied players mines to no more than 5? \n\n-having 3 weapons on you at once, is as difficult as treading water. It creates more problems than it solves. When you're the invader its especially pointless. Its a sniping game. running around like a moron and getting into firefights with everyone you see isn't sniping, or smart. If you absolutely have to have 25 lbs of guns and 20 lbs of ammo, then decrease the stamina, dexterity, silence, and speed the player can travel at. If they want, they can drop the other gun/s  and ammo at any time. it seems pretty simple to me. believe me, a sniper rifle is pretty darn effective enough. the game doesn't capture its effect at all.\n\n-walking makes noise. climbing makes noise. reloading makes noise. Doing anything in the physical world makes noise, no matter how \"elite\" you are; Fix it.\n\n-wind doesn't make a 30-06 drift all that far at 300 yards. You barely notice the effect of a 10+ mph wind at the ranges the game simulates. It tries to simulate distance by making your ballistics garbage. Its bad form, at best.\n\n-dudes are going to react when a firefight breaks out, 100 yards away. At the very least, they are going to be lazer focused. Your'e not going to just go from hedge to hedge or street to street, mopping up baddies. Plus, where are the mortars? Why are AI snipers hanging out in towers, STANDING AS TALL AS POSSIBLE!!!??? Make less snipers, and make them more sniper like.\n\n-take the third person view away, and replace it with a parascope or even a careful peek. If you need paripheral vision, there are ways to do that.I cant fathom why third person is still a thing in shooters. Its possibly the most absurd feature of this game, and that's saying something.\n\n-Whats with the stupid guns? Why do you need to customize them? Why does everyone have a suppressor and night vision? Again, its the 1940s and if your rifle handles like shit, or is too weak to do the job, you cant really do much to fix that. That being said, getting hit by just about any gun is going to knock you on your ass and make you bleed out. Just give the guns their realistic abilities.\n\n-where are all the allied troops, and there's no way that many germans troops would just be sitting there with their thumb up their ass. The first time you took a shot, half the map would take to the bushes, walls, windows, ditches, and so on. If you shot one or two dudes, and then crawled up to the spot they were patrolling, you'd get zapped from the bushes by some private. THAT'S NOT HOW SNIPING WORKS.\n\n-I also have a suspicion that people are still able to cheat. I manage to kill half of them, because i now just assume they made that seemingly absurd decision because they saw me behind the giant stone barn. When I can routinely win by assuming the other player is cheating, or cant even come close to winning after 100 rematches, that's pretty much a guarantee that the game is dropping the ball. \n\nlook, I enjoy messing with people on invasion mode, well enough. But i'm not going to pretend this game lives up to its namesake. There's next to no sniping in it, and it doesn't even provide the options that \"elite\" snipers would rely on, then alone choose. The plot is super dumb, and unnecessary. its just a garbage game.",
