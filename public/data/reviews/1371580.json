I am thinking the space is just completely overcrowded. \n\nAlthough I must say this game is a bit more then your average survive and build game. The graphics are high end, the scenery is gorgeous. The attacking is complex and you can attack from every direction, and block. There is an extensive skill leveling with battle and life. Looks like you can build and army, Travel on a moving base, fly, and have siege wars. The movement is really nice, especially when you configure the controller set up. The armor sets look really cool, and there is a ton to do. \n\nOne last unique thing that this game does. So They close servers or areas depending on player contribution. So if your area is not really playing or doing anything they move you closer together. If massive amounts of people would be playing this it would continue to expand. I think this is a really cool feature.",

It really only shows a deep seeded disrespect for the people who play this game, not too mention the obvious pay to win stuff for official servers with the Gold currency and the way you can spend gold on enhancing skills.\n\nOverall this game is just a crappy Conan Exiles knock off. If it wasnt on sale for $10 I never would have bought it, even though I still feel cheated. With the limitations on customizing server settings, you either need a lot of other people to play with to get a good amount of the content or you suffer through a ridiculous grind for even the basic of gear, with most recipes requiring a crazy amount of materials. \n\nBase building is another major turn off. Im not sure how they accomplished it but they somehow made building worse than ARK. All the building in this game made me do was think about how ARK building was actually pretty good in comparison and made me want to take back all the stuff I said about it. It even made me think the logging simulator game Sons of the Forest had decent building. \n\nWith all of the bad stuff, the game has OK directional combat, even though blocking is pointless when you can just move out of your attackers swing. The map is huge and is not bad in its design, although some land formations dont really make sense in a real world view. There is a lot of content, you will get lost in the menus and will struggle to figure out whats what. The level cap is crazy, which is nice cause it spreads out the content a bit.\n\nOne more thing, dont bother buying the DLC's unless you plan to actually play this. You wont be able to use anything from them until level 45-50, which takes a long time. It honestly makes the devs look really scummy not mentioning that in the DLC description, but scum will be scum I guess.\n\nIf you cant get this game for $10 or less just stay away. The devs obviously made this game to intentionally be some sort scam one way or another. With the lack of good video content online and the terrible wiki info, its clear most people realized what this game really was. Just another turd spray painted gold.

To the ARK players it was snail games who was responsible for all the shit that went down with ARK...(and they have done this to other games). With snail games behind the ropes bugs and fixes will be bottom of the list, Battle pass and paid DLC filled with gambling micro transactions are going to have that top spot.. snail games will strangle and bleed Angelica Games to pieces and leave them with a shit game",

      "review": "Myth of Empires offers a huge amount of content, maybe even too much – but it’s presented in such a chaotic and poorly explained way that you constantly need to look up guides or videos just to understand the basics.\n\n✔ Pros:\n• Extremely rich world with lots of potential.\n• Strong focus on crafting, building, and co-op gameplay.\n\n✘ Cons:\n❗ Confusing Crafting & Structures\n • Multiple workbenches for armor, weapons, different cages, and various building types – no clear explanation of what each is for.\n • The game provides no proper tutorials or in-game guidance, forcing you to use external guides.\n❗ Terrible Translation (English & German)\n • Many texts are poorly translated, making them misleading or completely wrong.\n • Crafting/building requirements are sometimes incorrect or unclear, leading to frustration.\n\n❗ Dedicated Server Issue\n • Simply couldnt join servers of the host even with port forwading and all the usual settings done.\n\n❗ LAN / Self-Hosted Server Issues – Major Problem\n • We wanted to play casually on a self-hosted LAN server, but it’s been a nightmare.\n • The server constantly loses its settings, even when run as admin.\n • Some settings (e.g., increased horse movement speed) don’t sync properly to all clients.\n • Every session starts with fixing server issues instead of actually playing.\n\n❗ DLCs Released While Core Issues Remain\n • Despite all these problems, paid DLCs are being released, while essential bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements are still missing.\n • This feels like the wrong priority and is very frustrating for players.\n\nConclusion:\nThis game could be an amazing sandbox experience, but right now it feels unfinished and frustrating.\nThe bad translations, confusing systems, and broken self-hosted servers make casual co-op play almost impossible.\n\n❌ Not recommended – at least until core issues are fixed and stability is improved.",

The screenshots and trailers make this game look so awesome. But it has possibly the worst UI and menu systems I've ever seen in a game. To overuse the trope - it was unplayable for me.\n\nIt's all the more frustrating because I'd been pining for an Asian-inspired survival/craft game for ages. Buy Sengoku Dynasty when it's on sale instead. Heck, DM me if you find something better lol",

All character movements are slow: swapping weapons, mounting horse, running, walking, archery. Npcs are a pain to talk to. UI is horrible. Lacking major QOL options. Edit: Now fought some bandits. I like directional combat, I've played Mount and Blade, Bellwright, Chivalry, and Mordau. This is the worst combat I've ever played. You can block an attack, go in for a counter and they can still beat you. so boring.",

You will grind for res and tames to build up it takes way to long to build and or craft anything almost max lvl crafter and it still takes 10+ to make a bow to have it break after firing a few arrows.  The biggest reason I'd say avoid this game is if you have any issues there is ZERO customer support outside of maintenance.  If you have any issues you're on your own.  Which will drive you crazy when it takes hour + to craft things.  All I can say is buy this game if really enjoy the grind of getting resources and no customer suppoort.",

      "review": "There is just way too many limitations for a game that is playable in single player. They hard coded numerous game mechanics so you cant adjust their settings. Things like Mining Hut build limit or a setting to make torches not require fuel. It really only shows a deep seeded disrespect for the people who play this game, not too mention the obvious pay to win stuff for official servers with the Gold currency and the way you can spend gold on enhancing skills.\n\nOverall this game is just a crappy Conan Exiles knock off. If it wasnt on sale for $10 I never would have bought it, even though I still feel cheated. With the limitations on customizing server settings, you either need a lot of other people to play with to get a good amount of the content or you suffer through a ridiculous grind for even the basic of gear, with most recipes requiring a crazy amount of materials. \n\nBase building is another major turn off. Im not sure how they accomplished it but they somehow made building worse than ARK. All the building in this game made me do was think about how ARK building was actually pretty good in comparison and made me want to take back all the stuff I said about it. It even made me think the logging simulator game Sons of the Forest had decent building. \n\nWith all of the bad stuff, the game has OK directional combat, even though blocking is pointless when you can just move out of your attackers swing. The map is huge and is not bad in its design, although some land formations dont really make sense in a real world view. There is a lot of content, you will get lost in the menus and will struggle to figure out whats what. The level cap is crazy, which is nice cause it spreads out the content a bit.\n\nOne more thing, dont bother buying the DLC's unless you plan to actually play this. You wont be able to use anything from them until level 45-50, which takes a long time. It honestly makes the devs look really scummy not mentioning that in the DLC description, but scum will be scum I guess.\n\nIf you cant get this game for $10 or less just stay away. The devs obviously made this game to intentionally be some sort scam one way or another. With the lack of good video content online and the terrible wiki info, its clear most people realized what this game really was. Just another turd spray painted gold. Do yourself a favor and just buy Conan Exiles, trust me, you wont regret it.",
