It's very enjoyable and dispatching extra members on missions is great too (ha! servants!).\n\nBad-ish: It comes in the format that's P2W / P2P mobile game. While you can somewhat play without paying, you'll slam headfirst into artificial-feeling difficulty walls that can only be surmounted by waiting / farming for days / weeks, or paying thousands to overcome them. For people who want to play a short time a day without caring about speedrunning this can work, but for others this can be horrible.  \n\nIf this game charged $60 as a one-time fee and allowed play and farming to be in your own pace, I would buy and recommend the living crap out of it because it really is a terrific concept with great potential. As it is I'd recommend you to try it until the moment you feel stuck in an unreasonable way.",

      "review": "Played this off and on since the mobile release. In short it's shockingly a solid Wizardry game despite being a gacha game.\n\nFor more info, in a world where the words \"mobile gacha game\" describe a game that caters to the lowest common denominator. Wizardry Daphne actually does something different where from the beginning. It's willing to have the player fail. \n\nFights are deadly, and someone going down gives you the question. Do you risk your main characters health to revive them, where you dying equals a game over? Or do you leave them dead with no chance to bring them back until you return to town? \n\nThe legendary characters just have unique mechanics and are not powerhouses to carry you through the game. You can even lose said legendary heroes to permadeath, granted you pretty much have to actively try for it happen. \n\nIt's bare minimum worth it to play through the first major dungeon, as it is a pretty good dungeon crawl. There's even a nice little story hook at after you finish it. \n\nIs it grindy?\nYes\nIs it gacha?\nYes\nDoes it feel like Wizardry?\nYes!\n\nOne thing I should add, I personally see this as a plus since I don't like making accounts for stuff, but this game does not use any email accounts. Instead it uses an ID that is saved locally so if you lose that you'll lose your progress. If this worries you then either back up your appdata or link the account id to another device from the options in the main menu.",

It's borrowed a bit from Dark Souls with the concept of an undead protagonist who can keep coming back from the grave until he wins.

The writing and game direction are good, and the Japanese voice acting is excellent, though if you go that route, there's a number of lines that are untranslated.\n\nFrankly I wish the developers had made this a standalone offline game that didn't need the obnoxious anti-cheat program; I'm enjoying it that much.",

      "review": "Warning: Huge wall of text!\n\nIf you're a fan of the series, dungeon crawlers - or just a glutton for punishment - then you'll feel right at home with Wizardry Daphne.\n\nFor those familiar with the series, this variant of the game is more like Tale of the Forsaken Land (Busin). The aesthetic of Daphne and TotFL are very similar with the combat, dungeons and mechanics also familiar. That's not to take anything away from either game as I believe they are both fantastic and I believe Daphne to be a much more in-depth and complete game with huge potential to grow.\n\nFor those who are fans of dungeon crawlers and classic RPG's, I would highly recommend giving this a shot. The dungeons themselves are vast, challenging, tricky and exhilarating. The story itself is huge and the replayability is endless - at the time of writing this, the game is currently in it's 1st year anniversary and I would gauge the story to be 5 core chapters, 3 replayable dungeons and 6 event story dungeons that are unlocked (rather than locked behind seasonal events like other mobile games). I currently have 80 hours in the game on Steam but I've over 200 with the mobile app (yes, this does have cross-progression!).\n\nAnd for those who love a challenge, dark souls-esque, you won't find many games quite as brutal as this. Battles around every corner, status afflictions and instant death mechanics, a permadeath for your characters (yes, although unlikely if you know what to do, there really is permadeath of your team members). For those looking for a challenging game that is unforgiving, I guarantee this will scratch that itch.\n\nNow to the review of the game itself and my opinions overall;\n\nIt's extremely challenging yet rewarding, you need to manage your team resources, items, loot and team composition every time you enter a dungeon. Some runs end in disaster whereas other runs could lead you on a roll for hours before you need to head back to town and restock. The unpredictability of a fresh dungeon respawn can cause you havoc each time you enter.\n\nThe graphics overall, are pretty good. Keep in mind that this game was/is designed for mobiles, they have done a pretty good job making the game look good for PC release. The soundtrack could be a lot better, especially considering some of the masterpieces from other games in the series.\n\nThe gacha element and worry of \"P2W\" is vastly exaggerated. Most of these comments view the game negatively as a gacha game when this is far, far from the truth. The game itself could be a standalone game and I'm not joking. The content in Daphne easily spans over 100 hours of gameplay, for free. There are a lot of AAA games these days which only provide a fraction of this time for £60 or more. The game is an RPG first and foremost with elements of gacha and payable services a distant second, you honestly never have to spend a penny in the game if you wanted. There are no \"P2W\" elements, the game is not PvP focused or competitive in that way and \"whaling\" on this game will only allow you to progress slightly quicker than normal. The real progress in Daphne is story progression, unlocking new gear with each chapter and surpassing levels caps. You won't find a single OP character in this game 1 hitting bosses, or gear that allows near invulnerability - far, far from it. I always find the payable transactions in the game as a way to support it and the developers.\n\nAs an added note regarding the negative reviews about this being a \"gacha\" game, which will \"ultimately close\" - that may happen, but not for a long time. When the game was released, Drecom had a rough launch but the developers communicated to the playerbase every step of the way. Drecom have stated multiple times that this game has far surpassed their expectations, both financially and on a player level. No one can predict the future, the game may close down in a year, two or more but for a FREE game that provides hundreds of hours and high quality content - I can't think of many games I have purchased which can provide this level of playability and active updates. The double edge sword of mobile games is their longevity - for however long this game lives, it will have provided many more hours of gamplay and updates then the games I will buy within its lifetime.  \n\nThe story in Daphne is, in my opinion, fantastic. Without spoiling - the end of the dungeon has such a huge twist which hugely impacts the story and replayability going forward. The game opens up massively upon your first clear and completely changes the way you play and how your decisions affect the story itself. When the game first came out and we finally got to this point, the playerbase was pretty shocked yet the game has gone from strength to strength since.\n\nThe second most important part of the game is your team and their equipment. Every character you summon is a viable team member, honestly. Each character has their own class, some even have multiple classes which allow for different team variations based on the skills they acquire. They have their own elements which are strong or weak against others, an alignment which makes for interesting team buffs and compositions, their own unique skills that provide party or alignment buffs and attack skills that uniquely enhance the character and class they play. Any character is viable and that is something you won't find in any other game like this. The equipment is also very unique, allowing any party member to shine in any role you want them to play. In addition to this, each chapter provides new gear and better stats which links your overall strength with story progression. There are a lot of elements to the team and equipment system, which is another in-depth side to this game which you would struggle to find elsewhere.\n\nOverall, this game is truly fantastic. One year down with many more to come, many more updates in the pipeline. I highly recommend this game",

The very first section is the beginning abyss, where you have the king who went to seal up the abyss but never came back. So the rest of the kingdom puts out a hefty reward for saving the King and that's where you come in after... a few grizzly circumstances. When it comes to the story this game gets dark very fast. So there is going to be some parts that will make you the player uncomfortable, so heads up.\r\n\r\nNow, this is a Wizardry game and let me be frank, every single Wizardry title is brutal in the difficulty department and the same goes for here.  This game features ambushes where enemies will just obliterate your entire team before you can make 1 turn. And yeah that happens a lot!  When you are in the beginning abyss and you see any quest for a bunny. Don't take that quest until your almost about to fight the big bad of that abyss. I still clench every time I see a damn bunny on the field.  Those little bastards  look so innocent and cute, if I had access to nukes, poison gas, a chainsaw, I would use it on Wizardry bunnies and those succubus. Those two enemies have a special place in hell.  You'll find out when you play this game.\r\n\r\nSo to deal with the difficulty of this game you the player make a team of 6  The main character is a wild card, So you need 5 more party members. You obtain party members from the ruins using reverse right hand mechanic which is a major plot device in the game. Your right hand can turn back time sorta. In the ruins you can restore junk items into equipment to use, and restoring bones is how you get adventurers. You have 3 rarities, Nameless -they don't talk, General - They talk and introduce themselves, Legendary - The rarest ones 5% rates on that one.  You get BP when you add them to your team and you will see basic stats like strength (Fighters, Knights, Thieves, Ninja's, Samurai main stat), dexterity (Thieves for opening chests and disarming them), Speed (Great stat for everyone) IQ ( Magic damage stat for mages),  Piety (Works on healing, divine damage spells, NOT buffs), Vitality (Don't put points)  Luck ( Who knows what it does, maybe Ninjas?)  Does BP matter in the long run? No, not at all. But IV does matter. Here is the short version. You have different copies with different stats. Example lets say you own 2 copies of Oliva  16str, 14dex, 9IQ, 9 Piety, 12 speed, 6 luck.  The 2nd Oliva has  14 str, 14 dex, 9 IQ, 9 Piety,  16 speed, 6 luck. First Oliva has str IV and the 2nd Oliva has speed IV the difference is a couple of stats and slighty better growth in stats. Last thing. Some general units are really good. Make sure to read their passive ability.\r\n\r\nThere is an inherit and discipline system in this game. I'll have to be brief with this or I will run out of characters for this review. So every character in this game that can be pulled in the ruins comes with a inherit skill or alternate inherit skill.  You can only inherit the initial skill/spell or alternative version. So you own a lv 60 Alice and put it into your MC (Main character) You only have that one skill she has, none of her other spells she learned.  You can make a extremely diverse team that can be ready for a lot of situations.  Discipline works if you have the exact same copy of a character. Lets say Debra  and another copy, you can then use the copy as a Discipline to increase her core stats and some other features. Also the inherit/discipline unit leaves for good after the action is over.  \r\n\r\nLet me be 100%  you can have a full team of legendaries out the gate and this game does not care, it will clap your cheeks,  and sometimes it just says screw you and hit you with a gut punch, next thing you know your main character is dead and you staring at the Fight again or Death screen. This game can be petty as hell when it wants to be. Speaking of petty you are quickly introduced to Lulunarde, who is a ghost. Shes your partner. She has sharp wit, can function as a tutorial, can throw out suggestions to help the player or be a complete bitch.\r\n\r\nHoly crap this game is hard, This game rolls out the welcome mat of come get your ass whooping. When you first start out, take baby steps, learn how to fight, rely on spells like sleep, level up when you get a chance. Which happens when you rest at the inn or stables if you broke broke or wanna save money ( Can get robbed for gold but gain 20 gems 1 time only)  There are some really sneaky down right diabolical difficulty moments in this game that makes me wanna rip out my hair.  1 The bunny quest.  If you know you know.  If I   could use a flamethrower and set the bunny on fire I would or just nuke the entire battlefield.  2. Any enemy team that harbors a succubus, These abominations  need to be hit with a steamroller and sent to hell. As of now we finally having access to equipment to deal with those guys. 3.  The 2nd Abyss fighting for a wish, If you know, you know. And finally abyss 3 difficulty spike. I'm dealing with this right now and its like everyone and their momma has their foot in my party's ass, I'm broke from the inn costs, upgrading gear to survive, scrolls.  And I just recently had chests explode on me, and then the slap in the face where I got a full  game over from failing to disarm a chest... WHAT!? \r\n\r\n I almost forgot every single Wizardry game has permadeath and this has been going on since the 1980's  In this game if your character dies, reaches 41 to 0 fortitude and you try reviving them at the Temple and if it fails they become ash. Fail to revive them again and they are lost for good. Fortitude can be restored over time. Either replace the character or take a break from the game. And then revive them around 50+ Fortitude. Don't lose a valuable unit over this. It's not worth it and easily avoidable.\r\n\r\nIf you want to find any information about this game, you have to check through community websites,  discords, or even streamers. A lot of the communities I went to are very nice and helpful when it comes to wizardry games and the series.  The game is already mean to the player makes no sense if the community would be bad too. I myself has checked in with the reddit and official discord of Wizardry Variants Daphne, I learned a lot. Still didn't beat any event yet. But one day I will. \r\n\r\nLets discuss the elephant of the room, the microtransactions. If this was a full release game I would buy for $40-$50 bucks easily but sadly its a live service gacha game like geez man. So, the game has two ways of doing things. You can buy stuff from the Wizardry Variants Daphne store. You log in with your ID which you can find a town tavern,  select friends or view messages and your ID is there. When making a new account you can obtain 800 gems one time only. And 50 gems each week.  When you log on to the website the you get better gems and purple gem ratio than in game store. And in game store those prices are crazy high for a lot of stuff.  Some packs are good value for like $1.29 up to $25  which can net you 1 bone or a legendary bone (100% legendary character)  Other packs are on the more expensive side, some are limited, some rotate weekly. The best in game purchases I've seen are the class change books. Each character can class change into an alternative class, and yes they keep their skills and spell from the previous class. However be aware some skills and spells are class related only.",

You can beat and enjoy everything without a single legendary character or dollar spent, and you can save up free gems to pull for legendary characters if that's what you need (dailies take like 2-3 mins to do). It's not a generous gacha by any means when it comes to pulls, but unlike others, it's a good game.\n\nI've been playing nonstop for a couple weeks, and I'll likely continue to log in and look around while eating or something.",

      "review": "I have to be clear about this in the very first sentence that this is a free to play gatcha game, a \"slot machine for nerds\" as a friend of mine (that I hooked on the game) put it. It is possible to play it without indulging in the gatcha elements but the chances are fairly good you will not want to avoid indulging in them if you get into this game. I freely admit this is the first gatcha game I have played where I actually cared about purchasing the gatcha elements and have spent some money doing so. Still, if this is the kind of thing that offends or repulses you, you can just skip this whole review.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, this game is actually an excellent dungeon crawler. It came out first for mobile devices and that's where I first played it, and this port is basically unchanged, to the point where the opening screen reads \"Tap to start\" as do a lot of other later screens that want you to \"tap\" to continue/dismiss them. The meat of the game remains a solid Wizardry-style game where you build a party of six adventurers and go into the depths of \"the Abyss\", a big dungeon with multiple floors, to rescue the king who has been abducted by some demonic entity called a Greater Warped One. This first part of the game is basically a long go through where you raid this big dungeon over and over to try and get down to the bottom level and save the king. Lots of NPCs will help you along the way as much as they can as you go deeper and deeper.\n\nThere is an actual plot and dialogue and most of the time you will forget you are playing a mobile game, or maybe you will forget that mobile games aren't supposed to be good, or at least are supposed to be more casual. This is definitely not a casual game and the mechanics start out fairly intricate already, even if the combat is relatively standard turn-based Wizardry stuff. The graphics are perfectly serviceable, but since they are meant to run smoothly on a mobile device they are not exciting, and the resolution is capped at 1920x1080. Still, the monsters and characters look pretty good, in an anime style way, and overall I have no complaints.\n\nThe gatcha comes in two varieties, the adventurers and the equipment. Very early on in the game you find out you have the magic power to \"reverse\" things with your right hand, and this (mainly) takes the form of turning bones into adventurers, and junk into equipment. You will get a bunch of bones and junk (especially junk) in the course of gameplay so you can pass on all the gatcha elements if you want and the game is still perfectly playable (and free). The equipment comes in a lot of varieties but the differences between the \"rare\" drops and the more common stuff is not great so you will probably care less about this gatcha, you'll get plenty of good gear eventually in the course of raiding the dungeon if you are patient.\n\nThe adventurers are the heart of the gatcha, so much so that they deserve more than one paragraph to discuss it. They come in three varieties. One is \"anonymous\" adventurers who have no name (well they do have a name but it's something like \"Human-Fig\" or \"Elf-Pri\", you can name them whatever you want if you keep them around), a backstory of one sentence, and no dialogue. These guys are mostly placeholders for the real, named adventurers, there to be in your party until you get named guys, or \"inherited\" for their skills (we'll come back to this later), or dismissed for their guild tags. The second type of adventurer is the \"general\" adventurer. These guys have names, backstories, dialogue (with some voice acting!), and personalities, and during the campaign you can talk to them and get to know them, expanding their backstories and their dialogue towards you. They also get a special skill that nobody else has, sometimes this special skill is pretty good, other times it is mediocre. The third type of adventurer is the \"legendary\" adventurer and they are identical to the general adventurers except that they have two special skills (instead of one) and usually they are pretty good, they also have a legendary special quest you can go on with them once you are good enough friends with them. The game will provide you with one legendary for free at the beginning and you'll even get to choose exactly who it is by selecting from a descriptive line. These are the people you will be bringing back to the land of the living when you find their bones and they will join you in your quest to save the king. When they are not actively adventuring with you, you can send the surplus ones on \"dispatches\" which are a \"ProgressQuest\" sort of deal where they wander off for several hours and come back with a detailed report of what they did while they were away, and probably with a bunch of xp and treasure.\n\nAll the adventurers have alignments (\"personalities\" in the game parlance) and the alignments affect how well they get along with you and the other adventurers, as well as what they say in dialogue. It's generally OK to have clashing alignments in your personal party but if you send people with clashing alignments on dispatches without you it's likely their disputes will lower morale and affect the outcome of the mission. It also takes you longer to be friends with an adventurer whose alignment opposes yours. Some adventurers give buffs to other adventurers of specific alignments if they are in the right position in the party, including you.\n\nIf you get bones of adventurers you don't really care to keep around, they will have skills that you can \"inherit\" to your existing characters - losing that adventurer, but giving the other adventurer who \"inherited\" them a new skill, and some of those are pretty good. If you get duplicates of adventurers you already have, the first one can absorb them for \"discipline\" and you lose the duplicate but the original adventurer gains a special \"discipline\" skill that improves their stats with levels along with even greater improvements to two different stats, depending on the adventurer. You can also \"dismiss\" extra adventurers and get their guild tags which you will need later on to improve your standing in the Guild and surpass certain level caps (you can get these guild tags in other ways though). You can \"inherit\" skills multiple times and they make that skill stronger (but needing more copies to make it stronger every time), and the same goes for \"discipline\". This is part of why the gatcha element of the adventurer's bones is so addictive, because even adventurers that you don't really care for or who are duplicates of current adventurers that you do use can help you in meaningful ways. Thankfully you can still indulge in this even if you spend no money because sometimes bones will be in chests or found in encounters, and additionally the game will provide you with the green gems you can use at the \"jeweler\" to play this slot machine during the course of normal gameplay, but the temptation to purchase things with real money from that same \"jeweler\" can be quite strong.\n\nBack to the actual game, you will think that you have basically figured things out when you get to the bottom of the dungeon and beat the final boss, but in the best way I can to avoid spoilers I will just say that there is a big plot twist and a bunch more dungeons open up and you can end up enjoying yourself in this game for a very long time. There is a big map with lots of places to go and dungeons to explore. You even get new ways to improve your character and other characters (that don't cost any money) as well as more plot.\n\nOverall this game is a ton of fun, it is definitely the best mobile game I have ever played hands down, but the PC port that I am reviewing here is quite serviceable and will provide you with hours and hours of enjoyment if dungeon crawlers are your thing. Probably the best pure dungeon crawler I have played in a very long time. To say I have been pleasantly surprised by this game is an understatement.",

Any time you lose, you can rewind to before the battle, three times per day. Also, companions have a rating from 1 to 100 which recharges slowly. However, when they die or get hit by traps or certain effects, it drops their fortitude giving a daily sense of attrition. If you try to rush through, it's possible for companions to permanently die, but if you wait -- from my understanding-- a day before trying to resurrect the companion at a temple, you can greatly increase you changes to resurrect them.\n\nI find these two resources makes me want to come back the next day to play some more.

The story is good and it has some interesting mechanics, and I have never felt like they are trying to force me to spend money on the game.

In short it's shockingly a solid Wizardry game despite being a gacha game.\n\nFor more info, in a world where the words \"mobile gacha game\" describe a game that caters to the lowest common denominator. Wizardry Daphne actually does something different where from the beginning. It's willing to have the player fail. \n\nFights are deadly, and someone going down gives you the question. Do you risk your main characters health to revive them, where you dying equals a game over? Or do you leave them dead with no chance to bring them back until you return to town? \n\nThe legendary characters just have unique mechanics and are not powerhouses to carry you through the game. You can even lose said legendary heroes to permadeath, granted you pretty much have to actively try for it happen. \n\nIt's bare minimum worth it to play through the first major dungeon, as it is a pretty good dungeon crawl. There's even a nice little story hook at after you finish it. \n\nIs it grindy?\nYes\nIs it gacha?\nYes\nDoes it feel like Wizardry?\nYes!\n\nOne thing I should add, I personally see this as a plus since I don't like making accounts for stuff, but this game does not use any email accounts. Instead it uses an ID that is saved locally so if you lose that you'll lose your progress.

      "review": "Warning: Huge wall of text!\n\nIf you're a fan of the series, dungeon crawlers - or just a glutton for punishment - then you'll feel right at home with Wizardry Daphne.\n\nFor those familiar with the series, this variant of the game is more like Tale of the Forsaken Land (Busin). The aesthetic of Daphne and TotFL are very similar with the combat, dungeons and mechanics also familiar. That's not to take anything away from either game as I believe they are both fantastic and I believe Daphne to be a much more in-depth and complete game with huge potential to grow.\n\nFor those who are fans of dungeon crawlers and classic RPG's, I would highly recommend giving this a shot. The dungeons themselves are vast, challenging, tricky and exhilarating. The story itself is huge and the replayability is endless - at the time of writing this, the game is currently in it's 1st year anniversary and I would gauge the story to be 5 core chapters, 3 replayable dungeons and 6 event story dungeons that are unlocked (rather than locked behind seasonal events like other mobile games). I currently have 80 hours in the game on Steam but I've over 200 with the mobile app (yes, this does have cross-progression!).\n\nAnd for those who love a challenge, dark souls-esque, you won't find many games quite as brutal as this. Battles around every corner, status afflictions and instant death mechanics, a permadeath for your characters (yes, although unlikely if you know what to do, there really is permadeath of your team members). For those looking for a challenging game that is unforgiving, I guarantee this will scratch that itch.\n\nNow to the review of the game itself and my opinions overall;\n\nIt's extremely challenging yet rewarding, you need to manage your team resources, items, loot and team composition every time you enter a dungeon. Some runs end in disaster whereas other runs could lead you on a roll for hours before you need to head back to town and restock. The unpredictability of a fresh dungeon respawn can cause you havoc each time you enter.\n\nThe graphics overall, are pretty good. Keep in mind that this game was/is designed for mobiles, they have done a pretty good job making the game look good for PC release. The soundtrack could be a lot better, especially considering some of the masterpieces from other games in the series.\n\nThe gacha element and worry of \"P2W\" is vastly exaggerated. Most of these comments view the game negatively as a gacha game when this is far, far from the truth. The game itself could be a standalone game and I'm not joking. The content in Daphne easily spans over 100 hours of gameplay, for free. There are a lot of AAA games these days which only provide a fraction of this time for £60 or more. The game is an RPG first and foremost with elements of gacha and payable services a distant second, you honestly never have to spend a penny in the game if you wanted. There are no \"P2W\" elements, the game is not PvP focused or competitive in that way and \"whaling\" on this game will only allow you to progress slightly quicker than normal. The real progress in Daphne is story progression, unlocking new gear with each chapter and surpassing levels caps. You won't find a single OP character in this game 1 hitting bosses, or gear that allows near invulnerability - far, far from it. I always find the payable transactions in the game as a way to support it and the developers.\n\nAs an added note regarding the negative reviews about this being a \"gacha\" game, which will \"ultimately close\" - that may happen, but not for a long time. When the game was released, Drecom had a rough launch but the developers communicated to the playerbase every step of the way. Drecom have stated multiple times that this game has far surpassed their expectations, both financially and on a player level. No one can predict the future, the game may close down in a year, two or more but for a FREE game that provides hundreds of hours and high quality content - I can't think of many games I have purchased which can provide this level of playability and active updates. The double edge sword of mobile games is their longevity - for however long this game lives, it will have provided many more hours of gamplay and updates then the games I will buy within its lifetime.  \n\nThe story in Daphne is, in my opinion, fantastic. Without spoiling - the end of the dungeon has such a huge twist which hugely impacts the story and replayability going forward. The game opens up massively upon your first clear and completely changes the way you play and how your decisions affect the story itself. When the game first came out and we finally got to this point, the playerbase was pretty shocked yet the game has gone from strength to strength since.\n\nThe second most important part of the game is your team and their equipment. Every character you summon is a viable team member, honestly. Each character has their own class, some even have multiple classes which allow for different team variations based on the skills they acquire. They have their own elements which are strong or weak against others, an alignment which makes for interesting team buffs and compositions, their own unique skills that provide party or alignment buffs and attack skills that uniquely enhance the character and class they play. Any character is viable and that is something you won't find in any other game like this. The equipment is also very unique, allowing any party member to shine in any role you want them to play. In addition to this, each chapter provides new gear and better stats which links your overall strength with story progression. There are a lot of elements to the team and equipment system, which is another in-depth side to this game which you would struggle to find elsewhere.\n\nOverall, this game is truly fantastic. One year down with many more to come, many more updates in the pipeline. I highly recommend this game",

Held back a bit by the presence of micro-transactions, but I've felt no pressure to pay for anything, even approaching 70 hours in. I've earned more than enough party members, almost more than I could possibly use, and even the most basic characters feel viable, including the unnamed \"generic\" heroes. Some things you could opt to buy even feel like bad options (skipping level cap exams, or buying gold).\n\nIf I had one major complaint, its leveling extra characters; some of the best strategies involve repeating the same quests (with the time travel mechanic) or waiting for daily quests. It's a blemish on the otherwise great pacing, and at times feels like its best to stick to one well rounded team instead of using party comp to tackle specific dungeons.\n\nI think the game's biggest drawback, and one I hesitate to even fault it for, is that the game's best plot hook comes at the end of the first dungeon, which may be upwards of 10+ hours to reach. If you dropped out before slaying Helmut once, give it another go, it gets very interesting very quickly!",

There’s no one-size-fits-all approach, as the content demands different strategies and setups.\r\n\r\nI personally finished the first Abyss after turning back time and managed to achieve a satisfying good ending. The sense of accomplishment was worth every moment spent strategizing!\r\n\r\nNow, let’s talk about the gacha system. Unless you’re a whale or the type who obsessively min-maxes everything for the perfect units, be prepared to spend a bit of money. However, if you’re not concerned about having the absolute best characters, you'll find that the game is quite manageable even with non-perfect units. As others have mentioned, factors like Stat IV and Bonus Points can still make a significant difference.\r\n\r\nIn summary, if you enjoy a game that challenges your skills and encourages strategic thinking, Wizardry Variants of Daphne is definitely worth a try!",

      "review": "*English Translation for the Global Community\n\n\nOne simple synopsis: A Game That Is not bad playing through, But Flawed in Every Other Conceivable Way\n\nBefore I begin this review, let's get one thing straight: at its core, this game is undeniably not bad. This is especially true for players like me who have experienced titles from the 2010s, like The Bard's Tale and the more recent Might and Magic series.\n\nWhen it comes to game reviews, I agree that the detailed, segmented analysis that YouTubers and professional review wannabes provide can be a device to show expertise. However, from a player's perspective, the most fundamental question is always the same: \"Is it fun or not?\"\n\nIf we set aside all the long-winded arguments and focus solely on that element of fun, this game is a clear pass. And yet, despite having that crucial factor, why is the game's overall reception \"Mixed\"? And why do I, too, have to give it a negative verdict? The reason is simple: everything else about the game, down to the most minuscule, trivial details, is just plain bad.\n\nYou'll see some \"old gamers\" making a big fuss about how this game is a true successor to the Wizardry series, but very few of them actually play it for a significant amount of time. The barrier to entry required by this game is so astronomically high that most players will quit before even clearing Chapters 1 or 2. I'll break down the game's shortcomings, starting with the incompetence of the developer, Drecom, and moving on to the in-game issues.\n\nFirst, Drecom, A Developer That Offers No Real Maintenance or Compensation\n\nThe game is already overflowing with bugs and errors. But even when these issues cause a consumer to lose a paid item they purchased, there is no compensation. Drecom either won't—or can't—provide a clear explanation for why the problem occurred. To put it simply, imagine you lost or had a $100 paid item swapped due to an error. Drecom offers zero compensation and provides no transaction history or explanation.\n\nThis points to Drecom's rock-bottom development capabilities and a profound lack of developer integrity and conscience, a stark contrast to the so-called \"artisan spirit\" or \"master craft\" whatever often found in other Japanese games. It's so pathetic that you'll frequently see community posts from players in various countries discussing plans to report Drecom to their respective consumer protection agencies. This is the result of countless customer service and operational problems: bugs, errors, neglect, and evasion of responsibility.\n\nNext, the In-Game Problems\n\n1. A Collection of Foolish and Failed Systems\n\nAs I'll explain below, this is the kind of game where you should just get one copy of a character and stop. If you only consider characters and equipment, the gacha is already a \"dual-gacha.\" But when skills and jobs are also held hostage in the gacha pool, it can become a triple or even quadruple-gacha. If it were like other mobile games where unlocking a single copy of a character is enough, it might be manageable.\n\nHowever, this game has a character enhancement system called 'Discipline' (こっき). As someone who initially thought, \"It's not a competitive game, so I can just take my time,\" I was infuriated by this system. Here's why:\n\nWhen you get a new character, you get between 5 and 10 Bonus Points (BP) to allocate to your stats. However, getting a high BP roll of 8 or more is incredibly rare, and most players have to settle for 5 or 6. But it doesn't end there. Character growth is also governed by a Random Number Generator (RNG). This means two characters of the same type and level, with the same starting BP, can have vastly different stats as they grow.\n\nThis hidden stat variance is called \"individual values\" in the Japanese community. In severe cases, it can create a \"blessed\" character versus a \"cursed\" character with a difference of up to 8 points in a key stat. The initial BP difference is at most 5 points, right? But this hidden \"individual value\" system is as infamous as the old-school P2W games where character stats were determined by dice rolls.\n\nBecause of this RNG in both BP and individual values, you can't even confidently use duplicate characters for enhancement. People who enhance their characters without knowing this system eventually find out their mistake is irreversible, leading them to either quit the game in shock or completely restart their accounts from scratch. And to make matters worse, the game provides zero explanation about this system, so unless you're a seasoned expert, you'd never know it exists.\n\n2. An Unbelievable Amount of Grinding\n\nSurprisingly, the game is technically F2P (Free-to-Play) possibly, a factor often valued in Western markets, but it is brutally difficult. You have to start by rerolling relentlessly to get top-tier characters and then commit to an insane amount of grinding. Not only is character growth RNG, but so is acquiring equipment and items. Items have different qualities (colors) and star ratings, and the difficulty of getting a good drop is nauseating.\n\nI play on both mobile and Steam, but there are F2P veterans whose playtime dwarfs mine. They spend hundreds of hours—several times my playtime—just to reach the third Abyss area. And once there, the third Abyss requires specific strategies and team compositions, forcing you into a tedious cycle: either spend real money or go back to grinding. And if you defiantly decide to spend money at that point...\n\n3. Expensive Gacha and Terrible Value\n\nYou'll find yourself in another dilemma due to the expensive gacha and cash shop items that offer terrible value for money. Premium currency in this game is nearly impossible to obtain outside of real-money purchases. The amount you can earn in-game is minuscule.\n\nIronically, in a game that gives out almost no freebies, the best hope for premium currency is when the developers fix one of their many chronic bugs and distribute compensation rewards as an apology. It creates a backward situation where you're actually hoping for more bugs to be found and fixed.\n\n4. Bugs, Errors, and CTDs\n\nAs mentioned, the staggering number of bugs, errors, and crashes will constantly hinder your progress.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nSetting aside the gacha and monetization models, if Drecom were to fix just the \"individual values\" and BP problems, I would actually encourage you to try this game. In major mobile games from large Korean or Japanese corporations, failed systems like these are either removed based on player feedback or revised to be more advantageous for the player. At the very least, they wouldn't make players agonize over something as trivial as whether to use a duplicate for enhancement.\n\nBut given Drecom's track record as I mentioned, I have zero faith they will ever fix this.\nFinally, I have a personal wish that you will think carefully before playing this game and not suffer like I did.",

      "review": "*English Translation for the Global Community\n\n\nOne simple synopsis: A Game That Is not bad playing through, But Flawed in Every Other Conceivable Way\n\nBefore I begin this review, let's get one thing straight: at its core, this game is undeniably not bad. This is especially true for players like me who have experienced titles from the 2010s, like The Bard's Tale and the more recent Might and Magic series.\n\nWhen it comes to game reviews, I agree that the detailed, segmented analysis that YouTubers and professional review wannabes provide can be a device to show expertise. However, from a player's perspective, the most fundamental question is always the same: \"Is it fun or not?\"\n\nIf we set aside all the long-winded arguments and focus solely on that element of fun, this game is a clear pass. And yet, despite having that crucial factor, why is the game's overall reception \"Mixed\"? And why do I, too, have to give it a negative verdict? The reason is simple: everything else about the game, down to the most minuscule, trivial details, is just plain bad.\n\nYou'll see some \"old gamers\" making a big fuss about how this game is a true successor to the Wizardry series, but very few of them actually play it for a significant amount of time. The barrier to entry required by this game is so astronomically high that most players will quit before even clearing Chapters 1 or 2. I'll break down the game's shortcomings, starting with the incompetence of the developer, Drecom, and moving on to the in-game issues.\n\nFirst, Drecom, A Developer That Offers No Real Maintenance or Compensation\n\nThe game is already overflowing with bugs and errors. But even when these issues cause a consumer to lose a paid item they purchased, there is no compensation. Drecom either won't—or can't—provide a clear explanation for why the problem occurred. To put it simply, imagine you lost or had a $100 paid item swapped due to an error. Drecom offers zero compensation and provides no transaction history or explanation.\n\nThis points to Drecom's rock-bottom development capabilities and a profound lack of developer integrity and conscience, a stark contrast to the so-called \"artisan spirit\" or \"master craft\" whatever often found in other Japanese games. It's so pathetic that you'll frequently see community posts from players in various countries discussing plans to report Drecom to their respective consumer protection agencies. This is the result of countless customer service and operational problems: bugs, errors, neglect, and evasion of responsibility.\n\nNext, the In-Game Problems\n\n1. A Collection of Foolish and Failed Systems\n\nAs I'll explain below, this is the kind of game where you should just get one copy of a character and stop. If you only consider characters and equipment, the gacha is already a \"dual-gacha.\" But when skills and jobs are also held hostage in the gacha pool, it can become a triple or even quadruple-gacha. If it were like other mobile games where unlocking a single copy of a character is enough, it might be manageable.\n\nHowever, this game has a character enhancement system called 'Discipline' (こっき). As someone who initially thought, \"It's not a competitive game, so I can just take my time,\" I was infuriated by this system. Here's why:\n\nWhen you get a new character, you get between 5 and 10 Bonus Points (BP) to allocate to your stats. However, getting a high BP roll of 8 or more is incredibly rare, and most players have to settle for 5 or 6. But it doesn't end there. Character growth is also governed by a Random Number Generator (RNG). This means two characters of the same type and level, with the same starting BP, can have vastly different stats as they grow.\n\nThis hidden stat variance is called \"individual values\" in the Japanese community. In severe cases, it can create a \"blessed\" character versus a \"cursed\" character with a difference of up to 8 points in a key stat. The initial BP difference is at most 5 points, right? But this hidden \"individual value\" system is as infamous as the old-school P2W games where character stats were determined by dice rolls.\n\nBecause of this RNG in both BP and individual values, you can't even confidently use duplicate characters for enhancement. People who enhance their characters without knowing this system eventually find out their mistake is irreversible, leading them to either quit the game in shock or completely restart their accounts from scratch. And to make matters worse, the game provides zero explanation about this system, so unless you're a seasoned expert, you'd never know it exists.\n\n2. An Unbelievable Amount of Grinding\n\nSurprisingly, the game is technically F2P (Free-to-Play) possibly, a factor often valued in Western markets, but it is brutally difficult. You have to start by rerolling relentlessly to get top-tier characters and then commit to an insane amount of grinding. Not only is character growth RNG, but so is acquiring equipment and items. Items have different qualities (colors) and star ratings, and the difficulty of getting a good drop is nauseating.\n\nI play on both mobile and Steam, but there are F2P veterans whose playtime dwarfs mine. They spend hundreds of hours—several times my playtime—just to reach the third Abyss area. And once there, the third Abyss requires specific strategies and team compositions, forcing you into a tedious cycle: either spend real money or go back to grinding. And if you defiantly decide to spend money at that point...\n\n3. Expensive Gacha and Terrible Value\n\nYou'll find yourself in another dilemma due to the expensive gacha and cash shop items that offer terrible value for money. Premium currency in this game is nearly impossible to obtain outside of real-money purchases. The amount you can earn in-game is minuscule.\n\nIronically, in a game that gives out almost no freebies, the best hope for premium currency is when the developers fix one of their many chronic bugs and distribute compensation rewards as an apology. It creates a backward situation where you're actually hoping for more bugs to be found and fixed.\n\n4. Bugs, Errors, and CTDs\n\nAs mentioned, the staggering number of bugs, errors, and crashes will constantly hinder your progress.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nSetting aside the gacha and monetization models, if Drecom were to fix just the \"individual values\" and BP problems, I would actually encourage you to try this game. In major mobile games from large Korean or Japanese corporations, failed systems like these are either removed based on player feedback or revised to be more advantageous for the player. At the very least, they wouldn't make players agonize over something as trivial as whether to use a duplicate for enhancement.\n\nBut given Drecom's track record as I mentioned, I have zero faith they will ever fix this.\nFinally, I have a personal wish that you will think carefully before playing this game and not suffer like I did.",

      "review": "*English Translation for the Global Community\n\n\nOne simple synopsis: A Game That Is not bad playing through, But Flawed in Every Other Conceivable Way\n\nBefore I begin this review, let's get one thing straight: at its core, this game is undeniably not bad. This is especially true for players like me who have experienced titles from the 2010s, like The Bard's Tale and the more recent Might and Magic series.\n\nWhen it comes to game reviews, I agree that the detailed, segmented analysis that YouTubers and professional review wannabes provide can be a device to show expertise. However, from a player's perspective, the most fundamental question is always the same: \"Is it fun or not?\"\n\nIf we set aside all the long-winded arguments and focus solely on that element of fun, this game is a clear pass. And yet, despite having that crucial factor, why is the game's overall reception \"Mixed\"? And why do I, too, have to give it a negative verdict? The reason is simple: everything else about the game, down to the most minuscule, trivial details, is just plain bad.\n\nYou'll see some \"old gamers\" making a big fuss about how this game is a true successor to the Wizardry series, but very few of them actually play it for a significant amount of time. The barrier to entry required by this game is so astronomically high that most players will quit before even clearing Chapters 1 or 2. I'll break down the game's shortcomings, starting with the incompetence of the developer, Drecom, and moving on to the in-game issues.\n\nFirst, Drecom, A Developer That Offers No Real Maintenance or Compensation\n\nThe game is already overflowing with bugs and errors. But even when these issues cause a consumer to lose a paid item they purchased, there is no compensation. Drecom either won't—or can't—provide a clear explanation for why the problem occurred. To put it simply, imagine you lost or had a $100 paid item swapped due to an error. Drecom offers zero compensation and provides no transaction history or explanation.\n\nThis points to Drecom's rock-bottom development capabilities and a profound lack of developer integrity and conscience, a stark contrast to the so-called \"artisan spirit\" or \"master craft\" whatever often found in other Japanese games. It's so pathetic that you'll frequently see community posts from players in various countries discussing plans to report Drecom to their respective consumer protection agencies. This is the result of countless customer service and operational problems: bugs, errors, neglect, and evasion of responsibility.\n\nNext, the In-Game Problems\n\n1. A Collection of Foolish and Failed Systems\n\nAs I'll explain below, this is the kind of game where you should just get one copy of a character and stop. If you only consider characters and equipment, the gacha is already a \"dual-gacha.\" But when skills and jobs are also held hostage in the gacha pool, it can become a triple or even quadruple-gacha. If it were like other mobile games where unlocking a single copy of a character is enough, it might be manageable.\n\nHowever, this game has a character enhancement system called 'Discipline' (こっき). As someone who initially thought, \"It's not a competitive game, so I can just take my time,\" I was infuriated by this system. Here's why:\n\nWhen you get a new character, you get between 5 and 10 Bonus Points (BP) to allocate to your stats. However, getting a high BP roll of 8 or more is incredibly rare, and most players have to settle for 5 or 6. But it doesn't end there. Character growth is also governed by a Random Number Generator (RNG). This means two characters of the same type and level, with the same starting BP, can have vastly different stats as they grow.\n\nThis hidden stat variance is called \"individual values\" in the Japanese community. In severe cases, it can create a \"blessed\" character versus a \"cursed\" character with a difference of up to 8 points in a key stat. The initial BP difference is at most 5 points, right? But this hidden \"individual value\" system is as infamous as the old-school P2W games where character stats were determined by dice rolls.\n\nBecause of this RNG in both BP and individual values, you can't even confidently use duplicate characters for enhancement. People who enhance their characters without knowing this system eventually find out their mistake is irreversible, leading them to either quit the game in shock or completely restart their accounts from scratch. And to make matters worse, the game provides zero explanation about this system, so unless you're a seasoned expert, you'd never know it exists.\n\n2. An Unbelievable Amount of Grinding\n\nSurprisingly, the game is technically F2P (Free-to-Play) possibly, a factor often valued in Western markets, but it is brutally difficult. You have to start by rerolling relentlessly to get top-tier characters and then commit to an insane amount of grinding. Not only is character growth RNG, but so is acquiring equipment and items. Items have different qualities (colors) and star ratings, and the difficulty of getting a good drop is nauseating.\n\nI play on both mobile and Steam, but there are F2P veterans whose playtime dwarfs mine. They spend hundreds of hours—several times my playtime—just to reach the third Abyss area. And once there, the third Abyss requires specific strategies and team compositions, forcing you into a tedious cycle: either spend real money or go back to grinding. And if you defiantly decide to spend money at that point...\n\n3. Expensive Gacha and Terrible Value\n\nYou'll find yourself in another dilemma due to the expensive gacha and cash shop items that offer terrible value for money. Premium currency in this game is nearly impossible to obtain outside of real-money purchases. The amount you can earn in-game is minuscule.\n\nIronically, in a game that gives out almost no freebies, the best hope for premium currency is when the developers fix one of their many chronic bugs and distribute compensation rewards as an apology. It creates a backward situation where you're actually hoping for more bugs to be found and fixed.\n\n4. Bugs, Errors, and CTDs\n\nAs mentioned, the staggering number of bugs, errors, and crashes will constantly hinder your progress.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nSetting aside the gacha and monetization models, if Drecom were to fix just the \"individual values\" and BP problems, I would actually encourage you to try this game. In major mobile games from large Korean or Japanese corporations, failed systems like these are either removed based on player feedback or revised to be more advantageous for the player. At the very least, they wouldn't make players agonize over something as trivial as whether to use a duplicate for enhancement.\n\nBut given Drecom's track record as I mentioned, I have zero faith they will ever fix this.\nFinally, I have a personal wish that you will think carefully before playing this game and not suffer like I did.",

Looks pretty high quality, but I just feel like I'm wasting my time playing a gacha game, when I know the servers will eventually close in the next couple years like other non-super-successful gacha mobile games. Hope this gets a normal release, will pay full price for it! But for now, I'll just uninstall this game, there are some many good Dungeon Crawlers, no need to waste time in a gacha one with a time bomb on the servers.",

Great gacha game, but its a fucking gacha game.\r\nLoved every aspect of it, but the fact its a live service gacha ruins it because you cant just progress normally, a bunch of characters are locked behind the gacha and you know its just another game you will never be able to beat cause live service (its not a huge success, so its likely to die in 1~2 years like most gacha games). Unfortunate, but if we're lucky, it might be released in the future as a single player without the gacha element (massive cope)",

      "review": "Long story short; A good old school rpg dungeon crawler with a unique system, character models, and story, only to be covered up with an extremely greedy prices, forced online universal timer, a really poor gacha system with no pity pulls, and an unnecessary and repetitive grind for ingredients and levels.\n\nI would say the only good thing about this game is it's creative story and rpg mechanics to the point you don't think this is originally a mobile game. They have a a sanity bar which is basically managing your team's sanity when they get revived or hurt outside of combat, and the game lets your party characters get skills or stat boost from inheriting from your useless characters.\n\nThe rest is just DOG HORRIBLE\nThe game is SINGLEPLAYER and you are REQUIRED to play online because they have banners and a universal timer which emphasizes you to wait IRL hours to progress the game.\nIt heavily pushes expensive, limited-time gacha banners and some only appear once or twice a year. And characters that are actually good are gone since it's a one and done.\nAnd not only that, most of the gacha pulls you get are just throwaway characters that become useless after leveling up your characters and inheriting those said throwaways' specific skills.\nTo follow-up, there is only a limited amount of those throwaway characters so you don't even get a variety of skills or unique stat boosts to pick.\nAlmost all in-game purchases require real money, with minimal use for in-game currency outside of transferring skills and upgrading weapons.\nTo make things worse, the game doesn’t properly your save progress so you have to manually back up your login info so you don't lose everything you worked and spent for.",

Sure it is a dungeon crawl but you don't even get to really make your character. You are just given one. Spoilers I know. The mechanics to the game seem solid but they are paywalled behind crap systems. Like why can't I stack two of the same pulls to make a better one? If I can why is it not easier to find out how? There seems to be promise to this but until they remove that mobile grabage I can't recommend. And to think I have only payed for a few hours.
