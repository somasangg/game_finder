      "review": "**[h1]Action Taimanin: A Wild, Over-the-Top Ride Through the Shadows[/h1]**\n\n**[b]Overall Impression[/b]**  \nMan, where do I even start with *Action Taimanin*? I've sunk over 120 hours into this game at this point - mostly late nights when I just wanted to zone out and punch some demons - and I can confidently say it's one of the most aggressively fun, unapologetically weird games I've ever played. It's not perfect by any stretch, but if you're into fast-paced action, anime chaos, and a storyline that doesn't take itself too seriously (until it absolutely does), this game will grab you by the collar and drag you through hell with a grin. It's like *Devil May Cry* had a baby with a hentai visual novel, and that baby grew up to be a ninja assassin with a chainsaw katana. Yeah, it's that kind of game.\n\n**[b]Gameplay Mechanics[/b]**  \nLet's break it down. Combat is *Action Taimanin*'s bread and butter, and it's surprisingly deep for what looks like a flashy beat-'em-up. You've got a roster of Taimanin (female ninja operatives) to choose from, each with unique weapons, skills, and playstyles. I mained Asagi, because nothing says “badass” like dual-wielding swords and teleport slashes, but I've dabbled with Sakura, Igawa, and even the DLC characters like Murasaki. The combos are tight, the dodge mechanic (with its brief invincibility frames) feels responsive, and chaining together aerial attacks, ground slams, and ultimate moves is *chef's kiss*.\n\nThe progression system is solid - leveling up your characters, upgrading their skills, and unlocking new gear keeps things fresh. But here's the kicker: the game leans *hard* into gacha mechanics. Want that S-rank weapon or that exclusive costume with stat boosts? Better roll the in-game currency, which you earn slowly or can buy with real money. I've managed to avoid spending cash, but it's definitely there, lurking in the menus like a hungry demon. If you're not into grinding for drops, you might get frustrated, especially in the later stages when enemy HP balloons.\n\nExploration is pretty linear - most missions are corridor-based brawls with occasional branching paths - but there's a weird charm in how much content is crammed into each level. Hidden items, optional bosses, and side quests pop up often enough to keep you poking around. Puzzles? Not really a thing here. This is all about slicing, dicing, and dodging. But hey, sometimes you just want to cut loose, right?\n\nOne gripe: the camera can get *janky* during big fights, especially in enclosed spaces. And don't get me started on some of the later mission objectives - defend this NPC for 90 seconds while waves of enemies spawn? That's not fun; that's tedious. Still, the combat is so satisfying that I usually push through.\n\n**[b]Graphics and Sound[/b]**  \nVisually, *Action Taimanin* is a mixed bag - but mostly in a good way. The character models are gorgeous, with detailed animations and a ton of customization options. The art style nails that Japanese anime aesthetic, especially during cutscenes, which are dripping with drama and... well, fanservice. If you're into that sort of thing (and let's be real, if you're playing this game, you probably are), you'll be happy. Enemy designs range from cool to outright goofy - there's a boss that's literally a giant sentient d*ck with arms - but in a game this absurd, it kinda works.\n\nEnvironments are decent but repetitive. You'll fight in demon-infested labs, neon-lit city streets, and ancient Japanese temples, but after the 10th time running through a warehouse with flickering lights, you start to wonder if the level designer took a shortcut. Still, the lighting effects and particle work during combat make up for it - seeing Asagi's sword ignite with fire magic while she's flipping through the air never gets old.\n\nSoundtrack? Fire. The opening theme alone is worth the price of admission. The OST mixes traditional Japanese instruments with heavy synth and rock, creating this perfect blend of feudal and futuristic. Voice acting is hit or miss - some characters are voiced with serious intensity, others sound like they're reading lines in a booth after a long lunch - but it's all part of the charm. Weapon slashes, demon roars, and the satisfying *thwack* of a finishing move are all top-notch. Crank up the volume, especially with headphones.\n\n**[b]Story and Characters[/b]**  \nOkay, real talk: the story is bonkers. It starts as a straightforward “ninjas vs. demons” setup, but quickly spirals into government conspiracies, interdimensional rifts, and a villain who's basically a demonic Elon Musk with a god complex. The writing is cheesy as hell, but in a way that's endearing if you lean into it. Some characters get actual development - like Fuuma Kotaro, who starts off as a typical edgy antihero but slowly reveals layers of trauma and ambition. Others? They're there to look hot and slice things. And honestly? That's fine.\n\nThe worldbuilding is surprisingly fleshed out for a game that's mostly about combat. There's lore hidden in item descriptions, side conversations, and optional missions. If you're into the Taimanin universe (which originated from visual novels and manga), you'll appreciate the nods to the source material. If not, it's still easy enough to jump in and enjoy the ride. Just don't expect Shakespeare - this is more like a B-movie action flick with boobs and blood splatter.\n\n**[b]Personal Experience[/b]**  \nI'll never forget the first time I fought the giant spider-demon in Chapter 5. I was under-leveled, out of healing items, and the camera kept getting stuck behind walls. I died six times in a row, swearing at my monitor like it owed me money. Then, on the seventh try, I nailed a perfect parry, triggered a slow-mo kill streak, and finished her off with a super move that lit the whole screen on fire. I actually cheered out loud. My roommate thought I'd gone insane.\n\nAnother moment: playing through the “What If” scenarios after beating the main story. Seeing alternate versions of characters - like a brainwashed Sakura going full yandere - was equal parts disturbing and fascinating. It's clear the devs had fun with these side stories, and it shows.\n\nOh, and the fan service? It's *everywhere*. Costumes, victory poses, dialogue choices that lead to... *intimate* scenes. If you're not into that, you can skip it, but it's woven into the progression system (some stat boosts only come from “bonding” missions). I personally just toggle on the “skip all H-scenes” mod from the Steam Workshop and call it a day.\n\n**[b]Recommendation[/b]**  \nSo, should you buy it?  \nIf you're a fan of character action games, anime aesthetics, and don't mind a little (or a lot) of ecchi content, *absolutely*. It's not going to win Game of the Year, but it's a blast if you're in the mood for something chaotic and stylish. The combat is tight, the customization is deep, and the sheer amount of content - main missions, side ops, challenge modes, and endless gear farming - will keep you busy for a long time.\n\nBut if you're looking for a deep narrative experience, hate grinding, or are easily offended by... *suggestive* character designs, maybe steer clear. Also, the game *does* have some rough edges - camera issues, repetitive level design, and the ever-present temptation to spend real money on gacha pulls.\n\nThat said, I've had more $20 well spent than I care to admit. *Action Taimanin* is dumb fun with heart, and sometimes, that's exactly what you need. Just go in with your eyes open - and maybe a controller in hand.",

Just don't expect Shakespeare - this is more like a B-movie action flick with boobs and blood splatter.\n\n**[b]Personal Experience[/b]**  \nI'll never forget the first time I fought the giant spider-demon in Chapter 5. I was under-leveled, out of healing items, and the camera kept getting stuck behind walls. I died six times in a row, swearing at my monitor like it owed me money. Then, on the seventh try, I nailed a perfect parry, triggered a slow-mo kill streak, and finished her off with a super move that lit the whole screen on fire. I actually cheered out loud. My roommate thought I'd gone insane.\n\nAnother moment: playing through the “What If” scenarios after beating the main story. Seeing alternate versions of characters - like a brainwashed Sakura going full yandere - was equal parts disturbing and fascinating. It's clear the devs had fun with these side stories, and it shows.\n\nOh, and the fan service? It's *everywhere*. Costumes, victory poses, dialogue choices that lead to... *intimate* scenes. If you're not into that, you can skip it, but it's woven into the progression system (some stat boosts only come from “bonding” missions). I personally just toggle on the “skip all H-scenes” mod from the Steam Workshop and call it a day.\n\n**[b]Recommendation[/b]**  \nSo, should you buy it?  \nIf you're a fan of character action games, anime aesthetics, and don't mind a little (or a lot) of ecchi content, *absolutely*. It's not going to win Game of the Year, but it's a blast if you're in the mood for something chaotic and stylish. The combat is tight, the customization is deep, and the sheer amount of content - main missions, side ops, challenge modes, and endless gear farming - will keep you busy for a long time.\n\nBut if you're looking for a deep narrative experience, hate grinding, or are easily offended by... *suggestive* character designs, maybe steer clear. Also, the game *does* have some rough edges - camera issues, repetitive level design, and the ever-present temptation to spend real money on gacha pulls.\n\nThat said, I've had more $20 well spent than I care to admit. *Action Taimanin* is dumb fun with heart, and sometimes, that's exactly what you need. Just go in with your eyes open - and maybe a controller in hand.",

You can simply acquire the characters (except Annerose) when you have enough gems which you can generate pretty quickly if you're patient.\n\nThe only thing that requires real money are the limited skins for characters in packages or battle passes. But other than that, you can get everything else for free when you play enough daily.\n\nAs an action game though? It's bad. The controls are abyssmal. There is likely no I-frames for dodges and it has cooldown. Attack cancel is clanky. And the targeting is way too strong. Enemies also attack in swarm giving you no time to breathe while evading their attacks.\nIn addition with those bad controls, missions have conditions to get stars. And in the hard difficulty, one of those conditions is \"Get hit less than 30 times\" which is doable but frustrating to clear. The best solution is to basically defeat the enemies before they can jump you.\n\nTLDR: This game is a good waifu collector for the gooners and Taimanin fans, but has terrible gameplay for combat. Skill issue? Maybe. Or maybe not. You decide.",

Who the hell programmed this garbage, and why hasn't the obvious resume liar been canned and replaced with someone who knows how to do network programming? This is ridiculous. I'm deleting this trash and never looking back.",

I figured it's linked to steam they even say it themselves that it auto links to steam but apparently not for me. So uninstall and removed from account since they have such a garbage account linking system.",
