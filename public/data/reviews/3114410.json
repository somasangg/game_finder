On mobile, it’s even worse, your placement screen immediately covers the entire UI, and there’s no way to clear it before the fight information disappears.\n\nFor a competitive game, this makes the learning curve frustrating. The combat log offers almost no detail beyond basic damage numbers, and there’s no way to review the actual sequence of events from the fight. A more accessible, persistent combat log or replay-style breakdown would go a long way in helping players improve.\n\nThe game also really needs a match history and the ability to view complete builds after a match ends, similar to what most other competitive titles provide. Without these tools, it’s hard to understand how a fight played out or what decisions led to the outcome.\n\nBalance is another concern. New heroes often launch overtuned, and adjustments tend to happen slowly\n\n------------------------\n\nUpdate : I have a free account where i have no tarots and i have a main account with 2500 tarots won from playing in tournament.\n\nOn my free account, the game feels challenging and i have to play with limited tools, my main account feels like an entirely different game. I can just choose whatever i want or whatever I need most of the time. It honestly feels like an entirely different game / experience.\n\nThe RNG with crit and dodge is awful. Sometimes, even when crit isnt in the lobby, youll be crit by things for your entire life bar just because of some dumb 15% chance to crit that the enemy has by default. \nThese crits decide entire lobbies. For example, i was fighting someone with 5k health and they where stunned but they got a single ult off during a tiny stun gap and they one shot me with a crit ultimate. (Crit damage is honestly too high imo, its like 250% dmg by default)\n\nI said it before and ill say it again, this game feels like a slot machine where sometimes you win and youre feeling high and other times you lose and it feels lame and out of your control.\n\nThere is skill to this game and ways to express that but its not always the case. You will get screwed over by dumb RNG and that's the way it is.

But the dev's do weird things to make it seem like its not a bot, like coming up with AI generated names for the bots that are usually different but tend to be dumb generic names or some symbols. If you surrender the game, a bot just takes your place and plays for you. So if youre in a 1v1 vs someone and the game is going to go for 5 more rounds until its over, even if you surrender, the other player is just stuck in a lobby killing your bot for the next 5 minutes. The game doesnt end when you surrender like every other auto battle game. \n\nthe excess of bots and the hiding of bots is trrrrrrrrrrrrash.

When a match ends, you only get about 0–2 seconds to review what actually happened. On mobile, it’s even worse, your placement screen immediately covers the entire UI, and there’s no way to clear it before the fight information disappears.\n\nFor a competitive game, this makes the learning curve frustrating. The combat log offers almost no detail beyond basic damage numbers, and there’s no way to review the actual sequence of events from the fight. A more accessible, persistent combat log or replay-style breakdown would go a long way in helping players improve.\n\nThe game also really needs a match history and the ability to view complete builds after a match ends, similar to what most other competitive titles provide. Without these tools, it’s hard to understand how a fight played out or what decisions led to the outcome.\n\nBalance is another concern. New heroes often launch overtuned, and adjustments tend to happen slowly\n\n------------------------\n\nUpdate : I have a free account where i have no tarots and i have a main account with 2500 tarots won from playing in tournament.\n\nOn my free account, the game feels challenging and i have to play with limited tools, my main account feels like an entirely different game. I can just choose whatever i want or whatever I need most of the time. It honestly feels like an entirely different game / experience.\n\nThe RNG with crit and dodge is awful. Sometimes, even when crit isnt in the lobby, youll be crit by things for your entire life bar just because of some dumb 15% chance to crit that the enemy has by default. \nThese crits decide entire lobbies. For example, i was fighting someone with 5k health and they where stunned but they got a single ult off during a tiny stun gap and they one shot me with a crit ultimate. (Crit damage is honestly too high imo, its like 250% dmg by default)\n\nI said it before and ill say it again, this game feels like a slot machine where sometimes you win and youre feeling high and other times you lose and it feels lame and out of your control.\n\nThere is skill to this game and ways to express that but its not always the case. You will get screwed over by dumb RNG and that's the way it is. Crit branch and dodge branch are just lame af.\n\n------------------------------\n\nAlso, why doesn't the game tell you who you're fighting next when it is already known and the info is available in the combat history. Whoever you fight on turn 1, you will fight 7 turns later. So 1-8, 2-9. 3-10, 4-11 etc.  You have to go through this awful combat log to find out who's next for no reason.\n\n__________________\n\nOn the NA server, and im sure on others, the lobbies are always filled with bots. On NA is like 60% bots in every lobby which makes the game feel so boring. Id rather wait twice or three times as long of a que to get a lobby filled with players. But the dev's do weird things to make it seem like its not a bot, like coming up with AI generated names for the bots that are usually different but tend to be dumb generic names or some symbols. If you surrender the game, a bot just takes your place and plays for you. So if youre in a 1v1 vs someone and the game is going to go for 5 more rounds until its over, even if you surrender, the other player is just stuck in a lobby killing your bot for the next 5 minutes.

Then you start to be aware it is purely pay to win, which is understandable as they want to make profit out of it, and it is more dedicated on selling winning than selling skins, additional heroes, content etc. There is almost no skill required to play this game it is like 80% random roll, you just need to know for what skills to roll. And you get more chances on random rolls when you pay. You got more chances on rolling heros, more heroes to choose from, more chances on rolling treasures. Which basically decides on your chances of winning. It is still possible to get some heroes and additional rolls with playing the game. But you would spend whole days doing so. I managed to be 3 times overking level, but still I would recommend other game if you like to invest your time and not money on winnign. For casual plays like 1-2 times per day it can be fun.",

      "review": "Skill Legends Royale has a lot of potential, but right now it’s held back by how difficult it is to learn from your losses. When a match ends, you only get about 0–2 seconds to review what actually happened. On mobile, it’s even worse, your placement screen immediately covers the entire UI, and there’s no way to clear it before the fight information disappears.\n\nFor a competitive game, this makes the learning curve frustrating. The combat log offers almost no detail beyond basic damage numbers, and there’s no way to review the actual sequence of events from the fight. A more accessible, persistent combat log or replay-style breakdown would go a long way in helping players improve.\n\nThe game also really needs a match history and the ability to view complete builds after a match ends, similar to what most other competitive titles provide. Without these tools, it’s hard to understand how a fight played out or what decisions led to the outcome.\n\nBalance is another concern. New heroes often launch overtuned, and adjustments tend to happen slowly\n\n------------------------\n\nUpdate : I have a free account where i have no tarots and i have a main account with 2500 tarots won from playing in tournament.\n\nOn my free account, the game feels challenging and i have to play with limited tools, my main account feels like an entirely different game. I can just choose whatever i want or whatever I need most of the time. It honestly feels like an entirely different game / experience.\n\nThe RNG with crit and dodge is awful. Sometimes, even when crit isnt in the lobby, youll be crit by things for your entire life bar just because of some dumb 15% chance to crit that the enemy has by default. \nThese crits decide entire lobbies. For example, i was fighting someone with 5k health and they where stunned but they got a single ult off during a tiny stun gap and they one shot me with a crit ultimate. (Crit damage is honestly too high imo, its like 250% dmg by default)\n\nI said it before and ill say it again, this game feels like a slot machine where sometimes you win and youre feeling high and other times you lose and it feels lame and out of your control.\n\nThere is skill to this game and ways to express that but its not always the case. You will get screwed over by dumb RNG and that's the way it is. Crit branch and dodge branch are just lame af.\n\n------------------------------\n\nAlso, why doesn't the game tell you who you're fighting next when it is already known and the info is available in the combat history. Whoever you fight on turn 1, you will fight 7 turns later. So 1-8, 2-9. 3-10, 4-11 etc.  You have to go through this awful combat log to find out who's next for no reason.\n\n__________________\n\nOn the NA server, and im sure on others, the lobbies are always filled with bots. On NA is like 60% bots in every lobby which makes the game feel so boring. Id rather wait twice or three times as long of a que to get a lobby filled with players. But the dev's do weird things to make it seem like its not a bot, like coming up with AI generated names for the bots that are usually different but tend to be dumb generic names or some symbols. If you surrender the game, a bot just takes your place and plays for you. So if youre in a 1v1 vs someone and the game is going to go for 5 more rounds until its over, even if you surrender, the other player is just stuck in a lobby killing your bot for the next 5 minutes. The game doesnt end when you surrender like every other auto battle game. \n\nthe excess of bots and the hiding of bots is trrrrrrrrrrrrash. They should just merge the servers together because latency doesnt matter too much in this game (although it can have some impact if you experience lag during a big roll down, lets say you have 3k+ gold youre trying to spend in a turn). Having one server would allow for a casual que and an actual ranked que with bans with would make the game alot better since the new heroes they add are extremely overpowered",
