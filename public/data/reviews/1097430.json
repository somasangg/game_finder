It's a special kind of cookie clicker but this time with anime girls and booba\n\nGetting things out of the way, yes the game is a gacha, is riddled with predatory micro-transactions, pop-ups here and there. This is a valid criticism of the game, however, the game is very F2P friendly\n\nNow hearing that term doesn't immediately discredit the claims going around, but YOU can definitely play this game without spending a dime. The only question is how fast you want to do it\n\nThe devs themselves give out events granting you 3000x Diamonds every single week in their Discord in a form of claimable public code not including in-game events, (for context one 10 pull is equivalent to 1000 Diamonds) there's also events that give you Sanguine Stones which is their second form of currency in your mail very frequently and in-game events spanning for weeks, months or just playable stuff. There's also the gold auction where you can barter for gold with in-game trading with other players where you can use it to buy Sanguine Stones\n\nIn-short what I'm trying to say is that the devs are VERY, very generous and that's underestimating how generous they are. If you also want to spend there's great value too\n\nThe game offers permanent bonuses for a one-time purchase. You know those other gacha games like Genshin/WuWa/HSR where they offer a monthly pass and you get their currency for pulling every day? This game offers it at a very cheap price and you have it permanently, and you get 300 Diamonds everyday and 30 Sanguine Stones\n\nFor context:\n10x Diamond Pull is equal to 1000 Diamonds\n10x Sanguine Stone Pull is equal to 300 Sanguine stones\n\nIt's not a bad deal including multiple permanent bonuses too many to count\n\nAND BY THE WAY, DIAMONDS ARE FARMABLE IN-GAME. IT'S RIDICULOUSLY EASY TOO\n\nThe reason why I'm telling all the value of this is because, the game is way too f2p friendly, devs are too generous and this game is made by a small indie team and they know what makes a gacha horrible and they do everything they can to ease up the burden on players\n\nThese devs are gacha players themselves and they made a game where gacha isn't a horrible predatory hole where you have to focus on it to have a chance of competing against bigger whales. Every single pull has a way to matter and every single character has a use whether it be for processing front levels, awakening, material etc.\n\nYou can enjoy this game without paying, and if you want to support the devs one-time at least, purchase the lifetime pass, they deserve it. The game is incredibly fun, dopamine inducing, numbers increasing type game. It's a bunch of fun, and I hope that they get the recognition this game deserves",

      "review": "This game obviously isn't for everyone, it's definitely not a \"main\" game that you should spend all your time into, but it's definitely dopamine inducing fun if you have time to waste and just want to see numbers go up. It's a special kind of cookie clicker but this time with anime girls and booba\n\nGetting things out of the way, yes the game is a gacha, is riddled with predatory micro-transactions, pop-ups here and there. This is a valid criticism of the game, however, the game is very F2P friendly\n\nNow hearing that term doesn't immediately discredit the claims going around, but YOU can definitely play this game without spending a dime. The only question is how fast you want to do it\n\nThe devs themselves give out events granting you 3000x Diamonds every single week in their Discord in a form of claimable public code not including in-game events, (for context one 10 pull is equivalent to 1000 Diamonds) there's also events that give you Sanguine Stones which is their second form of currency in your mail very frequently and in-game events spanning for weeks, months or just playable stuff. There's also the gold auction where you can barter for gold with in-game trading with other players where you can use it to buy Sanguine Stones\n\nIn-short what I'm trying to say is that the devs are VERY, very generous and that's underestimating how generous they are. If you also want to spend there's great value too\n\nThe game offers permanent bonuses for a one-time purchase. You know those other gacha games like Genshin/WuWa/HSR where they offer a monthly pass and you get their currency for pulling every day? This game offers it at a very cheap price and you have it permanently, and you get 300 Diamonds everyday and 30 Sanguine Stones\n\nFor context:\n10x Diamond Pull is equal to 1000 Diamonds\n10x Sanguine Stone Pull is equal to 300 Sanguine stones\n\nIt's not a bad deal including multiple permanent bonuses too many to count\n\nAND BY THE WAY, DIAMONDS ARE FARMABLE IN-GAME. IT'S RIDICULOUSLY EASY TOO\n\nThe reason why I'm telling all the value of this is because, the game is way too f2p friendly, devs are too generous and this game is made by a small indie team and they know what makes a gacha horrible and they do everything they can to ease up the burden on players\n\nThese devs are gacha players themselves and they made a game where gacha isn't a horrible predatory hole where you have to focus on it to have a chance of competing against bigger whales. Every single pull has a way to matter and every single character has a use whether it be for processing front levels, awakening, material etc.\n\nYou can enjoy this game without paying, and if you want to support the devs one-time at least, purchase the lifetime pass, they deserve it. The game is incredibly fun, dopamine inducing, numbers increasing type game. It's a bunch of fun, and I hope that they get the recognition this game deserves",
