Even as someone with experience in other card games (like Magic, Hearthstone, and Pokémon), I found this game refreshingly straightforward while still offering plenty of depth in deck-building.\n\nProgression & Rewards:The game is very generous with packs and cards, especially for new players. I don’t agree with the negative comments about it being “pay-to-win” — from my experience, you can progress and build competitive decks without needing to spend money.\n\nMatchmaking & Playerbase Despite the game’s relatively modest budget and smaller playerbase, the matchmaking is excellent. Matches are found within seconds, which is impressive. A lot of Chinese players seem to be active, which helps keep the community lively.\n\nOverall Impression: This is honestly one of the best free-to-play card games I’ve tried. It combines simplicity with strategic depth, fair progression, and quick matchmaking. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in card games, whether you’re a beginner or a veteran.

Графика выполнена в приятном, несколько минималистичном стиле, который не перегружает картинку и позволяет сосредоточиться на тактике. Разнообразие наций и их уникальных юнитов позволяет создавать самые разные колоды и стратегии.\n\nИгра требует не просто набора карт, а понимания логистики, снабжения и тактики боя. Кредиты и ресурсы в KARDS имеют решающее значение, заставляя думать на несколько ходов вперед.\n\nЕдинственным минусом, пожалуй, является кривая обучения для совсем новых игроков, но существующий режим обучения и активное коммьюнити помогают быстро освоиться. В целом, KARDS - это отличный выбор для любителей ККИ и истории Второй мировой войны, предлагающий захватывающий и интеллектуальный геймплей.",

Now the game is just bloated by overpowered cards. Every new expansion they have to add new 'interesting' cards which just completely throws the balance of the rails. And this is where my main point lays. 1939 absolutely has NO clue how to balance this game and if they do balance the game its MONTHS too late. They really had a chance to make this game in something good after the mobile release but they fucked it up hard with the balancing, guttiing the tournaments which was a HUGE pro on this game and not listening to the fanbase at all. I know im not the only one on this because the reviews have been terrible lately as it should be sadly from the current state of the game. 3/10 would not recommmend. Oh and btw if you are a new player.. gl getting a good deck, you either have to sink in a lot of money or play a lot with mediocre decks, yes its possible, no its not fun and scummy business practices.",

I grew up playing Magic the Gathering and to play a similar style of game with WW2 units, i was sucked in quickly! At the beginning, i enjoyed the single player games and duel event... built a few simple decks and managed to do okay. Then to progress playing single player or dual it said i needed coins that i didnt have.  I forked out some money for a 3 month package to get coin, cards, and some other perks. I then built some awesome decks and was doing great. Since then they have come out with several \"updates\"... all these \"updates\" consist of is a new series of cards that are overpowered and basically retire your older cards. I have stopped paying and as a result have been slipping further down the rank.\n\nSo bottom line , if you don't pay more money to buy the newest series of cards ( every 2 months or so) , you will fall behind and more often than not lose to the newer superior cards. There are ways to play and get coins to get the newer cards but its a drop in the bucket. For those of us that work, have families, and don't have hours to spend each night in the game LOSING TO THE NEWER DECKS to get the coins... your time is better spent on a game that you you can actually advance in without pulling out the wallet.\n\nAlso as mentioned in other reviews the soviets are OP and the hammer and sickle remain despite them losing the rising sun and german insignias.... because russia is no longer communist under Putins leadership lol? \n\nIts a shame, this game has great potential... the artwork is great and the game play is fun when you have a decent deck or you are playing against an equal opponent. Too bad the devs didnt expand on that and keep it more balanced, instead they catered to those with deep pockets.",

I'm a history buff so a card game with a WWII theme was a solid SOLD for me.  Now though?  I can't play this anymore.  No other game in my library makes me so angry that I want to throw my mouse or phone at the wall.  As it stands now, you're only going to win on ladder with a hyper aggro deck and it's pretty much caveman thinking of, \"Duh...I hit face.\"  No strategy.  No thinking.  Just \"I hit face.\"  There are so many different cards in this game with a variety of combos and decks that you can play with, but it's now just a few meta decks to win on ladder.  This isn't the worse part for me though.\n\nThe worst part is the toxicity of the players.  There's no chat, but you are allowed to pick and choose the emotes you want to use and nothing gets me more angry than playing against an aggro player who spams, \"It's A Good Day To Die,\" over and over again as they are smashing your face in.  You take more than 3 seconds to decide your move and you get spammed with, \"Is It My Turn Yet?\", again and again.  Sure, there's a way to turn this off, but you have to do it with every match you play because the devs don't want to give you the option to do so because it will switch off a small part of how they make their money.  Yes.....emotes can be purchasable in this game.  So after over 5 years of playing this game, I'm done with it.  Find another card game because I'm pretty sure there are far better ones that have a less toxic player base and more variety of decks you can play.",

It was more or less what this review is about and people were agreeing with me there as well, but the post was deleted at some point, so I have decided to mark this action up here where they can't tamper with the reviews. You can judge for yourself what this indicates about the developers. Had they not deleted my post I wouldn't be so antagonistic towards them, but now I'm going to twist that knife as hard as I can. Your shameful act is for all to see now.\n\nStarted out strong and was enjoyable, but the cracks have started to show. A game about history that does not care for history. The Germans being censored is kind of \"understandable\", but some time after this, the censorship didn't stop there. Now they have changed the Japanese rising sun flag to it's modern equivalent. All signs point to more censorship in the future.\n\nDon't you fools understand that it's this distinction that separated war-time Japan from modern Japan? If your justification for this was that people would take offense to seeing the military flag, how do you think this will appear to them now? Now people are going to think that the old Japan which committed countless atrocities is the same as the one now. In this way, are you suggesting they are still on the warpath, the same militaristic government as before? Now people are going to get triggered seeing the normal flag, too. You have only dug yourselves deeper into a hole.\n\nAnd don't even get me started about the other implications this brings. Ok, lots of Asian people suffered under Japan so they would get mad at their imagery. Lots of people suffered under German rule, and the Germans themselves don't like to talk about their past. So what about the Soviet imagery? You haven't changed those and people suffered plenty because of them. By this half-way censorship you open yourselves up to all kinds of attacks; Is one people's suffering greater than others? Should everyone else's suffering then be ignored? The Japanese and German imagery was too horrible to look at, but apparently communism was sooooo much better in comparison. You censor one, but not the other, even though all of the complaints are valid. So by this logic, you should ban the Soviet imagery too in the name of the values you preach, but in so doing you defeat the purpose of a WW2 themed game, the hook being historical accuracy. Why did you even bother making it if you were going to censor it? You follow this logic long enough, there will be no end to the censorship once you start.\n\nThe case to ban Soviet imagery is made stronger still, because Putin has been using Soviet rhetoric to justify his war in Ukraine. The Russians are constantly making pleas to Ukraine to remember how good it was to be under their rule during communism. You say you stand with Ukraine, but why haven't you done anything about the Soviet imagery then? Wouldn't that make you hypocrites? If you switched Japans military flag for their normal flag, you could just as well switch the Soviet imagery for Russian flags. Oooohhh but that would be offensive, current Russia is not the USSR, we would lose players! Now think how the Japanese players must feel.\n\nYou see what happens? You pick and choose only the things you want to defend, but in so doing you make a lot of mistakes and open yourselves up to a slew of other problems. You make yourselves look disingenious and as hypocrites, and then to correct this problem you try and fix it with MORE censorship until everyone leaves to greener pastures. It looks like favoritism and propaganda even though you didn't mean it as such. Maybe you did, hell if I know, but I wouldn't be surprised. Either you ban everything or you leave it untouched, but as I mentioned before that if you're going to censor things, why did you choose this theme?\n\nBut the gravest mistake of all is not the censorship, but rather how this game uses it to censor history itself. Much like others before you, you have opened up a dangerous rhetoric which is that history can be changed to suit your reality. You are revising history. You are changing the truth. A card game which uses its historical theme as a selling point, but does not respect it. A game which sees it fit to change it's values on a whim. Knowing this, how can any player trust this game enough to spend money on it?\n\nWhere will the censorship end? I have outlined a number of upcoming scenarios where more censorship is required.\nThe answer therefore is that it will never end, unless the developers decide to stand behind a policy of integrity. In fact, if people are going take offense to history, maybe it's the wrong game for them, so why would you pander to them, ever think about that? Maybe it lowers the quality for everyone else who actually care for the game? Instead try and branch out to people who enjoy the subject? Just something to consider.\n\nAll in all, I can no longer support this developer. Play it if you must, but do not spend money on it if you have any respect for yourself. The game is SO GOOD otherwise, where you can actually climb ranked with jank decks and play board instead of solitaire, but this is simply too much. Show us that you have some backbone, show to us that you can be trusted. Until then, in this age of ideological warfare, I refuse to support the enemy.",

I'm all for a few tasty dbl card smack downs, but seriously the amount of cards that literarilly wipe the board before you can even get to turn 5 is crazy. A good card game needs some luck, for sure. However, for the most part the cards you get turn 1 and the 1st cpl draws are going to determine your match. There is scarcely a battle that last past 8-10 turns, so if you are into fast attack decks rinse, wash, repeat then you will like this game. Customer service is good, only had to wait a cpl days for a name change even though I swear I never picked my initial name. I do not consider this pay to win, since I can be competitive without forking money over.

And this is where my main point lays. 1939 absolutely has NO clue how to balance this game and if they do balance the game its MONTHS too late. They really had a chance to make this game in something good after the mobile release but they fucked it up hard with the balancing, guttiing the tournaments which was a HUGE pro on this game and not listening to the fanbase at all. I know im not the only one on this because the reviews have been terrible lately as it should be sadly from the current state of the game. 3/10 would not recommmend.

I grew up playing Magic the Gathering and to play a similar style of game with WW2 units, i was sucked in quickly! At the beginning, i enjoyed the single player games and duel event... built a few simple decks and managed to do okay. Then to progress playing single player or dual it said i needed coins that i didnt have.  I forked out some money for a 3 month package to get coin, cards, and some other perks. I then built some awesome decks and was doing great. Since then they have come out with several \"updates\"... all these \"updates\" consist of is a new series of cards that are overpowered and basically retire your older cards. I have stopped paying and as a result have been slipping further down the rank.\n\nSo bottom line , if you don't pay more money to buy the newest series of cards ( every 2 months or so) , you will fall behind and more often than not lose to the newer superior cards. There are ways to play and get coins to get the newer cards but its a drop in the bucket. For those of us that work, have families, and don't have hours to spend each night in the game LOSING TO THE NEWER DECKS to get the coins... your time is better spent on a game that you you can actually advance in without pulling out the wallet.\n\nAlso as mentioned in other reviews the soviets are OP and the hammer and sickle remain despite them losing the rising sun and german insignias.... because russia is no longer communist under Putins leadership lol? \n\nIts a shame, this game has great potential... the artwork is great and the game play is fun when you have a decent deck or you are playing against an equal opponent.

No other game in my library makes me so angry that I want to throw my mouse or phone at the wall.  As it stands now, you're only going to win on ladder with a hyper aggro deck and it's pretty much caveman thinking of, \"Duh...I hit face.\"  No strategy.  No thinking.  Just \"I hit face.\"  There are so many different cards in this game with a variety of combos and decks that you can play with, but it's now just a few meta decks to win on ladder.  This isn't the worse part for me though.\n\nThe worst part is the toxicity of the players.  There's no chat, but you are allowed to pick and choose the emotes you want to use and nothing gets me more angry than playing against an aggro player who spams, \"It's A Good Day To Die,\" over and over again as they are smashing your face in.  You take more than 3 seconds to decide your move and you get spammed with, \"Is It My Turn Yet?\", again and again.  Sure, there's a way to turn this off, but you have to do it with every match you play because the devs don't want to give you the option to do so because it will switch off a small part of how they make their money.  Yes.....emotes can be purchasable in this game.  So after over 5 years of playing this game, I'm done with it.

If you play draft then you´re RIP early if you´re getting rushed by 0 cost units or getting destroyed by control cards or by cheap orders or everything combined ... and on top of that you can also be unlucky with the rng if you want heal orders with germany by combing the nation with UK for example.\n\nDraft was the only thing that was at least a bit fun and i played the last months only that because you need to decide from random cards for your deck but with all the unbalanced cards now ? forget it .. 150 gold wasted \nCombinations like japan + France .. in which world is this historic ?\nU.S players (or other players who wants to play most of time their fav nation) for example are just Rip against those combinations with those unbalanced cards and orders .. ofc you loose fun if you realize that you have no chance with your fav nation. \nThe best thing is also if you´re in a match for example in a draft match then the game randomly freezes sometimes and you need to close the game and if you return (restarting the game only taking a few sec) you only see that you have lost the match automatically .... nice to see something like this ..... especially in a draft match .. and the Problem is 100% not my PC.",

If your justification for this was that people would take offense to seeing the military flag, how do you think this will appear to them now? Now people are going to think that the old Japan which committed countless atrocities is the same as the one now. In this way, are you suggesting they are still on the warpath, the same militaristic government as before? Now people are going to get triggered seeing the normal flag, too. You have only dug yourselves deeper into a hole.\n\nAnd don't even get me started about the other implications this brings. Ok, lots of Asian people suffered under Japan so they would get mad at their imagery. Lots of people suffered under German rule, and the Germans themselves don't like to talk about their past. So what about the Soviet imagery? You haven't changed those and people suffered plenty because of them. By this half-way censorship you open yourselves up to all kinds of attacks; Is one people's suffering greater than others? Should everyone else's suffering then be ignored? The Japanese and German imagery was too horrible to look at, but apparently communism was sooooo much better in comparison. You censor one, but not the other, even though all of the complaints are valid. So by this logic, you should ban the Soviet imagery too in the name of the values you preach, but in so doing you defeat the purpose of a WW2 themed game, the hook being historical accuracy. Why did you even bother making it if you were going to censor it? You follow this logic long enough, there will be no end to the censorship once you start.\n\nThe case to ban Soviet imagery is made stronger still, because Putin has been using Soviet rhetoric to justify his war in Ukraine. The Russians are constantly making pleas to Ukraine to remember how good it was to be under their rule during communism. You say you stand with Ukraine, but why haven't you done anything about the Soviet imagery then? Wouldn't that make you hypocrites? If you switched Japans military flag for their normal flag, you could just as well switch the Soviet imagery for Russian flags. Oooohhh but that would be offensive, current Russia is not the USSR, we would lose players! Now think how the Japanese players must feel.\n\nYou see what happens? You pick and choose only the things you want to defend, but in so doing you make a lot of mistakes and open yourselves up to a slew of other problems. You make yourselves look disingenious and as hypocrites, and then to correct this problem you try and fix it with MORE censorship until everyone leaves to greener pastures. It looks like favoritism and propaganda even though you didn't mean it as such. Maybe you did, hell if I know, but I wouldn't be surprised. Either you ban everything or you leave it untouched, but as I mentioned before that if you're going to censor things, why did you choose this theme?\n\nBut the gravest mistake of all is not the censorship, but rather how this game uses it to censor history itself. Much like others before you, you have opened up a dangerous rhetoric which is that history can be changed to suit your reality. You are revising history. You are changing the truth. A card game which uses its historical theme as a selling point, but does not respect it. A game which sees it fit to change it's values on a whim. Knowing this, how can any player trust this game enough to spend money on it?\n\nWhere will the censorship end? I have outlined a number of upcoming scenarios where more censorship is required.\nThe answer therefore is that it will never end, unless the developers decide to stand behind a policy of integrity. In fact, if people are going take offense to history, maybe it's the wrong game for them, so why would you pander to them, ever think about that? Maybe it lowers the quality for everyone else who actually care for the game? Instead try and branch out to people who enjoy the subject? Just something to consider.\n\nAll in all, I can no longer support this developer. Play it if you must, but do not spend money on it if you have any respect for yourself. The game is SO GOOD otherwise, where you can actually climb ranked with jank decks and play board instead of solitaire, but this is simply too much. Show us that you have some backbone, show to us that you can be trusted. Until then, in this age of ideological warfare, I refuse to support the enemy.",

You cannot hope to complete your collections in a reasonable amount of time without paying in some way. This is how the free-to-play model works.\n\nRare cards dominate the battlefield.

There is a huge incentive to have the greatest and latest cards in order to outperform the meta. \n\nMeta decks are forced upon you in some way.

You are forced to play the meta if you want to win.\n\nDiminished strategy gameplay. There used to be strategy early on with the front mechanic. Now, have fun playing against players that destroy your units right as you play them, or worse punish you from playing anything. \n\nYou are here to sit though your units getting a beating, and you cannot do anything unless you have the exact counter card.

I'm all for a few tasty dbl card smack downs, but seriously the amount of cards that literarilly wipe the board before you can even get to turn 5 is crazy. A good card game needs some luck, for sure. However, for the most part the cards you get turn 1 and the 1st cpl draws are going to determine your match. There is scarcely a battle that last past 8-10 turns, so if you are into fast attack decks rinse, wash, repeat then you will like this game. Customer service is good, only had to wait a cpl days for a name change even though I swear I never picked my initial name. I do not consider this pay to win, since I can be competitive without forking money over. However I think pretty much anyone can win at this game, as long as your personal best main trait is luck of the draw. If you are looking for a slower paced card game, where you must really rely on your deck versus a variety of situations, Then RUN!",
