(once you collect 10 hidden collectables, you are able to pseudo glide and you gain a powerful way to skip large sections of the map with trampolines)\n\nCONS\n---A couple bugs found when playing that force you to restart (Temple yellow tile puzzle can get locked). Also there are a couple wonky hitboxes on some assets.\n---No real story, just climb up\n\n\nGame was good, would recommend for someone looking for a game that can frustrate you or you want to mess around and play with a couple of friends.",

O estúdio Anegar Games riu da sua ingenuidade e nos deu Chained Together, o Only Up! com o bônus de você poder arrastar seus amigos para baixo. É a escalada, onde a única coisa mais quente que a lava são os ânimos no Discord.\nA Realidade Nua e Crua\nO jogo é simples: suba. A pegadinha? Você e até outros três \"parceiros\" estão presos por uma corrente mística que tem a flexibilidade de um vergalhão congelado. Um passo em falso, um escorregão, um \"Ai, calma, me puxa!\" e POOF, todo mundo volta para o início. É como um cabo de guerra vertical, mas com consequências existenciais e gritos que fariam as banshees terem inveja.\nA Corrente: Ela é a verdadeira vilã. Não é a plataforma que some, não é o lag (embora o ping alto seja um assassino silencioso), é a corrente. Ela te puxa, te joga no abismo, te enrola em volta de um pilar e te faz questionar todas as suas escolhas de vida.\nO Multiplayer: A experiência é descrita por usuários como \"definidora de amizade\". Sim, define se você ainda tem amigos ou se, no final, você quer desinstalar o jogo. É um gerador de clipes hilários e momentos de pura rage.\nA \"Terapia\": Segundo um usuário da comunidade Steam, jogar isso fez ele perceber que ele e seus amigos \"não compartilham apenas correntes, mas também a falta de neurônios\". Terapia de casal inclusa!\nVeredito\nRecomendado. Compre para os seus amigos que você quer ver sofrer um pouquinho, ou se você quiser testar os limites da paciência humana. A risada (depois da raiva) faz valer cada centavo. Esse jogo precisa de um replay depois de cada falha para sabermos exatamente de quem foi a culpa. JUMP NOW!!!!",

      "review": "Chained Together — Vertical Chaos in Cooperative Platforming\n\nChained Together challenges players to climb, swing, and leap through perilous environments while being physically chained to friends. Every movement, jump, and swing requires coordination, making teamwork essential if you hope to make it to the top without disaster.\n\nThe game shines in its chaotic physics-based co-op gameplay. The chain connecting players isn’t just cosmetic — it dynamically reacts to every movement, forcing you to adapt constantly. One misstep can drag the entire team down, turning even a simple platforming section into a tense and hilarious challenge.\n\nReplayability and variety keep things interesting. Different difficulty modes, including safer options with checkpoints and high-risk challenges, offer a fresh experience each run. While solo mode exists, the game truly comes alive in multiplayer, where communication and timing turn every climb into a shared thrill.\n\nTeamwork is both the reward and the challenge. Coordinating with friends creates unforgettable moments of triumph — and chaos. Mistimed jumps, tangled chains, or unexpected physics mishaps can be frustrating, but they also lead to laughter, memorable fails, and stories you’ll tell long after the session ends.\n\n[h3]Final Verdict:[/h3]\nChained Together is a unique, chaotic platformer that balances precision, cooperation, and humor. Its physics-driven co-op makes every climb a tense, entertaining, and memorable experience. Perfect for friends who enjoy a challenge and plenty of laughs along the way.\n\n“Bound by a chain, reliant on each other — every step is a test of teamwork and timing.”\n\nOverall Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 10/10",

      "review": "**Review: Chained Together**\n\nIf you think your friendships are unbreakable, **Chained Together** will happily prove you wrong — especially at 3 AM, and *especially* if you’re not sober. This game is a friendship-crushing masterpiece: terrible in all the right ways, brilliant in execution, and unforgettable whether you want it to be or not.\n\n**What Makes It So Terrible (In the Best Way)**\nYou and up to three friends are literally chained together, and that chain isn’t just decoration — it’s physics-driven chaos. Every step, jump, mistake, or panic movement affects everyone. One person slips, the team plummets. Someone hesitates, the chain tightens. Someone tries something “creative,” and suddenly the entire squad is wrapped around a pole like a human pretzel.\n\nThe climbing challenge is punishing. The modes range from “difficult” to “why are we doing this,” with the lava mode adding a constant race against rising death. It’s mean, it’s relentless, and it’s hilariously unforgiving.\n\n**Why It’s Brilliant**\nFor all the rage it inspires, the game nails its core idea with surprising elegance. There’s nothing to distract you: no complicated systems, no bloated menus, no filler — just you, your friends, a chain, and a mountain that does not care about your feelings. When you finally coordinate a perfect sequence of jumps or swings, the shared triumph feels incredible.\n\nThe physics, while occasionally unpredictable, create moments of pure, chaotic comedy. The “Wings” power-ups offer just enough hope to keep you trying again after you fall… again.\n\nAnd despite being simple, the game has resonated with players everywhere. It exploded in popularity for good reason: few games capture both camaraderie and catastrophe as well as this one.\n\n**The Dark Side**\n\n* The physics can be *wonky* — hilariously so at times, maddeningly so at others.\n* Communication is absolutely essential; without it, expect emotional collapse.\n* Input quirks and controller issues can appear in local play.\n* Content is limited, and replay value depends entirely on how much joy you find in shared suffering.\n* And yes, it can — and will — strain your relationships.\n\n**The Midnight, Drunk-Friendship Test**\nMy own experience? Four not-quite-sober friends at 3 in the morning, yelling, laughing, falling, and arguing about who ruined “the perfect run.” By the end, we were exhausted, proud, and unsure if we were still on speaking terms. If that’s not the sign of a memorable co-op game, I don’t know what is.\n\n**Final Verdict**\n**Chained Together** is a must-have for anyone brave enough to test their friendships through shared frustration. It’s the worst fun you can have with people you care about — which somehow makes it some of the best.\n\nBuy it. Support these absolute madmen of game design. Encourage them to create something even worse.",
