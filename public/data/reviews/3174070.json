Spades is played with bot partners and the game is rigged for them to screw you.. The only thing that's close to not fixed is the sports betting which is fun but they will switch up the odds after the fact on some bets not pay what you set the bet for. I had odds go from 1.68 all the was to 1. If you bet 100K you got 100K if you won but if you lost they still take it. Not recommended for reality fans.",
