I've probably only ran into 4 actual cheaters in 200 hours. All the people saying it's full of cheaters honestly probably just kinda suck at the game, and are probably getting killed by sweaty players with 1000 hours in the game. When TTKs are <200 ms, of course you're gonna feel like they're \"cheating\" when you get one tapped before you can react (I'm often on the receiving end of this. It's almost always a max rank Marshal blasting me)\r\n\r\nLike seriously devs, wtf is the point of having the ranked \"Grade\" system if you're not going to use it for matchmaking? Half my Warfare matches the enemy team has 10 Marshal ranked players and my team is full of Privates who've never even heard of the word \"flanking\"...of course we're going to get absolutely cooked by them. Put the noobs with other noobs so they can have a bit of fun, and put the tryhards with the other sweats ffs\r\n\r\nOk with that aside, this game is actually 3 separate games bundled together:\r\n-Campaign is phenomenal for a free game, although very difficult (can't seem to beat the last mission lmao). This in itself is worth giving the game a shot\r\n- Operations is an \"extraction shooter,\" not my cup of tea. I don't really play it but this is probably where all the \"cheaters\" are since there's loot for them to steal. If they bring back the PvE mode, it might be worth trying again\r\n- Warfare is discount Battlefield. Poor matchmaking makes this often very one-sided, but it sometimes can be fun clubbing seals. Vehicles are kinda OP (like seriously that active defense is really dumb, you're literally invincible. Not to mention you can literally just keep repairing your vehicle if it gets damaged). Air vehicles are almost impossible to shoot down if the pilot is competent because AA range is abysmal. If you suck at shooters, get ready to have your ass kicked\r\n\r\nAll of that being said - it can be fun, it looks great, it's free. If you don't like it, just uninstall lol, it's not like you paid to play. And if you are spending money on it, it's just for skins (you know why you bought it :)  )",

Performance can be a bit inconsistent at times, but overall it runs smoothly on most setups. The main downside is that the menus and interface can feel a little clunky, and the anti-cheat system has raised a few eyebrows.\n\nStill, Delta Force offers a fun, large-scale shooter experience that’s easy to jump into and hard to put down — especially considering it doesn’t cost a thing.",

      "review": "I can pretty much only speak on the behalf of Warfare mode because I barely touch Operations at all especially because Queue Times are highly inconsistent in my region in Operations but not in Warfare. \n\nFor what it's worth the game is surprisingly good for being a F2P FPS Game, the gunplay is pretty nice and it feels good to play, the characters do play a good role having abilities that serve well in team play for the most part, some Warfare maps are pretty good and others are pretty much meat grinders almost impossible for the attackers to win (Shafted and Knife's Edge though the later not as much).\n\nI have to be clear with the following and that is I did play BF2042 for the Road to BF6 Pass and having already played Delta Force first before 2042 I must be completely honest but Delta Force is literally a better 2042 in my opinion, of course this game here doesn't beat the classics of BF3/4 or BF1 at all but it is certainly way more enjoyable than whatever 2042 was that I had to go through to get the skins for BF6. \n\nWith that being said let's not forget this game is from China and therefore their selection of cosmetics tend to be far more relaxed, the game itself being inspired on 2042 and quite literally having factions inspired in Command & Conquer factions which I realized at the end of the Arknights collab minigame where the red Shield bearer says \"Thank you for the new shoes!\" a reference to C&C Generals and it made me realized why the rebels and the corporation have such a 2000's color palette and designs to them...they are literally C&C Inspired factions in a way lmao. This makes for an artstyle that from the get goe never really lands as completely grounded which kind of helps the game numerous events and skins everywhere not only for the guns but for the characters to be as bonkers as they want, probably one of the very few games where I accept fully the anime skins as the Arknights skins for characters and guns are really well made and I love Arknights after all although I completely understand if this is a deal breaker for people who don't play Arknights at all, the game is and clearly never was supposed to be fully grounded as they clearly wanted flashy skins from the get go. \n\nSince BF2042 is pretty much done and never getting update it again this game can be a good alternative as it is still receiving updates and content, regarding cheaters I haven't encountered them too frequently in Warfare mode but I've heard they are outrageous in Operations (aka The Extraction Mode) although the devs apparently want to add Secure Boot which we will have to see if that helps with that problem for Operations mode as I don't see them much in Warfare. \n\nA bit aimless on this review because I just finished the Arknights event which I absoluted loved and my thoughts aren't well organized right now, I do recommend this game but ONLY for Warfare as it is the only game mode I play on this game, I can't speak on Operations since I have barely touched it, good game so far it's F2P so you don't lose any money just trying it out to see if you like it enough to stick around and it's better than the mess of 2042",

When you suffer together the pain becomes comedy.\nThe open map looting mode is pure happiness. You steal random things that do absolutely nothing in game but still feel like priceless treasures. Emotional attachment level maximum.\n\nCons\nGetting the Mendel Brick should be classified as a mythological event. If it actually happens your blood pressure jumps again because every enemy on the planet suddenly wants to eliminate you before you reach the exit.\nThe skins cannot be traded which breaks my dream of becoming a black market Delta Force skin dealer like CS.\nSome missions try so hard to be realistic that my soul leaves my body every few minutes, but online is good and easy for new players.\n\nOverall Score\nSolid 8 out of 10.

The only complaint I have is the cheaters on the PC side from time to time, but that's just something that has become and issue over the years with all games that are free to play. For me better anti cheat and controller support on mobile is my only complaints, the game is allot of fun for me.

It doesn’t rely on flashy gimmicks or over-the-top explosions — instead, it focuses on what really matters in a military shooter: tension, tactics, and teamwork.\n\nWhat stands out most is the sense of realism. Missions feel like actual operations, not arcade levels. You’re often dropped into huge open environments where you have to think before you move, plan your approach, and pick your shots carefully. One wrong step, one careless sprint in the open, and you’re done — and that makes every successful mission feel genuinely rewarding.\n\nDelta Force might not be the most modern-looking game by today’s standards, but its gameplay has aged surprisingly well. If you enjoy tactical shooters where patience, positioning, and precision matter more than running and gunning, Delta Force is absolutely worth playing — or revisiting. It’s a classic for a reason.",

      "review": "This is one of the coolest games I have ever played. Although it is from China I don't believe it's spyware. People say that the Anti-Cheat was not able to be uninstalled, however they did mention that it was a bug and it already has been patched. Also the reason the game isn't high on good reviews might also be because of the cheaters it has a lot, but they are fixing it by making the anti-cheat better and the kill-cam feature more advanced. (Please note that there are way less cheaters on the easier maps)\n\nDelta Force has one of the best, if not the best gun systems in any FPS game ever, there are almost 30 different guns with 1000s of attachments (Total not for each gun, but there is still a lot per gun). It has 3 modes, a battlefield style game mode, a beautiful extraction mode, and a Black Hawk Down remake (which is really hard.)\n\nAlthough this game isn't the best, for me the extraction mode is really hard, but that's probably just me. However, the worst part about the game in my opinion is the suggestive skins. Delta Force had a collab with Arknights and they make 3 types skins for the DF characters based on the Arknight characters. And I guess Arknights is an anime-style game plus its popular in China, I hope you know where I'm going. They aren't naked or anything too crazy but it's still a little too much for my liking. (I should mention that the skins were pretty hard to get so you're not going to see a crazy amount of people with them I would say maybe a 20-30% chance.)\n\nThis game did have collabs with Alan Walker and a new collab with Metal Gear Solid which is coming sometime soon. This game is really good and I wanted to wait until I hit 1000 hours in the game before I made a review but I don't think I can. I really hope this game is successful and gets The Steam Award. If I gave it a rating I would say 9/10.",

The game’s focus on realistic combat, large-scale maps, and strategic planning sets it apart from more modern shooters, creating intense and memorable engagements. Its multiplayer, although less active today, still offers moments of nostalgia and excitement for those who enjoy methodical, skill-based gameplay. The single-player missions are well-designed, providing challenging objectives and a strong sense of immersion in military operations. While it’s true that the number of players on Steam has gradually declined, the quality of the gameplay itself hasn’t diminished. For anyone interested in tactical shooters with a focus on realism and strategy, Delta Force still holds up remarkably well, and revisiting it can be both nostalgic and thrilling. Its combination of large maps, challenging AI, and tactical depth ensures that fans of classic shooters will find plenty to enjoy, even as the community slowly dwindles.",

It's a mix of everything good and bad that an FPS game can have and sometimes a positive point can be negative as well!(I'll talk about it). Starting with the pros:\r\n+ This game offers a campaign, a multi-player and an extraction mode which is a lot of content for a free \r\n   game so you can play your favorite mode and it also gives you a lot to grind for (Which I'll get into later)\r\n+ Gunplay feels fun (like battlefield!) with very fast TTK.\r\n+ maps are big (maybe too big sometimes) with a lot of different locations to engage in combat.\r\n+ Good amount of guns (45 total) with operator class system (like battlefield!) plus operator skills which \r\n   are cool and not that game braking.\r\n+ Events are rewarding with guns and operator skins unlike some other FPS games (*COUGH* COD \r\n  *COUGH*) BUT because of this there are a lot of bad rewards as well to keep you grinding. For example \r\n  I got some freaking voice lines for an operator!!!! Who cares about voice lines in an FPS match!\r\nAs I said it comes with its own cons and boy there are some RED FLAGS!\r\n- This is a GACHA game TO THE BONE and you feel it every moment when you are not in a match. \r\n  Beside the typical battle pass (so sad it's normalized these days), you have lots events as well. \r\n  Remember when I said a lot of grinding as a positive point, that is if you really don't care about the \r\n  cosmetics and only like the gameplay because this game CALLS you to spend money. I know after all it \r\n  is a free game so it relies completely on live service aspects but it's just every where! So yeah grinding \r\n  feels too much some times!\r\n- Like I said some maps are too big so you should run through vast empty areas to get to where you want\r\n  because some areas are filled with players while most of the map is empty which is a shame because \r\n  there are some very interesting locations with lots of details that can be a map on their own! \r\n- TTK is too fast (Remember where I said a pro can be a con as well, now you're getting it!)\r\n- Nothing and I mean NOTHING is original in this game. I've seen everything in another game before.\r\n- Music is Just BAD! No immersion, no relationship with any vibe in this game, Just turn it off.\r\n\r\nThese were my main points when I played the game and I look forward to see how my views change.\r\nIn summary; Play if you want something like battlefield for free and don't mind a lot of grinding for guns and operators which you can easily get with spending money. If anything else, then you might not enjoy this game that much.",

      "review": "⭐ Delta Force — My Honest Review\n\nDelta Force is back, and this reboot delivers a surprising mix of large-scale warfare, tactical extraction gameplay, and a nostalgic campaign inspired by Black Hawk Down. It’s far from perfect — but it’s one of the most ambitious free-to-play shooters available right now.\n\n🎮 Gameplay\n\nThe game offers three major modes, each with its own identity:\n\nWarfare (32v32 PvP): Large maps, vehicles, helicopters, and chaotic combined-arms combat. Feels like a mix between Battlefield and classic Delta Force.\n\nOperations (Extraction/PvPvE): Squad-based missions where strategy and communication matter. Risk-reward gameplay similar to Tarkov but more accessible.\n\nBlack Hawk Down Campaign: A modern reimagining of the classic missions. Looks good, plays well, and is surprisingly fun with a team.\n\n🌍 Graphics & Atmosphere\n\nThe visuals are solid for a free game. Maps are huge, environments look clean, and the lighting is decent. Animations and polish aren’t perfect, but the scale of the battles feels impressive.\n\n🔧 Performance\n\nPerformance is mixed:\n\nRuns well on most systems\n\nOccasional bugs, odd animations, and netcode issues\n\nHit-registration sometimes inconsistent\n\nAnti-cheat still needs serious improvement\n\nThe game is playable and enjoyable, but definitely a work in progress.\n\n👍 What It Does Well\n\nMassive, cinematic battles\n\nGood weapon variety and customization\n\nFun extraction gameplay\n\nPvE campaign is surprisingly enjoyable\n\nCompletely free — no pay-to-win\n\n👎 Where It Fails\n\nCheaters are a real problem\n\nAnti-cheat needs urgent work\n\nBugs and balancing issues\n\nMatchmaking can feel chaotic\n\nNot very solo-friendly in some modes\n\n🎯 Final Verdict\n\nDelta Force isn’t perfect, but it delivers a unique mix of tactical shooting, large-scale warfare, and cooperative missions. If you enjoy teamwork, vehicles, extraction gameplay, and huge maps, this game is absolutely worth trying — especially since it’s free.\n\nIf the devs keep updating it and improve the anti-cheat, it could become one of the best F2P shooters.\n\n⭐ Score: 7/10 — Fun, ambitious, and full of potential.\nYes, I recommend it.",

Mechanically it’s solid, it looks great, and the meta has potential but the AC issues overshadow all of that.\n\nEdit - Delta Force still stands out because of how its mechanics push a slower, more tactical style of play instead of the run and gun chaos most shooters fall into. The huge, open maps change everything you’re not fighting in tiny corridors, you’re scanning hills, grass, and distant silhouettes, trying to figure out where a single shot might come from. Long-range firefights are the core of the game, and the ballistics actually matter bullets drop, wind affects your aim, and you can’t just spray and pray. Movement is intentionally simple, but it works. You’re crouching, prone, crawling through tall grass, treating every bit of cover like it’s life or death. There’s no fancy parkour or gimmicks just you, your rifle, and how well you can position yourself. The AI can spot you from far away, which keeps you on your toes, and missions rely more on approach and patience than pure reaction time. Picking the right weapon loadout actually matters because each gun behaves differently across long distances. It’s a game where planning your angle, lining up that one clean shot, and staying hidden feels better than any flashy killstreak. If you want a shooter built entirely around distance, tension, and precision, Delta Force still nails that feeling.",

You risk expensive gear for literally nothing.\n\nMeanwhile, lower-skilled players get protected, low-pressure lobbies where high-value loot seems to spawn more frequently to \"hook\" them in.\n\nIt leads to the ultimate Extraction Shooter paradox:\n\n[b] You can't Search: Because the loot density for skilled players is nerfed.

      "review": "This game has one of the most fluid/best gun plays and looks graphically similar to Battlefield. It has very good potential if not for the cheaters that ruin it.\n\n●Pros:\n✓This game will teach you how to play extraction shooters and detox you from brain dead pushing from playing COD Multiplayer.\n✓Not pay 2 win. Battle pass price is reasonable, and the game gives a lot of freebies for active players.\n✓One of the best gun customization systems in any FPS game\n✓Each gun is balanced. New operators that come out as OP get a nerf towards the end of the season.\n✓Cross play to console and playable on mobile\n✓Mandelbrick skins for guns are awesome and one of the coolest Inspect animations in any FPS game\n✓Operator skins are great in this game, more than eye candy. Some players feel an attachment already.\n\n●Cons:\n✗Deal with cheaters in this game because of poor anti-cheat implementation, and is very detrimental in operations mode (the extraction shooter part of the game). \n✗Cheater compensation is inconsistent. Out of 10 you report, only 2 get banned after a long time.\n✗In Global version, maps are time limited unlike the Chinese version. This can be understandable because the devs want to guarantee that enough players will be online for the matchmaking by rotating the maps in a time table, but this can be a con for some people who cannot play at the specified times.\n\n●Caveats:\n○Better invest in good gaming hardware to play this game (Headset, mouse, mouse pad) as you will need every edge you can get. \n○The TTK in this game is brutally fast and unforgiving. Be the one to shoot first or be shot at.\n○You will sometimes get rushed in your spawns by experienced enemy players. Knowing how to counter such a rush can turn the tide of battle to your favor easily.\n\nConclusion:\nDo not stay too long in this game as you will be burnt out by cheaters. If the devs are only willing to listen to the player base and fix the cheater problem, they will not flock to their competitors like Arc Raiders or Arena Breakout: Infinite - which are also extraction shooters. Implementing hardware bans like Battlefield 6 or COD 7 can be a solid solution to this, not unless they are trying to grow a cheater economy at the backs of many honest players.\n\nIf you are new to extraction shooter genre and do not have a solid experience in echo locating enemy player footsteps, this is one of the games that will help teach you if you pay attention to it, or detect if there is something wrong with your setup (hardware + in-game settings) and adjust it. They did fix the audio for footsteps as before it was bugged in the past. Even cheaters cannot mute their footsteps, but they will still aim lock you from a thousand miles away with perfect tracking. If you put in the effort to improve, you can play at a higher level over time.",

Modes like Operations and Attack & Defense have great potential for tactical and team-based combat, delivering a real sense of battlefield intensity during the early hours.\r\n\r\nHowever, after about 30–40 hours, I started to notice the game’s long-term appeal fading. The reasons are several key issues that negatively affect the overall experience:\r\n\r\nUnnecessarily long matches often make even victories feel exhausting and directionless.\r\n\r\nLack of team coordination due to weak communication tools and unbalanced matchmaking turns team play into a random experience.\r\n\r\nPresence of cheaters and weak anti-cheat measures — even if you don’t directly encounter them, frequent reports kill the sense of fair competition.\r\n\r\nBattle Pass and gear imbalance create inequality between new and old players, as certain items directly affect power and gameplay balance.\r\n\r\nUnnatural shooting feel over time — while fun at first, it gradually becomes more like a flashy arcade shooter than a realistic combat experience.\r\n\r\nPoor ranking system that doesn’t reflect real player skill and leads to mismatched lobbies.\r\n\r\nToo many bots in matches just to speed up queue times, which removes the feeling of real competition.\r\n\r\nOn the positive side, the environment design, sound effects, and visual detail are genuinely impressive. The game has strong potential, and if the developers focus on balance, anti-cheat improvements, and better team mechanics, it could become a popular (though not necessarily timeless) shooter.\r\n\r\nAs it stands, Delta Force is more suitable for players looking for quick, adrenaline-fueled action rather than deep, strategic gameplay.\r\nFor those who prefer realism and long-term progression — fans of titles like Tarkov or ARC Raiders — I’d recommend waiting until the game matures a bit more.\r\n\r\nFinal Score: 6.5 / 10\r\nHigh potential, but still struggling with fundamental design and balance issues.",

This game has great features, even good breaking points and profit points, but it all lost to the planning and operation team. I don't think a game that focuses on profit is a good game. I admit that developers need to make money, but they should not sacrifice the player experience. After all, if the player experience is not good, who is willing to spend money to recharge? So the game is okay, but the game planning is not good. This is the first flaw. The second flaw is that there are problems with the design of game values, which prevent the game from having a positive cycle. I seriously suspect that the economic system of the game has not been carefully designed by mathematicians. \"Running the knife\" and \"attacking fiercely\" have formed an effective cycle, and positive feedback is far less than negative feedback. Slot point three is the anti cheating system of the game. I don't know the significance of putting this game on the Steam platform? It is mandatory to install the anti cheating ACE system again, and the root directory is the wegame platform. Moreover, the AEC system is rumored to damage the hard drive because it will scan and read/write disks frantically during matches after being reported by other players to detect cheating?

Illegal Loot Selling sites,\nThere is Sites in the internet that they are selling in-game items and loot for IRL money. Basically you pay them to join with you one game when they have an entire 40-red backpack full of red loot. (Depents from the amount of Alloys or Items you buy)\n\nI love this game. its my first interaction with FPS Extraction Shooter game and i liked it from the first time. If they are gonna fix the Cheater problem and put proximity chat it will be one of the best games out there, until then, im gonna take a break from Delta Force. FIX OUR GAME PLEASE!",

Ok, they have a system where when you get killed by a cheater, you will receive your entering gear back. The shitty part is that you lose time, the loot that you waste time to pick up for the cheater to enjoy, and the joy is sucked away. If you are lucky enough to report a cheater and he gets banned, don't worry, it's creating a new account for you to report. If you are still reading this, congrats to you. If you don't receive an email informing you that a cheater has been banned, keep reporting. Cheaters get a 10-year ban instead of a lifetime ban on the account (VAC BAN). The game has a ton of potential and crazy things. (Gun customization, New maps, mechanics, etc.)\nIf you want to play Warfare, there are not that many cheaters in that game mode, and it is free to play. You can give it a try.

The controls are rough, the shooting lacks impact, and the missions feel more tedious than tactical. Even the visuals and animations look dated, which makes it hard to stay engaged for long.\r\n\r\nThere are a few moments where you get a hint of what the game could’ve been — open maps, long-range sniping, some nostalgic tension — but they don’t last. Most of the time, you’re fighting the game more than the enemies.\r\n\r\nOverall: 1.5/5 — a struggle to enjoy, with only small flashes of potential buried under outdated design.",

      "review": "-A FEW WORDS FIRST \nOn release when I play this it was an amazing FPS shooter game with amazing attention to detail. Big variety of weapons, attachments, good progression, nice maps, good gameplay overall BUT, then the cheaters came. The game is unplayable sadly, you just can't get into a match without cheaters. So for this reason don't bother trying to play. Unless you are a cheater, then you deserve to be cheated on and you're playing on a level playing field. \n\n-GRAPHICS: 9/10\nThe game definitely looks good and is up there with it's competitors. No complaints at all here. \n\n-GAMEPLAY: 9/10\nOne of the best FPS gameplay wise. There's so much attention to detail that it's ridiculous, in a good way. You can customize your weapons so in depth that no other FPS game allows you to (at least non that I have played before). There's definitely a lot of mechanics taken from the competition, but nothing copied per sah, just inspired. Also I liked the \"hold your breathe\" for less recoil part of the game, usually other FPS games have this only for the sniper, here it's on all the weapons and using ADS. \n\n-STORY: -\nDidn't play it. Has to be good since it's a remake of the old Black Hawk Down, but sadly I have grown out of single playing FPS games, I only care about the multiplayer. \n\n-BUGS/GLITCHES: 10/10\nNothing on my playtime. \n\n-FX/SOUNDTRACK: 8/10\nMusic is nothing special, just exists on the game, but the FX are amazing and you feel like you're right inside the battle. \n\n-ORIGINALITY: 6/10\nCould've done something a little bit more original, overall the game is just a copy/paste of CoD & Battlefield. Couple of great new mechanics and the customization I mentioned above, but besides those, the game is just a generic FPS. \n\n-MICRO TRANSACTIONS:\nSeason passes and cosmetics. \n\n-WHO SHOULD PLAY THIS:\nOn release it was spectacular and fun, for maybe a week, after that cheaters became a majority and the game became unplayable. So don't play it nowadays. \n\n-DIFFICULTY:\nSkill based. \n\n-REPLAYABILITY/LENGTH:\nIf there weren't cheaters I'd probably still be playing. There's so much to unlock and progress that you always feel like there's a carrot in front of you. Also good and rewarding progression system.\n\n-PC REQUIREMENTS For Max Settings\nPretty decent machine, not as demanding as it's competitors.\n\n-OVERALL SCORE: 8/10\nBUT 1/10 cause of the unplayable nature of it and the incapability of the studio to fix the cheaters problem. \n\nIt's sad, cause I truly loved the game on release, but it is over sadly, nothing bringing this back to life especially cause of the release of BF6 and it's outstanding anticheat system.

It’s not my favorite map, it’s not the most exciting one—it’s just the last safe space left in the whole game. Everything else feels unplayable.\n\nHonestly, I’m already considering quitting. It’s hard to keep grinding, improving, and learning when legit players barely get a chance to enjoy the game.
