The visuals are coherent and overall well thought out. BUT. IT. IS. SO. GRINDY.\r\n\r\nIt's obvious that the map has been built with the intention to make you walk longer than you should and the teleport stone does not fix that. You're constantly navigating a labyrinth back and forth from the very start of the game to its very end.\r\n\r\nThe game desperately needs a task list feature because you have to either manage a spreadsheet along with it or backtrack a bajillion times.\r\n\r\nThe alchemy system is yet another feature that adds a needless amount of blind-grinding. Adding a recipe book to help you navigate the possible recipes would be incredible.\r\n\r\nInventory management is also abysmal the further into the game you get. It's great that you can craft from nearby chests but there's no reason they wouldn't add the option to craft some sort of backpack expansion or whatever.\r\n\r\nI did, however, enjoy that I had to pay attention to what's happening in the story and what every character is saying, to know what I'm supposed to do next without having a quest list and it all felt intuitive to follow all the way to the end.\r\n\r\nIf I had to play it again, it would definitely be with some QoL mods.",

      "review": "Graveyard Keeper is a great game, but do not be fooled, it is an enormous grind.\n\nI own all the DLCs and have earned every achievement. I have replayed the game multiple times, and several achievements are missable depending on story progression, so be prepared to plan ahead. As mentioned, the grind is real. If you enjoy min maxing like I do, aiming for perfect corpses and a fully decorated graveyard becomes a long term project. The Better Save Soul DLC in particular demands a lot with its requirement of 26 white skulls, and the basic automation in the game only helps so much. In the end you will still be limited by the sin shards you get from daily corpses.\n\nThe game is not difficult. You can take as long as you want to reach full completion. It is perfect for players who enjoy slow and repetitive progression. The start is quite slow, but things improve once you establish your automation. I would not call it groundbreaking, and there are a lot of quality of life improvements I would love to see added. Still, despite the simplicity and the long grind, I thoroughly enjoyed my time with it.",

      "review": "Played both on PC and deck.\nDeck preformance can get choppy, especially towards the end of the game @ 4k display.\nRecommend FPS cap at 30, resolution at 1080p to then scale to 4k, and preformance mode (docked).\nIt is a grindy game; but, good and rewarding. It is what you expect for a crafting management game. It is not stardew valley; inspired by, yes. DLC adds a lot of cool ideas and new mechanics while also expanding the story. I have all 3, and the tavern DLC feels the weakest gameplay wise. I already had significant infrastructure for exporting gold veggies and alcohol, maybe it is different without all of that.\n\nStory is good. DLCs add significant context to both the past and present situation of the world. Soul DLC is focused on character stories.\n\nIf i were to recommend anything: the vanilla game is slow. Get the tp stone from the tavern and invest into speed potions and buff extenders (it made the game much faster). The alchemy system is good, and the \"alchemy recipies\" you get can help with recipe discovery; but, the expectation is trial and error. It fails in that it is VERY expensive early game, so it dissuades you from using it without a guide. Also, late game should allow day skipping beyond meditating or sleeping. I was down to two quests and all i was waiting on was \"come back next week\" timers.\n\nOverall: good game if you are into crafting management games. If not, probably should stick to stardew valley; less tedious and a friendlier approach to players. Story here is better imo and gameplay depth far exceeds stardew -- at the cost of slow to very slow progression at times.",

      "review": "[b] Overview [/b]\nThe farming / life sim genre is full of sunlight, cheery neighbors, and wholesome community activities as you integrate yourself into a pleasant, slow-moving village away from the hustle and bustle of the big city. Graveyard Keeper is most easily described as that genre’s more deranged cousin that just got out of a long stint in prison (or maybe even a psychiatric ward). I wasn’t sure what to expect when I first picked it up, but I was thinking it might be something like Stardew with a darker feel. What I found was a unique management sim with so many different, interconnected systems that I was intrigued from the start and quickly hooked.\n\n[b] Home Away From Home [/b]\nYou play as an individual who is transported to a strange fantasy world where you are tasked with renovating and managing a local, neglected cemetery. Though your long-term goal is to return home, you quickly find yourself pulled into a bizarre tapestry of events that is not only surprisingly dark, but also hilarious. You’ll find yourself befriending talking skulls and communist donkeys while running quite possibly the least ethical business I have ever come across in my years of gaming.\n\n[b] The Graveyard, the Church, and a Plethora of Perks [/b]\nYour humble beginnings as a laborer are soon replaced as opportunity comes knocking at your door. Advancing through the tech tree allows you to harvest increasingly profitable and useful body parts from the corpses that are dropped off to you for disposal. Resources abound from those we are accustomed to, like crops, lumber, and stone, to bizarre alchemical ingredients used to mix strange elixirs. The world is quite sizable for a title in this genre and exploring it is quite rewarding, especially once you’ve begun the process of automating your labors by animating some of your “patrons” to perform your duties for you.\n\nIt’s important to note that as you rebuild and renovate more of the land around your graveyard, you’ll also become something of a priest. Regular sermons will keep the coin flowing into your coffers as you progressively gain more followers based on your capabilities. Profit is the name of the game and you have all of the tools needed to squeeze as much of it out of the local population as possible. After all, even the flesh from the corpses can make some delicious ground meat and what the villagers don’t know can’t hurt them, right?\n\n[b] Verdict [/b]\nGraveyard Keeper is a unique and entertaining title that will keep you coming back for more. Although I would have liked to have seen some kind of multiplayer in it, I can also acknowledge that the complex systems within the game could make that quite a challenge to implement. Unlike games like Stardew Valley or Coral Island, this one has a wide variety of upgrades and automation that would be quite unwieldy with multiple players attempting to take the wheel at once.\n\nHowever, the game that is here will keep you engaged for a lengthy period of time, easily earning its $20 sale price. I put in over seventy hours which included time with DLC content like opening and running your own tavern. It was a bittersweet feeling when I finally came to the end and watched the story conclude as I could’ve played for longer and still had a great time. Just be sure to temper your expectations regarding your own preferences as there is a healthy amount of grind in this experience as well.\n\nI highly recommend this title and hope that we’ll at some point get a sequel or at least a spiritual successor who learns from some of the great elements that were brought together in its design. May blessings follow you as you serve the local community as its newest Graveyard Keeper!",

To get there, you’ll be growing crops, crafting, trading, building up a mighty fine graveyard and church, clearing dungeons, and completing a bunch of questlines with the townsfolk.\n\nWhat I love most is the story and that incredibly satisfying feeling you get after finishing each quest.\n\nThe biggest difference between Graveyard Keeper and Stardew Valley is that Graveyard Keeper actually has an ending. You’ve got real goals, strong direction, and a sense that everything you do is pushing you toward something meaningful.\n\nOverall, I love this game.",

      "review": "[h1] Short Review of Graveyard Keeper + DLCs [/h1]\n\nGraveyard Keeper was a really entertaining experience. I started with the main game before buying the DLCs to see if it was worth the extra cost. (glad I did)\n\nThe base game is fun but a bit frustrating at first. Outside of a few main tutorials, the game gives you very little guidance, so you’ll often rely on the wiki. You might try crafting something and discover it needs a material or workstation you haven’t unlocked yet, which leads to another requirement, and so on. It’s a constant chain of tasks in the early game, but eventually everything starts to make sense.\n\nMy biggest issue was inventory management, specifically stacking. Smaller items like nails can stack high, while heavier materials like stone stack low. It’s realistic, but not practical. Having only a couple of standard stack sizes would have been much more user-friendly.\n\nOn the positive side, the dialogue is hilarious. There are so many clever jokes and funny moments sprinkled throughout the game.\n\n[i] Important note: I finished the main game before the DLCs. Playing everything at once might feel overwhelming. [/i]\n\n[h1] DLC Reviews [/h1]\n[h2] 1) Better Save Soul – 4/10 [/h2]\nThis one didn’t do much for me. The story was okay, but the content felt rushed and very easy to complete. If you’re not aiming for 100%, I’d honestly skip it.\n\n[h2] 2) Game of Crones – 7/10 [/h2]\nGreat lore and mostly fun gameplay, but I have mixed feelings about the rewards. Some items become useless after finishing the main game. Inventory management also becomes more annoying, and locking extra bag space behind a DLC isn’t something I’m a fan of. Still, the quests themselves were enjoyable.\n\n[h2] 3) Stranger Sins – 9/10 [/h2]\nEasily my favorite. The lore dumps are fantastic and answer many of the main game’s lingering questions. Building and running your own tavern is great, and hosting parties for extra income is a fun touch. I just wish there was a bit more customization, like with the church, but overall it’s the DLC I’d most recommend.\n\n[h1] Final Ratings: [/h1]\nMain Game – 8/10\nBetter Save Soul – 4/10\nGame of Crone – 7/10\nStranger Sins – 9/10\n\n[b] Overall – 7/10 [/b]",

So many funny moments and the dark humor just hits. Story is really interesting and makes me want to keep playing. Its got that \"simulator\" feel, kinda like Stardew Valley, but honestly, for me its even better cuz of the mystery behind the characters and shi. \n\nHonestly this is one of those games you can totally kick back with, spark one up, grab a drink and enjoy the weird little world they built. \n\nI’ve only just started but im already hooked and cant wait to see where the story goes next. The cozy vibe, the humor, the little secrets everywhere—it all just clicks.\n\nI did hit a little bug at the beginning but after resetting the game a couple of times, everything worked perfectly and I havent had any issues since.\n\nAlso, just a heads up—on key sites you can get this game for like $4, which is an absolute steal for how much content and fun you get.\nDefinitely recommend.",

I could not tear myself away from this game until I beat the story and I am seriously considering purchasing the DLC so I can play it again and make more.... \"ethically sourced\" burgers.\n\nI had a lot of fun discovering the alchemy recipes and restoring the church.  I like how the automation system with the zombies works, and I think that having a wacky sleep schedule instead of going to bed at the same time is nifty.  Making money is pretty difficult in the early game, but once you get into the later phases of the game it gets a lot easier.  The skill trees also offer a reasonable progression for in-game skills, and I found value in maxing out the skill tree.  The fishing system is also nice, I liked knowing the odds of catching the various fish in the fishing locations.  Another thing that really made the game interesting was the stacking food/drink buffs, so my character was running around copying manuscripts and carving marble statues living solely off of onion rings and beer (one of the most efficient food combos in the way I found myself playing the game).\n\nI will say that the pacing of the quests that require speaking to NPCs who only arrive on certain days is a little off.  I could finish a quest for one NPC and then have to wait almost an entire in-game week so that I could meet up with the next NPC required to progress the story, whose day was the day before that.  There are also several areas and characters who never really get explored in the base game, mostly because they are DLC only areas.  I thought for the longest time that I'd be able to go to one of them, and I even got the permit to do so, only to be struck down by lightning.  There's not really any sort of tutorial either so I had to google how to swing my sword, which wasn't very MLG of me (oh well).  Also, cooking food that has variable quantity ingredients can only be done one-at-a-time which is pretty annoying for someone whose character almost exclusively lived off of onion rings and beer.\n\nAaaaaand the big one.  I know that some people weren't very fond of the economy system, but I think it adds a slight bit of realism to the game.  Even though this is the game where nobody bats an eye if you're selling meat that came from a graveyard where there's no livestock....... but anyways, it's pretty realistic that the barkeeper doesn't want to keep buying wine from you for the same price for an entire week.  The only complaint I have regarding base game selling is that there are several artisan goods that you can make that are impossible to sell and just take up space.

My favorite parts are the gameplay, music, ambience, pixel art, characters, theme, fucking everything. I love this game and it really feels like it loves you back haha. No joke tho. I cannot wait to replay this..! With all the DLCs!! Here's advice from me: Play the game at your very own pace, do not be afraid to make mistakes! Try to google as little as possible cuz spoilers, but sometimes, you will need to. Use the wiki. and you may be overwhelmed in the start but just keep going! The better you are and the better you know the game, the more fun it is! I would say someone can deciede wether or not they like this game after playing at least 10 or 20 hours. Cuz i almost gave up on like 5h XD. But i'm glad i didn't! Now i have like 110hours. and i'll play plenty more! also, i think not having dlcs for the first playthrough is a good idea. Replay value, and you get a smoother first time playthrough. oh and if you're a no lifer with unlimited free time. Like i mean just free everyday all day, THEN THIS GaME IS PERFECT FOR YOU.\r\n\r\n10/10",

I even straight off laughing in some of the events. i wont forget that time when the inquisitor ask me to open up a burger stand. which i use human meat as the burger patty. that is fuckin hilarious man xD\n\nthe dlc is also fun, i thought its gonna be a half-assed made kind of dlcs. but damn, each of the dlc actually gives REAL perks. like improved inventory, new way to improve the graveyard scores, etc. very worth the time to finish all the quests in the dlc. maybe the only thing bugging me is the thing when you want to increase the scores in refugee camp. it is not a problem to give foods to them, its just the waiting time for the foods to take effect its kinda slow. but that is not even a major problem. and the reward is what i would say is one of the most important mechanics in the game. which is the bag system which helps a damn lot. so its worth it. there is no complaint on the other dlcs. \n\nfor the devs, you got another fan to the game. mark my words, do graveyard keeper 2, and i'll gladly buy the first time it went on preorder/early-access. cos i saw the ending that has a potential of the keeper doing shit in the town as a sequel. good job, very well done and very well-thought game. good job devs",

      "review": "[playtime inaccurate, offline-only player]\n\nI wanted to like this game so much and have spent (wasted) dozens of hours in that pursuit. The themes and gameplay loop are exactly my jam and I like where it deviates from other Stardew-esque games (e.g. nixing the social chats/birthdays/gifts, not forcing the player to sleep every day, etc). A common complaint is the grind, but it's a crafting game so I don't consider that an issue since without it there wouldn't be one... and frankly it's why I like the genre. The ingredients for a good experience exist.\n\nBut it fails SO hard that I've finally thrown in the towel after several hundred in-game days in my latest attempt and can't recommend it to anyone. The primary reason is because the game's design revolves around two key points: [b]obfuscation and inconvenience[/b].\n\nAlmost nothing about the various convoluted mechanics are explained in game. To an extent I rarely see it constantly forces even the most anti-walkthrough players (i.e. me) to use in-depth wikis and guides to be able to do almost anything, and that is an absolute showstopper. If your players have to resort to alt+tabbing out then you have failed as a developer, no exceptions. I don't care if the average idiot is already doing that. Plenty of us don't and more importantly [i]shouldn't have to[/i].\n\nWhile the first hurdle any player is probably going to face is how the corpse rating system works, it is *nothing* compared to the absolute absurdity that is the alchemy system. Every single thing about it is blind trial-and-error but nothing tracks the results so you either need to keep a thick notebook nearby, have a savant-tier memory, or constantly consult wikis. This applies to pretty much everything in the game... from small things (e.g. earning science or using a zombie) to large (e.g. the entire alchemy and corpse systems).\n\nAs for the inconvenience side of things: everything is absurdly far away for no reason other than to annoy you, the layouts of lots of areas are intentionally designed to not have an optimized way to traverse them, there's no to-do list or way to track recipes, chests are very limited and not possible to amass due to space restrictions, and buildable locations are not only incredibly limited but also unnecessarily punishing because you can't move anything without destroying it after it has been built.\n\nThe last point is a particular annoyance for me. If the devs wanted to limit where things were built then they should have just had static locations you build up. The illusion of choice without any way of knowing if you're screwing yourself is such a baffling design choice that it was either intentionally sadistic or conceived while huffing lethal levels of gasoline.\n\nThis doesn't even touch on how awful the dungeon and combat are, the infuriating sensitivity of where you have to be to actually interact with anything even though the prompt shows, the bugs (of which there are tons), the SAVE CORRUPTION, etc etc etc.\n\nIt could have been a good game, but it's an insufferable slog at every turn. Most frustratingly of all is that these issues are fixable. None of them are intrinsic to the experience and could have easily had additional QoL tweaks to work (e.g. an alchemy flowchart/journal, actually *useful* information on item tooltips once studied, movable buildings, expanded tutorial sections, etc).\n\nHugely wasted potential. I swear this genre is cursed.",

Our MC is flat dead wife trope, quests take so long to progress you forget about the NPCS who gave them to you and don't really care about them anyway, and it's so confusing that you have to reference the wiki often to see how to progress (which is just not good gameplay design, period). There's also a section of the game where you have to go through a maze that takes half a day. This game is so aggressively unfriendly to new players and the fan wiki and mods may be the only thing that saves it from being unplayable.",

If you liked or loved Stardew Valley, then Graveyard Keeeper will very much scratch that itch you been looking for in your next game. It does have... farming in its own way. Lets put it bluntly: Its obviously a decorating sim type of game here, just with a little more spooky stuff sprinkled on top. I still think this game oozes charm and personality in its writing and humor.\n\n...Even if I'm not a fan of games that punishes you with limited time. Graveyard Keeper unfortunately follows the same mistake and sins here for me as Stardew Valley did.\n\nBut...! Credit where credit is due: I do adore this type of graphics that this game uses... That nostalgic 16-bit SNES style. The game in terms of visuals is absolutely stunning! It looks like a very crispy (Zelda) \"A Link To The Past\", mixed with a sort of old school medieval PC style game like \"Tibia.\" Absolutely gorgeous to look at, and very good lighting effects. I'm a sucker for this art style and hope some big franchises make spin-off games in this style.\n\nBut I digress... Yeah, my issue lies with Graveyard Keeper's GAMEPLAY. The rest is fine! \n\nSo okay TLDR or in a nutshell: \nGraveyard Keeper overwhelms you with too much information at once, and gives you a sort of FOMO and anxiety on how to spend your time with the game. What to spend your skills on, what to craft first, what to focus on... etc etc. This is also why I have problems with Stardew Valley, they both don't let you choose WHEN the day ends. I really wish the game allowed ME to go to bed (in-game) and from there make the next day happen. I think a full day in-game is maybe... Seven and a half irl minutes... Its way too little. Too fast.\n\nMaybe I'm alone in this complaint but these type of games stresses me out and gives me major fear of missing out stuff because I'm doing something less productive or just want to explore around. I have ocd to explore every nook and cranny of a game.\n\nSo yes, I think this game might be perfect for some... but if you are like me in any sort of way: Then I can't say I recommend this game unfortunately.\n\n...That being said, I will give it one more chance. The humor, charm and graphics does deserves attention and praise.\n\nScore while this early review was made:\n\nGameplay: 4,5 / 10\nGraphics: 10 / 10\nSoundtrack: 6 / 10\nPersonality: 9 / 10",

      "review": "[playtime inaccurate, offline-only player]\n\nI wanted to like this game so much and have spent (wasted) dozens of hours in that pursuit. The themes and gameplay loop are exactly my jam and I like where it deviates from other Stardew-esque games (e.g. nixing the social chats/birthdays/gifts, not forcing the player to sleep every day, etc). A common complaint is the grind, but it's a crafting game so I don't consider that an issue since without it there wouldn't be one... and frankly it's why I like the genre. The ingredients for a good experience exist.\n\nBut it fails SO hard that I've finally thrown in the towel after several hundred in-game days in my latest attempt and can't recommend it to anyone. The primary reason is because the game's design revolves around two key points: [b]obfuscation and inconvenience[/b].\n\nAlmost nothing about the various convoluted mechanics are explained in game. To an extent I rarely see it constantly forces even the most anti-walkthrough players (i.e. me) to use in-depth wikis and guides to be able to do almost anything, and that is an absolute showstopper. If your players have to resort to alt+tabbing out then you have failed as a developer, no exceptions. I don't care if the average idiot is already doing that. Plenty of us don't and more importantly [i]shouldn't have to[/i].\n\nWhile the first hurdle any player is probably going to face is how the corpse rating system works, it is *nothing* compared to the absolute absurdity that is the alchemy system. Every single thing about it is blind trial-and-error but nothing tracks the results so you either need to keep a thick notebook nearby, have a savant-tier memory, or constantly consult wikis. This applies to pretty much everything in the game... from small things (e.g. earning science or using a zombie) to large (e.g. the entire alchemy and corpse systems).\n\nAs for the inconvenience side of things: everything is absurdly far away for no reason other than to annoy you, the layouts of lots of areas are intentionally designed to not have an optimized way to traverse them, there's no to-do list or way to track recipes, chests are very limited and not possible to amass due to space restrictions, and buildable locations are not only incredibly limited but also unnecessarily punishing because you can't move anything without destroying it after it has been built.\n\nThe last point is a particular annoyance for me. If the devs wanted to limit where things were built then they should have just had static locations you build up. The illusion of choice without any way of knowing if you're screwing yourself is such a baffling design choice that it was either intentionally sadistic or conceived while huffing lethal levels of gasoline.\n\nThis doesn't even touch on how awful the dungeon and combat are, the infuriating sensitivity of where you have to be to actually interact with anything even though the prompt shows, the bugs (of which there are tons), the SAVE CORRUPTION, etc etc etc.\n\nIt could have been a good game, but it's an insufferable slog at every turn. Most frustratingly of all is that these issues are fixable. None of them are intrinsic to the experience and could have easily had additional QoL tweaks to work (e.g. an alchemy flowchart/journal, actually *useful* information on item tooltips once studied, movable buildings, expanded tutorial sections, etc).\n\nHugely wasted potential. I swear this genre is cursed.",

      "review": "Graveyard Keeper bills itself as a dark, medieval spin on the Stardew Valley formula — managing a graveyard instead of a farm, crafting your way through strange and morbid tasks, and unraveling a quirky, tongue-in-cheek story. On paper, that sounds amazing. In practice, though, the game becomes a frustrating grind that struggles to balance charm with playability.\r\n\r\nThe Good\r\n\r\nUnique Concept: The idea of running a graveyard as the core mechanic is genuinely fresh. The first few hours of digging graves, preparing bodies, and upgrading your church are intriguing.\r\n\r\nArt & Atmosphere: The pixel art is detailed and pleasant, and the moody-yet-comedic vibe works well.\r\n\r\nHumor: The writing has a few funny moments that poke fun at modern life and classic RPG tropes.\r\n\r\nThe Not-So-Good\r\n\r\nThe Grind is Endless: Progression is tied to sprawling, interconnected crafting chains that quickly become overwhelming. Every small task requires several layers of prerequisites, so instead of feeling rewarding, progress often feels like busywork.\r\n\r\nRepetitive Gameplay: What starts as novel soon becomes tedious. After 10–15 hours, you’re mostly running back and forth, juggling timers, and waiting for resources to process. Unlike other life-sim games where the loop feels cozy and rewarding, here it just drags.\r\n\r\nOverly Convoluted Systems: The game feels unnecessarily complicated, with too many layered mechanics that seem more like padding than meaningful gameplay. It often feels like the systems are designed to stretch out playtime rather than create depth.\r\n\r\nQuality of Life Issues: Inventory management is a nightmare, crafting stations are scattered, and there’s way too much backtracking for even the simplest of tasks. Several QoL additions — like better inventory sorting, centralized crafting, or clearer progression paths — could have made the game far less of a tedious chore.\r\n\r\nPacing Issues: Quests and unlocks are gated behind grind-heavy requirements, so story beats and new mechanics appear at a snail’s pace. Instead of feeling motivated to see what’s next, I often felt drained and reluctant to continue.\r\n\r\nStory & Characters Fall Flat: The narrative tries for satire, but the characters never become memorable. Jokes land occasionally, but they can’t carry the game through the long stretches of monotonous gameplay.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\n\r\nGraveyard Keeper starts strong, with a unique premise and a good sense of style. But the deeper you go, the more the cracks show. What could have been a morbidly fun alternative to Stardew Valley ends up being a tedious, grind-heavy experience that mistakes convolution for complexity.\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking for a cozy life-sim with satisfying progression, this isn’t it. The art and concept might pull you in, but the padded systems and lack of quality-of-life features will likely push you away before long.\r\n\r\nVerdict: Not Recommended.",

So if you want something Stardew Valley - esque and don't really care if you finish or not you'll get good value from it.\r\n\r\nWhat really killed my enjoyment of the game though is the end grind. The game introduces you to a cool loop of dealing with bodies and managing your graveyard and that's fun. What it doesn't tell you is winning the game isn't related to that loop at all. You actually have to complete six NPC quest lines.\r\n\r\nFor a while these are kind of fun and you are kept busy with lots of different things. The mid-game is actually pretty hectic as there are a few too many systems and things to track and all the work stations are quite far apart.\r\n\r\nBut during the last third of the game the wheels kind of fall off. The graveyard and the bodies don't matter after you've upgraded your church to the last stage. For much of the game you don't need to worry about money until suddenly you need to grind cash. Once you hit the target though it goes back to not mattering. The last fifth of the tech tree doesn't seem to be used for anything and if it is used its for like a one off quest item. Compare with something like Factorio where all the extra convolution is adding up to a final product. In Graveyard Keeper the extra things get added and then forgotten and don't build upon one another in a meaningful way. \r\n\r\nAnd wrapping up the NPC quest lines at the end just got me to quit. The key NPCs are only available *one* day out of the whole week. So if you finish crafting a quest item but its an hour too late the NPC won't be available again for another whole week and you are kind of left with nothing to do since all the other busy-work doesn't really matter in the end. So sadly I just go bored quick.\r\n\r\nSo overall, its fun for a good while but the end is a bit of a boring grind.",

Prolly it needs a longer hatching time but still 8 hours is 8 hours and I see no breakthrough in anywhere! Moreover the atmosphere is quite disappointing as well for I was waiting good ghastly set up even some real horror, but what I got was a childish jumping skull with amnesia - a talking commie donkey had potential though, but the progression is far too static to enjoy the dialogue. It just gets dull when every problem you face you are suppose to 1) Just go blindly searching an item like carrots, wondering aimlessly for hours (might see a farm site having carrots but you can't pick them), 2) get your google open and find a solution for such simple task or 3) build an telepathic link between you and the dev, who seems to believe that everybody thinks how they do. Owkey.. there is nothing wrong with google, but when it seems that the only way to prevent grinding is to go look for 3rd party information, problem after another it does ruin the mood - to the bottom! I have spent more time in google than digging graves, damn it!!\n\nAlso the world is quite small, of course you unlock some new places while you progress, but like I have already made clear - it is an obtuse process. There have been few fights and this far I have seen \"magnificent\" 2 enemy types which could be dealt blindfolded and provided some ingredients which use remains still undiscovered. The musical yield grows thin. The scores are ok, but nothing near to spectacular that you would want to hear them in loop over and over and over again.\n\nI am not a farmer simulation specialist, but there should be always a some sort of carrot - a bait to keep you going. Graveyard Keeper however gives you bait so stiff and moldy to chew that it just leaves you exhausted and unsatisfied. I may give it another 8 hours, which might be a mistake but I am brainless enough to take my chances. For now however the game has proven far too boring to call it entertainment.

The start felt very uncurated and seemed like all the DLC contents were just haphazardly placed in the game without forethought of a new player\r\n\t[*]Terrible UI and Inventory management. Not sure about the experience on K&M but the controller UI experience really adds to the tedium of the game and feels even worse when you get item-specific bags that should work great but don't sort according to items readily. Two examples of how bad the bags are is (1) the fisherman's bag where if you have bait/lure in that bag you can't actually access them as bait/lure when fishing and they need to be in your primary bag instead, and (2) to have an item, like Health Potion, go to their specific (Potions) bag you first have to fill up your primary bag for that item to go to their specific bag.\r\n\t[*]Lack of information (in-game of course). I'm fine with having to figure out unknowns like recipes and things to do. What I didn't like were (1) Tasks/Quests with no way of repeating what they were about and just given a sometimes vague line as a reminder of what to do, and (2) Crafting things don't provide adequate information on where they can be crafted (locations) and what the item actually does (like for prayers you have to go to the Tech/Knowledge menu just to see what a prayer does)\r\n[/list]\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[h3]What I did enjoy though were:[/h3]\r\n[list]\r\n\t[*]The complexity of the morgue, soul and graveyard systems were really great and felt like the only properly fleshed out part of the game\r\n\t[*]Plenty of stuff to do and actions are pretty quick instead of feeling like mindless tasks\r\n[/list]\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[h3]Achievements:[/h3]\r\n[list]\r\n\t[*]Had missable achievements and only one save for each game, why even bother going back to replay\r\n\t[*]Not a fan of fishing and you had to do 200, I'll pass\r\n[/list]",

If you liked or loved Stardew Valley, then Graveyard Keeeper will very much scratch that itch you been looking for in your next game. It does have... farming in its own way. Lets put it bluntly: Its obviously a decorating sim type of game here, just with a little more spooky stuff sprinkled on top. I still think this game oozes charm and personality in its writing and humor.\n\n...Even if I'm not a fan of games that punishes you with limited time. Graveyard Keeper unfortunately follows the same mistake and sins here for me as Stardew Valley did.\n\nBut...! Credit where credit is due: I do adore this type of graphics that this game uses... That nostalgic 16-bit SNES style. The game in terms of visuals is absolutely stunning! It looks like a very crispy (Zelda) \"A Link To The Past\", mixed with a sort of old school medieval PC style game like \"Tibia.\" Absolutely gorgeous to look at, and very good lighting effects. I'm a sucker for this art style and hope some big franchises make spin-off games in this style.\n\nBut I digress... Yeah, my issue lies with Graveyard Keeper's GAMEPLAY. The rest is fine! \n\nSo okay TLDR or in a nutshell: \nGraveyard Keeper overwhelms you with too much information at once, and gives you a sort of FOMO and anxiety on how to spend your time with the game. What to spend your skills on, what to craft first, what to focus on... etc etc. This is also why I have problems with Stardew Valley, they both don't let you choose WHEN the day ends. I really wish the game allowed ME to go to bed (in-game) and from there make the next day happen. I think a full day in-game is maybe... Seven and a half irl minutes... Its way too little. Too fast.\n\nMaybe I'm alone in this complaint but these type of games stresses me out and gives me major fear of missing out stuff because I'm doing something less productive or just want to explore around. I have ocd to explore every nook and cranny of a game.\n\nSo yes, I think this game might be perfect for some... but if you are like me in any sort of way: Then I can't say I recommend this game unfortunately.\n\n...That being said, I will give it one more chance. The humor, charm and graphics does deserves attention and praise.\n\nScore while this early review was made:\n\nGameplay: 4,5 / 10\nGraphics: 10 / 10\nSoundtrack: 6 / 10\nPersonality: 9 / 10",

      "review": "[playtime inaccurate, offline-only player]\n\nI wanted to like this game so much and have spent (wasted) dozens of hours in that pursuit. The themes and gameplay loop are exactly my jam and I like where it deviates from other Stardew-esque games (e.g. nixing the social chats/birthdays/gifts, not forcing the player to sleep every day, etc). A common complaint is the grind, but it's a crafting game so I don't consider that an issue since without it there wouldn't be one... and frankly it's why I like the genre. The ingredients for a good experience exist.\n\nBut it fails SO hard that I've finally thrown in the towel after several hundred in-game days in my latest attempt and can't recommend it to anyone. The primary reason is because the game's design revolves around two key points: [b]obfuscation and inconvenience[/b].\n\nAlmost nothing about the various convoluted mechanics are explained in game. To an extent I rarely see it constantly forces even the most anti-walkthrough players (i.e. me) to use in-depth wikis and guides to be able to do almost anything, and that is an absolute showstopper. If your players have to resort to alt+tabbing out then you have failed as a developer, no exceptions. I don't care if the average idiot is already doing that. Plenty of us don't and more importantly [i]shouldn't have to[/i].\n\nWhile the first hurdle any player is probably going to face is how the corpse rating system works, it is *nothing* compared to the absolute absurdity that is the alchemy system. Every single thing about it is blind trial-and-error but nothing tracks the results so you either need to keep a thick notebook nearby, have a savant-tier memory, or constantly consult wikis. This applies to pretty much everything in the game... from small things (e.g. earning science or using a zombie) to large (e.g. the entire alchemy and corpse systems).\n\nAs for the inconvenience side of things: everything is absurdly far away for no reason other than to annoy you, the layouts of lots of areas are intentionally designed to not have an optimized way to traverse them, there's no to-do list or way to track recipes, chests are very limited and not possible to amass due to space restrictions, and buildable locations are not only incredibly limited but also unnecessarily punishing because you can't move anything without destroying it after it has been built.\n\nThe last point is a particular annoyance for me. If the devs wanted to limit where things were built then they should have just had static locations you build up. The illusion of choice without any way of knowing if you're screwing yourself is such a baffling design choice that it was either intentionally sadistic or conceived while huffing lethal levels of gasoline.\n\nThis doesn't even touch on how awful the dungeon and combat are, the infuriating sensitivity of where you have to be to actually interact with anything even though the prompt shows, the bugs (of which there are tons), the SAVE CORRUPTION, etc etc etc.\n\nIt could have been a good game, but it's an insufferable slog at every turn. Most frustratingly of all is that these issues are fixable. None of them are intrinsic to the experience and could have easily had additional QoL tweaks to work (e.g. an alchemy flowchart/journal, actually *useful* information on item tooltips once studied, movable buildings, expanded tutorial sections, etc).\n\nHugely wasted potential. I swear this genre is cursed.",

Everything feels so slow, everything is locked behind research that, in my opinion, isn’t well designed. The game just wears me out really quickly.",

If I don't google it or look on reddit, I am moving from object to object trying to figure out what I can do. The NPC task lists don't help. If anyone has a comprehensive guide or playthrough I'd be happy to delete this comment, but for now I'm just putting the game away as it's incredibly frustrating.",

      "review": "Graveyard Keeper bills itself as a dark, medieval spin on the Stardew Valley formula — managing a graveyard instead of a farm, crafting your way through strange and morbid tasks, and unraveling a quirky, tongue-in-cheek story. On paper, that sounds amazing. In practice, though, the game becomes a frustrating grind that struggles to balance charm with playability.\r\n\r\nThe Good\r\n\r\nUnique Concept: The idea of running a graveyard as the core mechanic is genuinely fresh. The first few hours of digging graves, preparing bodies, and upgrading your church are intriguing.\r\n\r\nArt & Atmosphere: The pixel art is detailed and pleasant, and the moody-yet-comedic vibe works well.\r\n\r\nHumor: The writing has a few funny moments that poke fun at modern life and classic RPG tropes.\r\n\r\nThe Not-So-Good\r\n\r\nThe Grind is Endless: Progression is tied to sprawling, interconnected crafting chains that quickly become overwhelming. Every small task requires several layers of prerequisites, so instead of feeling rewarding, progress often feels like busywork.\r\n\r\nRepetitive Gameplay: What starts as novel soon becomes tedious. After 10–15 hours, you’re mostly running back and forth, juggling timers, and waiting for resources to process. Unlike other life-sim games where the loop feels cozy and rewarding, here it just drags.\r\n\r\nOverly Convoluted Systems: The game feels unnecessarily complicated, with too many layered mechanics that seem more like padding than meaningful gameplay. It often feels like the systems are designed to stretch out playtime rather than create depth.\r\n\r\nQuality of Life Issues: Inventory management is a nightmare, crafting stations are scattered, and there’s way too much backtracking for even the simplest of tasks. Several QoL additions — like better inventory sorting, centralized crafting, or clearer progression paths — could have made the game far less of a tedious chore.\r\n\r\nPacing Issues: Quests and unlocks are gated behind grind-heavy requirements, so story beats and new mechanics appear at a snail’s pace. Instead of feeling motivated to see what’s next, I often felt drained and reluctant to continue.\r\n\r\nStory & Characters Fall Flat: The narrative tries for satire, but the characters never become memorable. Jokes land occasionally, but they can’t carry the game through the long stretches of monotonous gameplay.\r\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\r\n\r\nGraveyard Keeper starts strong, with a unique premise and a good sense of style. But the deeper you go, the more the cracks show. What could have been a morbidly fun alternative to Stardew Valley ends up being a tedious, grind-heavy experience that mistakes convolution for complexity.\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking for a cozy life-sim with satisfying progression, this isn’t it. The art and concept might pull you in, but the padded systems and lack of quality-of-life features will likely push you away before long.\r\n\r\nVerdict: Not Recommended.",

      "review": "This game is Rage-Bait at it's finest. Every time you unlock something you need to progress, you need to find or unlock 3 other things to make said thing. It's a wild goose chase game that you can never actually do what you want because you are forced to do something else to get a million other things just to do the initial thing you wanted to do.\n\nNeed paper? Extract Skin from corpses to make it. Sounds simple right? NOPE! Now you have to progress far enough to unlock the Church, then do a couple Sermon's (which is like 2 weeks time) then build the Church workbench to make it? NOPE! You gotta get blue points to unlock the tech for it which requires the Study Table. Craft that, then study items to get blue points right? NOPE! Now you need Science Points to fuel the Study Table...How do I get Science Points? BACK TO THE WIKI. Oh I need to put paper in the Study Table to get Science Points. My GAWD! \n\nThen you need \"Ink and Paper\" ok I'll make it at the crafting bench since I just learned the Tech for it. Nope, now you need \"Ink\" AND \"Paper\" to make it. So how do you make Ink? Some Flasks and Black Paint! It's a fools errand to play this damn game, and I'm fed up with it. \n\nTLDR: If you like a wild goose chase with no end, and rage-inducing games, This is for you.  Highly Recommended.",

      "review": "If Stardew Valley had a dissection minigame, that would make this game feel like a piece of trash. A game that calls itself Graveyard Keeper should focus more on actual graveyard-keeping tasks, but instead I end up doing everything else: farming, mining, fishing, activities that I can already do in Stardew Valley, and in a much more enjoyable way.\n\nP.S. While the game appears to have depth, its poor guidance makes it difficult to figure out what to do, which significantly ruined my experience. If you’re not prepared to look up information online yourself, you probably won’t enjoy it.",

If I have to Google how to do certain things because it's left so incredibly vague, it's a problem.  But if you're happy to do that, you'll probably have a lot more fun in this game.  To me, it just seems like poor design.\n\nIt's like Stardew Valley but darker, and with worse controls. Also, I got a strange bug where I couldn't progress because it said I had to be somewhere on a specific day of the week.  But when that day rolled around and the cutscene played, my character was immobile even after the cutscene ended.\n\nHonestly, I would probably still be playing it instead of complaining if that didn't happen.  But I'd have likely quit shortly after anyway.",

Unfortunately the gameplay falls really short for my ability to enjoy and recommend it. \r\n\r\nPROS:\r\n- Unique story and theme\r\n- Nice artwork and music\r\n- Overall good concept\r\n\r\nCONS:\r\n- Quests are incredible uneven in your ability to understand and complete.\r\n- Inventory management is complex and frustrating\r\n- Crafting recipes are obtuse. You cannot play this game without a wiki. It needs a clear recipe book.\r\n- Many \"basics\" of the game are either never explained or hidden very deep. It's very easy to trap yourself early on with nothing to do.\r\n- There's a lot of complex stuff you can build that will have nothing interesting or benefical for you. \r\n- You can't move buildings and in many places you have a pre-defined area where buildings go. It's frustrating to manage your production.\r\n\r\nBasically, I spent about 20 hours on it and I really had no feeling about why I should continue. I have no concept of the quests and what they'll do for me in the game or why any action actually has value.",
