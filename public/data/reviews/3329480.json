Also the new calibration just doesn’t seem to work well at all. Inconsistent expressions, twitchy eyebrows, and can’t even manage a closed teeth grin without showing my mouth completely open. Perhaps this has to do with how my avatar’s face tracking was configured, and I’ll investigate accordingly, but implementing a huge change like this that forces creators to update their tuned face tracking parameters isn’t ideal.\n\nIf you get this, I suggest reverting to a previous build.",
