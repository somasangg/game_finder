      "review": "This game rocks but requires you to roleplay a bit to make the most of it imo. Treating it like a tycoon sim ends up being unsatisfying because it is incredibly easy to become the economic center of wherever you build a factory, and past a certain point you can essentially print money by selling ships to both sides of a war. And printing money is a problem in this game because the more factories you build and the larger your fleet, the more you get to deal with the games poor performance, terrible UI and the AI that you must constantly wrestle with to keep your various fleets from committing suicide. Fortunately unless you're looking up epic money making methods on reddit, it takes a good 60+ hours to get to that point. And ideally, that point won't come if you do a bit of roleplaying as mentioned and give yourself goals besides being space Bezos. Figure out what faction you like and work toward their interests, make enemies, join wars, limit your expansion. Its like having fun in a grand strategy, in the sense that power gaming will leave the game feeling empty.\n\nGame is incredible though. There just isn't another video game where you can fly in your tiny ship and land on the big carrier you own, walk to the bridge to drive it yourself and dock it at the space station you designed, and watch ships from various factions flow into the station to trade and buy the stuff you produced. All while the Argon AI embarrassingly tries to destroy the Xenon flagship that has been parked in their home sector for the past 60 hours and has a kill count in the thousands, while your own trade ships continue to route through the sector and get added to the shit list despite it being blacklisted. Its a special game",

After more than 150 hours (still on my first save), I’ve barely scratched the surface. The learning curve is steep at first and the UI can take a bit of getting used to, but the tutorials are solid and there’s plenty of help online, including community sites for planning stations and comparing ships.\r\n\r\nI’ve only added a couple of small QoL mods, though there are thousands out there, even full conversion ones (like the Star Wars one). I’m completely hooked. If you enjoy sandbox games and the freedom to build your own empire, this is perfect. The story missions are good too and give you plenty to do when you want direction, along with missions from other factions.\r\n\r\nIf you are still on the fence, get it on sale (looks like it goes on sale often) - and consider the DLCs, at the very least those that expand the universe even more.",

      "review": "As many other reviewers have previously stated, the UI is dense and confusing initially--we're talking approximately 50 to 100 hours before your mind wraps around it and the dawn of UI awareness begins to pierce the overbearing veil of inexperience. \n\nIf you overly dedicate yourself to learning the UI and how it properly functions you could reach it sooner, and there's no game without learning it. Sure, you can jump in and fly around, after the minor, and confusing, ordeal of mapping your keys.\n\nIt's about patience and dedication, simulations have a natural tendency to be more intellectually challenging. Many people want to jump in a game and have the game mentally apprehended quickly, and that's fine. X4 isn't that game, sorry. \n\nBefore I move on, let me qualify myself, behind the UI veil is a magnificent simulation--magical, almost. However, again, as other reviewers have proclaimed, occasionally AI dysfunctions occur throughout the game. This I've experienced on occasions, but in no way has this detracted from my overall joyful experience. \n\nThe game is visually stunning, even more so, on rigs with herculean-inspired graphics cards. But, thousands of reviewers have stated the visual beauty (or ugliness) of the game. \n\nI'm here to be a warning like others have said prior, you have to learn the UI to play the game, unequivocally. You have to trust the developers on why they constructed it as such. As you play, it opens up, and begins to make sense. There's no wasted pages, it's just mildly complex, not overly complicated.\n\nIf you dedicate yourself to learning the game it will surprise you with many hours of entertainment, and you might find yourself keeping the game running while you're busy doing other stuff around the house. You never know, you could make an extra million or more from your Boron Bofu factory while you're away washing dishes.",

X4 does this the best in the series if you ask me. It doesn't have everything that the X3 games had but its close and, at least to me, it does the things it does have better than X3.\n\nThe 8.0 version of the game is just an amazing space sim and one of the best of the genre.

The thing is, there are many dominating space-oriented games out there that fit this description, so the best way to address this is to address how it compares to it's competition...\n\nElite Dangerous: Ok, elite dangerous has tons of lore, but is pretty much devoid of substance. X4 has both job offier type missions (random) and story missions (not random) that are optional, unlike elite. Another major feature of X4 is that, unlike previous X games, all but a select few factions, everything in the universe is simulated. So every ore piece you bring contributes to whether or not a ship gets build which could either save your rear or pose a threat. Resources respawn, but how they're spent matters. Moreoever, you can own your own stations, production lines, etc, so you can eventually be self-sufficient. The universe in X4 is also way smaller, as well, making navigating the whole thing a normal thing you do. X4 also allows you to own fleets of carriers, repair ships, etc which can all join you in battle or just mine with you or whatever you're doing.\n\nNo Man's Sky: NMS is like elite, but with substance, so this naturally follows (and builds off of the differences with Elite). No Man's Sky is a watered-down elite but with substance. However No Man's Sky, like Elite, does not have the simulation aspects. What No Man's Sky uniquely brings is the ability to [i]design[/i] your own ships and multiplayer. X4 lacks designing (you can build your own ships and change equipment in X4, but you can't design corvettes), but it does allow you to design your own stations (which NMS does not). X4 focus' on space as well, with first person movement being strictly on ships and stations.\n\nSpace Engineers: Space engineers focuses on a minecraft like experience, really. Economy seems to be fundamentally different.\n\nEverspace: Haven't gotten around to playing it, but my understanding is that everspace is FTL, but 3d, and closer to wing commander.\n\nWing Commander: Mission oriented, plot only. X4 is cloer to space trucker (but only if you choose that life). Combat exists in X4, but it's not the sole focus, so you're going to be going from A to Z manually (through gates as jumpoints) yourself instead.\n\nThe main reason to choose X4, really, is to play a laid-back game (not always laid back, but comparatively moreso than anything other than elite, because elite is boring) where you're a small cog in a machine that can outgrow and become the machine. It's hard to grasp, but you don't have to fully understand it to get your foot in the door. It's complexity is often overblown by min-maxers, but you can do fine going in blind.",

From a resource being mined, sent to be processed, then being used for building a ship, and finally the ship being destroyed. There are very few things that spawn out of nowhere. The only ones i can think of are mission-related objects, [spoiler] Khaak, SCA ships and maybe some Xenon patrols [/spoiler]\r\n- Player having a real impact on the global economy. I mean, you can have fun selling weapon parts to a faction and (re)building materials to its enemies. How real can it get, right ?\r\n- The progression, although being slow, is [b]really[/b] satisfying. From buying your first mining ship to building your first station, then losing a whole fleet to a bad strategic decision and eventually conquering all that exists, be it peacefully or [strike]with Asgards[/strike] by force.\r\n- Once you get the hang of all the flight controls, the fights feel really good. I'd recommend turning off the auto align setting though.\r\n- Mods are a thing and can fix a lot of issues you could have with the game design. Lots of QoL mods on the workshop.\r\n- Space.\r\n- Automation. We love automation.\r\n\r\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\r\n\r\n- Early game is just a nuisance once you're already past the learning stage\r\n- Don't expect to have a high fps count when you're at the stage of big battles (100+ ships).\r\n- Cinematics are comically bad. Egosoft PLEASE stop trying so hard with the cinematics. They s*ck. Just embrace the limits of your XML-based game. Y'all are not Hollywood directors.\r\n- Boarding is bad. When I started playing the game, i thought i would not use the \"fly-by boarding\" cheese which seemed unbalanced. But hey, try boarding a ship once and tell me it's fun. I DARE YOU !\r\n- Audio is inconsistent. [b]THE SPLIT AGENT KEEPS MAKING MY EARS BLEED[/b]. I know it comes from a DLC, but I even checked in the game files and the volume multiplier for the Split being different to the other ones is just a weird implementation.\r\n- Voice acting. Is it just bad ? Is it AI ? Too lazy to investigate so I'll just say it sounds bad.\r\n- UI is not the worst I've seen. But some actions requires too many clicks in my opinion.\r\n- Can't move the camera on the Y axis on the map, or during station building.\r\n- Being used to quick save frequently and/or lowering the autosave interval is mandatory. You [b]WILL[/b] be wrongly accused of some crime and at the brink of war at some point, just because one of your ships decided to have a small amount of spaceweed for it's personal use.\r\n- \"Bring an Asgard\" being the solution to any problem you could have in this game.\r\n\r\n\r\nI could go on and on listing the smallest issues i had whilst playing this game, but even when writing them down, i really think the cons aren't [b]that[/b] bad.\r\nThe worst point being the late game performances.\r\nBut at the end of the day i envision the late game more as a strategy game than an action game. Why pilot your own fighter and risk your life when you can have the comfort of your luxurious base and just yell orders to your [strike]cannon fodder[/strike] fleet commanders ?\r\n\r\nAnyway, love the game. Would recommend.",

I really want to love this game, and feel strange leaving a negative review after so much time played, but hopefully it saves others a similar realization after already getting invested.\r\n\r\nThe cracks first started to show when I began to command a fleet rather than playing as a single ship. Want to issue a command to your squad of interceptors to prevent them from chasing an enemy ship too deep into enemy territory? That move command will be queued to the end of each ship's action list, meaning you have to manually clear the default intercept action if you want it to be followed. That behavior single-handedly prevents any RTS-style micromanagement, despite X4 being branded as playable like an RTS.\r\n\r\nThe real nail in the coffin for me though was realizing just how bad the enemy and player fleet AI actually is. Xenon destroyers are seemingly unstoppable killing machines when you first face them, even mowing through fleets of 20-40 ships with ease, but it's ok, because all you need to do is just hang back and wait. Eventually they'll fly head first into a base's guns, suiciding without a single shot fired. The same can be said for other factions - they're all just haphazardly throwing ships at each other in a piecemeal fashion. Occasionally a scripted event gives a brief illusion of something more tangible forming, but it quickly devolves back into the same nonsensical behavior, with cohesive fleets fanning out and suiciding into various structures, destroyers, etc rather than keeping formation and attacking viable targets at their optimal range.\r\n\r\nThe simulation itself really is such an impressive feat that you've got such a large world that can be played locally at such significant scale. It's just too bad that it quickly turns out to be all window dressing with very little depth due to the complete lack of functional AI. In my book, that single-handedly takes x4 from being a game, down to just being an impressive simulation.",

It worked before patch 8.0, small ships were dive-bombing just fine, why touch something that worked?), fail to trade, fail to mine, sometimes buy like 100x goods, when there's available 10000 and your stating needs 20K and has money, keep mining under fire, keep fighting being miner against military fleet and do all other dumb shit, station managers will auto-allocate storage space to absurd amounts, like request millions of metric tons of some good, while entire production line barely can process few thousands... \n\nYou can lose entire fleet capable of cleaning system from enemy presence on their single capital ship because they simply go to the enemy turret and die. Or you can take one of your interceptors and solo enemy capship by destroying their surface equipment and then use fleet to kill the defenseless hull. Or you can solo it with own capship, literally any capship of dozens you could lose by simply command AI to attack on their own. So it's not a balance issue, it's just idiotic AI. Yet, player simply can't be everywhere and fight every battle manually, why do we even need crew hired then and talented admiral picked from your ranks? \n\nAnd then you learn, that some enemies are immortal (you can't defeat their faction, because they have no economy) and they will attack player the more frequently the more ships player faction has and so cripple players economy, same with pirates, they will periodically attack exclusively player stealing goods or killing economy ships, and pirate factions also immortal and spawn ships from nowhere. Not even to mention hidden cooldowns for money sources, hidden debuffs working only on player economy and so on... Game already super-slow pacing, and you can play years in one playthrough, what's the point in haulting progression - I don't know, but this policy is extremely consistent across the entire game, you will be haulted and bottle necked in many places. Player have to play years and grind their path to do endgame.\n\nEndgame... there's none, you realize this once you become too powerful. There's no much to do once you complete scenarios and DLC missions, that are mostly early to midgame. You can get angry robots crisis which effectively is just map-scale wave-defense against enemy fleets with stop-event inside. Nothing more, you will kill such waves thousand times starting from midgame. So, what the point of grind to endgame if there's none? It always more interesting to start anew, except this boring and slow grind to get at least some property in the game. \n\nAnd then we return back to shit AI that will turn player effort to ruin in every turn, forcing us into endless micro-management of every ship we got in the game. And without player property, corporation, stations and fleets it's just another spacesim and very bad at this, because basic mechanics made for large fleet actions.\n\nI really hope devs at least read player's feedback in different platforms and will fix AI at some point, because in current state it just grind to sacrifice hours of progression into single defense of your own system. \n\nI want to give a good review, but this game is simply unplayable in 8.0 version, AI always was a mess in X series, but not this bad...",

It's like they intentionally made the controls as unintutive as possible. Like they played other space and fps games and specifically designed controls not to match what people are used. It's not just the default keybinds being completely miss assigned, the name sof controls in the keybind menu are nonsense. Theres a bunch of keys that just don't let you use, like shift and control. \n\nFor keyboard and mouse, use W, A, S, D for strafing. Sounds about right yeh? no W and S strafe up and down, not forward and backward. Specifically trolling people that have actually played games before.\n Shift + Space to enable steering. Yeh you read that right, you have to enable steering.. as if thats not the most basic default mechanic of any first or third person game ever.\nTab to boost, because shift and space are too busy enabling the advanced ability to look around i guess.\n Backspace to brake, what? your using your right hand for your mouse? crazy talk!\n\nWhat about moving forwards you might ask? Well thats a complex maneuver you see, so you may want to take notes: You hold X, then hold LMB and then drag the mouse forwards. \n\nThis is what happens when devs are just compeltely ignorant and havn't done any playtesting or research or hell even played other games.",

A new player will need to spend dozens of hours just to get a grasp of how the game works.\r\n\r\nThere are many amusing moments: the game claims to be an economic simulator, but it requires hours of micromanagement of units for this system to work properly (without the right skill level, your units are unable to do many tasks). I also found an exploit that allows capturing ships without losing reputation. Otherwise, if you want to earn something meaningful in this game, be prepared to spend hundreds of hours.

I really want to love this game, and feel strange leaving a negative review after so much time played, but hopefully it saves others a similar realization after already getting invested.\r\n\r\nThe cracks first started to show when I began to command a fleet rather than playing as a single ship. Want to issue a command to your squad of interceptors to prevent them from chasing an enemy ship too deep into enemy territory? That move command will be queued to the end of each ship's action list, meaning you have to manually clear the default intercept action if you want it to be followed. That behavior single-handedly prevents any RTS-style micromanagement, despite X4 being branded as playable like an RTS.\r\n\r\nThe real nail in the coffin for me though was realizing just how bad the enemy and player fleet AI actually is. Xenon destroyers are seemingly unstoppable killing machines when you first face them, even mowing through fleets of 20-40 ships with ease, but it's ok, because all you need to do is just hang back and wait. Eventually they'll fly head first into a base's guns, suiciding without a single shot fired. The same can be said for other factions - they're all just haphazardly throwing ships at each other in a piecemeal fashion. Occasionally a scripted event gives a brief illusion of something more tangible forming, but it quickly devolves back into the same nonsensical behavior, with cohesive fleets fanning out and suiciding into various structures, destroyers, etc rather than keeping formation and attacking viable targets at their optimal range.\r\n\r\nThe simulation itself really is such an impressive feat that you've got such a large world that can be played locally at such significant scale. It's just too bad that it quickly turns out to be all window dressing with very little depth due to the complete lack of functional AI. In my book, that single-handedly takes x4 from being a game, down to just being an impressive simulation.",

Ships suiciding into larger ships for no reason, ships flying solo into a swarm of enemies and dying for no reason, some ships set to defend just sitting still in space getting blasted without reacting, some ships set to intercept choosing targets furthest from their carrier when there are targets right next to it, and you guessed it, get cut off and die. Capital ships ignoring enemy laser turrets that are killing every repair drone they launch even though there are no other enemy targets in the area. Capital ships that have long range main guns but suicide boost towards enemy capitals to knife fight them... the list goes on.\r\n\r\nEven simple move commands given to ships... THEY CAN'T EVEN GO TO A SPECIFIC EMPTY SPOT IN SPACE!\r\nI've watched my XL carrier fly AWAY from the point I told it to fly to then give up without completing the command and resuming default behaviour until I manually clear and reissue the command and it then overshoots and keeps flying off... like wtf.\r\n\r\nI've tried mods to fix the shitty AI behaviours and in some cases it helps, but in others you just get to watch vanilla AI scripts and mod AI scripts fight each other and still not result in expected behaviour and in all cases you lose.

Absolutely pathetic.\r\n\r\nThis would be a 10/10 if the player owned combat AI ships simply did what you told them and acted predictably and intelligently based on the roles instead of whatever paint huffing doorknob licking bullshit this is.",

      "review": "First, the good: The X series more or less represents the only entry in a modern open world space game with ship customization and empire building that's not a 4X strategy game.\r\n\r\nNow, the bad: The interface is abysmally bad. In just about everything. Just a few examples: You can employ two kinds of jobs: station workers, who are just a number attached to an individual station and are managed indirectly. And ship personnel: Captains, engineers and marines. A captain to pilot each ship, who's qualification determines almost everything and can make the same ship top-of-the-line or near worthless. Engineers to repair the ship, marines to board other ships.\r\n\r\nEven though you might have hundreds of stations with tens of thousands of workers, you have no pool for ship personnel. If you want to switch crew around or train some up in reserve, you need to actually build ships, big ships, just to dock them somewhere and use them as container to hold people. While you can at least push service crew and marines around with a slider, captains can only be transferred individually. So, you build a single carrier with a full complement of fighters and corvettes - that comes up to 93 ships for a Shark. Now, you will, for each and every one of them:\r\n- Right-click the captain.\r\n- Select \"Work somewhere else\" from the context menu.\r\n- Load into the map screen and search for the HQ or holding ship to assign the useless default pilot to. \r\n- Right click the target.\r\n- Open the drop-down and select a new, non-captain position in the pool\r\n- Click OK.\r\n- Load back into where ever you started the process. \r\n- Switch to whatever dead ship you hold your trained pilot pool in.\r\n- Right-click a qualified pilot.\r\n- Select \"Work somewhere else\" from the drop down menu (not context menu, you need to open a separate drop down).\r\n- Load into the map screen.\r\n- Look for the vessel you just removed the incompetent captain from.\r\n- Right-click the target vessel.\r\n- Choose \"Captain\" as occupation from the drop down (not context menu, you need to open a separate drop down).\r\n- Click OK.\r\n- Load back into whatever screen you came from.\r\n\r\nThis whole process you need to do 92 times for a single carrier. Keep in mind, the interface is in no way an isolated process from the rest of the game, so if you are in the mid or late game, every click might need to be tried two or three times before registering, every screen loading in will take a few seconds. You can somewhat minimize this by pausing the game before you do this, but this will mean you will spend hours and hours with a paused, frozen game just ordering pilots around.\r\n\r\nStation building is not much better. The optimal strategy is by far building large, complex stations containing a whole production chain from mined resources to the end product.  Considering the game gives you 20km³ plots to work with, this is obviously a normal thing to do. But if there's a few stations already in the sector, you need to disable the environment, because else your whole station has a a tendency to become invisible.\r\n\r\nThen you try to add a part to an already big complex - but they all spawn in oriented the same way and you can only attach them to snap points with the right orientation.\r\n\r\nSo you drop it somewhere. Without attaching it to a snap point, it's anyone's guess how far away it will be positioned. Usually very far or outside the plot.\r\n\r\nThen you turn the piece - and it randomly snaps to other parts not even on screen, kilometers away, all over the build. But with the piece out of screen, you cannot move the mouse along the ring to turn it anymore. So zoom out (the only camera control you have while turning) in the hope of finding it. But when you're zoomed out until the ring is just a dot, precision turning becomes impossible.\r\n\r\nYou turn a piece in the horizontal plane, and suddenly it flips 180° on its head and is top down.\r\n\r\nIf you manage to get the piece turned how you like, you need to drag it to where it snaps. Sadly, it often does not snap to where your mouse pointer is, but somewhere completely else on screen. This is regularly so far away from the pointer that it is impossible to move the mouse far enough to snap where you want, because even a big screen has outer bounds. It also does not stay in about the distance from the screen it started, but snaps to stuff all the way through the build at the other end of the station kilometers away.\r\n\r\nBut fear not! On a selected piece you do not just have the three circles in the three planes to rotate them, you also have three arrows along the three axis to move them just along one axis. Except that only works as long as it does not snap, because it will still snap to things kilometers away on an axis you are not moving along.\r\n\r\nThere is no way to select a piece and select a snap point and just have it moved to snap there.\r\n\r\nOh, and after a while int the editor, you will loose the ability to move your point of view, the controls just stop doing anything. The only way to move your pov then is to center a piece with a double click. You can still zoom in and out or rotate, but not move it along any axis or drag the screen along.\r\n\r\nOh, and best hope you remembered to choose the loadout of the first module of this type and did all the later ones by copying that one. Because you cannot define a default loadout for all modules, or all modules of this type. No, you can choose between none, low, medium, high - all useless - or \"custom\", but custom means you have to edit every single module by hand in a station that can easily have a few hundred modules. And heaven help if you ever get a new blueprint or change your mind and want to change the loadout, because then you will every single module by hand again. Mid game that might still be a couple thousand modules to go through.\r\n\r\nOnce the station is built, it will be able to host drones. There is no way to save a default drone contingent for a station layout, or a default for a module type so that each station could derive a default configuration from that. No, every time you build a station you have to return once all modules are build and set the three types of drone by hand. Every time.\r\n\r\nAnd just about everythign is like that. The whole interface is a torture device.\r\n\r\nX4 is an ok game (not great, just ok) while you get to play, but for every hour of geniune play, you get five pushing employees around or fighting with the station building interface. And instead of fixing this, we get DLC after DLC of new content that's just as terrible to control and sometimes simply terrible.",

Occasionally there's super cool moments and at times I get the feeling there's a really cool game somewhere under the surface.\n\nThe AI is horrible, and the moment to moment playtime is typically more wrestling with the horrible interface than actually doing anything fun or productive. The specific thing that triggered me to write this review, was that I was hitching a ride in a trade-ship. Standing in the cockpit and perusing the map. I realise I can hear Kha'ak lasers and that I've been in sanctuary of darkness for awhile. My trade-ship is fighting a little Kha-ak swarm who aren't strong enough to break my shield, and my ship is changing targets as the Kha'ak lose their shield and then skirmish out of range. An infinite stalemate. I try changing their behaviour to flee and they start boosting off into the danger area that kills you just by being in it.\n\nI don't have a command that just says ignore fighting and get on with navigating to the trade. My only AI options were fight forever, or flee into death. I had to take command and get into the highway and then cancel the trade and restart it. Now it occurs to me that any trade going through Sanctuary of Darkness will have this same dogshit behaviour.\n\nI get it, I can upgrade my ships, I can avoid that route, but I should also be able to tell my crew to ignore attacks and get on with the job I gave them.\n\nI should also point out that you can't lock in a trade when you're flying the trade ship. You have to be at the station and buy the goods. Your AI captains can buy stuff in advance so you don't get sniped by another competing trade ship. You get punished for playing rather than delegating. Some design decisions are baffling and they've had years to sort this out. I like this game but I don't recommend it.",

      "review": "It's really disappointing.  It's an enormous game that hasn't decided... what it _is_.  Or how it's trying to invite you to have fun.\n\nIs it a flight sim?  Is it a shooter?  Is it an economic sim?  It doesn't know.\n\nShould you be commanding fleets?  Building stations?  Slugging fights out yourself?  Or running story errands?  Are you building a trade fleet or are you supposed to be stuck spending your time flying close to things to \"scan\" them before you can even make trades or get inventory reports?  The game hasn't decided -- or rather, it's decided that you as the player should be forced to do the most monotonous possible versions of all of these things.\n\nThe game is constantly posing you challenges that it then gives you no good way to handle.  Sectors get pirates: is there a patrol command that lets you assign defenders?  No.  Ships take damage and don't auto-repair; is there a way to configure fleet wide repair and retreat orders?  No.  Ships need crew to \"level up\" to be able to do many orders; is there any way to automate that?  No.  Transport ships doing critical tasks *will* get destroyed, perioidically; can you auto-replace them and have that replacement remember the orders?  Well, yes, actually, they did add that... about four (edit: six, actually) years after launch; and it's still considered to be buggy and unreliable, for reasons that are unclear.\n\nIt's hard to explain in words how utterly user-hostile the entire UI is.  Do you want to give that mining ship an order to mine, which is available in the right click menu?  *No*, actually, that's almost certainly not what you want -- you want to go into the ship's \"info\" page, scroll to the \"behaviour\" section -- oh, no, wait, scroll down to the \"default behaviours\" section!  That's different than just behaviors! -- and then set a default behavior for automining.  Oh, and you'd better hope your pilot has enough skill for that: if it's a new ship, and the pilot doesn't?  I dunno, sit on your thumbs and GFY, I guess; there's no easy immediate remedy for this (except install a mod to remove this goofy roadblock).  Now, what, why?  What's the difference?  The former thing causes the ship to do just one mining action, and then *peace out* -- a completely useless thing that I literally never want to command a ship to do.  The latter thing, with default behaviors, actually causes the ship to keep working over time.  **The whole game is like this**: the thing that you *definitely* want to do is *extremely hidden*, while much stupider things that you *functionally never* want to do are front, center, and very easy to click on.  It's bonkers.\n\nAll of the core behaviors for ships are buggy as hell.  True in the 1.0 release; still true in the 5.0 release, the 6.0 release, the 7.0 release, the 7.5 release, the... you get the idea.\n\nDo combat fleets work?  Well, sorta.  Just make sure you don't set the turrets on your capital ships to \"attack all enemies\" mode.  *Obviously* you don't want to do that.  That would make all of your capital ships always move to their turret ranges instead of using main guns, which will cause them to regularly get melted by the defensive turrets on any station they attack.  No, the game doesn't tell you this, why?  Oh, and the attack range is based on that pilot skill rating.  No, the game doesn't tell you this, why?  Oh, and the formations system doesn't work.  No, the game doesn't tell you this, why?  Oh, and the subordinates system has commands \"attack\" and \"intercept\" and \"bombard\", are those different?  _I have 788 hours of playtime and I have to tell you frankly, I have no idea._  So, does fleet combat work?  Well, it makes pretty videos!  But does it make sense?  Well.  You be the judge.  And don't even get me started on how \"OOS\" (out-of-sector) combat is completely different than _when you actually watch_ (no the game doesn't tell you this, why?).\n\nYou might think I'm joking about this combat stuff, but consider that a reddit thread called \"Cannot believe we're still dealing with this in 2025\" was just posted a few days ago, and it's all about capital ships wandering into knife-fight range and getting melted: https://www.reddit.com/r/X4Foundations/comments/1nf8r2r/cannot_believe_were_still_dealing_with_this_in/  It's not a fluke, it's not just me, it's been broken for years, the entire player base knows it, and it just doesn't get addressed, at all.\n\nAll of the NPC AIs and factions are just random number machines.  They're barely playing by any rules.  They fill up the universe, but they don't feel alive in any way.  They'll never build beyond hardcoded limits.\n\nAnd it's _slow_.  It's _dog_ slow.  I've never seen a game this slow.  There's something like between 1000 and 10000 objects simulated.  They're not even complex simulations: anything outside of the sector you're currently in isn't even using pathfinding that involves collisions.  Any reasonable implementation of this should be snappy.  X4... is not snappy.  It takes closer to 10 minutes to load than one.  The game itself lags constantly, and it's not even from graphics: it's from the simulation logic.  Why?  I _have no idea_.  But if you poke into any of the mods, you'll find people constantly bending over backwards to try to touch core APIs once every _second_ at most because more is somehow killer.  This _wild_.  I honestly boggle to imagine how the engineering core is fucked up this badly.\n\nThe game is *almost* kept alive by its modding community, which releases mod after mod to remove time-wasting features that the core developers thought was a great idea to keep you in the game longer, but literally every player recognizes as waste-of-time nonsense.\n\n...except over time, that's kinda dying out too.  Mods keep breaking from core changes.  Modders themselves get sick of fixing core bugs.\n\nAnd as a player, I'm now burnt out of trying to keep on the treadmill of turning this fundamentally mis-designed game into a real playable game by shepherding hordes of mods that are mostly abandoned because they're from other people who are as burnt out as me.\n\nI had a real soft spot in my heart for the whole X series for a really long time.  But my gosh, Egosoft.  You need to figure out what the difference is between a \"game\" and a \"toy\" and a \"puzzle\".  Because you're selling this like it's a game... but it's really more like a puzzle, in which the player tries to figure out how to build it _into_ a game that's actually playable.  And even if one succeeds in puzzling together the broken pieces, all they recieve is a \"toy\", because there's no real challenge or counterparty, even in the form of NPCs, because those are all empty husks too.\n\nIt's sad.\n\nThe environment is beautiful.  The lore _could be_ deep.\n\nAnd everything we have to try to play with here is just a wreck.\n\n---\n\nEDIT: I *keep* *trying* to play this game.  I keep hoping.  I saw in the changelog recently again that Egosoft claims they fixed an issue where ships do insane things trying to target unreachable objects... which I assume means trying to fix the destroyer suicide issues (again).  No, guys.  You didn't.  You still didn't.  I just had two out of three destroyers in a fleet -- so, everyone except the fleet leader -- charge directly into a Xenon station and commit rapid suicide again.  Fleets continue to be literally unusable.  Battles continue to be a joke.  I don't know what you're doing when you try to fix this stuff and when you try to test your fixes, but whatever it is, it isn't remotely working.  You need to figure out how to test these things, because you obviously don't.  And you seriously shouldn't post claims you've fixed this anymore unless you've actually tried the thing.

The UI is absolutely atrocious, station building, and station management are incredibly unintuitive, as is the process to obtain the blueprints and modules for the stations, on top of being grindy. \r\n\r\nThese issues by themselves are nuisance, but as you can see by my 315 hours played of this game- it didn't stop me.

      "review": "This is a tough one for me... Grudgingly I am putting this as a \"No\" recommendation. I did at least get 50+ hours of gameplay out of X4. Unfortunately after 57-ish hours, the game just didn't live up to my expectations. It is designed as grand space \"kingdom simulator\" type game where you can go from flying a single person fighter all the way up to managing fleets of ships, building space stations, etc. Conceptually it sounds awesome. However, the process to get that point ultimately became more draining than fun. At this point I'm going to take a break from the game, and come back to hopefully down the line to give it another shot.\n\nFor me, the game is just so clunky and not intuitive. I had to stop playing constantly to look things up online because they were not well explained in-game. I've lost track of how many dozens of hours I've spent watching Youtube videos that, once again, explain something that didn't make sense in-game. I knew the learning curve was going to be steep, but ugh... For example, building a station requires you to hire NPC ships to help with each step. How do you find those NPC ships? You just have to hang out near stations and hope to get lucky. Or you spend hours putting satellites near all the major system hubs, and then hope you get lucky and find the right ships flying by. After hours of searching I finally got a builder to hire, but for some unknown reason none of the trading ships I find have the option for me to hire them for the station. I have a feeling I'm going to have to redo tutorials or spend more time finding the reasons why, and honestly I just can't get myself to do it anymore. \n\nI had the same experience with automating mining ships. Veteran players make it sound so easy, and in practice it really should be.  Buy a mining ship, outfit it, and then drop it in a system where it can deliver ore (or whatever it is mining) to an NPC station nearby.  Seems simple right? Except, what they don't tell you is that you can only set a mining ship to \"Automine\"  like that if it has a Pilot with 3 stars or higher. Those cost somewhere between 600k and 1M credits, which is way outside my price range at this point in the game. Every spare credit I get is immediately sunk into buying things for missions or upgrading my combat ships. I don't have that much to spare on every pilot for every mining ship. Thus I have to manually assign mining ships to do each step. It gets WORSE though... I constantly have to search for new places to send my mining ships, because the asteroid fields are a finite resource, and you can easily \"mine out\" an area with a single starter mining ship.  Then even when I find a new asteroid area to mine, I have to also find a new station to sell it to, because of course the previous station no longer wants to buy ore. Why are these ore refineries always \"full\"? At most I'm making 50k credits an hour with my two passive mining ships, and that's only when everything works. It's just yet another hassle that is needlessly grindy.\n\nMissions too are a grind. So many times I get a mission to find X, Y, or Z item.  Sometimes they are crafted items, and I have to spend hours farming enemy ships or going station to station to station trying to find a trader that sells what I need. It's a grind, and it's not fun by any stretch of the imagination. There have even been times where I ended up spending MORE to get the items than the reward I got for completing it.\n\nCombat has been the most fun for me in the game, but again -  there are caveats to that. Until I did the questline to get a Hyperion, I was flying around in fighters and corvettes. Unfortunately those size ships get absolutely demolished by almost every enemy raiding party that comes through. The really easy combat missions were fine, but almost everything else required a lot of min/maxing of small ships. Either that, or hit-and-run tactics to kill one ship and run away before I get insta-killed by the other enemies. It did get a lot better once I had the Hyperion, but that was a lot of gameplay hours of struggling to get that far.\n\nI'm hoping that I can eventually revisit the game someday and give it another shot. Maybe the learning curve grind was just too much to start out with... I don't know. We shall see.",

It worked before patch 8.0, small ships were dive-bombing just fine, why touch something that worked?), fail to trade, fail to mine, sometimes buy like 100x goods, when there's available 10000 and your stating needs 20K and has money, keep mining under fire, keep fighting being miner against military fleet and do all other dumb shit, station managers will auto-allocate storage space to absurd amounts, like request millions of metric tons of some good, while entire production line barely can process few thousands... \n\nYou can lose entire fleet capable of cleaning system from enemy presence on their single capital ship because they simply go to the enemy turret and die. Or you can take one of your interceptors and solo enemy capship by destroying their surface equipment and then use fleet to kill the defenseless hull. Or you can solo it with own capship, literally any capship of dozens you could lose by simply command AI to attack on their own. So it's not a balance issue, it's just idiotic AI. Yet, player simply can't be everywhere and fight every battle manually, why do we even need crew hired then and talented admiral picked from your ranks? \n\nAnd then you learn, that some enemies are immortal (you can't defeat their faction, because they have no economy) and they will attack player the more frequently the more ships player faction has and so cripple players economy, same with pirates, they will periodically attack exclusively player stealing goods or killing economy ships, and pirate factions also immortal and spawn ships from nowhere. Not even to mention hidden cooldowns for money sources, hidden debuffs working only on player economy and so on... Game already super-slow pacing, and you can play years in one playthrough, what's the point in haulting progression - I don't know, but this policy is extremely consistent across the entire game, you will be haulted and bottle necked in many places. Player have to play years and grind their path to do endgame.\n\nEndgame... there's none, you realize this once you become too powerful. There's no much to do once you complete scenarios and DLC missions, that are mostly early to midgame. You can get angry robots crisis which effectively is just map-scale wave-defense against enemy fleets with stop-event inside. Nothing more, you will kill such waves thousand times starting from midgame. So, what the point of grind to endgame if there's none? It always more interesting to start anew, except this boring and slow grind to get at least some property in the game. \n\nAnd then we return back to shit AI that will turn player effort to ruin in every turn, forcing us into endless micro-management of every ship we got in the game. And without player property, corporation, stations and fleets it's just another spacesim and very bad at this, because basic mechanics made for large fleet actions.\n\nI really hope devs at least read player's feedback in different platforms and will fix AI at some point, because in current state it just grind to sacrifice hours of progression into single defense of your own system. \n\nI want to give a good review, but this game is simply unplayable in 8.0 version, AI always was a mess in X series, but not this bad...",

This is coming from someone who has 100s of hours in flight simulators. \n\nI have tried twice to get into it, but the barrier to entry is too high. I'm willing to put in the time to learn new concepts, game features etc, but learning how to fly a spaceship all over again like they did in the 90s is just too frustrating to get past.",

Half of that time, I was trying to understand the game mechanics, many of which still remain unclear to me. The game has many bugs and glitches, and the FPS often drops. A new player will need to spend dozens of hours just to get a grasp of how the game works.\r\n\r\nThere are many amusing moments: the game claims to be an economic simulator, but it requires hours of micromanagement of units for this system to work properly (without the right skill level, your units are unable to do many tasks). I also found an exploit that allows capturing ships without losing reputation. Otherwise, if you want to earn something meaningful in this game, be prepared to spend hundreds of hours. All the races and ships are monotonous and look very similar to each other. The game is unfinished and not worth its price.\r\n\r\nMy overall experience has been negative, and if I had known what I’d encounter, I definitely wouldn’t have bought this game.",

In general it's not a 3-d map, but a 2-d map where you can fly around, similar to Master of Orion. Graphics are very beautiful, but planets are only decoration and have no function.\r\n\r\nPoor tutorial means \"google 1 week for 1 day playing\". Tutorials tell only how to fly, but you have no clue what you can do with the game. Can do so much with the game ? No one tells. Google it. How to automine ? No one tells...\r\n\r\nCatastrophic UI consists of a flood of text, buy a good book instead. Even the simplest orders are hidden in a flood of text and hidden behind 3 corners. Ship inventory is hidden somewhere, buried under a flood of text and additionally hidden behind a second table of text. Why aren't there separate tables for ships and staff with basic information and adjustment menus ? Every soccer manager can show how simple this would be. The whole UI is messed together into a pot and mixed to a soup of chaos.\r\n\r\nAt last, the gameplay. To do something serious you need millions, but start with a few thousand. Accepting tasks brings somewhat 50000-100000, to buy a miner you have to fulfill 50-100 tasks. These tasks depend on items that you can't afford or aren't available. Loot scrap ? There you get items that nobody buys. Pirate a ship and you trigger a war. So last chance I sold my DLC spaceship to get a miner and watched TV while waiting until the miner was full. But no one buys the harvested gas and again you are at a dead end road, have a stuck miner and have lost your DLC spaceship.\r\n\r\nThat's it folks: No money, no game.

      "review": "The game is lovely and a fairly good reboot of the franchise while also making sense in lore. However, the scale is far smaller than any of the X3 games in ship size, battle sizes, and economy. It is very easy to build yourself a fire and forget station that prints money, and once you can secure enough space and resources, and can make your own parts and ships, it becomes even easier to just roll over the game, either as an economic mogul, or as a conqueror. However, those are not really negatives, especially with mods that can make the scaling more difficult, or certain factions stronger if you're pursuing specific roleplaying. In fact, up to and including the Kingdom End expansion, this would have been a positive with a few buts sprinkled in.\n\nSince the Timelines expansion, however, Egosoft has insisted on using AI voice over for new content despite consistent pushback against this. There is no excuse, not the size of the studio, not the way in which they may be trying to still pay the people whose voice is used, nothing, that excuses this. Leave the people silent, or hell, ask the community to contribute (the X fanbase may be small but it is very dedicated) if professional VAs are too expensive. Options exist, but AI is not one of them. Also, the latest two dlcs and the upcoming one at the time of writing (Envoy pack) amount to little more than ship packs with more or less rigmarole involved (generally less though Timelines has some absolutely draconian missions), and barely add anything worthwhile to the open universe. Not everything needs to be on the scale of Kingdom End or Split Vendetta, sure, but something of substance is a minimum. What amounts to basically overpowered ships for money in a single player game is starting to seem suspect.\n\nThe company is taking a direction I am extremely unhappy with and hope that there will be a major change from this direction. Until then, play the X3 series - there's more complexity, larger scale, more interesting storylines, sometimes questionable (but undeniably human) voice acting and all the reasons I and the whole community truly fell in love with the universe and Egosoft a long time ago",

I really want to love this game, and feel strange leaving a negative review after so much time played, but hopefully it saves others a similar realization after already getting invested.\r\n\r\nThe cracks first started to show when I began to command a fleet rather than playing as a single ship. Want to issue a command to your squad of interceptors to prevent them from chasing an enemy ship too deep into enemy territory? That move command will be queued to the end of each ship's action list, meaning you have to manually clear the default intercept action if you want it to be followed. That behavior single-handedly prevents any RTS-style micromanagement, despite X4 being branded as playable like an RTS.\r\n\r\nThe real nail in the coffin for me though was realizing just how bad the enemy and player fleet AI actually is. Xenon destroyers are seemingly unstoppable killing machines when you first face them, even mowing through fleets of 20-40 ships with ease, but it's ok, because all you need to do is just hang back and wait. Eventually they'll fly head first into a base's guns, suiciding without a single shot fired. The same can be said for other factions - they're all just haphazardly throwing ships at each other in a piecemeal fashion. Occasionally a scripted event gives a brief illusion of something more tangible forming, but it quickly devolves back into the same nonsensical behavior, with cohesive fleets fanning out and suiciding into various structures, destroyers, etc rather than keeping formation and attacking viable targets at their optimal range.\r\n\r\nThe simulation itself really is such an impressive feat that you've got such a large world that can be played locally at such significant scale. It's just too bad that it quickly turns out to be all window dressing with very little depth due to the complete lack of functional AI. In my book, that single-handedly takes x4 from being a game, down to just being an impressive simulation.",

Ships suiciding into larger ships for no reason, ships flying solo into a swarm of enemies and dying for no reason, some ships set to defend just sitting still in space getting blasted without reacting, some ships set to intercept choosing targets furthest from their carrier when there are targets right next to it, and you guessed it, get cut off and die. Capital ships ignoring enemy laser turrets that are killing every repair drone they launch even though there are no other enemy targets in the area. Capital ships that have long range main guns but suicide boost towards enemy capitals to knife fight them... the list goes on.\r\n\r\nEven simple move commands given to ships...

      "review": "First, the good: The X series more or less represents the only entry in a modern open world space game with ship customization and empire building that's not a 4X strategy game.\r\n\r\nNow, the bad: The interface is abysmally bad. In just about everything. Just a few examples: You can employ two kinds of jobs: station workers, who are just a number attached to an individual station and are managed indirectly. And ship personnel: Captains, engineers and marines. A captain to pilot each ship, who's qualification determines almost everything and can make the same ship top-of-the-line or near worthless. Engineers to repair the ship, marines to board other ships.\r\n\r\nEven though you might have hundreds of stations with tens of thousands of workers, you have no pool for ship personnel. If you want to switch crew around or train some up in reserve, you need to actually build ships, big ships, just to dock them somewhere and use them as container to hold people. While you can at least push service crew and marines around with a slider, captains can only be transferred individually. So, you build a single carrier with a full complement of fighters and corvettes - that comes up to 93 ships for a Shark. Now, you will, for each and every one of them:\r\n- Right-click the captain.\r\n- Select \"Work somewhere else\" from the context menu.\r\n- Load into the map screen and search for the HQ or holding ship to assign the useless default pilot to. \r\n- Right click the target.\r\n- Open the drop-down and select a new, non-captain position in the pool\r\n- Click OK.\r\n- Load back into where ever you started the process. \r\n- Switch to whatever dead ship you hold your trained pilot pool in.\r\n- Right-click a qualified pilot.\r\n- Select \"Work somewhere else\" from the drop down menu (not context menu, you need to open a separate drop down).\r\n- Load into the map screen.\r\n- Look for the vessel you just removed the incompetent captain from.\r\n- Right-click the target vessel.\r\n- Choose \"Captain\" as occupation from the drop down (not context menu, you need to open a separate drop down).\r\n- Click OK.\r\n- Load back into whatever screen you came from.\r\n\r\nThis whole process you need to do 92 times for a single carrier. Keep in mind, the interface is in no way an isolated process from the rest of the game, so if you are in the mid or late game, every click might need to be tried two or three times before registering, every screen loading in will take a few seconds. You can somewhat minimize this by pausing the game before you do this, but this will mean you will spend hours and hours with a paused, frozen game just ordering pilots around.\r\n\r\nStation building is not much better. The optimal strategy is by far building large, complex stations containing a whole production chain from mined resources to the end product.  Considering the game gives you 20km³ plots to work with, this is obviously a normal thing to do. But if there's a few stations already in the sector, you need to disable the environment, because else your whole station has a a tendency to become invisible.\r\n\r\nThen you try to add a part to an already big complex - but they all spawn in oriented the same way and you can only attach them to snap points with the right orientation.\r\n\r\nSo you drop it somewhere. Without attaching it to a snap point, it's anyone's guess how far away it will be positioned. Usually very far or outside the plot.\r\n\r\nThen you turn the piece - and it randomly snaps to other parts not even on screen, kilometers away, all over the build. But with the piece out of screen, you cannot move the mouse along the ring to turn it anymore. So zoom out (the only camera control you have while turning) in the hope of finding it. But when you're zoomed out until the ring is just a dot, precision turning becomes impossible.\r\n\r\nYou turn a piece in the horizontal plane, and suddenly it flips 180° on its head and is top down.\r\n\r\nIf you manage to get the piece turned how you like, you need to drag it to where it snaps. Sadly, it often does not snap to where your mouse pointer is, but somewhere completely else on screen. This is regularly so far away from the pointer that it is impossible to move the mouse far enough to snap where you want, because even a big screen has outer bounds. It also does not stay in about the distance from the screen it started, but snaps to stuff all the way through the build at the other end of the station kilometers away.\r\n\r\nBut fear not! On a selected piece you do not just have the three circles in the three planes to rotate them, you also have three arrows along the three axis to move them just along one axis. Except that only works as long as it does not snap, because it will still snap to things kilometers away on an axis you are not moving along.\r\n\r\nThere is no way to select a piece and select a snap point and just have it moved to snap there.\r\n\r\nOh, and after a while int the editor, you will loose the ability to move your point of view, the controls just stop doing anything. The only way to move your pov then is to center a piece with a double click. You can still zoom in and out or rotate, but not move it along any axis or drag the screen along.\r\n\r\nOh, and best hope you remembered to choose the loadout of the first module of this type and did all the later ones by copying that one. Because you cannot define a default loadout for all modules, or all modules of this type. No, you can choose between none, low, medium, high - all useless - or \"custom\", but custom means you have to edit every single module by hand in a station that can easily have a few hundred modules. And heaven help if you ever get a new blueprint or change your mind and want to change the loadout, because then you will every single module by hand again. Mid game that might still be a couple thousand modules to go through.\r\n\r\nOnce the station is built, it will be able to host drones. There is no way to save a default drone contingent for a station layout, or a default for a module type so that each station could derive a default configuration from that. No, every time you build a station you have to return once all modules are build and set the three types of drone by hand. Every time.\r\n\r\nAnd just about everythign is like that. The whole interface is a torture device.\r\n\r\nX4 is an ok game (not great, just ok) while you get to play, but for every hour of geniune play, you get five pushing employees around or fighting with the station building interface. And instead of fixing this, we get DLC after DLC of new content that's just as terrible to control and sometimes simply terrible.",

My trade-ship is fighting a little Kha-ak swarm who aren't strong enough to break my shield, and my ship is changing targets as the Kha'ak lose their shield and then skirmish out of range. An infinite stalemate. I try changing their behaviour to flee and they start boosting off into the danger area that kills you just by being in it.\n\nI don't have a command that just says ignore fighting and get on with navigating to the trade. My only AI options were fight forever, or flee into death. I had to take command and get into the highway and then cancel the trade and restart it. Now it occurs to me that any trade going through Sanctuary of Darkness will have this same dogshit behaviour.\n\nI get it, I can upgrade my ships, I can avoid that route, but I should also be able to tell my crew to ignore attacks and get on with the job I gave them.\n\nI should also point out that you can't lock in a trade when you're flying the trade ship. You have to be at the station and buy the goods. Your AI captains can buy stuff in advance so you don't get sniped by another competing trade ship. You get punished for playing rather than delegating. Some design decisions are baffling and they've had years to sort this out. I like this game but I don't recommend it.",

The galaxy map layout seems to force you spend a lot of time on autopilot transiting through and between systems; ships sent on trade, scavenge, or exploration missions require a lot of management to ensure they aren't sitting idle, circling in systems not doing anything useful, or getting shot down; flying your own ship is fun, pretty, but eventually tedious, and managing a fleet becomes basically a full-time management job. Autopilot seemed to kick in a lot by itself when i was trying to do other things, which caused a lot of frustration.

      "review": "It's really disappointing.  It's an enormous game that hasn't decided... what it _is_.  Or how it's trying to invite you to have fun.\n\nIs it a flight sim?  Is it a shooter?  Is it an economic sim?  It doesn't know.\n\nShould you be commanding fleets?  Building stations?  Slugging fights out yourself?  Or running story errands?  Are you building a trade fleet or are you supposed to be stuck spending your time flying close to things to \"scan\" them before you can even make trades or get inventory reports?  The game hasn't decided -- or rather, it's decided that you as the player should be forced to do the most monotonous possible versions of all of these things.\n\nThe game is constantly posing you challenges that it then gives you no good way to handle.  Sectors get pirates: is there a patrol command that lets you assign defenders?  No.  Ships take damage and don't auto-repair; is there a way to configure fleet wide repair and retreat orders?  No.  Ships need crew to \"level up\" to be able to do many orders; is there any way to automate that?  No.  Transport ships doing critical tasks *will* get destroyed, perioidically; can you auto-replace them and have that replacement remember the orders?  Well, yes, actually, they did add that... about four (edit: six, actually) years after launch; and it's still considered to be buggy and unreliable, for reasons that are unclear.\n\nIt's hard to explain in words how utterly user-hostile the entire UI is.  Do you want to give that mining ship an order to mine, which is available in the right click menu?  *No*, actually, that's almost certainly not what you want -- you want to go into the ship's \"info\" page, scroll to the \"behaviour\" section -- oh, no, wait, scroll down to the \"default behaviours\" section!  That's different than just behaviors! -- and then set a default behavior for automining.  Oh, and you'd better hope your pilot has enough skill for that: if it's a new ship, and the pilot doesn't?  I dunno, sit on your thumbs and GFY, I guess; there's no easy immediate remedy for this (except install a mod to remove this goofy roadblock).  Now, what, why?  What's the difference?  The former thing causes the ship to do just one mining action, and then *peace out* -- a completely useless thing that I literally never want to command a ship to do.  The latter thing, with default behaviors, actually causes the ship to keep working over time.  **The whole game is like this**: the thing that you *definitely* want to do is *extremely hidden*, while much stupider things that you *functionally never* want to do are front, center, and very easy to click on.  It's bonkers.\n\nAll of the core behaviors for ships are buggy as hell.  True in the 1.0 release; still true in the 5.0 release, the 6.0 release, the 7.0 release, the 7.5 release, the... you get the idea.\n\nDo combat fleets work?  Well, sorta.  Just make sure you don't set the turrets on your capital ships to \"attack all enemies\" mode.  *Obviously* you don't want to do that.  That would make all of your capital ships always move to their turret ranges instead of using main guns, which will cause them to regularly get melted by the defensive turrets on any station they attack.  No, the game doesn't tell you this, why?  Oh, and the attack range is based on that pilot skill rating.  No, the game doesn't tell you this, why?  Oh, and the formations system doesn't work.  No, the game doesn't tell you this, why?  Oh, and the subordinates system has commands \"attack\" and \"intercept\" and \"bombard\", are those different?  _I have 788 hours of playtime and I have to tell you frankly, I have no idea._  So, does fleet combat work?  Well, it makes pretty videos!  But does it make sense?  Well.  You be the judge.  And don't even get me started on how \"OOS\" (out-of-sector) combat is completely different than _when you actually watch_ (no the game doesn't tell you this, why?).\n\nYou might think I'm joking about this combat stuff, but consider that a reddit thread called \"Cannot believe we're still dealing with this in 2025\" was just posted a few days ago, and it's all about capital ships wandering into knife-fight range and getting melted: https://www.reddit.com/r/X4Foundations/comments/1nf8r2r/cannot_believe_were_still_dealing_with_this_in/  It's not a fluke, it's not just me, it's been broken for years, the entire player base knows it, and it just doesn't get addressed, at all.\n\nAll of the NPC AIs and factions are just random number machines.  They're barely playing by any rules.  They fill up the universe, but they don't feel alive in any way.  They'll never build beyond hardcoded limits.\n\nAnd it's _slow_.  It's _dog_ slow.  I've never seen a game this slow.  There's something like between 1000 and 10000 objects simulated.  They're not even complex simulations: anything outside of the sector you're currently in isn't even using pathfinding that involves collisions.  Any reasonable implementation of this should be snappy.  X4... is not snappy.  It takes closer to 10 minutes to load than one.  The game itself lags constantly, and it's not even from graphics: it's from the simulation logic.  Why?  I _have no idea_.  But if you poke into any of the mods, you'll find people constantly bending over backwards to try to touch core APIs once every _second_ at most because more is somehow killer.  This _wild_.  I honestly boggle to imagine how the engineering core is fucked up this badly.\n\nThe game is *almost* kept alive by its modding community, which releases mod after mod to remove time-wasting features that the core developers thought was a great idea to keep you in the game longer, but literally every player recognizes as waste-of-time nonsense.\n\n...except over time, that's kinda dying out too.  Mods keep breaking from core changes.  Modders themselves get sick of fixing core bugs.\n\nAnd as a player, I'm now burnt out of trying to keep on the treadmill of turning this fundamentally mis-designed game into a real playable game by shepherding hordes of mods that are mostly abandoned because they're from other people who are as burnt out as me.\n\nI had a real soft spot in my heart for the whole X series for a really long time.  But my gosh, Egosoft.  You need to figure out what the difference is between a \"game\" and a \"toy\" and a \"puzzle\".  Because you're selling this like it's a game... but it's really more like a puzzle, in which the player tries to figure out how to build it _into_ a game that's actually playable.  And even if one succeeds in puzzling together the broken pieces, all they recieve is a \"toy\", because there's no real challenge or counterparty, even in the form of NPCs, because those are all empty husks too.\n\nIt's sad.\n\nThe environment is beautiful.  The lore _could be_ deep.\n\nAnd everything we have to try to play with here is just a wreck.\n\n---\n\nEDIT: I *keep* *trying* to play this game.  I keep hoping.  I saw in the changelog recently again that Egosoft claims they fixed an issue where ships do insane things trying to target unreachable objects... which I assume means trying to fix the destroyer suicide issues (again).  No, guys.  You didn't.  You still didn't.  I just had two out of three destroyers in a fleet -- so, everyone except the fleet leader -- charge directly into a Xenon station and commit rapid suicide again.  Fleets continue to be literally unusable.  Battles continue to be a joke.  I don't know what you're doing when you try to fix this stuff and when you try to test your fixes, but whatever it is, it isn't remotely working.  You need to figure out how to test these things, because you obviously don't.  And you seriously shouldn't post claims you've fixed this anymore unless you've actually tried the thing.

It is a fully simulated universe, with a storied history, a variety of ships to fly(99% of the ships in the game can be flown by the player), and some great music. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, that is where the positives end. The UI is absolutely atrocious, station building, and station management are incredibly unintuitive, as is the process to obtain the blueprints and modules for the stations, on top of being grindy. \r\n\r\nThese issues by themselves are nuisance, but as you can see by my 315 hours played of this game- it didn't stop me. What has stopped me from continuing is the completely idiotic fleet AI, that makes even the most simple of fleet commands, a daunting task. Destroyers will fail to use there main guns, and instead ram head first into Xenon defense stations. Fighters ordered to protect a commander, have done absolutely nothing in a few circumstances.  \r\n\r\nThere are numerous other reviews, that go into depth on this issue.

      "review": "This is a tough one for me... Grudgingly I am putting this as a \"No\" recommendation. I did at least get 50+ hours of gameplay out of X4. Unfortunately after 57-ish hours, the game just didn't live up to my expectations. It is designed as grand space \"kingdom simulator\" type game where you can go from flying a single person fighter all the way up to managing fleets of ships, building space stations, etc. Conceptually it sounds awesome. However, the process to get that point ultimately became more draining than fun. At this point I'm going to take a break from the game, and come back to hopefully down the line to give it another shot.\n\nFor me, the game is just so clunky and not intuitive. I had to stop playing constantly to look things up online because they were not well explained in-game. I've lost track of how many dozens of hours I've spent watching Youtube videos that, once again, explain something that didn't make sense in-game. I knew the learning curve was going to be steep, but ugh... For example, building a station requires you to hire NPC ships to help with each step. How do you find those NPC ships? You just have to hang out near stations and hope to get lucky. Or you spend hours putting satellites near all the major system hubs, and then hope you get lucky and find the right ships flying by. After hours of searching I finally got a builder to hire, but for some unknown reason none of the trading ships I find have the option for me to hire them for the station. I have a feeling I'm going to have to redo tutorials or spend more time finding the reasons why, and honestly I just can't get myself to do it anymore. \n\nI had the same experience with automating mining ships. Veteran players make it sound so easy, and in practice it really should be.  Buy a mining ship, outfit it, and then drop it in a system where it can deliver ore (or whatever it is mining) to an NPC station nearby.  Seems simple right? Except, what they don't tell you is that you can only set a mining ship to \"Automine\"  like that if it has a Pilot with 3 stars or higher. Those cost somewhere between 600k and 1M credits, which is way outside my price range at this point in the game. Every spare credit I get is immediately sunk into buying things for missions or upgrading my combat ships. I don't have that much to spare on every pilot for every mining ship. Thus I have to manually assign mining ships to do each step. It gets WORSE though... I constantly have to search for new places to send my mining ships, because the asteroid fields are a finite resource, and you can easily \"mine out\" an area with a single starter mining ship.  Then even when I find a new asteroid area to mine, I have to also find a new station to sell it to, because of course the previous station no longer wants to buy ore. Why are these ore refineries always \"full\"? At most I'm making 50k credits an hour with my two passive mining ships, and that's only when everything works. It's just yet another hassle that is needlessly grindy.\n\nMissions too are a grind. So many times I get a mission to find X, Y, or Z item.  Sometimes they are crafted items, and I have to spend hours farming enemy ships or going station to station to station trying to find a trader that sells what I need. It's a grind, and it's not fun by any stretch of the imagination. There have even been times where I ended up spending MORE to get the items than the reward I got for completing it.\n\nCombat has been the most fun for me in the game, but again -  there are caveats to that. Until I did the questline to get a Hyperion, I was flying around in fighters and corvettes. Unfortunately those size ships get absolutely demolished by almost every enemy raiding party that comes through. The really easy combat missions were fine, but almost everything else required a lot of min/maxing of small ships. Either that, or hit-and-run tactics to kill one ship and run away before I get insta-killed by the other enemies. It did get a lot better once I had the Hyperion, but that was a lot of gameplay hours of struggling to get that far.\n\nI'm hoping that I can eventually revisit the game someday and give it another shot. Maybe the learning curve grind was just too much to start out with... I don't know. We shall see.",

It worked before patch 8.0, small ships were dive-bombing just fine, why touch something that worked?), fail to trade, fail to mine, sometimes buy like 100x goods, when there's available 10000 and your stating needs 20K and has money, keep mining under fire, keep fighting being miner against military fleet and do all other dumb shit, station managers will auto-allocate storage space to absurd amounts, like request millions of metric tons of some good, while entire production line barely can process few thousands... \n\nYou can lose entire fleet capable of cleaning system from enemy presence on their single capital ship because they simply go to the enemy turret and die. Or you can take one of your interceptors and solo enemy capship by destroying their surface equipment and then use fleet to kill the defenseless hull. Or you can solo it with own capship, literally any capship of dozens you could lose by simply command AI to attack on their own. So it's not a balance issue, it's just idiotic AI. Yet, player simply can't be everywhere and fight every battle manually, why do we even need crew hired then and talented admiral picked from your ranks? \n\nAnd then you learn, that some enemies are immortal (you can't defeat their faction, because they have no economy) and they will attack player the more frequently the more ships player faction has and so cripple players economy, same with pirates, they will periodically attack exclusively player stealing goods or killing economy ships, and pirate factions also immortal and spawn ships from nowhere. Not even to mention hidden cooldowns for money sources, hidden debuffs working only on player economy and so on... Game already super-slow pacing, and you can play years in one playthrough, what's the point in haulting progression - I don't know, but this policy is extremely consistent across the entire game, you will be haulted and bottle necked in many places. Player have to play years and grind their path to do endgame.\n\nEndgame... there's none, you realize this once you become too powerful. There's no much to do once you complete scenarios and DLC missions, that are mostly early to midgame. You can get angry robots crisis which effectively is just map-scale wave-defense against enemy fleets with stop-event inside. Nothing more, you will kill such waves thousand times starting from midgame. So, what the point of grind to endgame if there's none? It always more interesting to start anew, except this boring and slow grind to get at least some property in the game. \n\nAnd then we return back to shit AI that will turn player effort to ruin in every turn, forcing us into endless micro-management of every ship we got in the game. And without player property, corporation, stations and fleets it's just another spacesim and very bad at this, because basic mechanics made for large fleet actions.\n\nI really hope devs at least read player's feedback in different platforms and will fix AI at some point, because in current state it just grind to sacrifice hours of progression into single defense of your own system. \n\nI want to give a good review, but this game is simply unplayable in 8.0 version, AI always was a mess in X series, but not this bad...",

И вот вы идёте в Журнал событий, находите название корабля, вбиваете его в поиск карты, находите, зумитесь, разбираетесь, и не факт что у вас получиться. \r\nКораблики ваши команды выполняют непойми как, самый простой способ что либо разрулить, это телепортнуться в кораблик и сделать всё самому, но бывает что непотребство творитсья сразу в двух местах и нет ни какой возможности разрулить и там и там.\r\nРучное управление это норм когда у вас 10-50 корабликов, события не так часто происходят, но на таком объёме флота играть не интересно, вся эпичность и масштабность пропадают.\r\nУ меня корабликов было 100, потом до 1000, рулить всем этим без автоматизации не возможно, можно забивать на какие то потери торговых судов, но их регулярно выбивали и торговля от этого страдает, денег конечно приходит столько что их не возможно потратить, но не камильфо, не порядок, когда тебя обижают и ты с этим ни чего толком сделать не можешь.\r\nДобило то что фракция Паранидов с которой у меня были отношения +30 начала произвольно выбивать мои кораблики, ладно бы я контробанду возил, но нет, у меня выбивали шахтеров !! К ним то какие притензии ?\r\nЕсли вы привыкли к нормальным играм, то поиграйте в эту что бы понять что такое не нормальная остойная отвратительная игра, чот бы понять на сколько хороши и восхитетитльны нормальные игры.\r\n\r\nПервый раз у меня было под 50 станций, таким хозяйством управлять не возможно, игра просто не даёт инструментов, второй подход я сделал одну, потом ещё две, плюс у меня была одна стартова, всего 4 станции, но даже столько это уже ад по администрированию этого хозяйства.\r\nИгра",

I want to play this game. \n\nBut I can't get past the controls and user interface. \n\nGetting to know this game feels like on-boarding at a new job that uses SAP or some 90's accounting technology, in an age where we are used to 30 years of advancements in responsive user interfaces and controls. It feels like I'm fighting this system to get what I want. The upside of on-boarding at a new job, and getting through the gruelling task of learning an outdated user interface; I get paid. I don't see the payoff to spending what is probably like a 10 hour learning curve to JUST LEARN THE BASICS; e.g. fly a spaceship and move around the environment and shoot, let alone advanced concepts. I loathe the prospect of learning how to manage a fleet down the road in what is basically a clumsy Excel sheet for a controller. This is coming from someone who has 100s of hours in flight simulators. \n\nI have tried twice to get into it, but the barrier to entry is too high. I'm willing to put in the time to learn new concepts, game features etc, but learning how to fly a spaceship all over again like they did in the 90s is just too frustrating to get past.",

      "review": "I bought this game because of positive reviews on YouTube and a good rating on Steam. I have played it for almost 60 hours. Half of that time, I was trying to understand the game mechanics, many of which still remain unclear to me. The game has many bugs and glitches, and the FPS often drops. A new player will need to spend dozens of hours just to get a grasp of how the game works.\r\n\r\nThere are many amusing moments: the game claims to be an economic simulator, but it requires hours of micromanagement of units for this system to work properly (without the right skill level, your units are unable to do many tasks). I also found an exploit that allows capturing ships without losing reputation. Otherwise, if you want to earn something meaningful in this game, be prepared to spend hundreds of hours. All the races and ships are monotonous and look very similar to each other. The game is unfinished and not worth its price.\r\n\r\nMy overall experience has been negative, and if I had known what I’d encounter, I definitely wouldn’t have bought this game.",
