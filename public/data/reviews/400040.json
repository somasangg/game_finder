The fact that it is FREE and OPEN SOURCE is a big plus, and it does capture and record well. I do have some issues with it - trying to capture game footage sometimes doesn't work, as all it will produce is a black screen, but anymore I use OBS for that, as it seems to work better in capturing the screen without restrictions. With OBS, I can even capture a full-length movie protected by DRM - something ShareX is not fully capable of and easily blocked by desktop apps or website scripts.\n\nAlso, it has had issues in the past, which admittedly I have not tried it lately before writing this review, but I remember the recording feature not working very well. In fact, it would crash sometimes, something that I hope they've fixed since the last time I used this over a year ago. Yes, a lot can happen in a year's time, but you'd be surprised how many free, open source programs I used to use and left in frustration because of bugs, then came back to months (or even years) later and found that the very same issues had not been resolved.\n\nI have managed to substitute ShareX's features with other programs like the GIMP, OBS, Audacity, and DaVinci Resolve, but it's still a nice program to have \"just in case\".",

Instead of instantly opening like it would if you just downloaded the standalone version, you get to wait on that steam loading window. If you have already opened sharex from steam and god forbid you closed the window and need the app again, you need to end the process in task manager before you can get Sharex on your screen again. Utterly dismal. Just download the app from the shareX site and forget about this garbage edition of such a good free and open source program.",
