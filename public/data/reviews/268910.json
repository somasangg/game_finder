The achievement hunt of Cuphead is very challenging but they do not ask you to do something you wouldn't want to, it just asks you to master the core of the game and get good. Very fun, mature game design decisions.",

      "review": "“Here’s a real high-class bout! - And begin!”\n\nWas meant to write a review for Cuphead after beating the game and deciding whether or not to grab The Delicious Last Course. But it’ll probably take quite a while before I reach that point and you know what, that’s totally fine. It took me eight years just to finally start playing it. Plus, I’m not exactly in a situation right now where I can just summon the motivation to finish it no matter what, especially with plenty of other games catching my attention. Still, hope to finish it someday.\n\nThe difference between many masocore, soulslike or just games with a high difficulty and frustration level and Cuphead, is that this one really really grabs me, visually and musically. \nThe whole look and sound hits something deep in me, and even though I’ve honestly thought about just watching a playthrough, I actually want to experience it myself. That old-school Betty Boop/Fleischer style just has something special, the way arms and legs move like rubber hoses, objects come to life, and everything feels a bit surreal. Of course, nostalgia also plays a big part.\nMaybe I’m not telling anyone anything new here, but I was blown away when the soundtrack hit number one on the US Billboard Jazz Charts and even made it into the Guinness Book of World Records. Back then just like now, I really wanted that soundtrack on vinyl. But just like with games, there’s so much other great music out there. Still, I really hope that one day the OST will find its way onto my record shelf.\n\nCuphead is one of the most successful indie games of all time, with around six million copies sold. So yeah a lot of people bought it, played it and failed miserably. Well, not everyone, a few actually pushed through and someone out there has probably even mastered it. With Cuphead it’s not really you playing the game, it’s the game playing with you. It’s pretty fair for the most part, but it still wants to crush you. I’d love to be part of the nine percent who make it all the way to the end, and when I finally do, I’ll reward myself by watching a ton of reaction and fail videos. \nThen again, maybe I’ll fail spectacularly, throw my controller at the main monitor, bite off the corners of my Editors Keys - Designed for Ableton Live or just jump out the window. \nStill, let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.\n\nIf you want to see how I’m doing, you can check out this video, though it’s a little compilation that also includes three other games: Best Month Ever, Look Mum No Computer and Road 96. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irVd26mjWlo&t=2421s",

The gameplay is very fast-paced and dynamic, the arsenal is wide and the player is encouraged to come up with different builds.\nThe music perfectly accompanies the player throughout the various sections of the game almost in a cinematic way, the fights being presented like episodes of old cartoons. The animation is just as impressive and it truly feels timeless, the drawings are so beautiful and stunningly hand drawn.\nOverall, this game is a pleasure for all the senses and, when I play it, I often admire it in astonishment and feel nostalgic for a distant but incredibly familiar time.\nIf you have patience and perseverance, do yourself a favour and play this work of art: you will not regret it.",

Playing this game with another person will drive you both mad. It's not enough to play perfectly but you both have to play perfectly. Due to the share screen nature both players have to stay in sync or risk slipping or stalling the screen from progressing whiles enemies and projectiles continue their trajectory towards your little bodies with big cup heads as easy targets.\n\nPain aside, this game is genuinely fun when you can finally clear a stage. It takes hours and hours, sometimes days to finally reach the next level. But when you do that feeling is unforgetable. Its the kind of game that exemplifies the value of perseverance. For young kids this game can potentially be a good teacher in that aspect.\n\nI still have only cleared like 5 levels so far at the time of this writing so theres very much left to play.

After S-Ranking every boss and getting every achievement I can confidently say that beating the game normally is not only not that bad but is actually pretty easy as long as you deduce where the projectiles are coming from and use every resource in your tool kit to come up with a strategy. The DLC is great as well however I do think they toned up the difficulty by a giant margin considering the amount of stuff you have to deal with on the screen at any given time is like 3 times as much as the main game, however it is still great fun and the cow boss is my favorite boss in all of cuphead. You should definitely not try to s-rank every boss however considering it does not give you a reward or even an achievement for doing all of them, however I do think if you love the game then getting all the achievements is pretty simple. Cuphead is an outstanding game that is visually gorgeous and provides a challenge that I feel anyone can enjoy, really hoping for a sequel even though it will probably take like 20 years.",

The game stands out through its 1930s cartoon art style, hand-drawn animations, jazz soundtrack, and pure personality packaged into each boss fight. It does not just look good; it truly feels like you're playing inside an old-school cartoon brought to life.\n\nThe gameplay's tough, but in a great way: Every boss tests your reactions, your timing, your ability to adapt. When you lose, it never feels unfair — you always know exactly what you did wrong and beating a boss feels insanely satisfying. That “one more try” feeling hits hard.\n\nThe creativity in this game is crazy. Literally, every fight is a new theme, new mechanics, new animations; nothing ever feels reused. It's one of those games where you can't predict what's coming next, and that keeps it exciting the whole way through.\n\nCuphead sticks with you. The art, the challenge, the music — it all melds into something that doesn’t feel like any other game. It’s easily one of the best and most stylish games I’ve ever played, and beating it feels like an accomplishment you’re genuinely proud of.",

      "review": "TL;DR 7/10, passable Gunstar Heroes clone but it's dragged down by poor design.\n\nIt's okay for what it is. It looks, runs, and plays well, but there's way too much RNG in the design since you have the boss patterns, but then you have the stage hazards on top of that, which often force you into unavoidable damage unless you're using the dash with i-frames. The first-time player traps are utterly copious, and the game's idea of \"difficulty\" is often-times just not letting you see. With the exception of one (Dr. Kahl's if I'm being generous, but his phase 2 is embarrassingly bad), all the shmup levels are a snorefest. Default control scheme is also terrible. The weapon balance is off. The tracer is way too strong. Charge-up laser is too weak. There's a pretty blatant exploit on the Phantom Express boss that should've been ironed out (second phase lasers can't hit you on their own side if you hug the edge of the screen). A lot of enemies have iffy hitboxes that makes shooting them obnoxious. King Dice's cards don't run fast enough, making you run into his hand unavoidably depending on the pattern. When Sally Stageplay transitions from the 3rd to 4th phase you'll often get hit unavoidably by a wave dude that still comes at you.  Great design, guys. Phase 3 Cala Maria, like, WTF is wrong with you, devs? Truly taking RNG trash to a whole different level. Carnation can also force you into unavoidable hits with his vines depending on the pattern. Phase 3 Grim Matchstick also just felt, weird? I don't know how else to put it. It seemed like the fireballs would just spawn out of thin air sometimes, and if you don't get above the flamethrower you're screwed, but then if you don't have beans or tracer then you're just sitting there doing nothing. Essentially there's almost no good damage opportunities aside from very specific setups. Some bosses are also just egregiously crappy like Mangosteen, Mr. Wheezy, Mr. Chimes, Pip and Dot, and Phear Lap. Just because you want to rip off Gunstar Heroes's board game doesn't give you carte blanche to put all of your garbage rejected bosses back into the game. I could go on for a while. Almost every boss has issues in their design. Best bosses were probably the Devil, Werner Werman, and Brineybeard. The game also sorely needs a colorblind assist. For someone like me that can't tell pink from red and blue it made it near impossible to parry. You don't even need a colorblind mode though, just having better visual design would've done it, because I think even normal-sighted people would still have trouble knowing what's parryable or not. I'd say this game is good enough, but could use a LOT of improvement. Levels either oscillate between very boring or very difficult, with little in-between and certainly no curve to it. That said, most of the difficulty comes from bad design or cheap tricks, without a lot of substantive challenge or fun to be found. Clearly inspiration was taken from Gunstar Heroes (if not for the parry mechanic you could almost call it a bad rip-off) but, I think the devs should go back, play that game again, and remember why it was, you know, good. Also maybe hire someone with actual game design chops. Then they can make a much better follow-up. Played on regular, total playtime was 6 1/2 hours (I had an hour already from a few years ago when I was unsuccessfully trying to get the game to work on Parsec. It should work fine now, Parsec has improved significantly). That reminds me though, no online play is a huge negative. 7/10 Haven't played the DLC yet, hopefully that's better.",

FUCK SEKIRO, that game was so good it has ruined every other game for me.\n\nI like difficult games that involve skill.\nWith this I am just frustrated because all my deaths are not based on my skill but on random events and terrible hit-boxes or just playing the same level over and over again until you learn what to press at every time.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h1]Playing on Android[/h1]\nPlaying the [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD9PFVhLLok]Steam Version of this game on Android via GameHub[/url] at a locked 60fps with a [url=https://ni6hant.com/accessories/controllers/phone-gamepads/ant-esports-combatant-2/]phone gamepad[/url] on which I bound one button on the back to fire and didn't have to worry about firing throughout.\nNote: The unofficial android port by SpanishFreddy plays beautifully but had a few minor bugs which might be okay if you can't run the Steam version of the game on your phone but I stick to the steam version for the achievements.",
