      "review": "Blazblue Entropy Effect is a game that really surprised me, as a Blazblue fan originally I was a bit upset to read about how little the game has to do with Blazblue itself and wrote it off as a cash grab; but after grabbing it on sale I can say that this is a great game with a coat of Blazblue paint, and the recently announced Entropy Effect X seems to be going deep into actually connecting the game to the wider Blazblue universe, though they're yet to announce what this means for us PC players; hopefully a paid expansion for us and not a whole new game to purchase.\n\nEntropy Effect is not a Blazblue game ostensibly but it is a fun roguelite action game featuring Blazblue characters, who have all been pretty loving adapted for this game. They look great, feel great to play, and have familiar moves you'll recognize from the home fighting games and it all works well; the result is a sort of fighting game hack and slash hybrid that has tons of build variety and replay value.\n\nThere is a story here but it's really unremarkable and doesn't really seem to have anything to do with Blazblue though Entropy Effect X seems to be changing this, hopefully the devs don't do us dirty seeing the price for the console version; with any luck they'll release the expansion for us as a paid DLC. \n\nIf you like Blazblue, there's enough care put into these adaptations of the characters that you'll probably like this game and how it retains the fighting game feel despite the genre shift. If you like roguelikes or side scrolling action games, you can do far worse than this one, especially with it regularly going on sale for great prices. Looking forward to learning what comes next in Entropy Effect X.",

While the connection with Blazblue is strenuous (the story of this game, which is pretty simple, has nothing to do with BB. The characters are just \"avatars\" and can be anyone) you can feel the developers' love for fighting games baked into every element of it. \n\nThis is the sort of game that doesn't have a lot of \"content\" but has pretty high replayability. Don't expect to progress like you would in a more linear roguelike. It's more the sort you pick up and play and have fun with for an hour every once in a while.",

Have you been moderately dissapointed that while YOMI hustle is almost that, and a good game in it's own right, the turn based mechanics really diminish the value you see in flashy combat that you wish you could properly be a part of?\r\n\r\nThis, my friend, is the game for you. It's a roguelike with balancing inspired by Hades and combat based around the fighting games ArcSys is known for, alongside their signature incomprehensible storylines. I have played this for less than a day of work, and I've already advanced to becoming something close to a god several times and have only been stopped by my single grievance of lacking the ability to loop or otherwise continue a run indefinitely.\r\n\r\nI don't even know what buttons I'm pressing half the time but the game tries it's hardest to make you feel like an evo champion. It's a power fantasy to the maximum and absolutely worth the $20 USD.",

      "review": "Typing this right after the reveal of Entropy Effect X.\n\nI love this game. The art style is immaculate, the performance is solid, the music is nice. But most importantly, the gameplay loop is just so fun. It's admittedly fairly limited in terms of stages, bosses, and run end points, but the replayability with builds and characters does a pretty decent job making up for it. Not one character plays the same, you'll find someone to have fun obliterating enemies with no matter who it is.\n\nThis game also gets a lot of support, including free characters/content and paid DLC that, while not entirely unreasonably priced, does go on sale regularly. \n\nThe major shortcomings (Apart from the lack of stage variety) are the story and the online, generally. The story has nothing to do with the main BlazBlue games, and is serviceable but nothing particularly special. And although I haven't had a particularly bad time myself, the multiplayer servers are known to struggle often, and so if you want to play with friends, it's important to keep that in mind.\n\nEntropy Effect X, the sequel/expansion has just been announced, and so all the negatives could just go away at that point from what we've seen. But it's too early to say for sure.\n\nBlazBlue Entropy Effect is by far my favorite in the Roguelite genre, and I'm writing this to hopefully give it more exposure, as it absolutely deserves that. It might not click for you, but if it does, you'll find yourself completely absorbed. And with a game that's still receiving major content and support into 2026, that's an easy recommendation for me.",

On paper, it really seemed like a dream game.\n\nActually playing it was a different story. The game is built around these short stages where you fight through a handful of enemies or a boss, collect points, and spend them on upgrades. There are multiple characters, which is great in theory, but the structure left me cold. The trailers and description gave me the impression this would play more like Dead Cells or The Rogue Prince of Persia, with larger, flowing biomes you can sink into. Instead, it’s all broken up into little chunks. That constant interruption makes the runs feel stop-and-go, and for me, it sucked the fun out of what could have been a fantastic loop. At times it honestly feels like a very polished mobile game blown up for PC, rather than something built around long, immersive sessions.\n\nIt’s frustrating because the combat itself feels really good. The animations are sharp, the abilities are flashy, and chaining attacks together is satisfying. I wanted to love it. But with the pacing chopped up into quick encounters, I never got that same sense of immersion or progression I was expecting.\n\nOn top of that, the DLC pricing doesn’t help. Charging nearly half the cost of the base game for a single extra character feels off, especially when character variety is supposed to be a core feature. It left a bad taste and made me less inclined to keep investing time into it.\n\nI ended up refunding the game. It’s not terrible by any means, and I can see the appeal if you’re into short, snappy stages, but it just wasn’t what I was led to believe from the previews. Maybe I’ll give it another shot someday if it goes on a deep sale, but for now, it’s not for me.\n\nThis is one of those situations where I'd like Steam to offer a numbers rating, or at least a neutral rating. Since I think the game does offer some good things, I'll leave a thumbs up.",

You can tell that the developers were treating this as a love letter to Dead Cells. They created a whole darn campaign full of roguevania gameplay to introduce the Prisoner to Entropy Effect.\n\nMore generally, Entropy Effect is insanely polished. The fluidity of the combat is phenomenal. You can feel the smooth buttery movement and combat within a few minutes of gameplay. \n\nThey hooked me with the Dead Cells crossover and won me with the polish. This will be a mainstay roguelite for me from now on.",

      "review": "Blazblue Entropy Effect is a game that really surprised me, as a Blazblue fan originally I was a bit upset to read about how little the game has to do with Blazblue itself and wrote it off as a cash grab; but after grabbing it on sale I can say that this is a great game with a coat of Blazblue paint, and the recently announced Entropy Effect X seems to be going deep into actually connecting the game to the wider Blazblue universe, though they're yet to announce what this means for us PC players; hopefully a paid expansion for us and not a whole new game to purchase.\n\nEntropy Effect is not a Blazblue game ostensibly but it is a fun roguelite action game featuring Blazblue characters, who have all been pretty loving adapted for this game. They look great, feel great to play, and have familiar moves you'll recognize from the home fighting games and it all works well; the result is a sort of fighting game hack and slash hybrid that has tons of build variety and replay value.\n\nThere is a story here but it's really unremarkable and doesn't really seem to have anything to do with Blazblue though Entropy Effect X seems to be changing this, hopefully the devs don't do us dirty seeing the price for the console version; with any luck they'll release the expansion for us as a paid DLC. \n\nIf you like Blazblue, there's enough care put into these adaptations of the characters that you'll probably like this game and how it retains the fighting game feel despite the genre shift. If you like roguelikes or side scrolling action games, you can do far worse than this one, especially with it regularly going on sale for great prices.

Maybe some of it is localization flaws. \n\nSomething I'm noticing, albeit from a relatively brief time, and unlike many other roguelites, is that your kit never necessarily has drastic changes throughout the run in terms of playstyle. You pick a core character, you unlock more and more of their moveset as you progress through Potentials, and all the \"Tactics\" you get along the way are basically just riders that tack on some bonus effects to those moves. This is in contrast to other roguelites where one pickup can massively change how you approach combat. In effect, this means that subsequent playthroughs of a given character don't tend to play very differently. This should not be mistaken as a major point of negativity; there are a lot of characters and their kits are individually quite flush with mechanics to keep you engaged and interested in mastering them. If you grow tired of one, just play a different one. \n\nFeels like all the game's really missing is a style meter to encourage combo variety. Even if only for a meaningless score number.",

Not actually part of that story, so if you expected more of that, you're not gonna find any of that - it does its own story that is frankly secondary to the main gameplay loop of the game.\r\n\r\nThe music is very catchy, especially the Research Base and Sakura City themes. Despite having a lot of unique artwork, it seems to mesh rather well together with the old BlazBlue sprites, especially with how these had an energy neon glow applied to them to stand out a bit more. My only complaints is that, the amount of effects can stack so much it might be hard to see things (I think there is a setting to lower the amount of effect so you can see), and how ICEY's much smoother sprites are downright jarringly smooth compared to the much lower framecount of BB chars.\r\nOnly other thing is performance, as the game can get a little stuttery when loading assets for the first time - otherwise will run perfectly fine though.\r\n\r\nThere is enough variety between characters and upgrades to last you a while, as well as a short list of fun bosses to go through. True to its predecessors this game still expects you to know how to string some combos to overwhelm your enemies, and it's fun to do so as characters can get really OP if you pick the right upgrades.\r\n\r\nRecommended if you wanna try a beat 'em up with familiar BlazBlue characters and watch them get absolutely ridiculous in terms of power scaling.",

But most importantly, the gameplay loop is just so fun. It's admittedly fairly limited in terms of stages, bosses, and run end points, but the replayability with builds and characters does a pretty decent job making up for it. Not one character plays the same, you'll find someone to have fun obliterating enemies with no matter who it is.\n\nThis game also gets a lot of support, including free characters/content and paid DLC that, while not entirely unreasonably priced, does go on sale regularly. \n\nThe major shortcomings (Apart from the lack of stage variety) are the story and the online, generally. The story has nothing to do with the main BlazBlue games, and is serviceable but nothing particularly special. And although I haven't had a particularly bad time myself, the multiplayer servers are known to struggle often, and so if you want to play with friends, it's important to keep that in mind.\n\nEntropy Effect X, the sequel/expansion has just been announced, and so all the negatives could just go away at that point from what we've seen. But it's too early to say for sure.\n\nBlazBlue Entropy Effect is by far my favorite in the Roguelite genre, and I'm writing this to hopefully give it more exposure, as it absolutely deserves that. It might not click for you, but if it does, you'll find yourself completely absorbed. And with a game that's still receiving major content and support into 2026, that's an easy recommendation for me.",

They seem represented well in this game.\r\nThere are also a couple of crossover characters/settings and the capacity for more.\r\nRuns can be paused mid-flow and returned to, although 30-40 minutes will normally suffice.\r\nThere is a lot of variety in character powers and run pick ups. You also get to use two of the characters you already played with to boost you and offer new abilities.\r\nCharacters that die or finish can be used in another mode against bosses.

Boss fights gained a higher focus and they are overall well done. I usually don't like randomized levels because they tend to be of lower quality in solo gameplay but it's okay in multiplayer. The true boon of BlazBlue Entropy Effect is playing together with someone else. This co-op style can be very enjoyable, funny and sometimes frustrating too. That's entertaining and lastly what matters. Additionally, the game has beautiful graphics but that's also a downside. The graphic design and system requirements are like a high tech temple built for a game style taken from a SNES console game. That's not exactly a complaint but a SSD shouldn't make a difference for these type of games. Most players will be happy with less fancy elements and graphically enhanced rooms/spots are used for a duplicate effect: To call a list from the option menu.\r\n\r\nIt should be pointed out that players have to face a lot of grinding, rinse and repeat with the target to complete a scene or bosss fight perfectly, just to repeat the procedure over and over again. Variety comes from playable characters, so called evotypes and the possibility to obtain certain benefits. The character can inherit abilities from up to 2 other characters and use up to 2 of their prior collected \"tactics\". Tactics are additional effects and damage effects that execute on regular attacks, skills used and so on. These tactics can be collected but it's not possible to assign them freely. It's an unfortunate decision in my eyes. Characters have their own unique set of abilities that can be upgraded over the process playing solo or in multiplayer, each.\r\n\r\nAll in all, there is a bit too much randomness within the game that takes away too much control of players and how they want to play. However, the multiplayer option, a good selection of characters and additional DLC content with more characters compensate for it.\r\n\r\nA major downside and weakness is communication. The game is terrible at explaining how things work and players are limited to a few messages to express what they want and how they want to play. It doesn't give the basic needs like \"Give me 1 minute, then we can play.\", \"Let's use settings ABC, not XYZ, please.\" and son on. Nobody needs \"Let's jump, now!\". There's no way of telling someone, \"Oh, hey! That tactic A is great and it can unlock an awesome effect with your currently existing tactic B.\". The Upside of that is, there is no risk of strangers sending questionable messages to minors. The selection of pre-existing messages is just useless.\r\n\r\nThe DLC for \"ICEY\" and \"The Prisoner\" from Dead Cells are interesting. They provide a new character and a bit of solo content each. Of course, nobody can predict if a player likes their style as a character but I'd call it a fair deal and worth a try.\r\n\r\nI can definitely recomment the game with a decent replay value for multiplayer. Solo players might find it mediocre due to many confusing things inside solo-progress.",

I currently main Ragna, Hazama, and my boy the Beheaded/Prisoner/Fallen One/King/Flame Face/Immortal Asshole/Little Dick and they all control wonderfully and satisfyingly. I'm currently posting this review fresh off the heels of having a highly potential'ed up Hazama Infinite Stomp Susanoo's 2nd phase and it was GLORIOUS!... albeit at the cost of some serious wrist pain from all the nonstop button mashing to ensure Hazama's stomps cleared Susanoo's whole 2nd phase ._. And holy SHIT the Beheaded!... the devs fucking COOKED with the Beheaded! There are Dante levels of combo potential available with a fully unlocked moveset and the Beheaded's main gameplay gimmick of being able to go into a stance and switch between three available sets of weapons and skills gives you SO MUCH POTENTIAL to do cool shit, to say nothing of how it very much feels like how the Beheaded would play if he really did end up a guest fighter in a pre-Strive Arc System Works game. (It also kinda very much makes me wish he was retroactively added to Cross Tag Battle as DLC with his own story and a personality inspired by Immortalis/Indie Cross ._.)\n\nBut yeah, FANTASTIC and satisfying game I can highly recommend, even as a mainline Blazblue fan that was disappointed by the lack of connection to the mainline series and its cast.
