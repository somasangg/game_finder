The $50 price tag in 2025 is honestly amazing for a game of this quality. Add in Friend Pass, which lets you play with your friends across different platforms, and the fact that there’s no Denuvo or annoying third party launchers that alone is a huge sign of respect toward gamers.\n\nStory wise, I think it’s a bit weaker compared to It Takes Two and A Way Out, but that ending… absolutely mind blowing, creative, and emotional. I was honestly stunned.\n\nDespite being made with Unreal Engine 5, the optimization is fantastic I didn’t run into a single issue.\n\nMy only real complaint is the lack of mini games. Unlike It Takes Two, which was full of fun little side activities, this one doesn’t have them but the amazing side missions make up for it pretty well.\n\nWith all the positives and the clear respect the devs have shown toward players, there’s no way I could give it anything less than a perfect score.\n\nThank you, Hazelight Studios.\n⭐ 10/10",

      "review": "[h1][i]Split Fiction[/i] is an ambitious game that brings us into fantastical settings with ease. [/h1] \n\nThere are many things working in this game's favor. The concept is very novel and allows the developers to literally take us anywhere. That is a boon, although it also leads me to see a bit of lost potential. With as boundless the possibilities were for this setting, it kind of does make me realize many of the stories we are in are very similar, especially Mio's. The settings start running together and feeling a little bit same-y, unlike its predecessor [i]It Takes Two.[/i] While I am able to enjoy what we got, I do think it could've been pushed a lot more and I find that a lot of the 'side stories' are actually a lot more inventive and unique than the actual story beats. \n\nThe characters are likeable enough, although it takes a lot of time to start appreciating Mio. I really feel like the pacing of this game is a bit slow, having some really great peaks but also some very slow, low valleys. I feel like one thing that I saw as missing was the chemistry between these two characters. They are meant to become really close by the end of the story, and remain friends during the epilogue, however I feel like they just kind of happen to be there together. They really don't have much in common, Mio is condescending towards Zoey for much of the run time, and I just don't really believe they are friends. Hence why I feel like the emotional turmoil we are thrust into in [i]It Takes Two[/i] is a lot more interesting because it is already established by the time we are introduced to it. This game however is about finding out about their backstories and it almost feels like they are on separate journeys and just happen to be together. \n\nOutside of that, it features some really ingenious level design. However, the truly innovative level designs really does highlight how boring some of the other parts are, if that makes sense. The higher the highs are the more obvious the low points are with this title. None of the parts were altogether unenjoyable, but some are definitely like \"I can't wait to just finish this area so we can move on.\"\n\nAnother issue I think arises throughout the story is that Zoey is a background dancer to Mio's performance. Even down to the powers Zoey gets, she is Mio's tag-along. The story itself takes a long, long time to give any attention to Zoey's story and it happens very late in the game. Mio's story is spoon-fed to you throughout the whole game, while Zoey's feels poorly paced. Even despite this, yeah, it's all fun to play with a friend. But I found that, playing as Zoey, you are an accessory to Mio's story and even the powers you will get as her are kind of just an accompaniment to Mio. \n\nDo I reccommend it? Well, despite it being an EA title, yes. It is a good game overall. Did it reach the same highs as its predecessor? In my opinion, no.",

This game brings innovative style for co-op games and has been my favourite game from this studio so far. Though compared to It Takes Two and A Way Out, this game doesn't reward you as much for exploring the environment, which I really hope it did. \n\nThe only bad thing to say about it (and this goes for most of modern games) is that I hate the fact of no save option. It's annoying to not be able to save the game and stop playing whenever you want and limits the possibilities to play for gamers with kids and other responsibilities in life. \nOther than that I loved the game.",

I played it with my dad and it turned into one of those memories you tuck away and keep forever. The game instantly wins points for the simple fact that you only need one copy and your friend can hop in with the free friend pass. More studios should take notes, but the team behind A Way Out and It Takes Two is already five laps ahead of everyone else.\r\n\r\nFor fifty bucks at launch and regular sales, the value is unbelievable. You get two fully fleshed characters, each with their own abilities, which doubles the replayability and keeps the second playthrough feeling fresh instead of familiar. Every mission brings in some new mechanic or twist, so nothing ever feels recycled. One moment you're racing through chaos and the next you're slowing down to soak in these gorgeous environments. I kept stopping just to look around because the backgrounds genuinely took my breath away.\r\n\r\nThe story is just as strong as the gameplay. Its funny, heartfelt, and not afraid to land an emotional punch. I cried once or twice and I'm not embarrassed to admit it. The friendship between the characters grows in ways that feel earned and honest, and the pacing never drags on.\r\n\r\nYou've probably already seen a thousand people tell you to play this game. Consider me drop number one thousand and one in that ocean. Split Fiction is a reminder that co op games can still have heart, charm, and craftsmanship in an industry that's getting a little too big for its britches. Support this studio.

Compelling story, beautiful art style, and a great soundtrack. \r\nThis game is another fun co-op adventure that takes you on a wild ride with a friend working together to escape from a virtual world to save not only yourselves but your untold stories as well.\r\n\r\nThere are so many fun and funny moments in this game, as well as thrills and moments of reflection and sorrow. It’s another game that isn’t afraid to warn of a dystopian future where creativity is nothing more than a commodity to be packaged and sold while also taking humans out of the creative process.\r\n\r\nI had a blast playing this game, and exploring another fun world(s) while exploring the past of the two main characters who are forced together to save themselves and maybe just end up friends in the end.",

      "review": "I've just finished playing Split Fiction, a coop adventure game developed by Hazelight Studios and published by Electronic Arts. While it greatly depends on your coop partner, a typical playthrough lasts around 11~12 hours.\n\nMio and Zoe are aspiring writers who join an experimental program sponsored by Rader, a tech conglomerate, which promises to use advanced mental rendering to expedite the creative journey towards publishing their books. However, an accident causes Mio and Zoe to get trapped in the same simulation together. Their only hope of returning to reality is to seek out glitches as they travel between each other's stories, in the hopes of causing the machine to shut down. Rader is reluctant to let this happen, as their plan is quickly revealed to be the desire to steal the all the creative knowledge of the writers, and simulate their works. Thus a frantic race ensues between Zoe and Mio versus Rader, as the girls try to escape the simulation, and Rader attempts to trap them within.\n\nThe feeling of Split Fiction is that of a high octane action adventure, as Zoe and Mio world hop between each other's stories in a linear path rich with innovative gameplay and fantastic coop sequences. As the two race through surreal renditions of their stories, they bond and share how these narratives relate to their own stories in real life. The two girls are each carrying a past which presents itself as an obstacle to their progress. The dialogue is straight out of the Joss Whedon school of script writing, but does not feel overly out of place in the context of what is largely a goofy action adventure. While the \"did we just do that\" and repeating things other characters say does become a bit grating, there are also sequences of the story which are somewhat touching, particularly the friendship between Mio and Zoe. \n\nThere's a less than subtle metaphor in Split Fiction for the way that generative AI can be used exploitatively against writers. While not terribly nuanced, it does lay a strong foundation for a comedically over the top villain, the CEO of Rader. As Mio and Zoe progress their stories, they occasionally catch glimpses of the outside world, which is turning bad for the CEO fast, as his board is concerned this incident has jeopardized the entire plan. My gaming companion and I did wonder why, despite repeatedly saying that he would stop the girls at any cost, he did not just... kill them; however, he instead allows their journey to continue, much to the delight of the player.\n\nThe gameplay is... fantastic. I genuinely think this is one of, if not the best, implementations of coop gameplay I've seen. Levels are designed with incredible ingenuity, with the perspective of the player, and the control systems constantly being revised to keep things fresh. Levels also have small optional side stories, which are an absolute joy to explore, with each featuring gameplay even more experimental than what is typically explored in the main scenario.\n\nAt its core design, the game is a coop linear platformer; however, what makes Split Fiction so incredible is its cinematic sequences of action, as players need to coordinate together to fight bosses, solve puzzles, and overcome tricky platforming segments. Split Fiction features something like 8~12 bosses, and each one was well designed with its attack sequences, and thematically relevant to the level, incorporating elements of the gameplay introduced across the chapter. While Mio's levels are rich with engaging and experimental gameplay, Zoe's levels are absolute eye candy, featuring lush vistas, and fantastical beasts.\n\nSplit Fiction is an incredibly easy recommendation to anyone, provided you can find a friend to play with. There were almost no sequences which dragged on longer than necessary, and the game is void of tiresome chores to keep people playing longer than is enjoyable. While its writing is a bit common, Split Fiction otherwise excels with fantastic art, gameplay and level design. Even if you don't have a friend to play with now, Split Fiction is a great excuse to try to find a new one.",

      "review": "Writing this review after playing roughly 10 hours of this game with my friend, and I can only say that I'm baffled it has such overwhelming praise. I don't know what kind of global psy-op is going on by Hazelight studios to convince me that this game is amazing when it simply fun at its best, and unfortunately boring at its worst. \n\nFrom the outset, the story is nothing substantial or revolutionary, as we're introduced to Mio and Zoe they seem like the average character archetypes of a emotionally guarded person vs a happy-go-lucky free spirit. I don't mind fun albeit sometimes-cringey banter between each other, though its was clear from early where they were going with the characters as we progressed. They are nothing amazing yet they aren't annoying or terrible either, simply two fun characters dropped in this setting, and as long as the settings themselves provided enough depth and engagement, it didn't matter how unremarkable they were, right?\n\nThen comes the massive disappointment in Split Fiction, the settings themselves. As we trekked from world to world, the prevailing sentiment I felt each and every time being echoed between my friend and I were how one-dimensional all of the worlds felt. For many of the opening worlds, we get little to no backstory or even modicum of effort to give Mio and Zoe's worlds any depth. It felt especially egregious in the sci-fi setting, not helped by the creator's (Mio) reluctance by narrative choice to withhold any details that might actually intrigue or entice the player as to what is going in this world. You do get some things from Mio and Zoe at times, but its perhaps a sentence or two that seem more like throwaway lines that don't seem like earnest attempts to enhance the worlds. (\"defeat the Ice King\", give me break man.) \nSidebar complaint: It didn't help many of the settings themselves felt incredibly derivative and unoriginal even in design, and I'm especially pointing out most of Mio's sci-fi world which I struggled to ascertain one thing that was remarkable about that I haven't seen in any other sci fi world in any other piece of media ever. (at one point quite literally just taking the Tower of Tiphares from Alita: Battle Angel and putting it in the game. Hey, its not an homage or a reference if its literally just it man. Get outta here. )\nRegardless, the action set-pieces simply felt like nicely decorated roller coaster rides, performing cooperative actions across high-flying hover-car traffic not because the story in the world demanded it and provided proper motivation, but because you simply had to \"keep moving\" to get to the next story, to try and eventually escape from your predicament from the plot's inciting incident (you are sucked into the world of your narratives and must defeat the evil tech billionaire trying to steal your ideas etc etc). The problem with that motivation is that while it did provide and endgame goal and set up the villain for the story, it is definitely not strong enough to hold the game's entire narrative tension as you slave through hours and hours of these worlds. Besides Mio and Zoe's relationship growing as they progress, but they do it against faceless, soulless worlds that provide no interwoven narrative elements in their own right, making the game feel like that much more of a slog.\n\nNow I will say, many of the mechanics are fairly fun in this game and it does play exceptionally well at times (especially portions of the fantasy worlds where you can transform into different beings), but the game also works against itself as it babies you through each checkpoint in the platforming, puzzle solving, and boss fighting. I'm not asking for stomp-on-my-balls difficulty, but for the love of god if me and my friend die to a boss' attack, please do not restart us at the point in the boss fight 10 seconds ago when we already have a third of its HP bar depleted. Challenge is fun, and at no point does this game actually feel like it wants to challenge you. So for as fun as the gameplay is at times, the lack of any real difficulty makes it hard to engage with on this level.\n \nAs we trudged through this game and reached the past-halfway point at the 10 hour mark, we just about had enough after being hand-held through the Metal Gear Solid reference #2 boss (MGS reference #1 boss was equally as dull) and stopped at the cool 2D sketchbook adventure that I'm sure is a cool reference to some indie platformer with the same visual style. In fact, it made me want to play that game instead of this. I think I'm gonna go do that. \n\nI give Split Fiction a 6/10. And I'm being nice there. I might change later. maybe. fuck you",

I love It Takes Two and A Way Out so I figured I'd love this as well - so far, I'm very disappointed. The characters are very... trope-y and flat compared to their other games and the conversation comes off as a bunch of naive whining. The story is bland and the gimmick of mixing two genres of fiction is more jarring than entertaining - the villain is also just... a giant caricature of evil, mustache-twirling,  overplayed stereotype rather than an actual character. Some of the Side Stories are fun but most overstayed their welcome well before their short playtime wore off. \r\n\r\nThe game itself feels like a constant string of poorly-disguised quicktime events with different visuals to distract you from that fact. Also, the constant use of one-time mechanics doesn't help me feel any better about that since you sometimes just... die because you couldn't figure out a new mechanic in time only to never use it again 10 minutes later anyway. The boss fights are also very bland with several of them just requiring you to do the same thing 3 times in a row or come with a different phase that, surprise, is just the same thing you already did anyway.",

I also really appreciate that it even has a friends' pass and that it works great online. To be honest that's really all the positive I wish to say for it.\n\nI did play It Takes Two, and I had really liked that and knew this had great reviews, so I was very excited to try it. Unfortunately, this game lacks the cohesive setting and its characters are more cliched and less tolerable. Mio is a very flat, rude character for a good few hours, and Zoe is naive on a level that is stereotypical at best. Both behave kind of immaturely for their age, so I didn't find myself terribly invested in them. The cutscenes were many and they made me bored.\n\nNot being invested was maybe good because GOD do I die a lot because of the constant new mechanics and what is essentially QTEs (see a section where a monkey makes you copy his movements). There's a lot of \"aaaa I'm falling! Player character, move left and right and press one additional button or you die!\" This, coupled with the game's unforgiving timing on some things where both players must participate, meant even if I got something right, I would often die from my co-op partner (not really shade against them, but haha loser. kek.).\n\nMeanwhile, there's kind of a lot of button mashing. Button mash to shield; button mash to speed up; heck, button mash to revive when you inevitably die. Maybe that's what made this game feel like QTEs?\n\nI did like some segments, like the ones where we genuinely got to goof around on water slides or even had tasks split up and were each doing our part, but sometimes this game just feels like \"two people do a solo thing but if one fails, both die.\" Not sure what exactly made this game feel different from It Takes Two, but I'm kind of disappointed.",

The latter spans the range from \"obvious dune ripoff\" to \"generic scifi 1\" to \"generic scifi 2\" to \"obvious harry potter ripoff\". Now maybe you like dune, or harry potter, and find the idea of a game taking you to all these places appealing. When I say ripoff I mean in the more bare bones 'gestures to it with aesthetics, if you have astigmatism and squint'. Yet they are also obviously ripoffs because there is nothing else they could be. The gameplay is designed for people who have never played a video game before, the story for people who have never read a story before, and the characters for people who have never interacted with a person before.\n\nThe only reason we haven't dropped it is because we have fun making fun of it. I can't recommend it on so bad its good qualities, though, because it costs so much money it's stupid.\n\nIt's an insult it's nominated for anything in the game awards, and that's saying something, because I don't respect the game awards.",

      "review": "This game is super inventive, similar to It Takes Two, with its gameplay but is suffers from poor controls at times. I wasn't really feeling the characters, but that was similar to the last game as well. Some of the gameplay was really fun, but a lot of it was really frustrating and at times just boring. I still don't understand why you have to play most of the game in split screen. It seems unnecessary, and the gameplay suffers for it. I'm not sure how far I was in the game having spent a little less than 3 hours, but I wasn't having fun. I see that this game has overwhelmingly positive reviews, and I'm glad people like it. It kind of reminds me of Zelda Breath of the Wild reviews. Everyone I talked to that played the game hated the fact that all of the weapons break. But it still got almost universal perfect scores. If you don't call things out, nothing will change. Anyway, I just don't think this type of game is for me anymore. I don't want to play games in split screen anymore.  It's so unique, it's basically in a category of its own. Which is a shame and means we will only get games from this developer that are like this, and I don't see them improving much, because everyone just tell them how amazing their games are. Hope everyone likes it, but I bet a few people feel similarly to me. If you can look past some shoddy controls and some bland characters you'll probably love this. I just didn't.",

Whatever joyless person decided to remove those from the gameplay loop should be ashamed.\n\nI understand there's only so many unique co-op experiences / situations you can give whilst remaining appealing to general audiences, and maybe they've reached the limit with this one, but we couldn't even bring ourselves to finish it over the span of over half a year. \n\nIf you haven't played any titles from this studio, buy the other two first and only get this one if you're desperate for more co-op and don't mind a downgrade in fun.",

      "review": "Going into this game I was excited to get my hands on another fun co-op bonding experience similar to its predecesors, 'It Takes Two' or even 'A Way Out'. I wanted puzzles that require intricate teamwork. A well designed puzzle can be intricate, yet have a clear goal, where we don't even need to verbally communicate what we need, we just fly through the challenges together once we feel the flow of the game and become immersed in a world of bright neon futuristic tech, and a nice easy on the eyes bright sun-lit fantasy univserse to juxtopose the faster paced cybernetic world. With the overwhelmingly positive reviews I was not expecting to be met with utter dissapointment just mere minutes into the game.\n\nTo start with the few positives because I want to give credit where credit is due; it is a cool idea to swap between alternate realities and getting in on the interdimensional band wagon, borrowed from the likes of Marvel, and Rick and Morty, opens the door for entertaining, boundary pushing gameplay. I liked the idea of exploring a fantasy and a neon cyberpunk style pair of univserses and I think if it was done with better execution it could have been great.\n\nHowever, just mere moments into the gameplay, you are thrown into the first area of the sci-fi universe. A series of incredibly easy platforming challenges are presented to you, as a parade of explosions and gun fire rain down around you. Parkour 'challenges' that literally automatically guide you onto the next platform with the click of the jump button. No aim required, no skill needed. I can appreciate that maybe this game wasn't made for me, the average experienced gamer. It was very noticably made for the average gamer's girlfriend who has never held a controller. A multiplayer experience that is incredibly low stakes and very forgiving upon dying again and again with no consequences. Over an hour in, I found myself wondering when the part of the game that makes for such universally positive steam reviews would present itself. \"Just a few more levels and it'll get to the good part.\" I told myself. Several hours in and it did not come.\n\nAtmosphere is one of the most important parts of a game. It is one of the hardest things to nail in a game, because it requires so many elements coming together to really sell the world the developers crafted. Good music, for example, to elevate your heart rate while you dash through levels and take down enemies on your way through is exactly what creates atmopshere. Split Fiction, however, missed on nearly every aspect. A completely forgettable soundtrack for the levels I did play. Just moments at the start of the game you are surrounded by gunfire and explosions that do nothing but fill my headphones with static, poitnless audio that does nothing to elevate the experience. It's loud for the sake of being loud. Even something that should be subtle like wind and moving platforms are fighting for your attention.\n\nVisually, the game doesn't look great. There are plently of great games that try to look realistic, and plenty of games that go for a stylized approach, and this game fails to do either. When creative game mechanics or well written story line come into play, lousy graphics can be forgivable. But when you take a second to try and appreciate the art style you quickly realize a generic visual presentation. A brown desert with brown dust and faint brown mountains in the distance. Even when you get into the city and start jumping from car to car, its nothing unique that you haven't seen from any other sci-fi game. Just some souless tall tower buildings and neon signs, nothing I needed more than a second to take it in. A great attempt at creative world building happens in the sand level. You are surfing down a gleaming ocean of sand pouring out from a massive sand timer. A detail that goes unnoticed until the lazy dialogue shoehorns an explanation to you.\n\nThe gameplay is incredibly boring and literally had me falling asleep. Gameplay similar to the likes of Lego Star Wars in the ship flying seciton I got confused when I wasnt collecting studs. The platforming could genuinely be done with your eyes closed because it does it all for you. The cyber weapons were cool looking, and if less restrictive could have been fun to use as well. Using the sword was extremely limiting. Click pink panel. Slash pink panel. Click pink panel. Repeat. The whip was a little more engaging; it brought interactable physics and sling shot mechanics that seemed fresh and interesting to use. But from my experience, getting smashed by trash cans by the unweildly whip till you die completely by accident over and over again gets pretty old pretty quick. Certain mechanics and gameplay were ripped straight out of \"It Takes Two,\" such as when Cody has to throw nails at a wall to create a path for his teammate. The interaction is nearly a 1:1 copy with no creative flair or tweaking to hide the fact that it was borrowed from a previous game. One of the early boss fight sequences downright uses the same attack patterns as well. Some quick time events are arbitrarily interrupted by a cutscene, intended to throw the player through a loop and do something unexpected, but it comes across as tired and shallow. Ironically, the silly \"Short Stories\" side quests felt less creatively bankrupt and more engaging. They had more unique mechanics and memorable art. At the very least, breaking up the \"serious\" gameplay with a world of cannibalistic pigs introduced new puzzles and gameplay features that made for more memorable experiences. The temporary enjoyment while playing these levels still had me dreading my return to the sci-fi world.\n\nIn all honestly, my biggest criticism is the story. The writing, the dialoge, the simple back and fourth banter all felt sloppy and out of place. In Mia's first 20 sentences of dialogue, about half of them are \"The company is stealing our ideas.\" The quips are awful, with no distinct personality or cleverness whatsoever. There was clearly very little love and soul put into the writing, and I have no earthly idea how it isn't more obvious to others. After spending an hour trudging through boring fights and replaying the same puzzle over and over, Mia spawns a car out of nowhere, simply for the sake of progressing the plot, and not because it fit the framework of the overarching narrative, leaving myself asking why the fuck I didn't just save 2 hours of my life and spawn a car at the very start if it was that easy. Half of the cutscenes are the player getting surrounded by police only for them to jump from a 500 foot drop even though, frames ago I fell off the same drop and died. This lazy form of plot progression not only happenend once, but multiple times in the short amount I played. I'll save myself another few hours by finding the nearest cliff next time. The story makes literally zero sense. A billion dollar company forcing a woman to participate in an unknown activity with no explanation while everyone else happily puts on space suits even though they also have no idea why they are there is uninspired and lazy. Just a small amount of critical thinking pokes enough holes in the story to tear the fabric so much that it's really not hard to see EA peeking through the other side hoping \"Made by the creators of 'It Takes Two'\" is enough to make a record high selling game.\n\nAnd of course it is.",

It Takes Two was technically the same thing but the setting and core story was so well done that it brought a cohesiveness to the entire experience that made it quite fun. This on the other hand never achieves that and it just feels like you're rolling the dice and playing the mechanic it lands on, leading us to burn out and stop about halfway through.\n\nI'm also quite disappointed that the levels are entirely in one or the other of two settings (Fantasy or Sci-fi) as the marketing really implies that you will be diving back and forth through some kind of clever mashup of the two in a meaningful way - a much more interesting execution of the idea than the one they ended up building out.",
