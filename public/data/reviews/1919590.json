Started out with an Adam , through Commodore , IBM and all the rest. What gaming has become is pathetic . Companies rip you off every chance they get. they lie and they steal and they misrepresent their products. But most importantly they make them obsolete at their discretion. When I buy a game I expect be able to play it until I don't want to play it anymore. I have already been through this with Microsoft and all the games I have bought over the years. Games (MICROSOFT GAMES) That supposedly are  not compatable  with windows is the biggest lie ever told. These games work fine once a cd cheat comes into play. Why do I have to use  cheat  when I bought the game in the right way? Its obvious that windows is designed not to recognize these games, which should be criminal act because it was done to prevent me from using something that I already OWN!!! Buying games where I do not hold anything physical in my hand is something I will not do anymore. I have spent enough money on steam for games that don't work anymore!! It will happen no more. I have a 2004 Dell that I keep to use all my disc games from years gone by so I'll just keep playing it. It has not been connected to the net in years and never will be again so these lowlifes can't mess it up too. By the way, I was messing with Dell one day and out the blue a screen came up and said their had been a catastrophic failure and the system was corrupt and unusable. Also had a date on it , 20 years to the day that computer was built. I \n quickly pulled the plug, then restarted without the internet connection and have been using ever since off line to play the good ole games , you know. the kind they used give you that they can't take away. Oh , thats right , you probably don't know cause they don't want you to. So Anyway I am done. Give me about a Million likes and we'll start a movement to stop this  ****!!!!!",
