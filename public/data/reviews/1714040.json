The way you can use the abilities of your Pets to manipulate the outcomes of a match in your favor feels great.I suggest this for people who like auto-battlers. Also, for those who just want an easy to play game that you can leave and come back to if you get busy. Works well because if something comes up then you can just exit the game and come back later to finish a run.\nIMO the game is a 8.5/10.

But as more updates came out, the manipulation behind wins and losses became increasingly obvious. You’ll often face opponents with insanely high stats and completely unreasonable win rates. Sometimes, you’ll lose because the enemy miraculously survives with just a sliver of health — once or twice it feels dramatic and memorable, but when it happens constantly, it starts to feel scripted rather than coincidental.\r\n\r\nThis problem has gotten much worse in the latest versions. You can clearly feel the matchmaking pushing you — suddenly matching you against much stronger opponents just to break your streak, or pairing you with absurdly weak ones after a losing run. I know games like this often tweak matchmaking behind the scenes, but the current version takes it way too far.\r\n\r\nLeaving this review before uninstalling it from both my phone and PC.",

Getting far at all with the original pets granted at the beginning, or any of the recent unbalanced weekly free packs, takes more patience then I can muster here. \n\nThe main complaint I would have is the balance. This game does not feel balanced, you will often lose lives and entire runs to individuals who have item/pets you cannot understand without extensive research on the pets, and cannot own yourself without paying money. \n\nWeekly packs are a wonderful idea to give F2P players a chance. but in my opinion balance is an afterthought on free content. Going through the newest weekly pack shocked me, as almost every pet only had abilities related to selling them or others midgame. tier 1 pets with sell abilities are wonderful as you have to replace them anyway. teir 5 pets with sell abilities related to selling LEVEL 3 pets (6 of the same pet bought at 3 gold][ 10ishgold max per round) is just unfortunate. what am I supposed to do with that pet, Especially if that only adds 1-3 health to SOME of my pets IF i can sell a high enough level pet. \n\nIn summary the game can be fun, but once balance tips most games never recover. and tipping towards Pay 2 win loses my vote for sure.",

The gameplay is fairly complex too (it's an autobattler), especially given the simple artstyle. I understand where its coming from, but I do dislike the game's monetization style. I'm definitely a completion-minded person, so the way it's handled is a bit of a bummer to me. My main issue with this game is that it gives me a vague sense of unease. I don't really know why, but it makes me unhappy. Sorry.",
