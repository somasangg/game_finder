I had all my snacks and drinks lined up, I was so immersed and engaged for the entirety of that time, to the point where time just slipped away. So I warn you now, sore and all, this game is an unbeatable experience. Salute to the sailors in Subs I'm dying just simulating what you all do. 10/10 game will unplug from reality with it again!!!",

If you're new to sub-sims, then this might be a bit frustrating on your first go round but when you get a direct hit on a merchant ship with a manual input solution, the satisfaction is worth it. \n\nAlso, watch out for the RAF. By 1943, they're a bloody nuisance when you have to surface your boat to get some fresh air.",

You just need to take it seriously and let yourself immerse in it, and it will reward.

This game just sucked me in.\n\nI also like to be called Korvettenkapitän in real life as I play this game but that's a different matter altogether.\n\nThe experience of hunting a convoy for hours of (in-game) time, waiting for the right opportunity, letting off some torps and scurrying away into the depths is just one of the many immersive experiences this game gave me. \n\nA little rough around the edges but the game nails life aboard a uboat: the monotony, the anxiety, the panic of realizing you're in a steel can 150 m underwater, the relief, the elation.",

The Discussion forum will provide answers from dedicated players with far more experience than myself when you might hit snags along the way.\nU-Boat is still a game in progress, and an update is promised soon that will expand the U-Boat roster and patrol areas.\n\nRecommended!",

From tracking down ships to laying down mines, landing spies in the uk and Ireland, making weather stations, doing patrols, sinking ships to looking for sunken treasure you will definitely have great fun if you just give it a try. Now i will say that the tutorial doesn’t really explain everything, specially if you are playing on higher realism, they don’t tell you how to track down ships, make your own torpedo calculations (which you should do as its usually more accurate but also more complex), how to approach your target and how the torpedoes work, for example i didn’t know that you could use magnetic triggers for torpedoes. They give you a good general idea of how to play but I do recommend that you find a good beginners guide on yt as it will help you a lot and you will need it trust me. Also if you hit your targed and they start doing Tokyo drift or get launched into space or even if they float off through the air, don’t be alarmed as im sure that its not a bug but rather some kind of defensive tactic.

I'm personally also not the biggest fan of the restock mechanic in that it is random which torpedo types, and how many, are available.
