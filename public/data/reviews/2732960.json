      "review": "Among the thousands of different games I've played, this is my favorite game of all time despite clearly not even being a great game by any standard. The AI is the typical cheating moron it is in every oldschool RTS, the community gave up on the balance of the game a very long time ago and has forced random mirrors in 1v1 tournaments for over two decades, and the online has always been fraught with desyncs and infamous for competitively relevant gameplay exploits. But it's great. This is lethal micro-intensive RTS at its finest, with the macro and strategizing reduced to a small fraction of the gameplay. Just set yourself up and put your heart and soul into every unit you make, and you'll win. This means that unlike most competitive RTS, you and your opponent are basically always looking at the same thing, the place where your units are closest to his units, except where a flanking gattling cannon (yeah they gave it a weirdly spelled name in this game) is shooting down chinooks to distract you from your micro, or is it the reverse? There are no chores back at base, just your broken combos vs his broken combos. No engineer rushes, but you can still win the game in under two minutes by hunting his dozers after he sells his CC for fast expand money. Or you can play a 30-minute GLA mirror and tech up to bus and buggy. Still a lot of micro and a lot of death prevention.\n\nThis is more of its own thing than a C&C, but you recognize a lot of C&C DNA in this game with its myriad hard counters, quick TTK, and superweapons intended to make turtleteching pointless. The node economy means the macro skill ceiling is even lower than previous C&C generations (though still higher than RA3) and you and your opponent are having more of a duel than a game of battleship. Sometimes it does feel like battleship with all the free airstrikes though. Oh and there's a campaign, which is actually better gameplay-wise than any Westwood campaign, but it's not for me. You get into this game for the multiplayer. and that takes modding and third-party accountmaking to get working. Quicker than it sounds.\n\nFFA isn't stupid because the XP system massively rewards involvement in fights (to a point) and cannot be exploited passively. Tanks are mostly garbage, the game is primarily about rocket soldiers and their escorts/transports. Lots of alright mods for the game, like every C&C. Scrap your technicals up and make China players crave death. Thrax and Granger are more broken than Yuri ever was.",

It doesn't run great on modern systems out of the box, but with some third-party patches (Genpatcher & Gentool), you'll be able to use modern resolutions and play online. If you are an RTS fan and haven't played Generals yet, I would highly recommend checking it out.

Though not scratching that cheesy C&C itch, they are welcome nonetheless. The new missions are very engaging with various different scenarios you have to overcome, and the generals challenge mode is quite an interesting approach to a secondary singleplayer campaign.\r\n\r\nThis gets an A.
