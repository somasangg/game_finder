      "review": "Honestly, this game is truly underrated. That 2009–2016 era of FPS games was something special, and coming back to Titanfall 2 just reminds me how unmatched it really was. The combat is slick and incredibly fluid, movement just feels great even if a little floaty. I’m still not the biggest fan of some of the guns (a few lean a bit too hard into sci fi gimmick territory for me with a few interesting ones I wont lie), but the moment to moment gameplay more than makes up for it. The story isn’t the most original premise you’ll ever see, but it never tries to be anything it isn’t. It’s confident, tight, and surprisingly heartfelt. The banter with BT hits that perfect balance of dry humour, warmth, and weight a nice emotional break from the game’s overall darker tone. It's genuinely one of the better buddy dynamic narratives in shooters. And the level design? Honestly incredible. There are moments here that feel like master class set pieces taking advantage of unique mechanics in ways that are memorable without feeling like gimmicks. Levels like that one (you know the one) are still talked about for a reason, and even outside the standout moments, the campaign’s pacing and creativity keep things constantly engaging. It's got some decent performances by its voice actors which is always appreciated. It’s short, punchy, and doesn’t waste your time a rare thing now. Titanfall 2 really deserved better support and recognition at launch, because even today it stands toe to toe with the best shooters ever made.",

      "review": "EA doesn't deserve Titanfall.\n\nThis is one of the most beloved FPS games for a reason. The campaign is fantastic, the movement has an incredibly high skill ceiling, the guns are awesome, Titan combat is really fleshed out and integrates amazingly into the game's singleplayer and multiplayer, there's not really any microtransactions, and there's no skill-based matchmaking. You start out sucking at the game, and as you get better, you really [i]feel[/i] your improvement as you begin to stand out against the other players in the lobby. It's very gratifying and refreshing compared to the dozens of modern FPS games where you are basically guaranteed to have a 50% winrate no matter how good you are due to their ELO systems. \n\nThe overwhelming community love and support for this game that has grown even past the game's heyday is something that is extremely undervalued by soulless megacorp Electronic Arts. I guess it's just less risky and probably more profitable to continue to milk Apex Legends until the Titanfall franchise fades into irrelevance.",

Playing as a titan feels great and really scratches the mecha itch. The interplay between pilots and titans is great, as it provides good gameplay variety during matches and gives a real \"david vs. goliath\" feel when you face a titan as a pilot. It especially helps that pilots [i] can [/i] fight titans if they use their environment and superior movement effectively, as it means the odds are stacked against you if you run into a titan but you're never powerless.

The gaming industry has become really broken, if a nearly decade old game feels \"refreshing\". \r\nAfter playing Baldurs Gate III for 140+ hours in my first run, just having to play a game for 8 hours feels \"refreshing\" too. Of course, BG3 is one of the greatest games in existance. But 140+ hours for one run is a behemoth of a game that can be exhausting.\r\n\r\nEven the visuals did not feel too old. You can see it's age from time to time, of course. But it never felt awkward. The visuals were definitly not an obstacle for me and I am 100% the type of guy, who feels a great urge to buy a new GPU, when a single slider needs to be tweaked to something awful like \"high\" or even forbid \"medium\" instead of \"ultra\".\r\n\r\nI wish these type of \"AAA\"-games were more common. This game is published by EA, the same company that destroyed nearly every big title and franchise for the last 10 years. For what it's worth, EA did not release a Titanfall 3 yet, which is a blessing for the series. No loot boxes, no micro/macro transactions, good performance and optimization. Titanfall 3 what be like, \"Your titan has no power left! Buy energy boosters for 24 hours for 2.99$ and get rid of all the grind mechanics we purposly build into the game to squeeze every single last coin out of your pocket after spending 199$ for our deluxe edition, just containing 2 skins and horse armor\". \r\n\r\n\r\nAhh and the cherry on top => Played this game on Bazzite, not Windows and it runs perfectly.

It's genuinely remarkable how good this still looks, and it does so whilst running at very high frame rates on pretty much anything. Stutterstruggle is not an issue with Titanfall 2, as it runs on Valve's Source Engine, not Unreal. Zero stutters, zero hitches, just super fluid frame rates. Amazing what the combination of great art and a great engine can achieve, something we don't see much of anymore.\r\n\r\nThe game also plays amazingly well. It has a perfect blend of high speed traversal with double jumps, wall running etc, with a big variety of unique sci-fi weaponry which all feel satisfying to use. They all sound great too, in fact the sound in general is top tier with a great cinematic soundtrack and a very densely layered sound mix.\r\n\r\nThe campaign itself is also flat out great. The story is fine but the real heart of the story is the friendship between the main character and the mech. Dialogue is nicely done, just enough banter without ever getting annoying.\r\n\r\nIt's too bad we never got a sequel to this, although it would probably have been on Unreal and looked and ran far worse than this. Still we'll always have Titanfall 2, which I expect will remain one an FPS high point for many years to come.\r\n\r\nDon't skip this one just because it's a few years old, it's still a phenomenal game from start to finish.",

From the second you wall-run into a slide, double-jump over a grenade, and drop a Titan from orbit like it’s your own personal meteor strike, you realize this game plays in a league of its own.\r\n\r\nThe combat is fast, fluid, and absurdly satisfying. Gunplay feels crisp, every weapon has personality, and the game somehow balances acrobatic pilots with gigantic metal death machines without breaking a sweat. One moment you’re zipping across rooftops like cyber-parkour royalty, and the next you’re stomping around in a Titan, turning enemies into glowing confetti.\r\n\r\nAnd let’s talk mobility — because wow. Titanfall 2 makes movement feel like a superpower. Wall-running, grappling, sliding… it’s so smooth that every other FPS feels a little sluggish afterward. Once you get the rhythm, it’s like the game plugs directly into your brain.\r\n\r\nThen there’s the multiplayer — yes, it's still alive, and yes, it’s still ridiculously addictive. Every match feels like a highlight reel waiting to happen. Even years later, the community keeps the game humming, and jumping into a lobby still feels like meeting old friends who all learned how to sprint on walls.\r\n\r\nTitanfall 2 is a modern FPS classic — overlooked, underappreciated, but endlessly fun. Whether you're dropping Titans, styling on enemies with acrobatics, or just living out your mech-pilot fantasy, this game delivers pure, high-octane joy from start to finish.\r\n\r\nRating 4.5/5",

The only two negatives I have to say is the incredible multiplayer is basically dead, campaign could've been slightly longer but essentially a masterpiece nonetheless.

I honestly don't remember the last FPS campaign I played other than battlefront 2 which I haven't even finished yet if you include the DLC😅, but Titan Fall 2's was quite enjoyable. The story was entertaining enough and trying out different kinds of titans was fun, although I ended up only really enjoying 3 in particular. Shooting people as pilot Cooper is also quite satisfying especially with fast guns, every time I would run low on ammo and have to switch to something on the ground I'd try to find something fast. My personal favorites were the Flatline and R-97. I haven't tried multiplayer much and what I did was without my controller so I was pretty trash and can't speak much of it, but it's probably very good based on what I've heard. Overall Titan Falls a pretty fun game👍\n\nAlso for anyone having trouble going full screen I found this random solution online.

I remember having a good enough time coming back to the campaign every so often, but this go around? Ugh...\n\nThe campaign's gameplay is painfully \"gamey.\" I know, that sounds like a nothing statement, but the novelty of stompy mech game clearly whitewashed much of my memory. 2025 me is just not okay with the amount of sterile \"this is a video game\" type moments.\n\nHere is obligatory too literal robot humor. Ha, funny. Here is the obligatory time travel level. Woo, go 2016. Here's the overblown \"mwa ha ha, we so EEE-Vile\" villains, complete with corporate mercenaries protecting the toxic waste facilities of their actual death chamber factory. I can't believe I can accurately write that statement, it's like the game was a parody of itself...\n\nThe gunplay is...adequate, but it's not really inventive. Going back, there aren't really fun guns. Just, the guns every game had at the time. Sure, they might have sci-fi skins, but here's the revolver! It revolvers. Here's the machine gun! It go dudda-dudda-dudda. There are a few neat guns, but nothing beats the carbine for me...in a setting with big, stompy mech battles...\n\nThe platforming is...functional? After playing Jedi Survivor, it's clear that Respawn is competent at hiding the seams of their platforming segments, but only just. What I mean is that...it's clear that this part is a ramp and it acts like ramps do. Here is the blatant roadblock to movement that must be double-jumped or wall-ran. It's functional, is what I'm saying. Not as blatant as, I don't know, Star Wars Outlaws going \"this is a yellow spot, so you can climb it\" type stuff, but not by enough to wow me.\n\nThe mech battles are fine, but again, not really excellent. It's just the Gears-core chunky boi shooter with a mech theme on it, almost completely separate from the too-mobile for its own good pilot combat. I never had a moment where I went...oh! That mech is hunkered down, let me get out and rodeo it as my pilot. I just shot it with my mech til it died. I never pined for my mech in a shootout. Any challenge was just \"oh! I died...darn. What got me? Some bull? Cool.\"\n\nI really like BT (the bot) and Cooper (the guy) and their interactions, but that's about all that really stuck with me after all of this time. The stuff that should be core memories of my time with the game just slide off of my neurons.\n\nThat's all the campaign. The multiplayer has been anemic since I started playing years ago, so I can't say much about it, other than that Respawn never figured out how to make pilots work as bots, so that's probably why they don't exist. In hindsight, that was probably why Titanfall 1 was multiplayer only, too.\n\nI don't hate the game. I'm not mad at it, but this has aged poorly for me and I have requested a refund, because I have zero interest in playing the game ever again. That doesn't take my fond memories of my time away from me or anything. I can still fondly recall staying up to beat the campaign when it first came out, even as I can appreciate that the game isn't as good as I remember.\n\nIf you don't have rose-tinted goggles for this, you can skip it. There's clearly a reason they never made a Titanfall 3 and it had nothing to do with a lack of interest for one.",

When that captain died, it was extremely forced and almost nonsensical. Neither he, nor the Titan had any observable substantial damage. Aside from missing batteries, which also made little sense.\n\n2. The shooting felt weird. Almost weightless, I guess, like there was no real impact force behind the bullets. Which is strange, because visually the enemies were exploding into pieces. It also sounded muffled, and playing with in-game and even system settings did not seem to change that. Both of these issues seemed to persists for multiple weapons, and even inside the Titan.\n\n3. Visuals... Hey, it looks amazing, I would not even guess it's from 2016, even if I did not know that. Runs at around 60 with periodic dips on ultra settings (one of the early cutscenes dipped to 12FPS somehow), even on 7900XTX. But problem is that it's just too detailed for my brain. I had similar issue with some multiplayer maps in F.E.A.R. especially some \"tropical\" one or whatever. So many little details, so many happening, and everything is so sharp, that it's borderline sensory overload for me, resulting in a very tiring experience of just trying to focus on something. Especially, if I am also to shoot while wall-running.\n\nWhile plot may get better at a later point, I doubt that the other 2 points will change, so I just got my Steam cards and removed the game.

To be fair, I do not know if my issue was caused by the EA app, or some hardware incompatibility, but when my PC crashed the first time and rebooted, the EA app tried to auto launch itself and gave me the message that its files are corrupted, or incomplete, or something like that, which makes me believe that the issue has occurred as a result of the EA app install.

As a new player there is no point even trying to learn, you will die on repeat with no chance to counter people who just have better loadouts, better movement, and almost 10 years of experience over you.\n\nI had fun on my first match then it was downhill from there. Poor hit reg felt like my bullets were just going through people and missing is so punishing if you miss a shot there is basically no chance for you to recover, you will die. hopping in a titan seemed fun, but you immediately become a target for everyone in the server, default titan doesn't have nearly enough damage output or survivability to be viable and is simply outclassed by everything else. You will get ganked, you will get blocked by teammates, and even when you outnumber or outsmart the enemy you will likely lose the fight purely because the default titan is just that bad. Not to mention I'm 90% sure I ran into a cheater in one of my matches, only one tho everyone else was fine just better. Not sure if cheaters are common but definitely annoying on your first play.\n\nI probably can't refund due to the hour of troubleshooting but I am going to try, this is just my honest review. I envy those who got to play nearly 10 years ago, I imagine this game would be great with no hardware issues, and an even playing field to learn in.\n\nSave yourself #1 the pain getting the game to work with consistent crashes on newer hardware #2 the sanity of playing against sweaty players while dealing with bad hit reg #3 the money spent on the game, $5 seems like a good deal, but there are many other games you could enjoy at that price point.",

I remember having a good enough time coming back to the campaign every so often, but this go around? Ugh...\n\nThe campaign's gameplay is painfully \"gamey.\" I know, that sounds like a nothing statement, but the novelty of stompy mech game clearly whitewashed much of my memory. 2025 me is just not okay with the amount of sterile \"this is a video game\" type moments.\n\nHere is obligatory too literal robot humor. Ha, funny. Here is the obligatory time travel level. Woo, go 2016. Here's the overblown \"mwa ha ha, we so EEE-Vile\" villains, complete with corporate mercenaries protecting the toxic waste facilities of their actual death chamber factory. I can't believe I can accurately write that statement, it's like the game was a parody of itself...\n\nThe gunplay is...adequate, but it's not really inventive. Going back, there aren't really fun guns. Just, the guns every game had at the time. Sure, they might have sci-fi skins, but here's the revolver! It revolvers. Here's the machine gun! It go dudda-dudda-dudda. There are a few neat guns, but nothing beats the carbine for me...in a setting with big, stompy mech battles...\n\nThe platforming is...functional? After playing Jedi Survivor, it's clear that Respawn is competent at hiding the seams of their platforming segments, but only just. What I mean is that...it's clear that this part is a ramp and it acts like ramps do. Here is the blatant roadblock to movement that must be double-jumped or wall-ran. It's functional, is what I'm saying. Not as blatant as, I don't know, Star Wars Outlaws going \"this is a yellow spot, so you can climb it\" type stuff, but not by enough to wow me.\n\nThe mech battles are fine, but again, not really excellent. It's just the Gears-core chunky boi shooter with a mech theme on it, almost completely separate from the too-mobile for its own good pilot combat. I never had a moment where I went...oh! That mech is hunkered down, let me get out and rodeo it as my pilot. I just shot it with my mech til it died. I never pined for my mech in a shootout. Any challenge was just \"oh! I died...darn. What got me? Some bull? Cool.\"\n\nI really like BT (the bot) and Cooper (the guy) and their interactions, but that's about all that really stuck with me after all of this time. The stuff that should be core memories of my time with the game just slide off of my neurons.\n\nThat's all the campaign. The multiplayer has been anemic since I started playing years ago, so I can't say much about it, other than that Respawn never figured out how to make pilots work as bots, so that's probably why they don't exist. In hindsight, that was probably why Titanfall 1 was multiplayer only, too.\n\nI don't hate the game. I'm not mad at it, but this has aged poorly for me and I have requested a refund, because I have zero interest in playing the game ever again. That doesn't take my fond memories of my time away from me or anything. I can still fondly recall staying up to beat the campaign when it first came out, even as I can appreciate that the game isn't as good as I remember.\n\nIf you don't have rose-tinted goggles for this, you can skip it.
