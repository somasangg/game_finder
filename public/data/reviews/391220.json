I feel bad, because that level of detail can really only be achieved with a slave workforce working crunch time 24/7 for 6 months.... but man does it show! Combat and platforming is as good as ever. Didn't play long, but I already know I'd love the game, based on what I saw, and its predecessor.\n\nSide-note, the intro ice climbing scene is so amazingly done and tense, but it's kind of funny, because the longer it goes it, the more it slips into farce, to the point where I was rolling my eyes. They really turned the dial up to 10 in every aspect of this game. Props.\n\nP.S. Lara you shouldn't dress like that in Syria.",

      "review": "A worthy 2nd part of the Reboot franchise, where Lara is caught in a war between Trinity and the village protectors, trying to find an ancient city buried in ice.\r\nThe mythology this game bases its story on is the orthodox religion, with byzantine elements, and also portrays the surroundings through different times during two big occupations: the mongolian invasion and the Soviet era camps and gulags.\r\nThe sequel expands upon the exploration of every area, offering many challenges, relics and documents to collect, and also a few firsts: side-missions and a shop. \r\nThe traversal can sometimes be a little bit annoying because some of it is really heavily scripted. You need to do some parts precisely how the game wants you to.\r\nUsing different mechanics with the same button is a good controlling efficiency, but sometimes it needs refining(mostly talking about swan dives challenge, which also are put in such positions that you have to backtrack a pretty long way to the ramp to try them again)\r\nNevertheless, the game rewards exploration and looting, having a good weapon and all the skills you can get from both leveling up and finding the tomb secrets can make a real difference towards the endgame.\r\nOverall, in my opinion the peak of the trilogy, highly recommend!",

I've put over 40 hours into this thing and beaten it two or three times, which for me says everything. This is the one where the series found its identity, gorgeous, confident, and set in one of the most atmospheric locations I've ever explored in gaming.\r\n\r\nThe snowy mountains of Siberia are just stunning. We're talking crumbling Soviet installations, abandoned Cold War machinery, and these massive, decaying structures that tell stories without saying a word. The whole setting has this haunting, isolated vibe that perfectly matches Lara's journey. You're not just platforming through pretty environments, you're crawling through history, through layers of forgotten expeditions and Soviet secrets. The atmosphere is unreal.\r\n\r\nGameplay-wise, this is where the reboot trilogy really clicked. The tombs are actually worth exploring, the combat feels weighty and satisfying, and the progression system keeps you engaged without feeling grindy. The mix of stealth, action, and puzzle-solving just works. And those optional challenge tombs? Chef's kiss. They're clever, rewarding, and exactly what I wanted from a game called Tomb Raider.\r\n\r\nThe story... look, it's fine. It's serviceable. It shows a different side of Lara and explores her family history, which adds depth, but it's not going to blow your mind. The characters are decent, the stakes feel real enough, and there are some genuine moments. But let's be real, you're here for the adventure, the exploration, and that incredible setting. The story supports that without getting in the way.\r\n\r\nGraphically, this game still holds up incredibly well. The snow effects, the lighting, the sheer detail in every environment, it's genuinely beautiful. I found myself just stopping to look around more than once.\r\n\r\nIf you're into action-adventure games, tomb raiding (shocking, I know), or just want to explore one of the most visually stunning and atmospheric settings in gaming, Rise of the Tomb Raider is it. It's the peak of the trilogy for me, and absolutely worth your time.",

If like me you couldn't deal with the camera shake in the previous game then rest assured you can skip to this one without missing out on too much story wise.\r\n\r\nI had a good time with this game. This one is much more open world than the Tomb Raider (2013), though weirdly divided up into areas as opposed to one big map even though most areas after the first two chapters are connected physically. The combat feels pretty good, though I played on the normal difficulty so I didn't ever really struggle with the fights. The exploration and puzzles were pretty good though, I even managed to get stumped a few times but never too much that I had to look up a walk through. This is a very pretty game, I found myself stopping and enjoying thew view on several occasions. It is not too long though, my play through where I did every side quest and all the optional crypts took me 15 hours.\r\n\r\nWhile the action sequences in the game always look spectacular I never found myself on the edge of my chair (so to speak) such as I have with similar sequences in Uncharted for example. Still fun just never felt like I was in too much of a rush even when the game wanted me to think I was. That might be a consequence of the open world allowing me to backtrack at almost anytime, who knows. There are still bugs here and there, though none were game breaking. Most commonly NPC's would default to A pose or an animation would fail to play and things would pop into existence blocking my path.

Most things happen almost the same way, and it really felt like I was playing the exact same game again — just with a few design changes.\n\nFor those who liked the first game, this one is basically more of the same, just more tedious.

The story is weak and predictable, and the exploration is terrible. I couldn’t even do more than 25% before feeling like I was wasting my time.\n\nOnce again, the game felt easy even on the hardest difficulty, but this time it was worse — not only was it easy, the combat was dull, and it often took around 10 bullets or arrows to kill a single armored enemy.\n\nOn top of that, the game feels like a copy of the first one. Most things happen almost the same way, and it really felt like I was playing the exact same game again — just with a few design changes.\n\nFor those who liked the first game, this one is basically more of the same, just more tedious. It’s also really annoying to finish the first game with all the gadgets (like the rope, lighter, and explosives), only to start this one and have to find everything again. Honestly, the exploration is awful until you finish the main story.",

She's excessive and wasteful. \n-Lara is always shivering cold while her enemies are looking very comfortable.

She has unlearned the agency she developed. I just do not know why this game was made or who it was made for. This review is negative but it's more like a 6/10.

In Tomb Raider, crafting resources were streamlined into one resource: scrap. Rise of the Tomb Raider separates things into a bunch of different resources, so you'll be running around killing the whole valley's deer population to make your bags bigger. While this does pad out the time, it also spreads the interesting action parts out. You can also unlock weapon variants, which while interesting, do the same thing of spreading things out.\n\n\"All filler, no killer,\" as my friend put it.\n\nTomb Raider starts with Lara getting shipwrecked and washing up on the island equivalent of Detroit.\nRise of the Tomb Raider starts with Lara traveling to Siberia to find God Juice while battling mercenaries and daddy issues.\n\nI just wanted to write this part because it sounded funny in my head.",

The only good aspect of this game is the breathtaking locations and beautiful art. Too bad they were too busy making great locations and forgot to fill them with anything meaningful, or create rewarding game-play to experience within them. Most forgettable predictable story. There is literally no reason to have stealth with how easy the combat is. The collectibles are straight out of a Ubisoft game. The skills seem to cater a lot to melee and stealth, but with how useless those mechanics are, it essentially makes 2/3 of the skill tree purposeless.",
