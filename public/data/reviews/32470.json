      "review": "Empire at War is a charming, janky, somewhat simplistic RTS from the golden age of Star Wars video games. \n\nCompared to the main RTS games of its day like Command and Conquer (The developers, Petroglyph, were former Westwood employees) the game is somewhat simplistic and small scale, with max unit limits, no tactical base building and active resource gathering, and a fairly strict rock-paper-scissors approach to gameplay. \n\nThe campaigns are charming, especially the buck-wild Forces of Corruption campaign, but the real draw is the freeform Galactic Conquest mode that offers the greatest scope and depth. \n\nLuckily, there are a number of ambitious total conversion mods that completely overhaul the game. Few people nowadays play the base game - everyone is playing their flavor of mod, where it's huge unit and map packs, gameplay refinements, scope increase, total conversions to other eras or sci fi universes, makeover into a 4X Lite, etc. \n\nThe biggest drawback is that as an old game in a to my knowledge no longer used engine, the game is jank and only grows more janky with time passing and mod functions slapped on top of it. Corrupted saves and crashes are the price to pay if you wanna get into the larger mods, and I have seen some strange bugs in my years of playing this game modded.\n\nAs a standalone game, it is pretty fun, but not worth 20 bucks or whatever the standard price. Luckily, as an old game it often goes on sale for less than 5 bucks. Get it on a discount. \n\nBut the mods alone make this a must-have inclusion in any SW or RTS fan's library.",

I came back to it recently to get my Star Wars fix - it's nice to have a Star Wars game that hasn't been EA-ified. Sure there are things which would be nice to have, and the pathing's a bit janky, but ultimately they're two drops of water compared to an ocean of positivity.

I killed three men one night on March 23rd 2009 at a local mom and pop shop in a secluded and rural part of town. for the sake of the owners of said shop and few residents surrounding I will not be disclosing any specific locations. As I was walking into the shop for groceries, one of the three men had approached me to bum a cigarette, I politely declined as I do not smoke. he seemed ill at the denial, but walked away back to the other two men. They all looked back at me with crude stares, like they were disgusted at me for having self discipline, I thought nothing of it so I went into the store to fetch groceries as I had planned to do. When I came back out, the three men grouped up tightly and followed me to my car. While I was loading my groceries, one goes to swing at me and I move out of the way just in time.
