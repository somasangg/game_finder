I do think the game is not in a great spot at the moment, I have been been playing fighting games for awhile so I believe that eventually the team will figure out balancing.  I do wish that side stepping worked differently.  Other than that I do feel like there are quite a few systems in this game so it is a ton to learn. \r\n\r\nOverall if you liked the older tekkens I would not go into this game expecting anything close to how those games felt.  I dont think its bad, just very different from the older games in the series.",

      "review": "TL;DR- Good outweighs the bad. Lots of great features and fun to be had if you put aside the small amount of issues. Heat system is a load of bullshit and ruins a lot of matches.\n\nI decided to update my review, as I have learned a lot since I originally posted it. Right off the bat, I just want to say it is painfully clear that the reason for most of the negative reviews is, \"It's not Tekken 7.\" Ok, so go play Tekken 7, it's right there.\n\nWith that out of the way, I want to address the actual issues I have with the game, the biggest of which isn't a problem with the game itself- it's the monetization.\nThere is no reason why a game that costs $60 should have paid DLC characters, with the exception of crossovers; and crossover characters should absolutely NOT be stronger than originals (*cough*Clyde*cough*). I got the game at an 85% discount, but this is a valid excuse for a negative review.\nThe second issue I have is with how weak defense feels in relation to damage output. It feels like characters do way too much damage across the board. It's not a case of \"if everyone is OP, nobody is.\" It's genuinely boring, because the matches feel rushed. I don't feel accomplished pressing one button to initiate a heat chain, just to follow it up with a combo that ends the round. It's not even annoying when it happens to me- it's just a really stupid mechanic. The craziest part is, I started playing AFTER they increased the max HP to 200. They need to either nerf damage across the board, or get rid of Heat chains.\n\nDespite that major gripe I have, the good outweighs the bad. For starters, the graphics are absolutely stunning, especially for this genre. The amount of detail in the character models and environment are genuinely beautiful, and it adds a special level of immersion.\nNext thing I really like is the Rage Art mechanic. It can completely change the outcome of a match, and it adds a level of strategy to both offense and defense that is genuinely exciting.\nThe Ghost Battle features are incredible. Wanna practice against that guy that just destroyed you in a set? Download his ghost data and go to town. Wanna fight YOURSELF? Pick one of your own ghosts and smash your monitor after you lose to yourself. The AI learning is really f*cking cool, and it will help you improve.\nThe replay system is another strong-suit. Can't figure out why you lost that match? Watch the replay and the game will pause it and tell you what you could have done differently at any given moment.\nI could keep going on and on about features like this, from learning combos, to a full blown story mode, the offline content is plentiful AND worthwhile.\nOnline is obviously why most people are going to buy it. The rollback netcode is great, the ranked grind is fun, and the Fight Lounge is actually really cool, and a great place to socialize in a PlayStation Home kinda way.\nAlso, boobs. Can't forget about boobs.",

A considerable leap forward in terms of graphics (developed using Unreal Engine 5), the rebirth of inherited mechanics revisited with more aggression, and a very powerful sound design. But above all, veterans will tell you that this game is completely different from previous instalments: gameplay that doesn't necessarily focus on punishment, but rather on gaining the upper hand through oppression, mix-ups (guessing the next move) and stances. Fans of the franchise will be delighted by the Story mode, which includes numerous references, and as a bonus, the Tekken Ball mode, which makes its return 26 years later. There are now additional quests to complete the story with the second season.\nFor online competition, you'll need to hang in there: Tekken is not an easy game to get to grips with, even with the basic knowledge required. You can get by, but keep in mind that progress can be very slow. It's still a legacy game. My advice: have fun without stressing yourself out, otherwise the fun may come from studying the fundamentals, and there's no way around that step.",

      "review": "Tekken 8 is a competitive 3D fighting game that advances the long-running series with refined mechanics, aggressive pacing, and a strong focus on character individuality. Built on Unreal Engine 5, it delivers high visual fidelity and fluid animations that enhance both readability and impact during matches. The game maintains Tekken’s core movement system while introducing new features designed to make offense more rewarding and dynamic.\n\nThe narrative continues the Mishima family conflict, centering on Jin Kazama’s confrontation with Kazuya. The story mode blends cinematic sequences with playable segments, emphasizing dramatic stakes and character motivations. While the plot follows familiar themes of power, legacy, and revenge, its presentation benefits from improved visuals and more cohesive mission structure.\n\nCombat remains deeply technical but leans further toward forward pressure. The Heat system is the centerpiece, granting characters temporary offensive boosts that expand combo routes, extend pressure, and enable new strategic layers. Rage Arts return as cinematic finishers, giving matches dramatic closing moments. Movement precision, punishment knowledge, and matchup awareness remain essential to high-level play.\n\nThe roster showcases a mix of returning favorites and newcomers, each with unique mechanics, stances, or signature techniques. Characters feel distinct without losing cohesiveness within the core system. Updates to move lists and animations improve clarity, allowing players to better recognize threats and react during fast exchanges. Customization options expand visual variety without affecting balance.\n\nOnline functionality features rollback netcode and a lobby system designed for smooth matchmaking. Ranked, quick match, and group play modes support competitive engagement, while training tools offer detailed frame data, scenario recording, and character guides. These resources make the game more approachable for new players without diluting its competitive depth.\n\nPresentation is a major highlight. Detailed character models, dynamic stages, and impactful hit effects contribute to a more visceral sense of combat. The soundtrack blends electronic, rock, and thematic stage tracks to match the intensity of matches and narrative tone. Visual clarity during high-speed sequences helps maintain focus despite the increased aggression of the new mechanics.\n\nTekken 8 succeeds by modernizing the series with an offense-oriented system, robust online features, and high production values. It preserves the strategic complexity that defines Tekken while offering tools and mechanics that encourage more active play. For veterans and newcomers seeking a refined, high-intensity 3D fighter, it stands as one of the most polished entries in the franchise.",

Its a joke. \n\nThe Season passes that include the characters and stages, unless you really want them day 1 and early access and you're a sweat in this game, buy it, if not then just wait till the end of the year till all out and even on sale I would say to get it. Otherwise it isn't worth it. \n\nI only started taking this game in the franchise seriously, i'm decent at best but even I can see the issues with this game. The rage arts, and the heat system. I do not know why this had to be added, at first in my/our two years worth of playing this game,  I thought this was a cool gimmick, something new, something that looks flashy yet does explosive damage but now as someone who plays rank and is raising in them slowly, I use them much less and I got rounds, matches even without using it. I'm pure hands mostly now. \n\nIn terms of the combat, i think its the best that its ever been actually, but I can say they made it too beginner friendly where even players who are in the top leagues complained about it and its true. IT IS EASYYY. The Special Style gets me mad as well, like just learn the game and the patterns and see what connects and doesn't. \n\nGraphics, this game visually is the best that its ever been and in many modern titles but one thing I found odd was some characters do look very doll like. Like Xiaoyu in the story mode, felt like her face barely moved to convey emotion. Bringing back Heihachi was a silly move too. Don't even get me started on the season 2 part.

      "review": "I have been playing this game since EVO '25 (August '25). My character that i chose to play was Clive (i know not the best choice) but i love FFXVI and Clive. So, i chose my character and played it.\n\nIt's been 93 hours and only characters i have played besides clive was Jun and it was after 90 hours.\nNow u would think that i had all fun with him as a character. It's not that case.\nThis season of tekken felt like the worst time to jump in. Every other character is like a 50-50 monster and unnecesary mixup tools with bullshit mechanics like heat and extra gimmick tools like enhancement tools for chosen characters. Like, who in the name of Namco would allow Heihachi to give this enhancement crap that activates on heat everytime instead of earning it. Who in Namco thought and got the idea through Harada and Murray and get it passed and get greenlit that Jun needs a GUN. Who thought that eddy gordo, the man who is known for his Capoeira needs a gimmick that allows him to get buffed.\n\nThen there is the season 2 effect that this game went through. You do not wanna fight 60-70% of this roster because of so much bullshit they get through. Whenever u fight a king he does the same crap and grab and get unnecesarry damage. Seriously, How is armour king more of a tekken character than King. Azucena gets this unnecesary parry and her heat smash being the most annoying thing ever. Whoever thought of making Paul's heat smash a low needs to be fired. Claudio with his gun that goes full screen and at the lowest level of Azucena's stage gets a guaranteed bounce is still monkey crap.\n\nThe customization has been the laziest in the series. Sure people can create Stryder Hiryu Lars or Eve Alisa or Ken/Ryu Jin/Kazuya or Heihachi as any ol man. But it is limited to there. How does clive not have any character portrait that can be shown at the vs screen? The collaborations are mostly logo or poster sticked to a Generic shirt/jacket and call it a day (Karate Kid movie as an example) Half the new costumes look either lazy or crap (cyber phantom suits look cool) and what with this trend of nerfing characters and giving players classic costumes in Tekken shop? Also who thought that buying the classics or any costume is as close to as buying a character? At least in battle pass they allow you to get some tekken coins which if you get through 2 passes you can get a discounted skin. So there is something known as Play2win (That's how i got the Tag 2 Jun costume)\n\nStages are very less varied that previous ones. Although they look great on a PS5 or even a base Series X (not to mention on PC) but these look less varied than T7. Maybe it's because there are less stages than 7 but even by look some stages get confused (although the Jun stage with trees and shit with no bounce and stage hazards is great).\n\nOverall i felt like i picked up the game at a wrong time but it is still worthy to play (especially if you buy on sale). It has great online experience and a ton of single player content. \n\nWHERE IS TEKKEN BOWLING AND LEI WULONG YOU FUCKING COWARDS AT BANDAI NAMCO????",

Practice mode is deep and gives you ample space to fine-tune your skills as this is a fighting game which takes a bit of labbing to get good at. Relatively quick loading times makes it easy to start getting into the game right away.\r\n\r\nThe actual fighting is...good in my opinion (I know fg enthusiasts and die-hards are really vocal about it online) and is definitely enjoyable, but could use a few tweaks here and there; with hitboxes and tracking being the main culprits. However, if you don't take the game TOO seriously when it comes to mechanics you're gonna have a fun time regardless, and that is enough for me.\r\n\r\nI recommend the Advanced Edition just for Eddy (DLC?!) and Heihachi.

      "review": "A very good TEKKEN game with some major flaws that let it down.\r\n\r\nOne of the major flaws being that the game is way too offensive now. Playing it smart and safe is dis-encouraged, and sometimes you are forced into unwinnable or near-impossible 50/50s purely due to pressure and the fact that you usually have to do some sort of maneuver to get out of the situation, leaving you vulnerable.\r\n\r\nEven worse is the disgustingly advantageous Special Styles. While I understand that, in higher ranks, this is quite counterable and not much of an issue (if it gets used at all), it can really unbalance the lower ranks and lower the skill gaps meaning a beginner with Special Style and a decent idea of the game's mechanics has an advantage over someone who prefers not to use it. This would be all right as an optional feature - but it is allowed in RANKED, with no option to filter it out!\r\n\r\nThe heat system is MEH, I wouldn't care if it was removed altogether but I haven't ever found it game-breaking or grossly unbalanced. I especially like the risk/reward factor that the Rage Arts bring to the game. And they are great to look at, although they can drag on sometimes.\r\n\r\nI feel this is why this game has become controversial amongst TEKKEN fans, mostly the competitive high-rank players. But I don't think this is so much the case for more casual or semi-serious players. The game offers plenty of Online and Offline content and doesn't feel unfinished.\r\n\r\nWhat the game partially lacks in substance it makes up for in style. TEKKEN 8 is by far the best looking TEKKEN game I have ever played. The character models look outstanding, the stages are gorgeous, and the amount of detail in ever corner of the game graphically is impressive. The visual effects during fights are maybe a little overdone, but it definitely looks flashy, and it feels responsive.\r\n\r\nI would recommend this game GENERALLY but there are some very major flaws that need to be ironed out. I can definitely understand people's point of view with the glaring issues in the game. If you are buying purely for story content and offline modes, there is a lot to be enjoyed. If you are a ranked player who is fairly competitive and high rank, and you are coming from a previous TEKKEN, do not set your expectations too high.",

This game is divisive among Tekken veterans because the defensive play has been nerfed, & generally the game is aiming to attract new players with flashier presentation & a focus on offensive pressure. In my opinion the game is best enjoyed with friends, or in \"group\" matches. Find players of similar skill & have fun. Ranked is not fun. At best it's 3 sets, but often an opponent will quit the match if they're losing bad or about to get a demotion. This even happens at intermediate ranks (where I stopped after around 120 ranked matches in over 1000 hours played). That & there are players running cheat scripts to auto duck, auto parry etc.\r\nWhat I like is that the game has a very good training lab- so there's no excuses for not improving your game.

It also feels accomplishing to finally consistently pull off a combo or move you've been struggling with for a while. I really enjoy the gameplay. However, I do agree with the other reviews here: the micro-transactions/DLCs are too much. Way too many characters and stages are locked behind a paywall, which can make it difficult to fully practice for tournaments if you're in the e-sports scene.

Rubber Banding Between Tekken king and Bushin has been hell especially when you're either fighting people who are really good and deserve it and people who play Tekken like a complete nuisance, truthfully I wish half the player base kinda died tbh because most of them have proven that they're VERY fraudulent.\n\nI've gotten almost 90 defense on this game but it feels like majority of things I encounter breach my defense a bit easier than it should, Characters like Anna, Lidia, Hwoarong, Jin, Asuka, Claudio, and VARIOUS others possess many things that have made this season unbearable. The amount of low options they posses, the severe lack of true critical thinking, mashable options that win in most interactions. I love Tekken but I'm despising Tekken 8 Season 2 as it is and I truthfully hope that when the long awaited patch of the gods comes around and really pushes forth defense instead of excessive offense that it cleans Tekken 8 whether it be this season or next season.",

The game needs more defensive options cause I'm not some sweaty no-lifer that dedicated their every waking moment to learning every fucking combo of the quickest fucking characters. God forbid they catch you cause you'll just be sitting in front of your screen watching them juggle the fuck out of you until you're dead for 3 rounds. \n\nIf you have friends to play with, it can be fun, and might be worth it.

It's both fundamentally and objectively worse than any other TEKKEN game. They don't even know what they're doing and it's showing. They're blatantly ignoring our request for balance changes, and instead would rather re-sell previous TEKKEN legacy costumes and remove even more customization features while they're at it and buff Asuka's tits. (Literally there was a patch to \"fix\" her bust size on the summer bikinis which had people thinking it was a balance change). TEKKEN 7 had long and strong combos too, but combos in TEKKEN 8 are at least BARE MINIMUM 15 second cutscenes with at least half of your health gone as you watch your opponent do the same combo every round, activating their heat burst, tornado, tailspin, character install, heat dash, only to get it again at the end of the combo. But I guess it's working if everyone tries to downplay their character's. The whole theme of the game with hope and aggression and always trying to one up the previous game is like something out of a 2D fighting game. If I wanted to play a game where I could burn meter to extend and enhance moves I would've went to go play an actual 2D fighting game, but with how the tracking and side stepping works in this game along with the previously mentioned features, it might as well is one. The changes to previously changed legacy knowledge, new features that they never needed like chip damage (and at one point they wanted the game to be so aggressive themed that you took chip damage from breaking throws, god forbid you have defense), heat meter, unique character installs, it's literally not TEKKEN anymore. They re-release DLC characters that were already DLC in TEKKEN 7 or are characters that are part of the base roster that should've been part of the base game. Half of the DLC characters for season 2 were literally the same characters from season 2 from TEKKEN 7. It's just a flimsy excuse to try and sell character's again with DLC privileges. Newest comer Mary Zo is a cool character, but she is not a TEKKEN character, and is someone ripped straight from Soul Calibur. They gave Ogre titties and made him a chick from Madagascar.

I haven't really played Tekken since Tekken 2 and 3 so my knowledge of the game is limited to those titles, so this review will be from that perspective, my friends who I played with also had not touched Tekken since 4 or 5, mostly playing locally.\n\nTekken 8 is a lot different than the earlier games, it is nostalgic seeing old characters* but they have changed visually, it is still great to see them again though in new and revived forms; and this game is visually impressive and runs well enough. \n\nThe gameplay is different in that it's not all about memorising moves and spacing, since now they have an easy mode that you can press that spams out moves and combos for you, again we all agreed not to use this, new players will bear the brunt of and with this feaure though.\n\nThere is also now heat and heat smashes, basically a limited resource per round that lets you do extra moves, more damage, or press a button that uses up all heat but performs an instant combo deleting a portion of the opponents health if it lands, again, not something we were proud of using but you get to smirk at them when it lands.\n\nThe least proud button that we didn't want to put people through (Or at least the animations are quite novel and cool to watch the first time around) is something called Rage, basically if you are low health you can press \"the funny button\", if this single strike hit lands the opponent has to watch as you perform a 20 second long cutscene that will remove over half of their health. Usually these don't land but if they do, boy they are going to *love* you so much.\n\n*Ah yes, the asterix, under characters...Yes charging players money for characters that are classically base game characters, they themselves being replaced mostly by characters that bore me or I haven't heard of, a lot of the roster was hit or miss for me but this is personal preference, there are definitely some new favourites of mine in tekken 8. \n\nThis game is heavy on the Item store, it will pop up every time you launch the game begging you to interact with the store, dlc and economy, in fact they released heihachi (An absolute Tekken staple) as DLC even though cannonically he was killed or something? That's fine, maybe? They advertised him in a youtube video which came with a cool map, whatever. Oh, god, the price...\n\n...Except you pay seperately for the map...Then you also pay for the character, they advertised them together so as to seem they are related, how, neat? This goes on and on. It's greedy. Traditionally core characters should not be DLC in my opinion, or they should not release for this title at all. But that's not my decision.\n\nI tried multiplayer for a bit, you know I work, I do other things. Apparently these people who I play against don't so I didn't bother playing against them that much. With that said there are other things you can do offline in Tekken so I applaud that, although the Singleplayer campaign is basically \"I hope you're a Jin main!\".\n\nOverall solid 6/10. A little over or on the fence, beautiful looking game but you feel dirty owning it or playing it. Obviously you can read up on other people's issues with this product but to me I felt a bit bad spending €60 on this only for my favourite character to get announced back then as DLC.\n\ntldr: im too old for this",

That f*cking monkey it's worst than Eddy mains.\r\nGot out and every lobby is full of her and as usual is a f*cking b*tch ass broken character as every other DLC character. The did that dirty like that on Tekken 7 too it was alright until the introduced the pay to win DLC's which gives you a giant advantage, no matter how good you are even the worst person in the planet can manage to deal you dmg with these characters. Talking about having way more range that you have and additionally doing way more damage too. It's unfortunate that this game failed my expectations. Was expecting them too learn from Tekken 7 and not make the same mistake again but when people are f*cking whales and giving money for stronger characters. Additionally the have characters that almost no one plays and they never added Kazumi Mishima which is such an iconic character within the Tekken series. Another one is Alisa there's so many people playing her and they added her on Tekken 8 too but what's the issue here. First of her move set is dogshit, close enough to Tekken 7 but worse and not to mention they made her ugly af like that's a complete downgrade in here. With that aside the game has lots of issues which needs to be fixed, you will see when you play it yourselves...",

      "review": "Tekken 8. A game series I played since I was a little kid. So pretty nostalgic about it (and bad at it :D )\n\nSo first thing first. This game is not worth it's asking price. The DLC's are super not worth the asking price. Characters like Heihachi should be base game content, no excuse allowed. Pure cash grab. DLC's never go on Sale. Despite the game seling pretty bad comapred to Tekken 7, the sale prices, if any, are still not there, where they should be. \n\nThat out of the way back to the game itself. And to make it short, it's bad. Like really bad. \nThe new heat machanic is game breaking and unfun. It's just a \"if you learn the combo and hit a launch you go from 100 to 0 health, tehe\" mechanic, no counterplay. It's gross how long the combos in Tekken 8 are. Every move tracks, so sidestepping is pointless more often than it should be. Characters have a bazillion moves and at the end every character can do similar stuff, because of it. Char identity is the worst ever in this game. I could go on and on, about the shortcomings of this game, but there are people who could make a better case then me, so I leave it at that. \n\nGame still can be fun, don't get me wrong, but not at these prices and with that shit DLC policy of Namco. It's just pure lazy cash grab with a side of \"Fuck the customer\".",

      "review": "Picked up Tekken 8 just the funny customization options, stayed because of Clive, dropped it because of how bad it feels to play. They toned down defensive play to force more aggressive matches, but in doing so almost punishes trying to be aggressive while keeping a decent defense. Hitboxes/hurtboxes that are either way too large than they need to be, moves tracking people on whiff, absolutely insane interactions with not just the stage(s), but also the camera, a whole season of no real changes/fixes/balancing for the sake of tournament events when the game badly needs it... \n\nSo much feels sacrificed for the beginner Tekken player experience, but being said beginner player (I have under 40 hours in Tekken 7 and one (1) in Tekken Tag 2) and playing more/getting better, it just feels awful to play. The \"hehe funny 50/50 gamble\" stops being funny when you're forced into coin-tosses every match, where losing the toss results in a combo that lasts so long you may as well be watching a cutscene. Characters with parries (shout-out my goat Clive) can parry some things, but other things break it, and it feels downright arbitrary as to why. Ditto to armored moves: some armored moves just break others for no reason other than \"because why not\". Getting hit by moves that are nowhere near you because the hitboxes in this game are absolutely massive for no reason other than... what, to make spectating more interesting? To make rounds end faster? Get a grip.\n\nIt's a fun game if you just run private matches with friends, and the character customization ([i]when it isn't locked behind a paywall[/i]) is neat (unless you play Kuma or Panda, in which case I'm so sorry), but other than that? Tekken 8 just feels like all style, no substance.",
