      "review": "I'm going to give this a reccomended because there is not a \"somewhat\" option for steam when reviewing. I also want to point out that while I only have 30~ hours on steam as of the time of writing, I do primarly play this game on phone and probably have around 150 hours in it in total. For what it is, this is a pretty decent gacha. The artstyle is cute, the battle mechanics are pretty linear but can be fun if you want to invest time in learning some more advanced strategies, and the simple role / element system for everyone is pretty cool and i enjoy it.\n\nThe problem is is that this game highlights some of the issues with Madoka Magia as a franchise. For one, honestly all this proves is how much better the original OG anime / wraith arc is compared to the rest of what came after with like, Magia Record / Oriko Magia / Scene 0 etc. If you are invested into reading the lore and enjoying the story, it [i] can [/i] be fun, but they are much weaker stories than the original run with the quintet.\n\nSecond off, I think this game has hugely unfair difficulty spikes if you aren't prepping with very specific Kioku in mind for each boss fight. Particularly in Nightmare Mode, Octavia (Mermaid Witch), Major Uwasa (Rumor of the Commoner's Horse), Roberta (Birdcage Witch) and Walpurgisnacht (Stage Witch) all feel incredibly unfair even with my solid core of Pluvia madoka / Coolmura / Sayaka / Mami / Felicia i had been running. Its bosses like this where the game very clearly wants you to have a specific 5 star for the fight that if you don't have makes it nearly impossible (ie: the game very clearly wants you to get Ren for Octavia, Kirika and Rena for Roberta) , etc etc etc. \n\nI think this game is also being very.. odd? with its selections. As of the time of writing, the game still hasn't released Nagisa, which I find incredibly odd because she very clearly would be an excellent healer in this game and shes just.. not here while the rest of the quintet / the girls from magia record are which is very odd, and the picks for who gets an alt or not is very weird to me. In particular, both Madoka and Mami has 3 total alts now, yet Kyoko still doesn't have one? (This particularly upsets me, as Kyoko is my favorite character in the franchise). Sayaka only has 1? The only magia record girl to get one is Iroha? I mean, i get it, but it is just a bit odd to me. \n\nI think if you love Madoka, and you enjoy it a lot and are deep enough that like, you'd read TDS and Wraith, enjoyed the anime a lot, watched the movies, etc etc you will find enjoyment in this. I love Madoka Magia (its one of my two favorite animes ever) , so obviously I have bias to it but if you just are a casual fan, I probably wouldn't recommend it. Its not for everyone and thats ok! Still a decent game!",

      "review": "Madoka Magica Magia Exedra lets you experience the MM anime through turn-based combat and huge boss battles that can take you out if you don't take your time to strategize your moves. This is an RPG that will punish you for using auto because of the priority to use skills and the way that skills consume skill points. Timing certain abilities and conserving resources to give your main attacker in your team comp the opportunity to strike for huge damage when enemies are broken is really fun and satisfying to do. Speaking of team comps, MAKE SURE YOU REROLL IF YOU WANT TO 100% THIS GAME.\r\n\r\nThe current limited banners are nothing to really gawk at so you can just go for the standard where you'll find the best characters for each role. I would suggest scouting for: Homura (ATK), Sana (DEF), Pluvia Madoka (BREAK), Ren (DEBUFF), KAEDE (HEALER)\r\n\r\nits not gonna be likely you'll get everything you want first ten pull so as long as you get Homura, you can stop rerolling and progress through game content to obtain gems to pull for the other 5 stars. priority should be: Homura > Pluvia Madoka > Sana > Ren > Kaede\r\nAgain, once you get Homura STOP REROLLING as the 4 stars are actually pretty good and are able to fill in the other roles until you can get the better 5 star characters. a 5 star attacker is TOP PRIORITY.\r\n\r\nanother thing: power level requirement doesnt mean jack. you could have 60k power and a boss has 75k and you still win. like i said, timing skills and setting up your main DPS for that big damage ult is your priority for clearing bosses and harder levels with ease.\r\n\r\nMadoka Magica Magia Exedra is defnitely worth playing if you enjoy the series, or just really like turn based combat reminiscent of Honkai Star Rail. although pretty grindy if you're F2P,  especially with the new gear system they implemented known as the crystalis, you dont rlly need to worry about 'building' characters to clear the story outside of levelling up your character's skill tree, having good portraits (gear with specific stat boosters), and support characters under each of your units that provide more stat buffs. Ignore the crystalis until the endgame if you feel yourself struggling with the nightmare difficulty stages. \r\n\r\nOne final piece of advice for achievement hunters, get this on your phone. im serious. getting your dailies in consistently guarantees a healthy flow of gems, upgrade materials, and much more you'll need to upgrade your characters to minimize roadblocks while completing the main story. If you are feeling stuck at any point i suggest watching this youtuber for advice as he creates top quality Exedra content for new and veteran players alike.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExTsZZAf6u8",

      "review": "I never write reviews but a lot of the negative one's points are either willfully ignorant or flat out lying. But either way there's a decent amount of bad faith so I wanted to give my honest thoughts, as a Madoka fan, someone who played on launch and hated it after a month, and a general consumer.\n\nIf gachas are not for you, obviously this game is not going to please or interest you in the slightest. I am at the very least able to stomach the disgustingly capitalist business model if the game is enjoyable enough. But I do agree the gacha business model is objectively anti consumer and should stop, and it is inevitable that things like power-creep will get this game if it lives long enough. however I do not think that automatically makes this game a waste of time or even bad. I think if executed right, it could have some serious potential for a lot of the lesser loved or known spin offs as well as its own story.\n\nOne thing I’ve seen that’s boggled me on multiple occasions is the \"critique\" that the game is redundant for recapping the original series and the lack of original stories. Any reviews that say the latter should flat out not be taken seriously as the game’s original stories have been advertised since before launch. but to address the first point, yeah duh it went over the original story, I understand the fatigue, trust me, of the original holy quintet I literally only care about Madoka and Homura and would dare say despite the others being shoved down our throat they do not have nearly as much of the thematic depth and character like many of the magia record cast, no shade. But it just would not make any sense to entirely leave out the literal nexus point of the series, and more so, at this point Madoka is not what it once was, and it makes sense to me at least. That this game might possibly be a starting point for some people or even just nice for someone who needs a reminder.\n\n\nThis game had a rushed and botched launch that lost a lot of good faith due to the really nasty delay, but I think the changes in structure and the base business model of this game is LEAGUES better than what Magia Record put us through. Now a different bad game being worse does not make this game automatically good, however given just how greedy and disgustingly paced magia record was (even outside of the botched NA release) I think it’s fair to at least consider this game in good faith. \n\nOn launch the game’s most glaring issues were 1. The lack of content. 2. The rate at which units were being released, 3. Gem income, 4. A poor spark system with no pity, 5. The dungeon exploration, and 6. The weird item expiration. Sadly some of these are not fixed but for the most part they have been addressed in some way.\n\nWe have just reached half anniversary and we’ve had 3 game modes added with the main guild features still yet to drop so it’s safe to say more is coming. Although who cares about stuff to do if the game play isn't fun. I don’t have much to say about this though as it is entirely subjective to a certain degree, but I am someone who earnestly loves a turn based battle system, does this have nearly half the depth of say SMT or Final Fantasy, no of course not, and I honestly do not blame people for finding it boring. But if you are anything like me and do enjoy team crafting and attempting challenging content, I think the game's simple approach to the class system and the equip and support kioku system still manages to be fun and interesting especially if you like these characters. But how easy is it to get characters?\n\nThis is kind of a mixed bag, the gacha system is by no means the kindest or even fair, but even still in an era where gacha games remain very popular and successful we have seen certain practices that are pretty much a given for any new big budget mobage slop. Even magia record, had things like making dupes nearly required and having an entire separate equip banner system you would pull on. I think Exedra’s system as it currently works is fine* The 200 pull spark system should seriously be lowered to at most 150. But the post launch added pity system they have added is nice. 50 pulls gets a key you can keep (for a bit more on that garbage later) and 100 gets a free guaranteed 5 star pull. Not ideal but in an era where these games hold the player by the metaphorical balls and squeeze, I think it was a very pro consumer choice to over haul and add a pity system. Every girl who isn't limited (anniversary or seasonal holiday units so far) is added to the general pool after a month (should be less) at the rate they were going on launch none of this would matter as the breakneck pace left everyone dissatisfied myself included, but they have since slowed down to much more tolerable pace. Dupes still unlock certain skills and things but I have an army of 0 ascension girls that are still absolutely able to keep up with my 4 or 5 Ascension ones.\n\nHow good are the units if they are general and how easy is it to just pull in general though? Well thanks to the added content it’s pretty easy to stock up on keys and key shards for free pulls, nothing crazy generous and tbf I am absurdly lucky in these games so my view is skewed but compared to the general rest of the scene, it feels like I get a decent amount of 5 stars especially during campaigns and special events. And in general all of the 5 star units are at least usable (the madoka the game gives you isn't really) and in fact a decent few are better than the 2 limited units we have, but generally everyone fits in and has a niche that they can do, that makes team building fun, some are more heavily dependent on certain comps but when everyone is a general unit, you’re bound to get them eventually. The base launch madoka (not the gifted one) is still considered to be the best unit in the game.\n\nNow here are some issues that persist, while I think the labyrinths are cool and it’s awesome we get such detailed renderings of them. They are objectively useless from a game play perspective and to be honest I barely notice them anymore. Definitely a bad mark for the game, I have no idea why they ever advertised it beyond aura farming. But the modeling of enemies in this game is spectacular, the way the witches are presented are a knock out of the park, you can tell with some of the witches they graphic artist put a lot of care and detail into them, which is much more preferable to the mobage chibi slop style of magia record. Same goes for the girls themselves although the cell shading can make some of the girls designed by other artists seem a bit…..bleh. The other huge critique the mind boggling item expiration, a lot of items that should not be able to expire can. Such as keys for summoning or shards for 5 star keys. I feel like I have an idea of why they put it in but it is far too redundant and frankly it’s scummy so I do hope they redo or adjust that.\n\nTLDR: They addressed a lot of issues the game had on launch, People saying there’s no original content are flat out wrong, and despite some rough flaws in the item and exploration system, I think the game is decently fun enough, I vastly enjoy the team building and story, and I am elated at the opportunity to experience previously Japanese only stories in a higher budget format, as the content we’ve seen already has been decently high quality (magia record arc 2 I’m so ready almost there)\n\n(Edit)\nA reply to this review did touch on some points i neglected to speak about, not on purpose to make the game look better just wasn't thinking about it. but definitely should be considered as I agree that the passive gem income is abysmal and they should have just standardized the labyrinth rewards based on length, so thank you for mentioning it!",

The 3D character models for battles are quite good, and characters at the same rarity level are fairly well balanced for usability.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, there is not much to keep the interest of general gacha game players.

TL/DR: if you are't a huge Madoka fan or interested in the story, just play a different game. there are plenty of other gachas out there and this one isn't even as fun as the last one that they took down the servers for.\r\n\r\nFirst: for fans of the series\r\nI picked this game up because i was a huge fan of the last game, Magia Record, but the servers for that game were shut down before i finished the game and this is the only way for me to get to finish the story. This game starts off with a recap of the original story, then expands into all the side stories, with additional stories added on as limited time events that you can slowly reactivate one at a time with each new event. if you are a fan of the series as a whole, this game is a decent way to get to explore the expanded series without needing to hunt for manga and places to find any OVAs that are not easily accessable in the west. If you would rather see things happen with more detail visually, go read the manga and watch the OVAs. \r\n\r\nSecond: The game play is not great, the core loop is basic strategy. build your team and do a turn based fight with a normal attack, special attack, and ultimates that you build up. there are more indepth games out there. for the more interesting stuff, It takes way too long for you to actually build up enough characters and skills where you actually get to figure out min/max combos of character/picture/supports in your teams and even then, it takes even longer just to unlock all aspects of your team. On top of that, getting to learn about each character is entirely dependent on RNG (it's a gacha after all). \r\n\r\nfinal synopsis: I like the game, warts and all, I like the stories and the characters and am willing to look past the relatively bland game play and just enjoy what it's really about... Little girls in a cruel, grim dark world slowly learning about the horrors of being magical girls and the true cost of having their wishes granted. If you are the type of person that wont tolerate gacha games and cant stand needing to either pay a lot or rely on luck for the best characters, or cant stand boring game play just to read a less interactive visual novel, then there are better things for you to do with your time and i wont fault you for it. However, if you like visual novels and are willing to wade through the not so great parts of this game, then its worth picking up and playing through the chapters in your free time.",

The gacha elements aren't nearly as bad as some other games so it's much easier to play in my downtime, too.\r\n\r\nRight now it's more of an anthology of everything canon-adjacent in the Madoka universe, so If you've seen everything Madoka Magica and Magia Record had to offer and are looking for new content involving actual plot progression rather than side stories focused on certain characters, you might be left hanging for awhile.",

Got to get through all the \"how do's\" and what not. The first story is a nightmare to go through, Its just the show. 100%. Nothing new or different. If you really want to give this game a chance you have to push yourself through the first story.\n\nI will say after you get through the first story and you get a good group. The game can be nice and fun. I enjoy the fun side stories and the new characters. Some stories really got me hooked. They can be from cute to down right 'I'm in bed crying over a green hair girl who just wants to watch movies!' Just like any other AFK games, there are raids, challenges, pulls, Tower climbs, and all that fun stuff. I have this game for my Phone as well and been playing it since day one really, only got the PC version for casual play. \n\nIs this game for everyone. Heck no. \nIs it a game for all Madoka fan. Heck no.\nBUT I will say, If you read the mangas. You will enjoy this game. I only think this game is here for explain and explore the world of Madoka Magica.",

However, Exedra is doing a great job with summarizing the Puella Magi franchise, and I was surprised that there was even a side story for Oriko Magica. Let's hope they add Kazumi Magica in the near future as well. \n\nThe gameplay is turn-based, and some fights (such as boss fights on nightmare difficulty) require some strategy. I also like that the 3* and 4* characters aren't useless and that it's possible to complete the story as a free-to-play player. \n\nUnfortunately, diamonds are very hard to get. If I compare Madoka to Umamusume or Infinity Nikki, I'd say the developers are very greedy with diamonds. But sometimes we get free pulls, so there are opportunities to unlock new Magical Girls.",

      "review": "I'm going to give this a reccomended because there is not a \"somewhat\" option for steam when reviewing. I also want to point out that while I only have 30~ hours on steam as of the time of writing, I do primarly play this game on phone and probably have around 150 hours in it in total. For what it is, this is a pretty decent gacha. The artstyle is cute, the battle mechanics are pretty linear but can be fun if you want to invest time in learning some more advanced strategies, and the simple role / element system for everyone is pretty cool and i enjoy it.\n\nThe problem is is that this game highlights some of the issues with Madoka Magia as a franchise. For one, honestly all this proves is how much better the original OG anime / wraith arc is compared to the rest of what came after with like, Magia Record / Oriko Magia / Scene 0 etc. If you are invested into reading the lore and enjoying the story, it [i] can [/i] be fun, but they are much weaker stories than the original run with the quintet.\n\nSecond off, I think this game has hugely unfair difficulty spikes if you aren't prepping with very specific Kioku in mind for each boss fight. Particularly in Nightmare Mode, Octavia (Mermaid Witch), Major Uwasa (Rumor of the Commoner's Horse), Roberta (Birdcage Witch) and Walpurgisnacht (Stage Witch) all feel incredibly unfair even with my solid core of Pluvia madoka / Coolmura / Sayaka / Mami / Felicia i had been running. Its bosses like this where the game very clearly wants you to have a specific 5 star for the fight that if you don't have makes it nearly impossible (ie: the game very clearly wants you to get Ren for Octavia, Kirika and Rena for Roberta) , etc etc etc. \n\nI think this game is also being very.. odd? with its selections. As of the time of writing, the game still hasn't released Nagisa, which I find incredibly odd because she very clearly would be an excellent healer in this game and shes just.. not here while the rest of the quintet / the girls from magia record are which is very odd, and the picks for who gets an alt or not is very weird to me. In particular, both Madoka and Mami has 3 total alts now, yet Kyoko still doesn't have one? (This particularly upsets me, as Kyoko is my favorite character in the franchise). Sayaka only has 1? The only magia record girl to get one is Iroha? I mean, i get it, but it is just a bit odd to me. \n\nI think if you love Madoka, and you enjoy it a lot and are deep enough that like, you'd read TDS and Wraith, enjoyed the anime a lot, watched the movies, etc etc you will find enjoyment in this. I love Madoka Magia (its one of my two favorite animes ever) , so obviously I have bias to it but if you just are a casual fan, I probably wouldn't recommend it. Its not for everyone and thats ok!

      "review": "Madoka Magica Magia Exedra lets you experience the MM anime through turn-based combat and huge boss battles that can take you out if you don't take your time to strategize your moves. This is an RPG that will punish you for using auto because of the priority to use skills and the way that skills consume skill points. Timing certain abilities and conserving resources to give your main attacker in your team comp the opportunity to strike for huge damage when enemies are broken is really fun and satisfying to do. Speaking of team comps, MAKE SURE YOU REROLL IF YOU WANT TO 100% THIS GAME.\r\n\r\nThe current limited banners are nothing to really gawk at so you can just go for the standard where you'll find the best characters for each role. I would suggest scouting for: Homura (ATK), Sana (DEF), Pluvia Madoka (BREAK), Ren (DEBUFF), KAEDE (HEALER)\r\n\r\nits not gonna be likely you'll get everything you want first ten pull so as long as you get Homura, you can stop rerolling and progress through game content to obtain gems to pull for the other 5 stars. priority should be: Homura > Pluvia Madoka > Sana > Ren > Kaede\r\nAgain, once you get Homura STOP REROLLING as the 4 stars are actually pretty good and are able to fill in the other roles until you can get the better 5 star characters. a 5 star attacker is TOP PRIORITY.\r\n\r\nanother thing: power level requirement doesnt mean jack. you could have 60k power and a boss has 75k and you still win. like i said, timing skills and setting up your main DPS for that big damage ult is your priority for clearing bosses and harder levels with ease.\r\n\r\nMadoka Magica Magia Exedra is defnitely worth playing if you enjoy the series, or just really like turn based combat reminiscent of Honkai Star Rail. although pretty grindy if you're F2P,  especially with the new gear system they implemented known as the crystalis, you dont rlly need to worry about 'building' characters to clear the story outside of levelling up your character's skill tree, having good portraits (gear with specific stat boosters), and support characters under each of your units that provide more stat buffs. Ignore the crystalis until the endgame if you feel yourself struggling with the nightmare difficulty stages. \r\n\r\nOne final piece of advice for achievement hunters, get this on your phone. im serious. getting your dailies in consistently guarantees a healthy flow of gems, upgrade materials, and much more you'll need to upgrade your characters to minimize roadblocks while completing the main story. If you are feeling stuck at any point i suggest watching this youtuber for advice as he creates top quality Exedra content for new and veteran players alike.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExTsZZAf6u8",

I do wish that the union function didn't have such a long wait time to be able to do stuff because it takes away from actually being in a union in the first place.

There's currently no use for them besides getting the rewards for being in one, as there's no form of communication in it either.\n- The gatcha portion...

      "review": "I've been playing this game since it came out, first on the mobile and then migrating to the Steam version once it became available. I've maxed my level, hoarded vast quantities of materials, completed every event and cleared almost every bit of game content. I've loved the Madoka characters and setting for a long time and desperately want a great game in the setting and something to keep the property fresh and relevant in the public consciousness, but this just isn't it.\n\nFirst, if it wasn't already obvious, this is a gacha.  What characters you get are entirely at the mercy of RNG, as are their stories.  The odds for the girls most people would be here for aren't very good and opportunities for any significant quantities of free rolls are sparing.  This is, of course, in service to wanting to push players to have to spend money to get what they're here for.\n\nIn terms of story, all of the story in this game is a rehash of other mediums.  The main campaign consists of retreading the source Madoka Magica anime, the Magia Record Gacha game, the Scene Zero Magia Record Gacha Event, and the Wraith Arc and Oriko Magica mangas.  They have in the past couple months added one original story, but, frankly, it is bad. Much like Scene Zero before it from their previous game, they have taken an existing slice of the story and shoehorned their OC into it as a hypercompetent best friend of everyone Mary Sue style.  \n\nSpeaking of creative bankruptcy, we need to talk about their units. Off the top of my head, without counting, there are approaching but not quite reaching a hundred different units in the game. I say different and not unique because that would be lying. First and foremost, the groupings are broken up into three, four, and five stars as is gacha standard.  There is no progression between them, but, instead, all three and four star units are the same characters, just of the 20ish 3 stars, 17 or so of them have a four star variant with a different attack and not even cosmetic differences.  The five stars demonstrate about the same level of creativity with characters such as Madoka and Mami having four units each, Homura and Sayaka having three, Kyoko, Alina, Iroha, and Mabayu having two each, keeping in mind we're still within the first year after release and already deep into version retreads.  Due to game design as well, some girls are just plain useless even at five star.  For example, Felicia is the one character capable of inflicting the powerful stunned condition, in theory, except that after the midway point every single enemy is immune to or so resistant they might as well be immune to stun, making her unusable.\n\nLikewise you unlock portraits as the game goes on, basically bonuses you can attach to a character that will improve their stars and give them a specific bonus.  The fact of the matter is the vast majority of these are worthless and you will find yourself reusing the same half dozen or so portraits on everyone that offer the largest boosts to speed, attack, defense, and magic recovery.  Similarly, you can unlock Crystalis bonuses for characters through completing upgrade quests. These are extremely grindy and again, the vast majority of the potential prizes are useless and mostly serve as testament to your luck or willingness to hit the 'retry' button day after day to get a good one.\n\nOn a similar thread, the battle system can be pretty repetitive.  Walpurgisnacht is the boss of several of the different subcampaigns and with very rare exception progressing through the stories involves fighting the same monster over and over again with slightly higher numbers each time. Witches can be a bit varied in the campaigns and some of them can benefit greatly from thinking outside the box and often times a specific ability of a four or three star girl might make a fight much easier than throwing a stronger five star at the problem.\n\nThat said, a lot of the witches, especially for things like raid links, battle towers, and score attacks, amount to just enormous masses of hit points with some gimmick tacked on.  Most of those gimmicks are annoying rather than engaging, such as requiring you do your damage on even turns for the witch with no way to tell what turn it is on, requiring you hit it a certain number of times between turns making only characters with multiple attacks useful to the exclusion of all others, being able to ignore your defensive barriers and damage you directly, etc. This seems to be designed to push people to spend money to roll for whatever the newest girl they've added is as she will invariably be keyed to whatever the current challenge is.\n\nThe PVP system isn't better and requires you to have the one true team to be competitive.  If you don't have at minimum Time Stop Homura and Hollow Woman Mabayu, there is no reason to even try.  To hit upper levels you also need Tiro Finale Mami and Pluvia Madoka and have all of them at descent ascension ratings.  Compounding the issue is the rerolling for PVP matches button simply doesn't work, usually cycling between the same 2-3 players in a range that can be dozens wide ad infinitum except for the lowest points.\n\nNot to say it is all bad - the collection of music from the franchise all in one place is great with a couple of really glaring omissions in Connect and Magia.  Visually it looks pretty good and the staff at least has been responsive so far to a lot of feedback, introducing more skips and other features to respect players time rather than make them sit through the same battles a billion times again (something they will hopefully bring to Crystalis Battles).  Material management isn't awful, especially by late game you'll find yourself with enough resources to nearly max out every four and five star character with the exception of their special attacks needing the unfortunately rare magic tomes. The home screen is now customizable with background and girl which is a fun little touch.\n\nStill, on the whole, this game needs a lot of work and a change of design philosophy away from trying to wring every last dime out of people for rolls to participate and towards making them want to give money to something they enjoy, away from reprinting old stories and characters towards new and creative content, and away from niche gimmicks in gameplay and towards fun core mechanics to give Madoka fans the game they deserve.",

And then you walk in another straight line to the end of the level. With cutscenes and dialogue in the middle that are just a stripped down version of the anime.\n\nIt’s just…really boring to play. The story is good because the story of the anime is good. But you could just watch the superior version and experience the story that way. \n\nThere are some nice side stories that are unique to the game but it’s not worth sitting through all the gameplay just to experience them (my time on Steam is about half of what I played on mobile, which shares progress). \n\nThe gacha elements aren’t actually too bad, surprisingly, and you can usually get your preferred characters in their banners by participating in all the content.\n\nI really wanted the game to succeed as we need more magical girl content but the gameplay just isn’t there.",

I don't think this IP lends itself well to a gacha game. The gameplay itself feels very slow and grindy and it basically plays itself in many ways. I don't think it's free to play friendly. The art is really beautiful ( sometimes, more on that later ), but then again most of it is revisiting the show or movies or spinoffs -- in other words, the same stuff we've already seen. Don't get me wrong, it's fun to take a walk down memory lane with what we are already familiar with however if you're expecting something new or a different story from what I can tell there's very little of it. \n\nOne thing I notice about this game is how it feels like a lot of different things mashed together. Even certain girls feel like they're done in different art styles and honestly, some of them are very ugly. The gameplay also feels altogether pretty clunky and janky in my opinion. It's a gacha game and all but I can't see how anyone really has fun with this gameplay loop and wants to stick with it for a while. I felt like I already saw everything there was to see in my time with it. I feel like this concept would have lent itself well to just a jrpg rather than a gacha game. It somewhat reminds me of the [i]Persona 5[/i] gacha game where I feel like it rides high off of nostalgia and having a recognizable IP to draw inspiration from and then kind of loses it from that point on.",

Definitely a game that makes me wish there was a 'so-so' vote option.\n\nFor one, I think this game really highlights how much better the OG series is compared to literally everything that came after it. Oriko Magica and Magia Record are both here and are kind of mediocre as stories. All the event quests have disclaimers on them that basically amount to 'this is basically fanfiction lol, we're not even going to pretend this is canon'. There's an entire main story section dedicated to 'here's the OG series again but we've added our own original character to the mix. It's fine because she gets deleted from existence at the end of it so it doesn't mess with canon'. \n\nThat's not a spoiler, it's built into the framing device used to justify it as a prequel.\n\nThere's actually a seed of a fun combat system here, for the few times that you actually need to use it. It's an obvious descendant of the Honkai Star Rail style of turn-based combat, where everyone gets a basic attack, a special, and an ult that doesn't use a turn. There are a few characters that have fun turn-manipulating abilities, most of which stack and cause fun things to happen. Problem is, this is a gacha game so the vast majority of the time you are either wildly overlevelled and can just auto-combat or you have hit a wall that you need to grind to get past.\n\nIn all it's a game that every time I open it up I wish it was better than it actually is.

It offers no unique content at all besides some cool art to look at (which sure, is very on point as is expected from the Madoka Magica universe, but a shiny coat of paint alone does not make a fulfilling game). \n\nThe 'gameplay' (and I see that with great generosity) consists of rolling the gacha lottery for characters, and watching the game on auto which lacks just enough to prompt the player to tap every few seconds, battles fight themselves, the character upgrade system is basically pointless, and the levels are just watching a character auto-run through a decorated hallway, there are maybe two or three animated cutscenes in the entire game.  For the rare characters (notable characters from the show+spinoff) they have 2d art, 3d models, and a cool cutscene for their special attack, but you can see all of that on youtube without having to grind and gamble. \n\nThe only people who are going to play this game are people who are already fans of the show, people who are very quickly going to realise there is nothing on offer here because the game's story is literally just a worse version of the show. You run through the exact same storyline but instead of watching the original animated series we all know and love, its jpegs of the characters with text boxes. And if there is for some reason someone who is being exposed to the Madoka Magica universe for the first time through this game, please uninstall it and watch the original show.

The gameplay is very dull - your character walks (automatically if you choose) in a straight line to a battle. Auto battle can be used if you want. And then you walk in another straight line to the end of the level. With cutscenes and dialogue in the middle that are just a stripped down version of the anime.\n\nIt’s just…really boring to play. The story is good because the story of the anime is good. But you could just watch the superior version and experience the story that way. \n\nThere are some nice side stories that are unique to the game but it’s not worth sitting through all the gameplay just to experience them (my time on Steam is about half of what I played on mobile, which shares progress). \n\nThe gacha elements aren’t actually too bad, surprisingly, and you can usually get your preferred characters in their banners by participating in all the content.\n\nI really wanted the game to succeed as we need more magical girl content but the gameplay just isn’t there.",

Expect random FPS drops and stutters, because this a mobile port; it's almost certainly running on an emulator trying to pretend its a mobile phone, to then try and run a game with kernel-level anticheat. It's frankly kind of doomed on that front.\n\nThe gameplay loop is barely present; you 'explore' dungeons automatically with no player input, and the battles can just be auto'd and ignored. There's basically nothing here. It's a gacha game with gacha game levelling mechanics; you level your units indepedent of the stages you play, so either you steamroll on the first turn or you faceplant a stat-wall. There is no inbetween. There never is with these games.\n\nInbetween the battles you often get little VN segments... but so far all these have been is Live2D sprites in a very different artstyle intercut with stills taken directly from the anime series. It's... jarring. No attempt has been made to try and rework the anime's scenes to better fit VN presentation, in fact I'm quite sure they're actually re-using the anime's voice-acting. This game is a goddamn awful way to experience the original series, so you haven't seen it, just... watch it. Don't play this game to do it instead. They would have been better off including the original episodes wholesale, or using the game's 3D models instead of the Live2D sprites (it would have kept the artstyle more consistent at least). There's so many bad decisions in this game.\n\nAs for its original story, it's... eeeeh. It's largely just a framing device for an amnesiac protagonist to rewatch the original show. It tries to set up an air of mystery, but we're never going to get answers anyway. Not before the servers inevitably shut down.\n\nEvery previous online Madoka game inevitably got shuttered. MagiReco was far more successful, and even that got shuttered to make way for this game. This game is not going to last. Don't waste your time and money.",

I don't think this IP lends itself well to a gacha game. The gameplay itself feels very slow and grindy and it basically plays itself in many ways. I don't think it's free to play friendly. The art is really beautiful ( sometimes, more on that later ), but then again most of it is revisiting the show or movies or spinoffs -- in other words, the same stuff we've already seen. Don't get me wrong, it's fun to take a walk down memory lane with what we are already familiar with however if you're expecting something new or a different story from what I can tell there's very little of it. \n\nOne thing I notice about this game is how it feels like a lot of different things mashed together. Even certain girls feel like they're done in different art styles and honestly, some of them are very ugly. The gameplay also feels altogether pretty clunky and janky in my opinion. It's a gacha game and all but I can't see how anyone really has fun with this gameplay loop and wants to stick with it for a while. I felt like I already saw everything there was to see in my time with it. I feel like this concept would have lent itself well to just a jrpg rather than a gacha game. It somewhat reminds me of the [i]Persona 5[/i] gacha game where I feel like it rides high off of nostalgia and having a recognizable IP to draw inspiration from and then kind of loses it from that point on.",

Oriko Magica and Magia Record are both here and are kind of mediocre as stories. All the event quests have disclaimers on them that basically amount to 'this is basically fanfiction lol, we're not even going to pretend this is canon'. There's an entire main story section dedicated to 'here's the OG series again but we've added our own original character to the mix. It's fine because she gets deleted from existence at the end of it so it doesn't mess with canon'. \n\nThat's not a spoiler, it's built into the framing device used to justify it as a prequel.\n\nThere's actually a seed of a fun combat system here, for the few times that you actually need to use it. It's an obvious descendant of the Honkai Star Rail style of turn-based combat, where everyone gets a basic attack, a special, and an ult that doesn't use a turn. There are a few characters that have fun turn-manipulating abilities, most of which stack and cause fun things to happen. Problem is, this is a gacha game so the vast majority of the time you are either wildly overlevelled and can just auto-combat or you have hit a wall that you need to grind to get past.\n\nIn all it's a game that every time I open it up I wish it was better than it actually is.

      "review": "I've been playing this game since it came out, first on the mobile and then migrating to the Steam version once it became available. I've maxed my level, hoarded vast quantities of materials, completed every event and cleared almost every bit of game content. I've loved the Madoka characters and setting for a long time and desperately want a great game in the setting and something to keep the property fresh and relevant in the public consciousness, but this just isn't it.\n\nFirst, if it wasn't already obvious, this is a gacha.  What characters you get are entirely at the mercy of RNG, as are their stories.  The odds for the girls most people would be here for aren't very good and opportunities for any significant quantities of free rolls are sparing.  This is, of course, in service to wanting to push players to have to spend money to get what they're here for.\n\nIn terms of story, all of the story in this game is a rehash of other mediums.  The main campaign consists of retreading the source Madoka Magica anime, the Magia Record Gacha game, the Scene Zero Magia Record Gacha Event, and the Wraith Arc and Oriko Magica mangas.  They have in the past couple months added one original story, but, frankly, it is bad. Much like Scene Zero before it from their previous game, they have taken an existing slice of the story and shoehorned their OC into it as a hypercompetent best friend of everyone Mary Sue style.  \n\nSpeaking of creative bankruptcy, we need to talk about their units. Off the top of my head, without counting, there are approaching but not quite reaching a hundred different units in the game. I say different and not unique because that would be lying. First and foremost, the groupings are broken up into three, four, and five stars as is gacha standard.  There is no progression between them, but, instead, all three and four star units are the same characters, just of the 20ish 3 stars, 17 or so of them have a four star variant with a different attack and not even cosmetic differences.  The five stars demonstrate about the same level of creativity with characters such as Madoka and Mami having four units each, Homura and Sayaka having three, Kyoko, Alina, Iroha, and Mabayu having two each, keeping in mind we're still within the first year after release and already deep into version retreads.  Due to game design as well, some girls are just plain useless even at five star.  For example, Felicia is the one character capable of inflicting the powerful stunned condition, in theory, except that after the midway point every single enemy is immune to or so resistant they might as well be immune to stun, making her unusable.\n\nLikewise you unlock portraits as the game goes on, basically bonuses you can attach to a character that will improve their stars and give them a specific bonus.  The fact of the matter is the vast majority of these are worthless and you will find yourself reusing the same half dozen or so portraits on everyone that offer the largest boosts to speed, attack, defense, and magic recovery.  Similarly, you can unlock Crystalis bonuses for characters through completing upgrade quests. These are extremely grindy and again, the vast majority of the potential prizes are useless and mostly serve as testament to your luck or willingness to hit the 'retry' button day after day to get a good one.\n\nOn a similar thread, the battle system can be pretty repetitive.  Walpurgisnacht is the boss of several of the different subcampaigns and with very rare exception progressing through the stories involves fighting the same monster over and over again with slightly higher numbers each time. Witches can be a bit varied in the campaigns and some of them can benefit greatly from thinking outside the box and often times a specific ability of a four or three star girl might make a fight much easier than throwing a stronger five star at the problem.\n\nThat said, a lot of the witches, especially for things like raid links, battle towers, and score attacks, amount to just enormous masses of hit points with some gimmick tacked on.  Most of those gimmicks are annoying rather than engaging, such as requiring you do your damage on even turns for the witch with no way to tell what turn it is on, requiring you hit it a certain number of times between turns making only characters with multiple attacks useful to the exclusion of all others, being able to ignore your defensive barriers and damage you directly, etc. This seems to be designed to push people to spend money to roll for whatever the newest girl they've added is as she will invariably be keyed to whatever the current challenge is.\n\nThe PVP system isn't better and requires you to have the one true team to be competitive.  If you don't have at minimum Time Stop Homura and Hollow Woman Mabayu, there is no reason to even try.  To hit upper levels you also need Tiro Finale Mami and Pluvia Madoka and have all of them at descent ascension ratings.  Compounding the issue is the rerolling for PVP matches button simply doesn't work, usually cycling between the same 2-3 players in a range that can be dozens wide ad infinitum except for the lowest points.\n\nNot to say it is all bad - the collection of music from the franchise all in one place is great with a couple of really glaring omissions in Connect and Magia.  Visually it looks pretty good and the staff at least has been responsive so far to a lot of feedback, introducing more skips and other features to respect players time rather than make them sit through the same battles a billion times again (something they will hopefully bring to Crystalis Battles).  Material management isn't awful, especially by late game you'll find yourself with enough resources to nearly max out every four and five star character with the exception of their special attacks needing the unfortunately rare magic tomes. The home screen is now customizable with background and girl which is a fun little touch.\n\nStill, on the whole, this game needs a lot of work and a change of design philosophy away from trying to wring every last dime out of people for rolls to participate and towards making them want to give money to something they enjoy, away from reprinting old stories and characters towards new and creative content, and away from niche gimmicks in gameplay and towards fun core mechanics to give Madoka fans the game they deserve.",

It offers no unique content at all besides some cool art to look at (which sure, is very on point as is expected from the Madoka Magica universe, but a shiny coat of paint alone does not make a fulfilling game). \n\nThe 'gameplay' (and I see that with great generosity) consists of rolling the gacha lottery for characters, and watching the game on auto which lacks just enough to prompt the player to tap every few seconds, battles fight themselves, the character upgrade system is basically pointless, and the levels are just watching a character auto-run through a decorated hallway, there are maybe two or three animated cutscenes in the entire game.  For the rare characters (notable characters from the show+spinoff) they have 2d art, 3d models, and a cool cutscene for their special attack, but you can see all of that on youtube without having to grind and gamble. \n\nThe only people who are going to play this game are people who are already fans of the show, people who are very quickly going to realise there is nothing on offer here because the game's story is literally just a worse version of the show. You run through the exact same storyline but instead of watching the original animated series we all know and love, its jpegs of the characters with text boxes.

There do appear to be social features, but at that point, why not just discuss meguca online with the millions of people who've already seen it, or make mods for games that aren't as unfriendly to the customer to spread the word of [spoiler]Madokami[/spoiler] to others?\n\nIn summary, deliver the movie already, SHAFT.",

Expect random FPS drops and stutters, because this a mobile port; it's almost certainly running on an emulator trying to pretend its a mobile phone, to then try and run a game with kernel-level anticheat. It's frankly kind of doomed on that front.\n\nThe gameplay loop is barely present; you 'explore' dungeons automatically with no player input, and the battles can just be auto'd and ignored. There's basically nothing here. It's a gacha game with gacha game levelling mechanics; you level your units indepedent of the stages you play, so either you steamroll on the first turn or you faceplant a stat-wall. There is no inbetween. There never is with these games.\n\nInbetween the battles you often get little VN segments... but so far all these have been is Live2D sprites in a very different artstyle intercut with stills taken directly from the anime series. It's... jarring. No attempt has been made to try and rework the anime's scenes to better fit VN presentation, in fact I'm quite sure they're actually re-using the anime's voice-acting. This game is a goddamn awful way to experience the original series, so you haven't seen it, just... watch it. Don't play this game to do it instead. They would have been better off including the original episodes wholesale, or using the game's 3D models instead of the Live2D sprites (it would have kept the artstyle more consistent at least). There's so many bad decisions in this game.\n\nAs for its original story, it's... eeeeh. It's largely just a framing device for an amnesiac protagonist to rewatch the original show. It tries to set up an air of mystery, but we're never going to get answers anyway. Not before the servers inevitably shut down.\n\nEvery previous online Madoka game inevitably got shuttered. MagiReco was far more successful, and even that got shuttered to make way for this game. This game is not going to last. Don't waste your time and money.",

I don't think this IP lends itself well to a gacha game. The gameplay itself feels very slow and grindy and it basically plays itself in many ways. I don't think it's free to play friendly. The art is really beautiful ( sometimes, more on that later ), but then again most of it is revisiting the show or movies or spinoffs -- in other words, the same stuff we've already seen. Don't get me wrong, it's fun to take a walk down memory lane with what we are already familiar with however if you're expecting something new or a different story from what I can tell there's very little of it. \n\nOne thing I notice about this game is how it feels like a lot of different things mashed together. Even certain girls feel like they're done in different art styles and honestly, some of them are very ugly. The gameplay also feels altogether pretty clunky and janky in my opinion. It's a gacha game and all but I can't see how anyone really has fun with this gameplay loop and wants to stick with it for a while. I felt like I already saw everything there was to see in my time with it. I feel like this concept would have lent itself well to just a jrpg rather than a gacha game. It somewhat reminds me of the [i]Persona 5[/i] gacha game where I feel like it rides high off of nostalgia and having a recognizable IP to draw inspiration from and then kind of loses it from that point on.",

Oriko Magica and Magia Record are both here and are kind of mediocre as stories. All the event quests have disclaimers on them that basically amount to 'this is basically fanfiction lol, we're not even going to pretend this is canon'. There's an entire main story section dedicated to 'here's the OG series again but we've added our own original character to the mix. It's fine because she gets deleted from existence at the end of it so it doesn't mess with canon'. \n\nThat's not a spoiler, it's built into the framing device used to justify it as a prequel.\n\nThere's actually a seed of a fun combat system here, for the few times that you actually need to use it. It's an obvious descendant of the Honkai Star Rail style of turn-based combat, where everyone gets a basic attack, a special, and an ult that doesn't use a turn. There are a few characters that have fun turn-manipulating abilities, most of which stack and cause fun things to happen. Problem is, this is a gacha game so the vast majority of the time you are either wildly overlevelled and can just auto-combat or you have hit a wall that you need to grind to get past.\n\nIn all it's a game that every time I open it up I wish it was better than it actually is.

      "review": "I've been playing this game since it came out, first on the mobile and then migrating to the Steam version once it became available. I've maxed my level, hoarded vast quantities of materials, completed every event and cleared almost every bit of game content. I've loved the Madoka characters and setting for a long time and desperately want a great game in the setting and something to keep the property fresh and relevant in the public consciousness, but this just isn't it.\n\nFirst, if it wasn't already obvious, this is a gacha.  What characters you get are entirely at the mercy of RNG, as are their stories.  The odds for the girls most people would be here for aren't very good and opportunities for any significant quantities of free rolls are sparing.  This is, of course, in service to wanting to push players to have to spend money to get what they're here for.\n\nIn terms of story, all of the story in this game is a rehash of other mediums.  The main campaign consists of retreading the source Madoka Magica anime, the Magia Record Gacha game, the Scene Zero Magia Record Gacha Event, and the Wraith Arc and Oriko Magica mangas.  They have in the past couple months added one original story, but, frankly, it is bad. Much like Scene Zero before it from their previous game, they have taken an existing slice of the story and shoehorned their OC into it as a hypercompetent best friend of everyone Mary Sue style.  \n\nSpeaking of creative bankruptcy, we need to talk about their units. Off the top of my head, without counting, there are approaching but not quite reaching a hundred different units in the game. I say different and not unique because that would be lying. First and foremost, the groupings are broken up into three, four, and five stars as is gacha standard.  There is no progression between them, but, instead, all three and four star units are the same characters, just of the 20ish 3 stars, 17 or so of them have a four star variant with a different attack and not even cosmetic differences.  The five stars demonstrate about the same level of creativity with characters such as Madoka and Mami having four units each, Homura and Sayaka having three, Kyoko, Alina, Iroha, and Mabayu having two each, keeping in mind we're still within the first year after release and already deep into version retreads.  Due to game design as well, some girls are just plain useless even at five star.  For example, Felicia is the one character capable of inflicting the powerful stunned condition, in theory, except that after the midway point every single enemy is immune to or so resistant they might as well be immune to stun, making her unusable.\n\nLikewise you unlock portraits as the game goes on, basically bonuses you can attach to a character that will improve their stars and give them a specific bonus.  The fact of the matter is the vast majority of these are worthless and you will find yourself reusing the same half dozen or so portraits on everyone that offer the largest boosts to speed, attack, defense, and magic recovery.  Similarly, you can unlock Crystalis bonuses for characters through completing upgrade quests. These are extremely grindy and again, the vast majority of the potential prizes are useless and mostly serve as testament to your luck or willingness to hit the 'retry' button day after day to get a good one.\n\nOn a similar thread, the battle system can be pretty repetitive.  Walpurgisnacht is the boss of several of the different subcampaigns and with very rare exception progressing through the stories involves fighting the same monster over and over again with slightly higher numbers each time. Witches can be a bit varied in the campaigns and some of them can benefit greatly from thinking outside the box and often times a specific ability of a four or three star girl might make a fight much easier than throwing a stronger five star at the problem.\n\nThat said, a lot of the witches, especially for things like raid links, battle towers, and score attacks, amount to just enormous masses of hit points with some gimmick tacked on.  Most of those gimmicks are annoying rather than engaging, such as requiring you do your damage on even turns for the witch with no way to tell what turn it is on, requiring you hit it a certain number of times between turns making only characters with multiple attacks useful to the exclusion of all others, being able to ignore your defensive barriers and damage you directly, etc. This seems to be designed to push people to spend money to roll for whatever the newest girl they've added is as she will invariably be keyed to whatever the current challenge is.\n\nThe PVP system isn't better and requires you to have the one true team to be competitive.  If you don't have at minimum Time Stop Homura and Hollow Woman Mabayu, there is no reason to even try.  To hit upper levels you also need Tiro Finale Mami and Pluvia Madoka and have all of them at descent ascension ratings.  Compounding the issue is the rerolling for PVP matches button simply doesn't work, usually cycling between the same 2-3 players in a range that can be dozens wide ad infinitum except for the lowest points.\n\nNot to say it is all bad - the collection of music from the franchise all in one place is great with a couple of really glaring omissions in Connect and Magia.  Visually it looks pretty good and the staff at least has been responsive so far to a lot of feedback, introducing more skips and other features to respect players time rather than make them sit through the same battles a billion times again (something they will hopefully bring to Crystalis Battles).  Material management isn't awful, especially by late game you'll find yourself with enough resources to nearly max out every four and five star character with the exception of their special attacks needing the unfortunately rare magic tomes. The home screen is now customizable with background and girl which is a fun little touch.\n\nStill, on the whole, this game needs a lot of work and a change of design philosophy away from trying to wring every last dime out of people for rolls to participate and towards making them want to give money to something they enjoy, away from reprinting old stories and characters towards new and creative content, and away from niche gimmicks in gameplay and towards fun core mechanics to give Madoka fans the game they deserve.",

      "review": "TLDR: JUST WATCH THE SHOW INSTEAD OF WASTING YOUR TIME WITH THIS\n\nThere is honestly very, very little reason to play this game at all. It offers no unique content at all besides some cool art to look at (which sure, is very on point as is expected from the Madoka Magica universe, but a shiny coat of paint alone does not make a fulfilling game). \n\nThe 'gameplay' (and I see that with great generosity) consists of rolling the gacha lottery for characters, and watching the game on auto which lacks just enough to prompt the player to tap every few seconds, battles fight themselves, the character upgrade system is basically pointless, and the levels are just watching a character auto-run through a decorated hallway, there are maybe two or three animated cutscenes in the entire game.  For the rare characters (notable characters from the show+spinoff) they have 2d art, 3d models, and a cool cutscene for their special attack, but you can see all of that on youtube without having to grind and gamble. \n\nThe only people who are going to play this game are people who are already fans of the show, people who are very quickly going to realise there is nothing on offer here because the game's story is literally just a worse version of the show. You run through the exact same storyline but instead of watching the original animated series we all know and love, its jpegs of the characters with text boxes. And if there is for some reason someone who is being exposed to the Madoka Magica universe for the first time through this game, please uninstall it and watch the original show. Theres three whole movies, a spinoff (which has its own issues but nonetheless is better than this game) and another movie on the way.",

Not only is the gacha system crazy rigged and not F2P friendly, but the gameplay is lazy, repeptitive, and the first several, and i mean SEVERAL chapters are just repeats of the anime. They even pulled some of the stories from already released spin off manga, such as The Different Story. It got to the point where I'd just put the game on auto mode in the background and did other things until i reached a cutscene, and even the cutscenes got boring with no voice acting. I truly love this franchise and madoka magica, but this \"game\" is just a cash grab and predatory to long time fans of the series. Do better Aniplex.",

It's why I nominated it in three categories of the Steam Awards even though it feels like it's riding on the coattails of its 2011 success (which is the unfortunate reality of the franchise other than Rebellion).\n[*] Gameplay is simple and discovering synergies with a limited pool of characters feels rewarding. You can clear battles well above your \"party rank\" if you're actually awake.\n[*] The 3D models look great and the animations they're rigged to definitely work in their favor.\n[/list]\n[h1]The Bad[/h1][list]\n[*] Voice lines you redeem for the sand currency are not subtitled except if you pick that meguca to be your background and repeatedly click on them. Inconvenient, but not a dealbreaker.\n[*] The original content can't really stack up to the original story, and it's apparent. Full stop.\n[*] I didn't clock why it has a \"streamer mode\" until I rolled two characters who are running around in their underwear. They make even the protagonist of Magia Record have a chaste-looking design in comparison.\n[*] It takes longer than watching the movie or the TV show. Battles feel like filler after you've fought the exact same mob composition several times over in the same dungeon crawl.\n[*] Maybe it's a quirk of the engine, but the Live2D models appear to be marionettes on strings that suddenly jerk into their animation sequence during the VN bits. Just uncanny enough to momentarily jerk you out of the story.\n[/list]\n[h1]The Ugly[/h1][list]\n[*] [b]Kernel level anticheat.[/b] If anything is going to make me install this faster, it's this. Purportedly it uninstalls with the game, but according to the intro, you lose your progress when you uninstall. Are we really getting this serious over jpegs?\n[*] When they can't bother to depict it any other way, they seem to use 720p aliased screenshots from the TV release, not the BD or the movies. Assuming this is intended to be played on contemporary monitors, why? Why play this when I can just watch something using the exact same frames in better quality?\n[*] I am getting the distinct feeling I'm about to run up against a grind at around 10 hours in and I'd rather spend my time grinding, at worst, in an MMO where I get measurable progress in a persistent world I can share with others. There do appear to be social features, but at that point, why not just discuss meguca online with the millions of people who've already seen it, or make mods for games that aren't as unfriendly to the customer to spread the word of [spoiler]Madokami[/spoiler] to others?\n\nIn summary, deliver the movie already, SHAFT.",

Like, ah man you know I really love this beautiful anime, you know what would make it better? If it didn't have any camera angles at all and all the characters were limited to a couple stock expressions and poses like Family Guy. \n\nThe actual gameplay is super dull. Run in a straight line, press the exact same buttons in the exact same order one million times because the labyrinths just drag ON AND ON. \n\nI'm so sick of all these spinoff stories getting added to Madoka Magica just for money. Such a wonderfully compact story with no filler getting just completely bloated for the sake of more gacha game slop. Genuinely saddening.\n\nMagia Record sucked, this game blows.",

The gameplay is very dull - your character walks (automatically if you choose) in a straight line to a battle. Auto battle can be used if you want. And then you walk in another straight line to the end of the level. With cutscenes and dialogue in the middle that are just a stripped down version of the anime.\n\nIt’s just…really boring to play. The story is good because the story of the anime is good. But you could just watch the superior version and experience the story that way. \n\nThere are some nice side stories that are unique to the game but it’s not worth sitting through all the gameplay just to experience them (my time on Steam is about half of what I played on mobile, which shares progress). \n\nThe gacha elements aren’t actually too bad, surprisingly, and you can usually get your preferred characters in their banners by participating in all the content.\n\nI really wanted the game to succeed as we need more magical girl content but the gameplay just isn’t there.",

      "review": "boring and pointless. every single action you take requires the game to take several seconds to talk to the server, except during combat where everything was auto-calculated before you even started the fights. this means that actions that SHOULD happen near instantly, like changing from 1 menu to another or opening up a characters details, gets dragged out to several seconds. at first it dosent seem so bad, but once you actually start playing and trying to redeem your gems that the game gives you, or upgrade your characters, or explore the UI in any way (because like all gacha games, the first hour and a half or so is a forced tutorlial where youre only allowed to click on what it says you can), it becomes so unbearably tedius that only the most dedicated gooners can handle it.\n \n and make no mistake. this IS a gooner game. its a gooner game for lolicons, specifically. most of the characters are in extremely skimpy outfits, several in thongs and the like. the story dosent matter, if youve watched the anime youve already seen everything its going to show you, so just skip EVERY scene. the auto-battler aspect of the game is worthless trash, it just spams out attacks against random targets with no regards to anything like all garbage tier gacha trash. and OF COURSE it follows the scummy genshin model of buying premium currency for money > using that premium currency to then buy tickets > trading those tickets for pulls with a\"puty system\" that dosent carry over between loot chests. and you WILL have to spend several hundred dollars to progress eventually, because its not enough to just get the monthly 5 star unit, you HAVE to get that same (or any limited banner character) unit some 10 or so times to power them up enough to actually take on the late game missions.",

      "review": "It's... it's bad folks.\n\nParticularly crippling is the lack of any vsynch option, so expect constant frame-tearing unceasingly as you play. Expect random FPS drops and stutters, because this a mobile port; it's almost certainly running on an emulator trying to pretend its a mobile phone, to then try and run a game with kernel-level anticheat. It's frankly kind of doomed on that front.\n\nThe gameplay loop is barely present; you 'explore' dungeons automatically with no player input, and the battles can just be auto'd and ignored. There's basically nothing here. It's a gacha game with gacha game levelling mechanics; you level your units indepedent of the stages you play, so either you steamroll on the first turn or you faceplant a stat-wall. There is no inbetween. There never is with these games.\n\nInbetween the battles you often get little VN segments... but so far all these have been is Live2D sprites in a very different artstyle intercut with stills taken directly from the anime series. It's... jarring. No attempt has been made to try and rework the anime's scenes to better fit VN presentation, in fact I'm quite sure they're actually re-using the anime's voice-acting. This game is a goddamn awful way to experience the original series, so you haven't seen it, just... watch it. Don't play this game to do it instead. They would have been better off including the original episodes wholesale, or using the game's 3D models instead of the Live2D sprites (it would have kept the artstyle more consistent at least). There's so many bad decisions in this game.\n\nAs for its original story, it's... eeeeh. It's largely just a framing device for an amnesiac protagonist to rewatch the original show. It tries to set up an air of mystery, but we're never going to get answers anyway. Not before the servers inevitably shut down.\n\nEvery previous online Madoka game inevitably got shuttered. MagiReco was far more successful, and even that got shuttered to make way for this game. This game is not going to last. Don't waste your time and money.",

It looks fun, the game really looks like something I'd enjoy since I love madoka, visual novels, and genshin and this is basically a madoka genshin VN from what I've seen, but, oh, how the tables have tabled. Seems like a game that people will get bored of grinding for in a few years, just like genshin.... fucking.... impact.\n\nUpdate: I also tried uninstalling it, reinstalling it, every tech-savvy thing you can think of and nothing.. The other bad reviews make this sound like a total failure of a game. Not a good look aniplex. Was wanting to come to walpurgisnacht rising, maybe I'll wait 'til all of the hypocricy gets sorted out.
