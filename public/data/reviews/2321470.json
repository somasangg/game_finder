Anything up to Hazard 4 performs perfectly. At Hazard 5, however, you’ll run into some performance issues, which is why I switched to PC for most of the mastery runs. Unless you’re planning to 100% the game like I did, this really isn’t a problem: Hazard 5 is downright ridiculous for a variety of reasons (already covered in plenty of other reviews), and I wouldn’t bother with it at all if it weren’t for the achievements.\n\nIs it impossible? No, cause once you unlocked the right gear it will make Hazard 5 quite \"easy\" as well — it just takes away a bit of the fun as you’re quite locked into the meta builds. So those also wanting to 100% this game, be prepared for a grind and quite a lot of \"rinse and repeat\". Oh, and luck. Lots and lots of luck.",

This means the player most likely will not be able to mine/get all resources on any given map.\nAfter the 1.0 patch the game has a great amount of upgrades/items etc. to get, which require quite a lot of grind.\nGameplay loop is great though, and I definitely recommend the game for fans of the genre.",

If you enjoy build crafting, steady progression and constant action, this one hits all the right notes.\n\nWhat the game does incredibly well\n\nA visual style that fits perfectly\n\nThe graphics are not aiming for realism. Instead, you get a bold and charming art style that makes every run easy to read and fun to look at. The chunky designs and cave atmosphere match the chaotic gameplay beautifully.\n\nGameplay that never feels the same\n\nEvery run feels like a fresh challenge. You level up, pick from three upgrades, discover crazy build synergies and collect resources while dealing with endless swarms. Random loot drops give your character permanent bonuses and the meta progression between missions keeps you improving even when you fail.\n\nThe loop is simple to understand but hard to put down. You are always making meaningful decisions about farming, fighting or upgrading, and the game constantly rewards experimentation.\n\nWeapons with real personality\n\nEach weapon feels distinct and becomes even more fun as you unlock new tiers. Many upgrades change how the weapon behaves, not just its numbers. This leads to wild combinations and playstyles you would not expect at first glance.\n\nClasses that actually matter\n\nThere are four classes with three variations each. Every variant pushes you toward a specific approach, whether you prefer aggressive play, tanking or resource gathering. None of the options feel useless or broken. They all bring something unique to the table.\n\nTons of content and replay value\n\nThere are multiple biomes, challenges, masteries, escort missions and a huge number of builds to try. The game keeps giving you new goals and new ideas to test. It is easy to get lost in all the possibilities.\n\nVery satisfying sound work\n\nThe music is fine, but the sound effects are excellent. Drilling, blasting and crushing enemies always feels punchy and clean. The feedback is great and makes every moment more enjoyable.\n\n⸻\n\nSmall things that could be improved\n\nThe escape timer after the boss\n\nI understand the purpose of the timer. It prevents endless farming and adds tension. Still, it can feel a bit stressful at times. A slightly longer window would make the ending feel more rewarding.\n\nRNG heavy missions\n\nSome missions, especially mastery and challenge ones, can feel too dependent on early luck. A bad start can snowball quickly. It does not ruin the game, but you will notice it from time to time.\n\n⸻\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nDeep Rock Galactic: Survivor is easily one of the best auto shooters available today.\nIt is fast, clever, full of character and bursting with progression. The game encourages you to try new builds, explore new ideas and dive into chaotic fights that never feel boring.\n\nIf you like games with loot, upgrades and endless replayability, this is a must play.\n\nRock and stone. 🪨👊",

Honestly, this feels like one of the least janky and complete survivor games out there with plenty of recognizable mechanics from Deep Rock Galactic.\r\n\r\nGear drops in missions you can upgrade/equip.\r\nAchievements/Ranks unlock new gear and increase the minimum power level of dropped gear in missions.\r\nSame humor with lots of lines from Deep Rock Galactic.\r\n\r\nMy only issue so far that I've run into appears to be at higher hazard levels where some of the classes weapons just cant handle the sheer amount of enemies the game starts to throw at you without getting a way to pierce enemies and you get overwhelmed. I guess it follows a similar pattern from Deep Rock with the Driller seemingly being the strongest with some of the best area effect control.\r\n\r\nDefinitely worth the price tag.",

Though the game is quite challenging, especially when you get to the harder levels (or dives), the fact that you are \"progressing\" in terms of material collection does make it feel like you are moving forward.\n\nThe progression is mainly linked to upgrading your base stats (such as health, damage, crit chance, etc.), and masteries (split to 3, weapons, classes and areas, or biomes in this case). But you'll mostly notice you're surviving gets easier as you progress further in this game. What will more noticeably affect your experience are the equipment you get as drops from beating bosses or finishing your dives. And the challenge modes also provide better chances of getting better drops.\n\nMy only gripe with this game is you don't really get to the OP level that you can  get in Vampire Survivors, where the enemies just melt. In a good way, this keeps the game engaging, but the downside is you don't get the satisfaction of just watching the hordes of enemies melt to you onslaught of weapons (to basically further prove that 1 dwarf can do the job of 4 if you just give him enough guns). \n\nBut all in all, its a nice game you can sink a decent amount of time into, especially in shorter sessions, and feel some level of satisfaction.",

      "review": "Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is not DRG2 - nor does it try to be. Instead, it adapts the authentic DRG experience into an all-new Survivors-like, complete with mining, objectives, dwarves (well, one dwarf), and lots of bugs (the squishy kind, not the ones that ruin your experience).\n\nLike many Survivors-likes, DRG:Survivor is easily accessible to new players while offering a surprising depth and a plethora of viable end-game builds as well as great replayability (as evidenced by my total play time).\n\n[h2]Gameplay[/h2]\nDRG:Survivor's gameplay is pretty much peak DRG. Unlike many traditional Survivors-likes, each run is divided into multiple stages, each with their own finale and an additional objective. The gameplay loop is surprisingly similar to the original's Deep Dives - mine minerals, complete your objective, get to the drop pod, rinse and repeat.\n\nThe EXP system, on the other hand, is similar enough to other Survivors-likes that players familiar with those will feel right at home. Collect EXP orbs, pick one of three upgrades, get stronger.\n\n[h2]Weapons & Upgrades[/h2]\nIf you played DRG, you will instantly recognise many weapons in DRG:Survivor. While not a straight port (obviously), even the roles and purposes of individual weapons translate well into the Survivors-like genre. During a normal run, you will unlock up to four weapons at level 5, 15 and 25 respectively which can be upgraded with stat upgrades and overclocks during a run.\n\nAlso like the original, DRG:Survivor's weapons and upgrades are somewhat imbalanced. While the auto-cannon, for instance, is extremely powerful with the right builld, many other weapons will feel inadequate on Hazard 5.\n\n[h2]Achievements[/h2]\nAlthough DRG:Survivor sports many of the usual achievements you can get just by playing, some of the rarer ones pose an actual challenge. This adds immensely to the replayability but can get frustrating for certain completionists.\n\n[h2]Conclusion (AKA the \"But how does it hold up against <insert Survivors-like of your choice>?\" section)[/h2]\nDRG:Survivor is definitely in the top percentile of Survivors-likes. While the game is ultimately a nod to the DRG community, even players without any experience in Deep Rock Galactic can jump right in.\n\nAlthough some of the mechanics such as mining, additional objectives and the relatively new gear system can feel unfamiliar or even daunting, this game is not easier or more difficult to pick up than any other Survivors-like. Unlike some of the more niche titles, DRG:Survivor also offers an active and (mostly) helpful community and wiki, making it a good starting point into the Survivors-like genre as well.",

      "review": "I've played this game a lot since it first released in early access and continued to iterate on the game.  The end result, at least of their 1.0, is that they just never addressed so many of the myriad problems with the game.\r\n\r\nWeapon balance is terrible.  It has always been terrible since the early days and has barely been addressed.  A large percentage of the weapons are so bad they actively make you weaker by having them, since you get offered upgrades for your other weapons less often.  Some weapons are so strong that they will carry an entire run by themselves.\r\n\r\nVisibility is terrible.  There is no mechanism to see aliens which are visually behind something.  The game has an isometric style, where the camera is top down but slanted in a way that you see the bottom side of things, but not the top.  Any aliens \"north\" of terrain are completely invisible.  This extends to being behind the escort vehicle, mineable resources, trees, crystals, etc.  Weapon effects also render over top of enemies.  You will routinely take damage from running into enemies that have never been visible on your screen.\r\n\r\nInformation availability is terrible.  Do you know want to know which weapons are available to the scout?  Too bad.  Do you want to know the stats of a weapon you're about to select from a level-up?  Too bad.  Do you want to know how much damage your existing weapon does?  First, you have to ESC, then click into each individual weapon.  Next, damage over time is not credited to the source weapon whatsoever.  If you're any kind of status effect build, all of the damage pools into one giant damage type that you can't even view until the postgame screen.  There is no way to know how much damage each of your fire weapons is contributing.\r\n\r\nMeta progression is ridiculous.  I have millions of credits and thousands of each meta resource from playing so much in early access.  You now not only have meta upgrades, but also gear that randomly drops during the game.  These items have *enormous* pools of stats and can cost a few hundred thousand credits to fully upgrade.  One of the item types is the only way for a class to have access to more weapon types, so you're unable to even go down that route until you RNG them.\r\n\r\nA piece of gear can have 60 armor or >100 hp in addition to multiple other stats.  A legendary armor upgrade in game is 15 armor.  Armor has a dramatic dropoff in effectiveness, so not only does armor become a completely wasted upgrade in game, but if you don't have these big pieces you're going to be taking 4x the incoming damage.  Keep in mind that even with this much armor you can still take half or more of your hp in a single hit from big enemies on danger 5.\r\n\r\nThe amount of weapons / tag spread is too small.  You naturally want your weapons to overlap in as many ways as possible so that you can maximally share the category upgrades.  For example, 20% projectile damage gives more benefit if all 4 weapons use projectiles than with just 2.  However, there aren't actually that many weapons with good overlap.  Outside of kinetic and projectile, there are pitifully few for many of the other types.  Some weapons have upgrades that change their damage type, but you can't plan around that since there's a high chance it doesn't appear and many of those that change type are in the \"these weapons suck\" category.  Between the general power (or lack thereof) for some weapons, and the availability of synergistic options, you end up building toward the same options far too often.\r\n\r\nThe game is cheap.  It's an OK game to play here and there, but it quickly becomes an exercise in frustration due to all the never addressed issues.",

It doesn't take in to account anything about the character you are playing.  \"Oh I see you have a level 70 legendary, here put this level 71 blue on with totally different stats and less overall effectiveness\".\r\n\r\nCheap game?  Yes!  Fun until a certain point? Definitely!  Want to progress and become very strong? No thanks, must have gear.",

I was kinda expecting, more?\n\n[h1] What I didn't like [/h1]\n\n [b] **I really don't like that upgrades, and content are locked behind higher hazards/difficulties [/b] Sure I might've not played the game enough to really see every overclock or every build but I just can't go farther. Don't get me wrong, if you do like that then thats a plus, but for me, and other people, that is a major reason to not play the game any more. It's frustrating when you're forced to play hazard 2, 3, even 4 for some perma weapon upgrades. It's even more frustrating considering that this type of game is increasingly more dependent on luck the higher hazard you go on. \n\n[b] I was also expecting more from the weapon overclocks.[/b] As someone who really enjoys overclocks from deep rock galactic itself, I was expecting more play styles for each weapon. Instead, for most of the weapons theres just a generic + reload speed and + fire rate, or +magazine size or -reload speed. Theres also a lack of clean overclocks, which might be a design thing but i feel left out. Then the big unstable overclocks, you'd expect some gigantic change of weapon play style, but for some of the weapons it's just more generic nonsense. A few of the weapons have really interesting upgrades, like sentries can follow you around, or destroy terrain, A good few of the weapons can switch what type of damage they deal out, but most of em? Just generic stat upgrades....\n\n[h1] Theres some good here though [/h1]\n\nSupply pods are really nice, being able to give you much needed space, and the artifacts seem to have a great amount of variety. The classes also seem to have variety and unique play styles which i really enjoyed before i reached my limit. The upgrades you get with minerals are nice too, though [b] I wish i felt.. more.. from them. 1% move speed or 1% mining speed, or even +1 to starting nitra.... it doesn't feel like it changes anything. [/b]\n\nFor what it's worth, this game has a lot right, and theres many things i didn't mention such as price, longevity, or the cave generation; thats because i didn't have a major opinion on em, so to me they're good. However, I ended up just being disappointed, I wanted more. I expected more considering the branding. Maybe thats my fault? To be fair, it's only been a month and a bit since it got fully released, so maybe as the game updates and changes, so will my opinion. \n\n[b] This game is 100% for a certain audience, but I'm not that audience. The biggest gripe i have is the upgrades and content being locked behind higher difficulties. I just can't recommend it, I gave it as much a chance as i was willing, but at this current moment it's not a game i wanna come back to. Maybe that'll change, but for now, I'll wait for a longer time for the game to really be at its best. Good luck to the devs, and I really hope this game turns into a delicious pizza with more time for it to cook.

      "review": "My take isn't going to be popular, because everyone likes to think of themselves as an elite gamer....\nBut this game is too hard...\nThis would be a GREAT multiplayer game... But for some reason whenever anyone makes something in the vampire survivors style, they don't do that. But single player? This is just running around in circles, maybe getting a few enemies down as more of them swarm in and barely managing to mine the materials you need.\n\nThere's an escort mission, this absolutely sucks. They are brutally difficult. Even on lower difficulties...\nI want to like this game, but it needs an easier difficulty.\n\nYou do get stronger with gear, as it slowly drip feeds you some, I've been playing for 8 hours and have barely found any pieces of gear. It filled all the slots and then just kinda stopped bothering to give me any gear. You find the gear in level in the forms of briefcases, but they drop extremely rarely. The most I've found on one level is 3 bad pieces of gear. But usually I find at most, 1.\n\nWhenever you get a boss down, you have 30 seconds to get out of the level, or it's game over.... Why the hurry? Let me pick up my goddamned loot! Oh, I missed a single flower for a quest, but despite needing only 6 of the stupid things, they're often extremely sparse. Or I need to mine 10 more of the blue ore... but I just can't find any. Sometimes, I swear, there just isn't enough on the level to do the quest. Randomly generated areas for you...\nPersonally, I'd prefer the level didn't end, until you finished off the rest of the enemies, and they stopped spawning. That would be way more fun... But no, it's get in or lose.\n\nThe dwarves cannot be customised at all. There's additional skins that cost money... There's no female dwarf (Another hot topic among gamers.) You can't even recolour the dwarves... Or unlock fun hats.\n\nThe weapons are a mix between awful, and slightly less awful. There's none that you can aim with your mouse. This is a huge problem for me... Different weapons aim slightly different. Some rotate around you, some shoot behind you, some shoot in front of you... Some just shoot the nearest enemy, or the strongest enemy.... But unlike Soulstone Survivors, where you can choose to have aiming be automatic, or actually aimed by yourself, quickly on the fly... There's no weapon that you aim... So your mouse isn't needed on this game... You only need WASD. Which gets really old, really fast. \nYou can use your mouse to select upgrades between level ups... Annoyingly, right click pauses the game. There's no way to rebind this. So if like me, you have fat heavy hands, expect to randomly pause occasionally, it's very annoying.\n\n\nLevels take a long time, and when you die, there's no recovery or 3 continues or the robot to bring you back up... You're just dead, it's just over... You do get XP and stuff, which is nice... But it takes a very long time to progress this way...\nThe game feels extremely slow, because for the first few runs, you're very likely to die... And that's boring.\nWho likes dying in games? (Okay, there's bound to be someone out there who does, but it ain't me!)\n\nI hate to give this game a not recommended, because I know I'll probably enjoy it once I've slotted in enough work hours to unlock the fun part... But when you have to invest a ton of time to get to the fun part of a game.... a goddamned video game, not a job... Then it's just not something I can recommend.\n\nFor instance, I play WoW... It's an MMO, you have to invest a lot of time to get to the fun parts... Consequently, I do not recommend it to anyone... But I still play it.\nI'll continue playing this game.. I might even add an update to this review to let you all know if it gets better eventually... But I will still recommend against it. Because quite frankly, if it's not fun within the first two hours (Refund hours) then it's not something I can recommend. \n\nQuite frankly, the grind should be fun. You should enjoy grinding because that's part of the game as well.\nIf you're not having fun grinding, and getting your levels up, and getting gear... then why are you playing? Go play a game that's fun from the get go instead.\n\nSo no, I cannot recommend this game.\nSorry devs... maybe make the game more fun and I might change my mind...\nAnd add customisation....\nAnd a female dwarf. Like c'mon, why's it men only? There are tonnes of badass dwarven women in media. But no, the incels in your community will throw a hissyfit if you do.\n\nIf you play this game anyway, I hope you have fun...\nIf you don't, can't blame you.\nRegardless, whether you liked my review, hated it, think I'm a moron... or didn't even read the review and just skipped to the end, I hope you have a wonderful day. <3",

      "review": "Decently fun, but increasingly frustrating. There isn't enough telegraphing of certain enemy actions and many game mechanics aren't fully fleshed out.\n\nFor example, the Glyphid Exploder can be triggered with proximity after a short delay or immediately with enough damage. The problem is damage in this game is almost random and uncontrollable, so you could have the Exploder explode on you as you try to trigger it with proximity. It should have timed explosions for both triggers.  Or, perhaps, explode and damage everything except you if triggered by damage.\n\nAnother failed mechanic is some weapons don't properly target the highest HP target when they're supposed to. You'll be fighting a boss and your biggest gun is just shooting in the wrong direction. That kind of bug just ruins gameplay.\n\nAnother infuriating issue is that sometimes there are impassable fissures on the ground that are invisible through the destructible rock. You don't discover these until you destroy the rock which results in thoughtful path planning that kills you. An outline of walkable surfaces could be made visible through rock or just don't have random fissures under the rock!\n\nThe biggest deal breaker for anyone: major MAJOR performance issues on my Intel i7 13700HX and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 GPU with 16GB of ram running at full performance and no throttling. I'm about 50 hours into the game and my otherwise rock-solid 120 FPS falls off a cliff (anywhere between 0 and 5 FPS) during specific events: 1) every time the enemies increase in strength 2) when a drop pod falls from the sky 3) when an boss or special enemy dies. The worst part is that during these low FPS events and stutters, the game is still counting in real time. Depending on how long the episode lasts, you may have walked you character blind for 3+ seconds which in later levels is more than enough to kill you.\n\nUntil the performance issues are corrected, I won't be playing this game anymore.

      "review": "Honestly, this game gives me a headache. I would LOVE to love it - DRG is awesome - but the auto-aiming is terrible. It never prioritizes the bosses, just the closest enemies and you have to keep away from the bosses to survive while some other bosses stick back at the middle of massive hordes. This leads you to have to kill bosses via drop-pods (which is fun and requires a bit of skill) or via a lot of AOE-damage and that's fine most of the time except when you're doing weapon masteries which you need to do to get a nice base damage bonus for your weapons. In these masteries, you only have one weapon, and a lot of the weapons just don't work alone. Maybe if I had all of the skills unlocked the game would be fun, but that's a massive grind and you'll likely keep on failing all of your dives during that grind. Now, I could just fight on a lower difficulty but the greater the difficulty, the better leveled the gear that you get. Overall, the game is really challenging and I could take the challenge if only I could switch between auto and manual aiming (like in Halls of Torment) or I could somehow change aim-priority on the fly.

On paper, this should work like a charm. Although as pretty much all of the negative reviews will point out: there are major issues with the game that have been around from early access, and I guess the solution was to either band-aid them or pretend they don't exist. The gear system is gonna be one of those that you either love it or hate it, and personally it's soured me on the game the longer I've engaged with it.\n\nThe biggest negative however, is that DRG Survivor has one of the most punishing difficulty cliffs I've seen once you hit Hazard 5. This is around the point where it just becomes frustrating. There's a fine line between challenging and punishing, and once you're able to clear Hazard 3+ consistently due to upgrades + meta progression, you're going to start to see that you're hitting that wall. I'm not gonna grind Hazard 4s for hundreds of hours hoping for RNG on good gear rolls just to be able to finally hit that damage check on Hazard 5. Sorry!\n\nOverall there are better \"versions\" of this game out there.

      "review": "There's the bones of a great game in there, but in its current state it feels like the devs ran out of ideas halfway through. I got to Hazard 3 which is meant to be the midpoint but I simply lost all interest because the only realistic way to progress further is a brutal and quite frankly really boring grind (actually, it's more like four separate grinds due to the amount of systems they put in) to increase power through extremely bland meta progression.\n\nHurray, one run gives me enough currency to increase my critical hit damage by 2% and two pieces of gear that are 0.206% better than what I'm currently wearing in those slots. Zzzzz.\n\nThe way the game presents numbers like upgrade percentages and damage is also incredibly poor, making trying to evaluate upgrades a complete crapshoot for most stats. Like yeah, sure, I can see the stat equation is \"((Base * skill) + flat) * meta * overclock * artifact * mutator)\" (I'm not joking, that's literally what the ingame tooltip says) but that doesn't actually *mean* anything to anyone who isn't some old EVE theorycrafter who can't enjoy a game unless it requires 6 separate spreadsheets.\n\nPast a fairly early point, every run feels the same apart from there being two different game modes (and Escort, while decent in itself, is badly overtuned). Almost every weapon feels the same. The only meaningful build choice you have most runs is whether to go for direct damage or DoT build, and even that has minimal impact on how you actually play.\n\nUpgrades don't feel meaningful; at best a \"legendary\" upgrade compensates for some inherent weakness a particular weapon has (like adding more beams to a flamethrower to make it more consistent), but there's basically no power fantasy of getting lucky and piecing together a really strong build. I played about 30 runs to get to Hazard 3 and honestly, I can't think of any that felt memorable in any way.\n\nIf a weapon feels different or unique, it's generally a bad thing because it has some major downside that makes it a pain to play with, like the minigun only firing forwards in your movement direction which requires constant micromanagement. Or you could just, you know, pick a different weapon that *doesn't* have a major downside, while feeling similarly strong (not that any weapon really feels strong, at best they feel adequate for keeping up with enemy spawn rate unless you massively overgear the difficulty).\n\nSame goes for the mastery objectives that I assume are meant to shake up how you play, but most of the time it feels like you're either forced to play with a bad / boring weapon or do other really arbitrary things (\"stand still for 60 seconds\") in order to, you guessed it, advance the meta progression that you need to get stronger.\n\nIn that regard the game feels like it has actually regressed since earlier EA builds, by simply nerfing anything that could be strong/fun and adding several more layers of meta progression grind, plus the addition of forced timers that make you play the game only at the pace imagined by the developers, with barely any space left for being creative with how you play a map/run.\n\nThe core of the game (a slower paced take on survivor genre leveraging terrain manipulation and DRG assets) is fundamentally solid, so I'm happy to believe it'll get better with time. But right now it's just too grindy, too samey run to run and not enough fun (strong builds) to be had to keep my interest.",

      "review": "I've played this game a lot since it first released in early access and continued to iterate on the game.  The end result, at least of their 1.0, is that they just never addressed so many of the myriad problems with the game.\r\n\r\nWeapon balance is terrible.  It has always been terrible since the early days and has barely been addressed.  A large percentage of the weapons are so bad they actively make you weaker by having them, since you get offered upgrades for your other weapons less often.  Some weapons are so strong that they will carry an entire run by themselves.\r\n\r\nVisibility is terrible.  There is no mechanism to see aliens which are visually behind something.  The game has an isometric style, where the camera is top down but slanted in a way that you see the bottom side of things, but not the top.  Any aliens \"north\" of terrain are completely invisible.  This extends to being behind the escort vehicle, mineable resources, trees, crystals, etc.  Weapon effects also render over top of enemies.  You will routinely take damage from running into enemies that have never been visible on your screen.\r\n\r\nInformation availability is terrible.  Do you know want to know which weapons are available to the scout?  Too bad.  Do you want to know the stats of a weapon you're about to select from a level-up?  Too bad.  Do you want to know how much damage your existing weapon does?  First, you have to ESC, then click into each individual weapon.  Next, damage over time is not credited to the source weapon whatsoever.  If you're any kind of status effect build, all of the damage pools into one giant damage type that you can't even view until the postgame screen.  There is no way to know how much damage each of your fire weapons is contributing.\r\n\r\nMeta progression is ridiculous.  I have millions of credits and thousands of each meta resource from playing so much in early access.  You now not only have meta upgrades, but also gear that randomly drops during the game.  These items have *enormous* pools of stats and can cost a few hundred thousand credits to fully upgrade.  One of the item types is the only way for a class to have access to more weapon types, so you're unable to even go down that route until you RNG them.\r\n\r\nA piece of gear can have 60 armor or >100 hp in addition to multiple other stats.  A legendary armor upgrade in game is 15 armor.  Armor has a dramatic dropoff in effectiveness, so not only does armor become a completely wasted upgrade in game, but if you don't have these big pieces you're going to be taking 4x the incoming damage.  Keep in mind that even with this much armor you can still take half or more of your hp in a single hit from big enemies on danger 5.\r\n\r\nThe amount of weapons / tag spread is too small.  You naturally want your weapons to overlap in as many ways as possible so that you can maximally share the category upgrades.  For example, 20% projectile damage gives more benefit if all 4 weapons use projectiles than with just 2.  However, there aren't actually that many weapons with good overlap.  Outside of kinetic and projectile, there are pitifully few for many of the other types.  Some weapons have upgrades that change their damage type, but you can't plan around that since there's a high chance it doesn't appear and many of those that change type are in the \"these weapons suck\" category.  Between the general power (or lack thereof) for some weapons, and the availability of synergistic options, you end up building toward the same options far too often.\r\n\r\nThe game is cheap.  It's an OK game to play here and there, but it quickly becomes an exercise in frustration due to all the never addressed issues.",

Most enemies are shared between biomes with a few exclusive one. And the \"challenge\" to unlock a new sector is just a regular level. Having a special scary biome there would have been cool. A bit more biomes so every sector feels a bit different would have been great. Having totally different creature pools, including bosses, in each biome, would have been a good minimum.\n\nThe only thing that feels new and refreshing when you go further in the game are guns. Relics are not that game changing so unlocking them is meh. Gear is anectodal, simply auto-equip them and sell what is not equipped, doing the math is not worth it since they just give you just start up stats or time-limited skill that will only impact the beginning of the run and quickly fade away with all the level upgrades and the difficulty.\n\nThe gameplay-changing level upgrades (e.g. add a beam to a multi-beam weapon, add a functionnality, change  an element...) are too scarce IMO, they are not all that efficient, not crazy enough, and sometimes even just regular stat changes. Synergies are actually inexistent except the \"mathematical\" ones like boosting a shared characteristic on several guns. No cool secret stuff happen like in other survivors (like 2 guns becoming one secret one, or a relic that changes how a gun behaves..).\n\nThere could have been so much more fun stuff to do with mining & crafting like crafting or upgrading guns or gear. But no, mined materials only serve as skill upgrades (which are not game-impacting since a/ they are tiny and b/ these stats get totally drowned in level upgrades). BTW how do you permanently upgrade a weapon in this game ? By playing a short version of a level. Several times. For each gun. And there are plenty.\n\nYou almost never \"feel the power\" of your level upgrades choices, except for gun level upgrade (every 6 level only). The levels play exactly the same from start to finish. Since most enemies exist at different levels (with palette changes), and their number increase to compensate variety, you never really feel becoming stronger over a particular enemy type.\n\nThere are 2 types of missions. These 2 have their own full campaign. I don't understand why those 2 are not part of a single campaign (alongside other mission types....). Probably because one of those wasn't there during early game development,  but seriously this feels like totally artificially adding hours of gameplay. If the devs add other types of missions they should seriously redesign the main campaign as a single one containing several types of missions rather than adding additional campaigns. And the \"challenge\" mission to unlock the next sector should be something different, a special mission, a boss, whatsoever, as long as each time it's a surprise you didn't see coming.\n\nConclusion : cool the first hours until you realize this game is basically just grinding the same exact levels again and again and again.",

      "review": "I originally played quite a bit of this game back in Early Access and found it to be a really fun VS-like experience. After taking a long break, I came back when I saw it had a full release, and while some of the new content is genuinely fine, there’s one major change that, in my opinion, made the game significantly worse - the gear system\n\nNow you have to farm different pieces of gear with random bonuses and equip them on your miners. Sounds fine in theory, but there are two big problems with how it’s implemented:\n\n1) It adds almost nothing interesting. Around 95% of all gear is just boring stat sticks. The only items with unique effects are legendaries, but those are very rare, and even then, many of them are still just glorified stat bonuses.\n\n2) It’s a massive chore to manage. There are 12 subclasses, each needing its own set of 8 items, so keeping everyone optimized means a ton of micromanagement. The inventory is also painfully limited, forcing you to constantly clean it out. And if you forget to mark something as a favorite, you risk selling gear you actually need - or waste time checking every item manually to make sure you’re not deleting part of your build.\n\n3) The game is now balanced around you having great gear. It’s not too noticeable in Hazards 1–3 (which are honestly where I had the most fun), but by Haz 4 you start to feel the pressure to have a solid setup. And Haz 5? It practically requires a min-maxed build just to make it remotely enjoyable.\n\nAnd that brings me to my biggest gripe: Hazard 5 (late game mode) just sucks. It’s easily the least fun experience I’ve had in any VS-like. The difficulty curve in general is pretty dull - there are no new enemies, mechanics, or map changes between Hazard levels, just enemies getting tankier and hitting harder. That’s lazy design by itself, but Haz 5 makes it even worse.\n\nThe absurd enemy tankiness completely clashes with the game’s built-in time limit mechanic. Once the boss spawns, you only have a limited window to kill it before the game starts throwing endless, increasingly tough waves of enemies at you. On earlier Hazards this works fine - you can usually kill the boss in time and the system keeps you from overfarming the map. But the jump in durability from Haz 4 to Haz 5 is absolutely insane. You often struggle to clear even normal mobs, and bosses turn into massive bullet sponges. Unless you get extremely lucky with your upgrades, your DPS just isn’t enough to kill them before the time limit runs out.\n\nOnce that happens, you get stuck in a death spiral - failing to kill the boss triggers stronger waves, which slow you down even more, which triggers even tougher waves, and so on. Most Haz 5 boss fights turned into long, tedious slogs where I had to slowly chip away at huge HP pools while dodging an ever-growing mob of enemies. It’s just not a good experience.\n\nI get that they wanted to make Haz 5 feel challenging, but cranking up enemy HP by 300% isn’t a smart way to do it. It’s artificial difficulty at its worst - and it completely kills what makes VS games fun in the first place: the freedom to experiment with builds, and the satisfaction of watching those builds come online and tear through enemies. When everything turns into a DPS check, most setups just become obsolete, and even the “right” ones feel underwhelming because enemies can soak up so much damage",

The game feels really buggy right now, in just the few hours I have played since 1.0 I encountered several of them, one of which completely blocked me from continuing a run. The progression system still feels grindy, bland and unsatisfying - gear isn't that much of an improvement here. (at least they removed mastery levels on different hazards, now THAT was a ton of grind for just a few %)\r\n\r\nIt's a shame, because the pretty visuals, setting, audio and even some of the moment-to-moment gameplay are quite cool.

While keep trying to play a bit of the game but it seem to have completely changed the game in a direction i don't think is for me. The gears system simply suck in my opinion, to look at a good gears system in a similar genre of game i would say look at a game like Halls of Torments and take inspiration because this isn't it. Current gears is grindy for the sake of grindy, most of them are meaningless singles digits percentage change and don't affect much of the way i will play, this game already has the most boring and grindy upgrade system where you have to repeat mission on different dificulty to upgrade each weapon/class and adding that on top isn't doing it any favor.",

I gave it a fair chance, but hitting wall again and again, being on the mercy of gear drop RNG that You cannot really affect in any way unlike in many other competitors...

The game gives no sense of satisfaction for completing a dive, just disappointingly meager incremental “progression”. I feel like I have made zero progress despite constantly completing dives and unlocking upgrades/gear. Playing 30 minutes just to get “rewarded” with +1 critical chance upgrades and +1.3 movement speed gear is just awful.\r\n\r\nTo be clear there is nothing technically wrong with this game, I have experienced no major bugs and there is a gameplay loop that some people could find fun. That said, I'm at a loss as to why the developers have chosen to make the game the way they have: excessive grind with pitiful progression. This game is a budget spinoff of an already grindy game, if the devs wanted to extend the gameplay do it by adding new weapons, gear, biomes, enemies, missions, etc don’t kneecap progression for the sake of bloating play time.",

      "review": "My take isn't going to be popular, because everyone likes to think of themselves as an elite gamer....\nBut this game is too hard...\nThis would be a GREAT multiplayer game... But for some reason whenever anyone makes something in the vampire survivors style, they don't do that. But single player? This is just running around in circles, maybe getting a few enemies down as more of them swarm in and barely managing to mine the materials you need.\n\nThere's an escort mission, this absolutely sucks. They are brutally difficult. Even on lower difficulties...\nI want to like this game, but it needs an easier difficulty.\n\nYou do get stronger with gear, as it slowly drip feeds you some, I've been playing for 8 hours and have barely found any pieces of gear. It filled all the slots and then just kinda stopped bothering to give me any gear. You find the gear in level in the forms of briefcases, but they drop extremely rarely. The most I've found on one level is 3 bad pieces of gear. But usually I find at most, 1.\n\nWhenever you get a boss down, you have 30 seconds to get out of the level, or it's game over.... Why the hurry? Let me pick up my goddamned loot! Oh, I missed a single flower for a quest, but despite needing only 6 of the stupid things, they're often extremely sparse. Or I need to mine 10 more of the blue ore... but I just can't find any. Sometimes, I swear, there just isn't enough on the level to do the quest. Randomly generated areas for you...\nPersonally, I'd prefer the level didn't end, until you finished off the rest of the enemies, and they stopped spawning. That would be way more fun... But no, it's get in or lose.\n\nThe dwarves cannot be customised at all. There's additional skins that cost money... There's no female dwarf (Another hot topic among gamers.) You can't even recolour the dwarves... Or unlock fun hats.\n\nThe weapons are a mix between awful, and slightly less awful. There's none that you can aim with your mouse. This is a huge problem for me... Different weapons aim slightly different. Some rotate around you, some shoot behind you, some shoot in front of you... Some just shoot the nearest enemy, or the strongest enemy.... But unlike Soulstone Survivors, where you can choose to have aiming be automatic, or actually aimed by yourself, quickly on the fly... There's no weapon that you aim... So your mouse isn't needed on this game... You only need WASD. Which gets really old, really fast. \nYou can use your mouse to select upgrades between level ups... Annoyingly, right click pauses the game. There's no way to rebind this. So if like me, you have fat heavy hands, expect to randomly pause occasionally, it's very annoying.\n\n\nLevels take a long time, and when you die, there's no recovery or 3 continues or the robot to bring you back up... You're just dead, it's just over... You do get XP and stuff, which is nice... But it takes a very long time to progress this way...\nThe game feels extremely slow, because for the first few runs, you're very likely to die... And that's boring.\nWho likes dying in games? (Okay, there's bound to be someone out there who does, but it ain't me!)\n\nI hate to give this game a not recommended, because I know I'll probably enjoy it once I've slotted in enough work hours to unlock the fun part... But when you have to invest a ton of time to get to the fun part of a game.... a goddamned video game, not a job... Then it's just not something I can recommend.\n\nFor instance, I play WoW... It's an MMO, you have to invest a lot of time to get to the fun parts... Consequently, I do not recommend it to anyone... But I still play it.\nI'll continue playing this game.. I might even add an update to this review to let you all know if it gets better eventually... But I will still recommend against it. Because quite frankly, if it's not fun within the first two hours (Refund hours) then it's not something I can recommend. \n\nQuite frankly, the grind should be fun. You should enjoy grinding because that's part of the game as well.\nIf you're not having fun grinding, and getting your levels up, and getting gear... then why are you playing? Go play a game that's fun from the get go instead.\n\nSo no, I cannot recommend this game.\nSorry devs... maybe make the game more fun and I might change my mind...\nAnd add customisation....\nAnd a female dwarf. Like c'mon, why's it men only? There are tonnes of badass dwarven women in media. But no, the incels in your community will throw a hissyfit if you do.\n\nIf you play this game anyway, I hope you have fun...\nIf you don't, can't blame you.\nRegardless, whether you liked my review, hated it, think I'm a moron... or didn't even read the review and just skipped to the end, I hope you have a wonderful day. <3",

Kinda sucks to be robbed of progression. Lots of other bugs and glitches, I had a Dreadnought (final run boss) get frozen midair and just kept gliding... Until he went completely off screen and soft-locked my run. Next run, I was telefragged by 4 of the bomb spiders when they spawned behind the drop pod after I killed the Dreadnought.\n\nMost frustrating of all, I equipped an acid gear for Bosco and there's a looping sound that plays constantly until I reset the game that drowns out all other sound in the game.\n\nIt's still fun, and I'll still play it, but it is disappointing that it's clearly not finished.",

A measly +0.5 stat here, +0.5 stat there — nothing that feels truly satisfying. No matter what difficulty you choose, you’re left wishing you had just a bit more time to grab some extra nitra, a bit more health, or squeeze out a few more XP. As you result of the game forcing you to advance - on higher difficulties, I cant get rid of the feeling of you ending up being underpowered. \n\nAnd that 30-second rush at the end of each level? It’s just painful.\n\nI’m a huge fan of Deep Rock Galactic (over 1,000 hours played) and of this whole genre — Vampire Survivors, Yet Another Zombie Survivors, and so on — but this game has sadly turned into a torturous, never-ending, unsatisfying slog.",
