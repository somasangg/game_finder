Since Epic Games is having issues with my account so I bought it on steam, while I wait for GTA VI to be released on PC, which will likely be released after President Prabowo's term ends, I'll keep playing this game until Rockstar runs out of cows to milk.\r\n\r\nThe amount of ridiculous **** my friends and I did together on GTA online was absolutely hysterical and classic memories. This game hung on for years, and I'd say for about 7 solid years we were going absolutely bonkers and enjoying the hell out of this. Insanely well-made and pushed the envelope from a quality and cultural relevance standpoint. A forever all-timer! \r\n\r\nRating: 10/10 Long Live Chocowie!",

The graphics and the detail of the weapons, items, clothes ,characters, cars and the city itself makes for an awesome spectacule that will definetly burn into your retina. The story and the physics are somewhat weaker than GTAIV but that doesn't mean the game is bad, you can sink in lot of hours either by exploring Los Santos and Blaine county or by rampaging, messing with the  cops and / or military, or just by completing the side quests the game offers. As a 'hardcore\" GTA fan i definetly recommend it and if these criminal oriented gamed are your thing just buy it. you will not regret it.\r\n\r\nOnline its a sh*t show not meant for everyone.

Everybody has a goal to prosper in a criminal world and gain wealth. You can find everything here, from regular heists to crazy races.

I played the Bangla version while wearing my lungi, drinking white tea (dud cha), and snacking on tooth biscuit. These simple moments made gaming feel cozy and deeply enjoyable. The entire afternoon would pass quickly as I explored the city, completed missions, and lived the adventures that Vice City had to offer.\n\nThe game's open-world design, exciting missions, and vibrant atmosphere captivated me from an early age. It was more than just a game; it was a daily ritual that brought joy and a welcome break from everyday life. Even now, I find myself drawn back to it during quiet mornings, though life has become busier and it’s harder to find the same amount of time to play because of running my business.\n\nGrand Theft Auto Vice City remains a nostalgic favorite, remembered not only for its gameplay but also for its connection to those peaceful afternoons filled with simple pleasures like tea and snacks. It’s a reminder of how video games can enrich our lives, create lasting memories, and offer an escape while still being part of everyday life.",

I’ve spent more time stealing NPC cars \"just to borrow them\" than doing actual missions.\n\nGTA Online is also fun—assuming you enjoy being blown up by a flying teenager with a rocket bike every 4 seconds.

      "review": "With over 403.8 hours invested, the Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced version on PC is the definitive way to experience Los Santos. It offers a massive, rewarding experience for anyone who grew up with the classic GTA titles.\n\nThe single greatest upgrade is the implementation of Battle Eye. I know is not the best anticheat system, but one of the reasons that this game was holding me back was the great amount of cheaters on the online that simply want to ruin your experience. Battle eye and the Enhanced release led to a huge reduction in modders and glitchers, making the online environment fairer and cleaner than the legacy version. For players committed to playing legitimately, the Enhanced version delivers a vastly improved, interruption-free experience. Visually, the addition of ray tracing and the new trajectory system also provide notable quality-of-life and graphical boosts.\n\nGTA V is truly vast, with the story mode taking me about 90 hours and the rest dedicated to online progression, leveling up, and the pursuit of all 77 Steam achievements. The game’s investment in detail and mechanics is immense. Challenges like \"Live a Little\" (spending $8 million) are no longer a major grind, as modern payouts from heists make large sums easy to acquire.\n\nEssential Pro Tips for 100%\n\nTo quickly progress toward completion and secure maximum cash:\n\nStory Mode: Crucially, save Lester’s assassination missions until after you complete the main story. Use these missions to manipulate the stock market and become a billionaire, which eliminates money constraints for achievements.\n\nOnline Mode: Your first major purchase should be the Kosatka Submarine to unlock the Cayo Perico Heist. This remains the fastest, easiest way to earn money, allowing you to quickly acquire other assets and tackle high-level challenges like Criminal Mastermind and Elitist.\n\nFinal Recommendation\n\nThe Enhanced version is a must-play. It successfully cleans up the online chaos while offering hundreds of hours of complex, high-quality content, making it a fitting gem in the Grand Theft Auto legacy.",

Los Santos looks sharper, the lighting brings out details you probably never paid attention to, and the improved performance makes driving, shooting and just messing around way more satisfying. It’s the same world you remember, but it finally runs the way you always wished it did.\n\nIf you’re new, it’s surprisingly welcoming. You don’t need to know anything about past games to get hooked. The story is still one of the most entertaining campaigns in open-world games, and the city gives you the kind of freedom most modern titles still struggle to match. You can jump straight into chaos, wander around, or slowly work your way through missions at your own pace.\n\nAnd then there’s GTA Online. Whether you’re starting fresh or picking up an old character, the enhanced version cuts down the waiting and gets you into the action faster. There’s always something to do, from casual missions to full-blown heists.\n\nIn the end, GTA V Enhanced works because it gives both types of players the same thing: a huge world that feels fun the moment you step into it. If you’re coming back, it feels renewed. If you’re coming in for the first time, it feels like a world you’ve been missing out on. It’s easily one of the few games that still earns the hype.",

The missions (especially the heists) are still some of the most fun I’ve had in an open-world game.\n\nGTA Online is fun too, just… chaotic. Youll either be making money and messing around with friends, or getting blown up by some guy in a flying bike. But when it’s good, it’s genuinely a blast. There are many exploiters, but still, its an amazing game.\n\nOverall, even after all these years, this game is still worth playing. Not many games age this well.\n\n9.5/10.",

The story alone is worth the price -- Trevor, Franklin, and Michael are still some of the best characters in gaming, and the missions swing from cinematic to downright ridiculous in the best possible way.\r\n\r\nBut the real rabbit hole is GTA Online. One minute I'm grinding a heist, next thing I know I'm in a full-on street war, flying a jet I can barely control. The world is alive, unpredictable, and honestly unmatched in scope. Even after all these years, the updates keep it fresh.\r\n\r\nIf you love open-world chaos, tight gameplay, and a city that feels like a character on itw own, this game easily deserves a full 5 stars.

      "review": "GTA Enhanced feels like the version Rockstar should have shipped years ago, while GTA Legacy remains the familiar, sometimes clunky experience many players grew up with. The biggest difference hits you the moment you load in: GTA Enhanced looks and feels like a modern open-world game. Lighting is richer, textures are sharper, and the city finally has the level of detail that matches the chaos happening in it. Cars shine realistically, nights are darker and more atmospheric, and the world simply feels more alive. By comparison, GTA Legacy has a raw, nostalgic charm, but it’s also clear how dated the visuals and effects are. Legacy still works, but you’re constantly reminded that it’s running on old foundations.\n\nPerformance is where Enhanced quietly earns its name. Even with better graphics, it loads much faster and runs more smoothly on current hardware. Crowded streets, high-speed chases, and explosive moments feel less burdened by the old engine’s limitations. Legacy, while stable, has occasional stutters and long loading times that break immersion. It isn’t unplayable, but it definitely shows its age.\n\nGameplay-wise, Enhanced doesn’t reinvent the formula, but it refines almost everything. Controls feel tighter, driving is more responsive, and small frustrations from Legacy have been smoothed out. AI behavior is slightly improved, and missions flow better thanks to quality-of-life changes. Legacy, on the other hand, retains its classic feel sometimes fun, sometimes frustrating, depending on how tolerant you are of older design philosophies.\n\nWhere Enhanced truly pulls ahead is immersion. The city feels more cohesive, the atmosphere hits harder, and the improved audio-visual fidelity makes everything from quiet nighttime cruising to full-blown chaos much more satisfying. Legacy is still enjoyable, especially for players chasing nostalgia or running on weaker hardware, but it’s hard to ignore how far behind it now sits.",

      "review": "It's a very old game. While the enhanced visual is very good and reality level of model is excellent, the game mechanism is incredibly shitty, for it's a game made 10 years ago. Operation systems like driving and character moving are badly designed. The delay of initiating an action right after commanding from players to characters and unbelievable awkward movements of interaction between characters and interactive objects could be the worst matter of the game for comparative stupidity, excluding glitches that force you to re-do a mission from the very beginning while all your costs from the last trial are never covered in online session. It IS a good game 10 years ago, but not good by now and the outdated design concepts and operation system are what kill this game the most, compared to other similar games in terms of open world, massive freedom of playing, etc made recently. Overall, character moves are not smart at all and they can't move like a normal person but a tard with underdeveloped brain that causes impaired movement. What decease makes people unable to do a sharp turn-around while running right away? Why do they always gotta pause a bit for the next command of movement as if their current inertia would break their ankles and crash them to death if they didn't slow down and awkwardly pause for a second - just so their muscles could catch up with the following brain command. This ain't real at all, given that characters are designed to appear healthy.",

It was actually not *bad* in the first half, since the addition of an anticheat came round, but of course, it didn't last long as cheaters, being the rats they are, found a way. Again. It's at the point now where cheats have evolved beyond the anticheat, to the point where we ask: why is the anticheat even in the game? Then we have the real cancer they brought over from console. GTA+. While not \"bad\" on the surface for a mere 7.99, having to pay a subscription to get bonuses for a game you already paid money for is insanely predatory. While not to mention some bonuses are downright a scam, leaving you to question why you even gave them your wallet again...On the plus side, you get free games! Surley that's good....right? Well, sure, it would be, if the games you were given were fixed. You get given the AI upscaled gta trilogy and bully. Both have their own problems that require modding the game to fix. So, not only are you getting bad rewards for the game you wanted it for, you're getting slapped in the face with broken games as a \"gift\". \r\n\r\nNow for the good (Yes, I actually have something good to say!)\r\nThis is the definitive way to play (In my honest opinion) the story mode for this game. Of course the modding isn't Legacy, since it's a \"new\" game and the mod devs would have to put their mods onto this version, but for those wanting to play vanilla, the new lighting is definitely a treat, if you have the hardware headroom. \r\n\r\nAll in all, I'd say just keep playing Legacy.

Also GTAO in the multiplayer aspect is uhh.. I can't even say anything about since you can't even communicate properly ingame. Heists are repetitive, it's impossible to do classic heists without 4 players (which these days is impossible without at least 1 friend on the team (you're still destined to fail with randoms)) AND you have to restart the game every time the game can't connect to Rockstar. The only pluses here is you can run GTAO on up to 3000ping without being sent to Siberia, solo/private GTAO servers, the lil' Cayo heist, the (unsupported) mods, and yeah. that's about it. If you really want it chase your dreams but like that just buy any other game. You can get like 2-4 good games for the price of this.",

You can be doing some high stakes mission with your in game money on the line, and a cheater at any moment can kill you, relocate you, destroy your vehicle, or even crash your entire game to the desktop. 99% of servers have at least one of these people and at any moment they can alter the game for everyone. I joined a server today, Thanksgiving and they blew everyone up and crashed my game within a couple of minutes. I go restart the entire game and join a different server and am about 5 mins into it before the same exact thing happens. \r\n\r\nWhy even play when it is like this and if you really want to progress without a cheater ruining it you need to be in your own server by yourself which is extremely lame.",
