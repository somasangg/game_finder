      "review": "This is the closest I’m going to get to a Conan the Barbarian RPG in this day and age, please understand.\r\n\r\nAssassin’s Creed: Odyssey is the 2nd game in the weird Assassin’s Creed RPGs and, like, the 45th game in the entire franchise. Its probably the 15th or something, I didn’t bother to look.\r\n\r\nYou play as Alexios, or Kassandra if you like being wrong. Growing up as an orphan on the island of Kephallonia, Alexios works as a mercenary, or Mithios, and does dirty or odd jobs for people so he can get money to buy bread and olive oil or whatever it was they ate back then. After taking a job from a mysterious benefactor who is obviously not a Templar precursor guy, Alexios leaves the island with his new best friend Barnabas and his ship to assassinate the Spartan General known as the Wolf, a task that leads Alexios down a conspiracy that involves not only the Greek World, but his entire family blood line. \r\n\r\nI have, like, 80 hours in this game on gamepass. For some reason, this one specifically clicked with me, more so than Valhalla did, and I haven’t even bothered with Origins. If you aren’t familiar with the “Assassin’s Creed RPGs” they’re basically The Witcher 3 clones with a bit of Genshin Impact and some other gacha game DNA. That seems to be modern Ubisoft’s bread and butter, taking formulas from other games and turning them into their own things. They did the same with the Ghost Recon franchise and a lot of Phantom Pain DNA. \r\n\r\nI say that, but Ubisoft isn’t doing so good right now, so oopsie poopsie on their end. \r\n\r\nI don’t have the same attachment to the franchise that a lot of people did, I played the series regularly until Black Flag came out and then sort of fell off, so I was also surprised when the new AC games coming out were these weird open world RPGs that took a lot of inspiration, or flat out just stole, from games like Dark Souls and The Witcher. So I never bothered with them until 2020 or so. But how actually IS Odyssey?\r\n\r\nI like it, I mean, I like it enough that I’m going through it again. \r\n\r\nIt’s this fun open world historical RPG that doesn’t really have the grapes to be something like Kingdom Come, but this is also the setting where Adam and Eve were cybernetic proto humans and the world used to be run by a precursor hominid race that had time travel and total god-like control over their planet. I’m never expecting historical accuracy from these games, especially with how modern day Ubisoft treats historical events and contexts as these play-Doh events where they can just change whatever as to not offend a very fringe and very select group of people. \r\n\r\nOdyssey is very competent in what it does. The combat system is fun, and I’m always a big fan of open world “Choose your own path” stealth. I was informed that Origin’s stealth damage was based on your level and you spent a lot of the time just using it as a damage buffer, I don’t know exactly how true that really is. But in Odyssey, as long as the enemy isn’t a mini boss or higher level than you, you can just stab them to death before anyone knows you’re there.\r\nI say that, but I’ve assassinated some guys that were 1 or 2 levels higher than me, so they’re fairly lenient with the stealth kills. \r\n\r\nThe game plays out like an adventure. Alexios follows clues and info and travels across the entire Greek world, from Macedonia to Laconia and beyond. I spent a lot of time just traveling the roads and seeing new places, and there is a surprising amount of stuff to see.\r\n\r\nIts set during the Second Peloponnesian War, which was a conflict that involved basically all of the Greek City States, choosing sides between the Delian league (Led by the Athenians) and the Peleponnesian League, led by Sparta. Its a lot more complicated than that, but the game narrows it down to just Sparta and Athens having a bit of a spat. \r\n\r\nWay to throw the Thesians under the bus like that, I guess. \r\n\r\nThere’s a lot to do in this game, outside of the regular RPG combat and travel stuff. Ship combat is back, I don’t know if it was missing from previous games but here its in full effect. You can find islands to explore, jump pirates, pirate yourself if you really want to, hunt wanted pirates, stuff like that. \r\nThink Black Flag but with javelins and arrows instead of cannons and muskets. \r\n\r\nYou can participate in the War itself, picking a side and helping that faction take a province in exchange for money and new equipment. Sparta and Athens don’t really hold grudges, they’ll just put a bounty on your head if you screw with them too much. \r\nWhich itself is its own thing. Unique boss characters in the form of other Misthios are roaming the world and can be fought for unique loot and experience, they’ll even come looking for you if you have a bounty on your head, which can actually be intense if the bounty hunter themselves are a higher level than you. \r\n\r\nIts far enough back in the Assassin’s Creed Timeline that you can just find a lot of Isu and other messed up things laying around. There’s a landmark in the game that’s just the remains of a giant dead snake, I don’t think its ever explained, its just sort of there. Late game enemies include the Minotaur and Cyclopses as well as other mythological monsters rebranded as Isu war weapons. \r\n\r\nSo what’s wrong with it? Well, Ubisoft is wrong with it. When you pause the game, there’s always these ads for the game’s in-game store, which only has items that can be bought with premium currency. There’s also pay to win items like permanent XP boosts and extra resources for crafting and upgrades as well as exchanging real money for fake ingame money. It’s such a slimy practice and I actually don’t even know why its there. Who’s looking at tacky grim reaper armor sets and thinking “Yes, I must spend 10 actual dollars for this cosmetic item for a single player game!” \r\n\r\nBecause of this, you’re always online. They try to wave it off with the fact that you’re being fed daily quests and other people’s taken screenshots in the pause money, but I don’t need to be online to play a single player game. This game doesn’t even have that Spy vs Spy mode that was in Brotherhood and AC3, so what’s the point of this outside of just disliking your paying customers? You’re punishing people willing to give you money to get back at people who can, will, and have gotten your game for free as well as removing the DRM that just exists to punish your actual playerbase. \r\n\r\nHonestly, this game would have probably made a much bigger impact if it was called something else. Like if these RPGs were called “Assassin’s Creed adventures” or “Isu Chronicles” or something. A quasi historical RPG with fantastic elements would have been a breath of fresh air from a big name publisher. \r\n\r\nShit, set these games in the For Honor Universe, flesh that bad boy out a bit. You can still have the medieval/ Viking/ Greek/ Japanese aesthetic, just with a lot less rules the developers refuse to follow anyway.  \r\n\r\nEither or, Odyssey is a good comfort game to play, you’re just going on an Ancient Greek adventure to fight evil cults and big cyborg monsters. \r\nI don’t actually know how the Isu make their monsters, actually, if they did, maybe those things were just something you had to deal with back then. I’m sure an Assassin’s Creed fan can tell me. \r\nI just honestly don’t know why these things are mainline AC games and not their own thing.\r\n\r\nI liked it a lot, going to keep playing it for a bit, its a decent story, I like the adventure, and I think the stealth and combat is a good time. You can get it on sale from 10 to 20 dollars, depending on what version you want, I would wait for that and not go for full price.\r\n\r\nAssassin’s Creed: Large greasy men gets 8 bounty hunters jumping you out of 10. \r\n\r\nWent through the entire review and didn’t even comment on the gear system.\r\n\r\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/7124597/] Are you a Sparta guy or an Athens guy?

I have completed the entire game, including the DLC's, these are also really awesome, especially the Atlantis DLC.\n\nThe story is pretty good, but the gameplay is where it is at in Odyssey. There is a big range of different playstyles, with many different abilities that you can equip and upgrade as as you progress in the game.\n\nOdyssey is set in the world of Ancient Greece. Most of the buildings that you can see in this game are based on real historical buildings in Greece. The graphics and colours in Odyssey will blow you away. There is always something new to discover in the world of Odyssey.\n\nOdyssey managed to perfecly weave together many aspects of Ancient Greece including, but not limited to: the mythology, the history, the philosophy and the conflicts, \n\nWhat I like the most about Odyssey is how your choices really affect the world around you, even more so when compared to other RPG's. Some of the quests do tend to feel kind of stretched just for the sake to increase playtime, so that is one minus point. But looking at the big picture I would say that Odyssey is a masterpiece!\n\nVerdict: 9,7/10 - Very Good+",

      "review": "This is a fun rpg where you get to explore a sensationalized version of ancient Greece as someone who is essentially a demigod. It is *not* an Assassin's Creed game and if you go into it knowing that and expecting nothing from the previous AC titles you'll likely enjoy it a lot more. \n\nThere are several small references to AC themes like the animus and such, but they're so minute that it has only a small impact on the gameplay. \n\nIgnoring the AC title and small sections of related quests etc, its a more or less a self contained story. You play as a lost child who is blessed by Zeus and travel all of Greece to solve the mystery of what happened to you and seek out a mysterious cult set on killing you. Combat is pretty fun and relatively simple and forgiving. Ship combat is reminicent of Black Flag so fun and enjoyable. It still has stealth elements like all AC games, and eventually lets you get some actual invisiblity that can last forever with the right setup. \n\nThe DLCs are very beautiful to look at and enjoyable to play. I highly recommend them if you enjoy the game.\n\nGame has microtransactions that are all consmetic, except for a map that tells you where everything is which comes with the deluxe pack. I suggest getting this as the map is enormous and trying to get everything without it is very difficult. \n\nOverall wait for a sale and if you like simple action RPGs and beautiful scenery.",

And you know what? It works brilliantly. This isn't just an AC game; it's a love letter to choice, exploration, and Ancient Greece itself.\n\nPlaying as Kassandra felt empowering and personal. The story wove together family, legacy, and destiny in ways that kept me invested from Kephallonia to the final revelation. I managed to save my entire family and achieve that heartwarming good ending—a moment that genuinely moved me after dozens of hours building toward it.\n\n**GAMEPLAY THAT NEVER GETS OLD**\n\nThe beauty of Odyssey lies in its variety. Fort infiltrations started with careful stealth—eliminating leaders from the shadows—but sometimes erupted into glorious open combat when plans went sideways. The game accommodates both seamlessly. Whether you're an assassin, warrior, or hunter, Kassandra adapts to your moment-to-moment needs.\n\nThe mercenary system kept things spicy—random bounty hunters appearing at the worst (or best) possible times. Conquest battles made you feel like you were genuinely shaping Greece's political landscape. Leader eliminations were consistently satisfying, each one a puzzle of timing and execution.\n\n**CREATURES, HUNTS, AND ENDLESS CONTENT**\n\nMythical creature battles tested my patience and skill—some bosses demanded 10+ attempts before I found the perfect strategy. But that feeling when you finally down a legendary beast? *Chef's kiss.* Treasure hunts scattered across the Greek isles turned exploration into addiction. Every bay, every island, every mountain peak promised something new.\n\n**THE DLC EXPERIENCE**\n\n*Legacy of the First Blade* delivered emotional gut-punches and that incredible nostalgic callback to Bayek and Aya of Siwa—a moment that made this long-time AC fan tear up. Meanwhile, *Fate of Atlantis* transported me to realms of pure wonder. Atlantis itself felt like a dreamscape: flowers blooming everywhere, ornate boats gliding through crystal waters, architecture that defies imagination. It was so peaceful yet thrilling—a perfect contrast to war-torn Greece.\n\n**WHY YOU SHOULD PLAY THIS**\n\nI know some fans have mixed feelings about Odyssey's RPG direction. But having experienced every AC game from the beginning, I appreciate what the developers accomplished here. They didn't just reskin Origins; they created something genuinely unique—a perfect blend of RPG depth, assassin gameplay, meaningful choices, and historical tourism.\n\nThe romance options add flavor, the dialogue choices give weight to your decisions, and the world itself is so densely packed with content that 200 hours felt earned, never padded. Ancient Greece isn't just a setting—it's a living, breathing world that begs to be explored.\n\n**FINAL THOUGHTS**\n\nEvery achievement earned. Every question mark cleared. Every treasure found. Every conquest won. And I cherished every single moment. This game respects your time by making every hour feel rewarding.\n\nOdyssey isn't just one of the best Assassin's Creed games—it's one of the finest open-world RPGs ever made.\n\n**Chaire, fellow misthios. May your own odyssey be equally legendary! ⚔️🌊**",

Being a student and fan of ancient Greece, it was great to attend a symposium with Socrates and to meet Herodotus.\r\n\r\nNever imagined playing the game for the storyline and the experience, but here it is. The combat is average and not difficult, the quests are also not challenging from a game play point of view, the game can get repetitive, but I would still recommend it based on the overall experience of the game.

      "review": "Assassin’s Creed Odyssey — My Greek Perspective\n\nIf I were to judge Assassin’s Creed Odyssey strictly as an action-adventure RPG, I’d probably agree with most critics and call it a solid 8/10—impressive, but not without its flaws. The gameplay loop is familiar for Ubisoft fans, occasionally bloated by side content, and sometimes the combat and progression can feel repetitive. Yet, for me, Odyssey transcends its “game” status.\n\nWhy? Because, as a Greek, this title does something truly remarkable: it honors the civilization and unique atmosphere of Ancient Greece in a way no other blockbuster game has managed. The landscapes, the architecture, the historical references—even the smallest village feels alive and familiar. The attention to detail is staggering: from the way dialects sound to the vibrant recreation of Athens, Sparta, and the islands, this is as close as you can get to time-traveling to the world of my ancestors.\n\nThe mythology isn’t just window-dressing; it’s woven into the main plot and side quests elegantly, mixing legend and history the way only Greeks know how. For someone who grew up with these stories, it’s deeply moving to see them treated with such respect.\n\nIn short:\n\nFor most, Odyssey is a great game set in an exotic locale.\n\nFor Greeks, it’s a homecoming—an epic that finally does justice to our civilization’s depth and beauty.\n\nMy verdict: 10/10 as a Greek player. Ubisoft, ευχαριστώ.",

I wish that there was some sort of option to disable men hitting on you if you play as Alexios (as I find it seems to be way more than women, maybe it's because they intended for you to play as Kasandra, I don't really care). \r\n\r\nIs it a good Assassin's Creed game? No, there's not even a mention of the brotherhood anywhere in the main game except for the sections you're playing as the girl who's connecting to the \"assassin\" in the Animus. There's no mention of the Creed, nothing like that.\r\n\r\nIs it a bad game? No, as far as games go, and in typical Ubisoft fashion, it's a serviceable open-world game that feels good (relatively) to play, and there's many hours of content involved as well. It's a good game, just don't go into it expecting it to be a good Assassin's Creed game.",

Combat and stealth have some varied approaches, satisfying to complete*, story gets carried by characters being fun more than it being actually a good story but it's not too bad at the same time. Good emotional beats surprisingly. The modern day story is at peak pointlessness but it's so minimal it barely matters.\n\n*The 3 big DLC for the game are sort of middling. It's already a long game and the extra bits get too disconnected from the rest of the story and the areas aren't that great. It's not the worst if you're really chomping at the bit for more but you aren't missing much if you skip them. If you were worried about being unsure if Layla Hassan sucked or not they'll definitely make up your mind though.\n\nThe little free extra island epilogue is okay though.",

The characters are epic, and its so cool to travel and discover parts of ancient Greece that look like thousands of hours of work were put into. The only downside I would say is that some side quests and things like that can get repetitive, and they always appear, which is good and bad. I feel like I HAVE to complete all these side quests from certain villages and then new ones keep appearing, I almost wish there was a limit to them, but I guess this counts for replay value. The story so far is pretty good, interesting, illuminati stuff happens, its cool. The combat system is fun and violent, but not as much gore as I'd hope. Assassin's creed should really start adding dismemberments to the combat system. Haven't played in a long time but might come back to it. Expect to spend over 100 hours on this easily.",

What evens makes it more fun is feeling the growth when you develop your character and get stronger and defeating the cult being the Champion the best mercenary it all just makes it even better. In my opinion what makes an assassins creed isn’t just parkour leap of faith and on and on what’s make an assassins creed is people or an order that want to serve and bring justice and ancient history  also most assassins creed’s are made of vengeance the parkour and fighting are fun and enjoyable put playing it just for those things you’d miss out on a lot of things that aren’t and will never be in other games.

The world is stunning, lush, bright, and way more interesting to explore than I expected. I thought I was done with Assassin’s Creed after Syndicate, but Odyssey dragged me right back in, and now I’m here hunting down every single achievement like a madman.\r\n\r\nCombat-wise, I’ve always preferred the older style from the pre-Unity games, but I eventually adapted to the newer system. Still wish fights weren’t so drawn-out. On the flip side, I absolutely loved the ship combat—Black Flag is one of my favorite AC games, so getting back on a ship and tearing across the Aegean felt amazing.\r\n\r\nThe base game’s story really surprised me. And then the DLCs… wow.\r\nLegacy of the First Blade actually made me want to go back and properly finish Origins once I wrap this up.\r\nThe Fate of Atlantis is a whole different vibe. Elysium is insanely beautiful, One of the prettiest areas I’ve seen in the series. Underworld, even though it’s the complete opposite, somehow feels more alive. And Atlantis itself? Just plain cool.\r\n\r\nMy only big complaint: microtransactions. The game already has tons of gear and content, so locking flashy armor and weapon packs behind MTX really didn’t sit well with me.\r\n\r\nOverall, Odyssey is massive, gorgeous, and way more enjoyable than I expected. If you’re on the fence, it’s absolutely worth diving in. Just be ready to lose a lot of hours in ancient Greece.",

It really should have just been called \"Odyssey\" and that would have worked.\r\nIt's a solid RPG too, offering the freedom of choice to go whichever path you want and even have a substantial hand in the outcome of the War.\r\n\r\nUnless you're a huge fan of these historical games, I would not buy this at full-price. Wait for it and the DLC to be on sale, then give it a try. For all of my personal gripes, It's still worth revisiting every once in a while.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Good game, not Assassin's Creed.",

      "review": "Assassin’s Creed Odyssey is an open-world action RPG developed by Ubisoft and released in 2018. Set in ancient Greece during the Peloponnesian War, it expands the Assassin’s Creed formula into a full role-playing experience with branching dialogue, multiple endings, and deep character customization. It represents one of the series’ largest and most ambitious entries.\n\nPlayers control either Alexios or Kassandra, mercenaries descended from the Spartan bloodline, as they navigate political conflict, mythological mysteries, and personal discovery. The narrative explores themes of family, freedom, and destiny, with choices shaping relationships and story outcomes. The dialogue system gives players moral flexibility uncommon in earlier titles.\n\nGameplay emphasizes exploration and player agency. The map spans a massive recreation of Greece, filled with cities, islands, and naval routes. Combat is fast and fluid, focused on light and heavy attacks, dodging, and special abilities tied to a skill tree. Stealth and assassination remain core elements, though the game favors open confrontation more than earlier Assassin’s Creed entries.\n\nThe RPG systems are extensive. Players collect and upgrade weapons, armor, and ship components. The mercenary and cult systems add depth—enemies hunt the player dynamically, and unraveling the Cult of Kosmos provides long-term investigative structure. The leveling and gear progression encourage steady exploration and engagement with side content.\n\nNaval gameplay returns from Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag, reimagined for the Aegean setting. Ship combat is streamlined but satisfying, integrating smoothly with exploration and quest design. Visuals are strong across land and sea, with exceptional lighting, environmental variety, and detailed character animation.\n\nThe world design captures historical and mythological Greece with impressive scope. Temples, cities, and landscapes feel alive with NPC routines and environmental storytelling. Mythical creatures and legendary quests blend realism and fantasy, extending the world beyond strict history.\n\nIn summary, Assassin’s Creed Odyssey transforms the series into a full-scale RPG focused on choice, scale, and player expression. It sacrifices some stealth depth for freedom and scope but delivers a vast, richly detailed world. For players seeking a long, immersive adventure filled with exploration, combat, and narrative variety, it remains one of Ubisoft’s most expansive and accomplished titles.",

Ancient Greece — from Sparta to Athens to the Aegean Sea — is one of the most beautiful settings the series has ever created.\r\n\r\nRight from the start, the game gives complete freedom: choosing between Kassandra or Alexios, shaping the story through decisions, building relationships, and deciding how the world reacts to your actions. Even if not every choice changes the entire narrative, the sense of agency is refreshing.\r\n\r\nGameplay blends fast, fluid combat with the stealth roots of Assassin’s Creed. The skill tree and gear progression make leveling up satisfying, and naval gameplay aboard the Adrestia is another highlight — sailing and sea combat remain enjoyable, even after many hours.\r\n\r\nThe main story, centered around the protagonist’s family and the mysterious Cult of Cosmos, is engaging with plenty of drama, action, and memorable moments. The vast map is packed with varied regions, side quests, mythological encounters, and hidden secrets, keeping exploration constantly rewarding.\r\n\r\nEarning the platinum trophy is almost a journey of its own — clearing the map, hunting cultists, upgrading the ship, engaging in conquest battles, and exploring every last island. It’s long, but extremely satisfying for completionists.\r\n\r\nAssassin’s Creed Odyssey is one of the richest, most expansive, and immersive games in the franchise. It can be huge — even overwhelming — but it rewards dedication with unforgettable stories, tons of content, and an incredible world to explore.",

      "review": "This game is 7 years old and still requires the completely unnecessary and unhelpful Ubisoft launcher. At a price point of $59.99 for the partial game and $99.99 for the full game I can not in good conscious recommend paying for this game. While booting up this single-player game Ubisoft greeted me with a painfully slow update to their useless launcher and I thought that I might as well use that time to write this review.\n\nAs with most Ubisoft games this one was forgettable enough that I never got around to finishing it after purchasing it on sale sometime in 2022. The setting is gorgeous, and killing people is almost always fun except that AC is now an RPG franchise and if you're not a high enough lvl, then planting a sharp dagger into someone's neck is easily shrugged off. The boat stuff is okay, better than Origins, but hasn't changed much since Black Flag. \n\nThe story has you start off as a discarded Spartan warrior and sometime after a flashback of a battle from the 300 movie you Spartan-kick the early-game meanie off a cliff because the Ubisoft team has the originality and creativity of a company that decided that turning Sam Fischer into Full-Paragon Commander Shepherd was a good idea.\n\nIf you really get the itch to play this game save yourself the torment of yet another completely useless and actively obstructive launcher, as well as $60 dollars, and just pirate it.\n\n(quick edit: I mistakenly noted that the full version of the game was only $99.99 but it appears that I was in err and the complete edition of the game is instead $119.99USD)",

But after about 20 hours in I realized what I was in for. The game progression feels REALLY slow. Additionally, the story feels bland. The game is super close to being one of my favorites, but I just don't find interest in anything else but some of the gameplay. The game studio put all the work into making the map all giant and historically accurate to the point to where they forgot to make good dialogue or make interesting moments. I don't care for any of these characters because ALL of the dialogue is sooo fake. It sounds like every person you talk to is an NPC, even the characters you're meant to have a close relationship to. It feels like there is no depth at all during the time I played this game. There were no moments that left an impact on me. One of the WORST single player experiences I have ever had to experience when it comes to story building. I have 91 hours and it feels like nothing interesting happened.

Focusing on what the [i]underlying[/i] game is, what obscures it, and what the *intended* game is like.\n\nIt *seems* the game was created with the intention of refining Black Flag on top of a different map, by a very talented team. And once it was done, some *other team* came in and tried their hardest to destroy that vision. Specifically, the following are the harmful \"additions\" I was able to pinpoint that the \"havoc team\" added to the finished game, each detracting from the gameplay and the product, and being clearly orthogonal to the original game design and experience the core team was shooting for.\n\n[olist]\n[*]Levelling enemies along with the PC. This removes any sense of progress from the game.\n[*]Making it so that assassination is just one of any of ordinary attacks, so is subject to HP vs Damage calculations, which is a stark contrast to all prior titles (except origins) where a dagger in the neck spelt demise (as it does in real life). Then make it so that any enemy one level higher than the player can't be 1-shotted from stealth by giving them higher HP than any damage the player can deal out (without super-powers engaged), thus completely eradicating the \"assassin\" part of the title.\n[*]Tweak the enemy spawning so that all meaningful MOB NPCs of note spawn with 1-2 levels [i]above[/i] the player, [i]ensuring[/i] a game customer can't play as an assassin.\n[*]Not leveling gear with the PC. This [i]forces[/i] the player to do constant fetch-quest and run around \"picking flowers\" / fetching toilet paper, 99% of the time, all throughout the game (not only in the beginning), just so they can raise the gear to the level they just \"advanced\" to in order to briefly be able to assassinate an NPC. And then those fetch quests level the player again, so they have to repeat this insanely pointless and boring loop infinitum.\n[*]Make cost of \"mandatory\" upgrades scale polynomially so that the higher level the player gets, the more of the \"flower picking\" / Go there and kill X captains, activities they [i]have[/i] to do (forcing the player to do ever more un-fun activities the further they progress).\n[/olist]\n\nAs can be seen, these 5 post-completion additions are enough to completely ruin the game. If they are removed or cancelled out, it doesn't take away [i]anything[/i] from the game. That's why I surmised these were **orthogonal** and added by a different team than that which created the game itself.\n\nHaving abandoned it after 5 hours upon original purchase half a decade ago due to the tedium, I recently tried to push my self to \"experience\" this title a second time around. But this time without these game-killing \"bugs\". After having spent 4h patching out these 5 specific issues, the game actually approached Black Flag; a fort clearing \"simulator\". This change revealed the game for what it was most likely intended to be, Fort clearing from Black Flag (but watered down by not having clearing forts have any persistent and regional impact) but projected onto a map of Greece. Filling that vast and **beautiful map** of Greece the graphics artists had created with some \"content\" meant 100x amplifying the fort-counts (copy-paste) to put [i]something[/i] in all that map space. So I'd ascribe this title to a \"walking\" simulator of ancient greece with optional fort clearing whenever one gets bored of walking / trotting with the slowest asthmatic horse imaginable. If one approaches it like that and wants to peak into an artistic interpretation of ancient greece, then I think it sets the expectations properly.\n\n[list]\n[*]As an adventure game... Well I think the parent review already captured it succinctly; Everyone's \"out of toilet paper, please fetch them some\".\n[*]As an RPG. This is not one. Choices and actions have no consequence. There is no persistence. Player might as well not exist for all the \"map\" cares.\n[*]As a show-room for a stunning map of ancient greece, it nails it.\n[*]As a fort clearing title, it's about on-par with Black Flag, so *more* of *that* if that's a loop you enjoyed in the former title.\n[/list]\n\nOverall, with some patching, this surfaces the original game design vision and made me able to complete the game. I'm happy I did since the map is an absolutely stunning piece of art to have experienced. I just hope Ubi doesn't make the same mistake going forward; refraining from letting the havoc team come in once a game is done and sabotaging it like they did for this one.",

For context, I never leave reviews. If you like a game, cool. Hate it? Cool. But I just do not understand how this game is sitting so highly rated.\n\nI have never, NEVER, played a game so completely filled with and predicated on repetitive, mindless slop content. Every. Single. Quest is 'mistios, I've run out of toilet paper, please kill the bandits that took it' or, even worse, 'sprint around in a 100m radius circle to collect 5 leaves, I've been waiting weeks for a hero like you to come along and help'. Every quest objective is ever so slightly far away as well to feel like a complete chore to get there. This isn't just the case for the hundreds of side quests, but the main quest as well. \n\nSpeaking of the main quest, I'd heard positive things and sadly I think those people singing the game's praises were playing a different game. To be clear there are sections of the main story I enjoyed, sections with genuinely rewarding emotional payoffs, genuinely impressive motion capture helping sell tragedy in some moments, and some great voice acting by Kassandra's voice actor. However most of what you'll be doing feels ancillary, unimportant and a complete waste of time in a game already bloated with slop content. Worst of all, I'd heard the payoff was worth it but the story just sort of... ends? The modern day aspects are also by far the worst aspects, full of characters I had genuine disdain for and, again, zero payoff.\n\nThe gameplay itself, depite the 'RPG' mechanics, is a basic and brain-dead as it's ever been in this franchise. Parkour is the biggest culprit with near enough no depth and the abilities to completely negate fall damage 10 hours into the game, and completely scale 95% of surfaces without any thought as to your path from the opening minutes of the game. Combat is animation driven slop with an incredibly low skill-ceiling and a reliance on long 'super-power' abilities that I'd honestly um and ah over whether to use. On the one hand the fight (and my misery) might end sooner, but on the other the 15 second combat animation might mean I'd be better off button mashing. If you insist on playing this game I implore you, gear yourself towards a high crit chance and crit damage build that can one-shot enemies and turn the difficulty down to easy, you'll be done a good few hours sooner.\n\nThe game is also this awkward hodge-podge of all the worst ideas from other games. Did you love the inane map-marker driven nonsense in the witcher 3? Did you also feel that while the witcher 3 was a masterpiece in some regards, the combat was a weaker aspect of the package? Good news, we've got thousands of cut and paste map markers and the combat is worse than in the witcher. Did you like the nemesis system in the LOTR Shadow franchise? Then you'll love this completely gutted, characterless mercenary system blatant copy of it. It even takes genuinely good aspects of previous games in the franchise and makes them inexplicably worse. How is the naval combat in Black Flag SO much more enjoyable, versatile and well-executed than a game by the same developers, released 4 or 5 years after it? \n\nMy final vent is the length and the DLCs. At this stage I'm about halfway through the Fate of Atlantis. Throughout my 85ish hours with the game I've been debating whether my thoughts are it's bad game or just a mindless game that's not for me. I was thinking the latter held true but this game is so intent on showing more and more hours of pointlessness down my throat that I simply can't picture anyone who'd enjoy the content on offer stretched over this length. Genuinely, I want to meet them, the same way I'd be interested to discuss with a serial killer why they are the way they are so I can just understand how their brain works more than anything. I thought approx 7.5hrs ago that I was finally coming to end with this game but had the awful realisation this final DLC looked a little large. So I googled. 15 hours long. I'm trying. Seriously, I'm trying to get through it. But the negatives of the main game are even sharper here with even less payoff. I think I might have to give up on this torture, I'm getting more enjoyment writing about how you should please, please avoid this slop than actually pushing through the final 5 hours to at least mentally tick this game off and parcel it away in my library to never touch again.\n\nHOWEVER, it's not all bad. The game looks gorgeous. The sync point towers provide from some great screenshot opportunities across varied and genuinely gorgeous biomes. It feels like a success in being an 'odyssey' in this respect. It runs surprisingly well as well. I've got a strong rig but I was genuinely surprised to see I could push 1440p ultrawide at 100fps (with dips to 80ish in city areas). Additionally, there was a period of about 10hrs where I just roamed the Aegean, landing on new islands, completing quest chains and indiscriminately stabbing my way through Greece. This felt like the game I imagined it could be. Well put together, contained, gorgeous, a genuine sense of discovery. Were all these positive worth the slog of the remainder of the game though? No. Not even slightly. This game is a case study in how to create a gorgeous, soulless time sink that has no regard for the intelligence or time of players and I'm genuinely baffled as to how this half-baked RPG nonsense the franchise has turned to hasn't completely killed this tired franchise that I (for better or worse) spent so much time with as a kid.\n\nBy all means give it a go, but if you aren't hooked within 2hrs, please please refund this. It doesn't get better, it just gets longer.",

You can run around, complete quests, find treasure, fight in naval combat. The voice acting is good, the cutscenes are... there. The story is predictable, but serviceable. As far as the sheer amount of stuff to do, it's practically bursting at the seams. Sounds fine so far. Then you start to look a bit deeper. Then you start to look a bit deeper. Then you start to look a bit deeper.\n\nOh, sorry, did I repeat myself? Did that bug you? If so, you are not going to like this game, the name of which, of course, is copy paste. So many locations have the same objectives, the same rewards, the same buildings, the same building [i]layouts[/i]. Thank goodness Greece isn't a real country, otherwise this would be lazy. Often the only way to differentiate one location from another is by looking at your map. While you're there, why not take a look at the shop? The in-game shop... with a dedicated... button.\n\nHey you! We know that our game is big. Really big. And you might have also guessed that a lot of it contains the same crap. We here at Ubisoft Inc. want to ease your boredom, and help you get through [strike]the whole game[/strike] all the monotony to get to the really fun stuff! The stuff you're here for! And now, it's more convenient than ever. Simply buy our premium in-game currency, and you're on your way to buying crafting materials, weapons, lieutenants (NPCs that help you); hell, we'll even sell you maps that show where everything is. Because we both know, at the end of the day, that this is a product. A boring, bloated product that is designed to do one thing: extract as much cash from you as possible before you lose interest. \n\nI'm 32 as of writing this, and believe it or not, I actually remember when AAA games were fun. I remember renting the first Assassin's Creed game for the Xbox 360 and thinking \"holy shit, this looks amazing, so life-like\". Just the act of running around across the rooftops, sneaking up on guards, the whole historical angle (I was a big history nerd back then) mixed with a sci-fi story that was so mysterious as it unfolded. What was all that writing on the walls of Desmond's room? What was the Apple? Is it alien? I dunno. Then Assassin's Creed 2 came out and it just blew my mind. I wasn't up-to-date on video game news back then so I didn't even know that people knew about this game, and then there's a sequel?? I was so excited, and it was so much better than the first. Following Ezio from humble beginnings to becoming a skilled Assassin, slowly uncovering this massive conspiracy that spans all of human history, and more of those damn Apples. It was so much fun.\n\nHonestly, I don't want to dislike this game. I don't want to see a new Assassin's Creed release and hit Ignore before the trailer even loads with a dull, resigned look on my face. I don't want to feel bad about buying a game because the creative director is a cheating asshole (I mean, I didn't buy Valhalla, but the point still stands). AAA studios have the resources to create amazing games, or at least games that I enjoyed: Halo, Gears of War, Dead Space, God of War, the list goes on and on. But money corrupts absolutely, I guess. I don't know. I just feel sad when I think about it. Things like this game, however unimportant it may be in the grand scheme of things, should teach us to create for the love of creating, the joy of the craft, not for profit or a quota.",

Unlike RDR2, or Witcher 3, in which the size of the game is the appeal, here the size of the game becomes a burden. I struggle to find the motivation to churn through and finish the game and probably am done here, barely making a dent in the main story.\r\nSo many of the side quests lack any substance and are the same formula of random back story, generic kill bandit / thug / soldiers and report back. The sheer number of quests you can undertake is just overwhelming, and I think that is where the game loses its identity. Instead of sticking to core AC lore, with a focus on detailed locations and architecture and stealth, it tries to be a RDR2 or Witcher 3 with way more open world game play. Which is fine, but they went for quantity over quality. So each new region you move to offers nothing new or unique other than the scenery, which loses its luster quickly since a bulk majority of the game play exists in random forts and there ends up being nothing unique about the enemies. I realized that the timed missions are completely pointless in the grand scheme of things, other then to discourage you from grinding through levels and just buy your way through the campaign.\r\nThe combat was interesting at first, but once you encounter the mini-boss commander/captain enemies, combat is geared towards cheesing your way through since their HP bars are so massive. Sticking to normal combat for these guys would take forever so you have to spam special attacks over and over again, not due to the uniqueness of the enemy, their attack patterns, etc, just cause your player feels so weak compared to these enemies. The fact that you can't clear a base on pure stealth just shows this franchise has lost it's identity. \r\nIt's feels like the main purpose of all of this is to have you make in-game purchases so your character can actually compete. Thankfully I read reviews prior to purchasing so I waited until I got it on sale, and even still I feel as if I overpaid.",

Focusing on what the [i]underlying[/i] game is, what obscures it, and what the *intended* game is like.\n\nIt *seems* the game was created with the intention of refining Black Flag on top of a different map, by a very talented team. And once it was done, some *other team* came in and tried their hardest to destroy that vision. Specifically, the following are the harmful \"additions\" I was able to pinpoint that the \"havoc team\" added to the finished game, each detracting from the gameplay and the product, and being clearly orthogonal to the original game design and experience the core team was shooting for.\n\n[olist]\n[*]Levelling enemies along with the PC. This removes any sense of progress from the game.\n[*]Making it so that assassination is just one of any of ordinary attacks, so is subject to HP vs Damage calculations, which is a stark contrast to all prior titles (except origins) where a dagger in the neck spelt demise (as it does in real life). Then make it so that any enemy one level higher than the player can't be 1-shotted from stealth by giving them higher HP than any damage the player can deal out (without super-powers engaged), thus completely eradicating the \"assassin\" part of the title.\n[*]Tweak the enemy spawning so that all meaningful MOB NPCs of note spawn with 1-2 levels [i]above[/i] the player, [i]ensuring[/i] a game customer can't play as an assassin.\n[*]Not leveling gear with the PC. This [i]forces[/i] the player to do constant fetch-quest and run around \"picking flowers\" / fetching toilet paper, 99% of the time, all throughout the game (not only in the beginning), just so they can raise the gear to the level they just \"advanced\" to in order to briefly be able to assassinate an NPC. And then those fetch quests level the player again, so they have to repeat this insanely pointless and boring loop infinitum.\n[*]Make cost of \"mandatory\" upgrades scale polynomially so that the higher level the player gets, the more of the \"flower picking\" / Go there and kill X captains, activities they [i]have[/i] to do (forcing the player to do ever more un-fun activities the further they progress).\n[/olist]\n\nAs can be seen, these 5 post-completion additions are enough to completely ruin the game. If they are removed or cancelled out, it doesn't take away [i]anything[/i] from the game. That's why I surmised these were **orthogonal** and added by a different team than that which created the game itself.\n\nHaving abandoned it after 5 hours upon original purchase half a decade ago due to the tedium, I recently tried to push my self to \"experience\" this title a second time around. But this time without these game-killing \"bugs\". After having spent 4h patching out these 5 specific issues, the game actually approached Black Flag; a fort clearing \"simulator\". This change revealed the game for what it was most likely intended to be, Fort clearing from Black Flag (but watered down by not having clearing forts have any persistent and regional impact) but projected onto a map of Greece. Filling that vast and **beautiful map** of Greece the graphics artists had created with some \"content\" meant 100x amplifying the fort-counts (copy-paste) to put [i]something[/i] in all that map space. So I'd ascribe this title to a \"walking\" simulator of ancient greece with optional fort clearing whenever one gets bored of walking / trotting with the slowest asthmatic horse imaginable. If one approaches it like that and wants to peak into an artistic interpretation of ancient greece, then I think it sets the expectations properly.\n\n[list]\n[*]As an adventure game... Well I think the parent review already captured it succinctly; Everyone's \"out of toilet paper, please fetch them some\".\n[*]As an RPG. This is not one. Choices and actions have no consequence. There is no persistence. Player might as well not exist for all the \"map\" cares.\n[*]As a show-room for a stunning map of ancient greece, it nails it.\n[*]As a fort clearing title, it's about on-par with Black Flag, so *more* of *that* if that's a loop you enjoyed in the former title.\n[/list]\n\nOverall, with some patching, this surfaces the original game design vision and made me able to complete the game. I'm happy I did since the map is an absolutely stunning piece of art to have experienced. I just hope Ubi doesn't make the same mistake going forward; refraining from letting the havoc team come in once a game is done and sabotaging it like they did for this one.",

      "review": "started playing it in 2025 again. i absolutely regret wasting my money in any of ubisofts game same bloody issues which were there back when i had first started playing the game. micro stutterings every 4-5 secs . ubisoft used to be my fav since warrior within. its the worst now. i absolutely hate it. ur games have lost everything, there are no stories, no emotions, even the performance of the games have gone down cause of bugs that ubisoft dsnt even care to fix and this isnt just specific to assassin's creed games, all the ubisoft games(star war's graph has been going down steadily with each sequel).instead of  releasing sub standard games in bulk, bring back the honesty and dedication towards games instead of just focusing on making money. last game was shadows that i had bought. never again. its a shame and such a disappointment. the older guys of ubisoft from back in 2000s had brains, creativity, dedication. now it feels like ubisoft just wants to scam people by releasing sub standard games which they dont even care to support properly or even fix the problems. before providing us with more content maybe take some time to iron out the kinks of the already existing problems. bring back the quality instead of the quantity which is all ubisoft is focusing on nowadays. such a bloody disappointment. my specs 3080 rtx 8gb, amd ryzen 9, 16gb ram, ssd. have tried everything that there is to try. ubisoft SUCKS!!!!",

It feels so shallow; the combat lacks depth and variety (different weapon types really don't feel impactful), and I couldn't care less about any of the characters I've met so far.\nI've played a couple of mainstream AAA titles recently, and even then this feels so soulless it's astonishing. Not even the animations are good for the time this came out. It's not the casual fun I wanted, but just a dry lump of incredibly meaningless content that wasted five hours of my life. Only thing I could like about this was the environmental design of ancient Greece. \nGet Ghost of Tsushima or maybe the Horizon Franchise if you want some high prod value, very casual games to explore cool worlds in.",

      "review": "If you're curious whether everything negative people say about the 'RPG' AC games is true, like I was, let me save you 80+ hours and confirm it's all true. For context, I never leave reviews. If you like a game, cool. Hate it? Cool. But I just do not understand how this game is sitting so highly rated.\n\nI have never, NEVER, played a game so completely filled with and predicated on repetitive, mindless slop content. Every. Single. Quest is 'mistios, I've run out of toilet paper, please kill the bandits that took it' or, even worse, 'sprint around in a 100m radius circle to collect 5 leaves, I've been waiting weeks for a hero like you to come along and help'. Every quest objective is ever so slightly far away as well to feel like a complete chore to get there. This isn't just the case for the hundreds of side quests, but the main quest as well. \n\nSpeaking of the main quest, I'd heard positive things and sadly I think those people singing the game's praises were playing a different game. To be clear there are sections of the main story I enjoyed, sections with genuinely rewarding emotional payoffs, genuinely impressive motion capture helping sell tragedy in some moments, and some great voice acting by Kassandra's voice actor. However most of what you'll be doing feels ancillary, unimportant and a complete waste of time in a game already bloated with slop content. Worst of all, I'd heard the payoff was worth it but the story just sort of... ends? The modern day aspects are also by far the worst aspects, full of characters I had genuine disdain for and, again, zero payoff.\n\nThe gameplay itself, depite the 'RPG' mechanics, is a basic and brain-dead as it's ever been in this franchise. Parkour is the biggest culprit with near enough no depth and the abilities to completely negate fall damage 10 hours into the game, and completely scale 95% of surfaces without any thought as to your path from the opening minutes of the game. Combat is animation driven slop with an incredibly low skill-ceiling and a reliance on long 'super-power' abilities that I'd honestly um and ah over whether to use. On the one hand the fight (and my misery) might end sooner, but on the other the 15 second combat animation might mean I'd be better off button mashing. If you insist on playing this game I implore you, gear yourself towards a high crit chance and crit damage build that can one-shot enemies and turn the difficulty down to easy, you'll be done a good few hours sooner.\n\nThe game is also this awkward hodge-podge of all the worst ideas from other games. Did you love the inane map-marker driven nonsense in the witcher 3? Did you also feel that while the witcher 3 was a masterpiece in some regards, the combat was a weaker aspect of the package? Good news, we've got thousands of cut and paste map markers and the combat is worse than in the witcher. Did you like the nemesis system in the LOTR Shadow franchise? Then you'll love this completely gutted, characterless mercenary system blatant copy of it. It even takes genuinely good aspects of previous games in the franchise and makes them inexplicably worse. How is the naval combat in Black Flag SO much more enjoyable, versatile and well-executed than a game by the same developers, released 4 or 5 years after it? \n\nMy final vent is the length and the DLCs. At this stage I'm about halfway through the Fate of Atlantis. Throughout my 85ish hours with the game I've been debating whether my thoughts are it's bad game or just a mindless game that's not for me. I was thinking the latter held true but this game is so intent on showing more and more hours of pointlessness down my throat that I simply can't picture anyone who'd enjoy the content on offer stretched over this length. Genuinely, I want to meet them, the same way I'd be interested to discuss with a serial killer why they are the way they are so I can just understand how their brain works more than anything. I thought approx 7.5hrs ago that I was finally coming to end with this game but had the awful realisation this final DLC looked a little large. So I googled. 15 hours long. I'm trying. Seriously, I'm trying to get through it. But the negatives of the main game are even sharper here with even less payoff. I think I might have to give up on this torture, I'm getting more enjoyment writing about how you should please, please avoid this slop than actually pushing through the final 5 hours to at least mentally tick this game off and parcel it away in my library to never touch again.\n\nHOWEVER, it's not all bad. The game looks gorgeous. The sync point towers provide from some great screenshot opportunities across varied and genuinely gorgeous biomes. It feels like a success in being an 'odyssey' in this respect. It runs surprisingly well as well. I've got a strong rig but I was genuinely surprised to see I could push 1440p ultrawide at 100fps (with dips to 80ish in city areas). Additionally, there was a period of about 10hrs where I just roamed the Aegean, landing on new islands, completing quest chains and indiscriminately stabbing my way through Greece. This felt like the game I imagined it could be. Well put together, contained, gorgeous, a genuine sense of discovery. Were all these positive worth the slog of the remainder of the game though? No. Not even slightly. This game is a case study in how to create a gorgeous, soulless time sink that has no regard for the intelligence or time of players and I'm genuinely baffled as to how this half-baked RPG nonsense the franchise has turned to hasn't completely killed this tired franchise that I (for better or worse) spent so much time with as a kid.\n\nBy all means give it a go, but if you aren't hooked within 2hrs, please please refund this. It doesn't get better, it just gets longer.",
