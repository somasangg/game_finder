Graphics are dated of course but frankly if you're busy zoomed in watching your infantry slog it out then you're problem missing enemy cav smashing your archers. There are so many features in this missing from newer Total Wars. Crusades/Jihad, population, unlimited build slots, sending units around without generals. It's pretty easy (unmodded at least), but unlike other game franchises it doesn't feel like Med 2 has been made irrelevant by later releases. It still stands strong and will always be worth checking out regardless of which game you started out on.",

The campaign is a bit lacking in certain aspects but not a complete failure. It's a game about war and domination so expect extremely limited diplomacy and trade features. Extremely satisfying to command such large armies and watch the individual units behave so realistically, most of the time. The first in the series to feature differently textured soldiers in the same unit. Mods gave a lot of life to the game for decades. Overall a great game that left its mark in history but can be improved upon.",
