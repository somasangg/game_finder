But there are cheaters utilising hacks where they disappear under the map and attack unseen, often increasing their own speed and weapon damage in the process. You report these cheats, but don't get feedback on if they have been banned. If you leave a match before the end (usually when someone is cheating) you are penalised - leave too often and you can suffer a matchmaking penalty.  The game structure is 'Pay to Win'  and there is always going to be someone out there willing to spend more than you. You arent guaranteed the things you want in the boxes you buy - encouraging you to continue buying and even when you do get the latest bot with the most powerful weapons, at the end of that season, they nerf everything youve spent money on - down. Then release a new tranche of bots and weapons all way more powerful than yours - now the cycle begins again. I'm at the point where I figure Ive spent enough money on my robot hangars now,, not planning on giving them any more.",

This doesn't mean you won't win the match, however, since the game pretty much decides if you will win the next match you play based on your current win rate. It tries to keep it at 50%. So whether or not you buy the next meta cycle only decides how easy engagement will be, and only against players who spend less. The only way to be able to win more than lose is to play with a full squad of maxed players, where you will then match against the same. Then the more skillful team wins. In short, super pay to win game in terms of engagement within battles, not so much in terms of winning games. It does get easier with time, albeit a LOT of time. I would say you have to put in at roughly 400 hrs for it to happen. Very fun gameplay loop when your'e not getting your skull bashed in, though.

It's slower than Mech Warrior.  I can see if some mechs are slower than others, but they all seem to be roughly the same.  Torso rotation didn't seem to make a diffirence between light and heavier mechs.  It seems the only difference between them is capability to carry heavier weapons, speed and armor/life.  The customization of your mech is nice, but it's a pain to get additional parts.  Also, my twitch intergration didn't work, so the free parts for watching streams was useless.   Might revisit to see what work they've done, but as is right now, just not a fan.  I think the game does have potential, though, especially for a free game.  Difficulty ramp is a bit steep, and I suspect it's p2w (it usually is in f2p), but I got bored before investing enough time to find out.  Speaking of time, the time delay to improve mechs is really irritating, nothing like a game you can't play while you wait for your mech to improve (in real time) after investing credits.  I don't know why devs insist on this mechanic.  I get that they want you to pay money to *not* wait 2 days for your mech to upgrade,  but what is just going to happen is I'll stop playing your game for 2 days, and then some other new shiny will get my attention and I'm just that much more likely to never play your game again.  Especially when there's all the hotness out there that you're competing against if your game is the hottest one out there, which (to be clear) this game, very much, is not.\n\nTL;DR  If you're not a fan of giant robots, this probably isn't for you.  Even if you are a fan of giant robots smashing the crap out of each other, there's better games than this.  But it's f2p, so why don't you give it a shot?

It's a literal catastrophy of what it is today, everything is locked down behind a paywall, and their excuse is that you can actually grind to get whatever Robot or Weapon you want. Even though grinding in this game is terrible.\nThe developers managed to completely destroy this game, the community now is so toxic, and skill based matchmaking is completely gone. Because the developers know well that the player who pays the most, is the winner.\nRobots aren't worth it anymore, because they get weal in the next season, not because they nerfed it, but simply because a better robot released.\nIt's sad to see my favorite childhood game drenched in infinite progress bars, fancy robots locked behind paywalls, and everything requires currencies you can't even get through normal matches. And the issue is that the rewards you get from winning a match is completely useless, you can pay 5$ to get gold bars that are worth dozens of matches rewards.\nThis game had the potential to be a really good game, I mean the idea that big robots fighting with cool weapons is just so good, and in an addition to the huge variety of robots abilities like Double jump or a magical shield or dash adds depth to your builds.

The ultimate versions of the robots are literally impossible to kill unless you spend a load of money which most likely won't work because someone will always spend more.\nAnother problem is that some ships like \"Beholder\" for example is just plain annoying as the beam keeps chasing a specific target and certainly more annoying since most robots can't outrun it and another ship called \"Thor\" is another can of worms, the damage out put of that ship is so high that it can literally almost kill most robots before they can even leave the damage zone. Highly recommend not downloading this game unless you want to be a punching bag for those that spend thousands on the game, you can't out compete high spenders.",
