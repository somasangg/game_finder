It *is* a roguelike, but it still feels short, and runs don't feel as random as others do. I frequently am capable of getting a similar build each run with enough knowledge of what I am going for. The item diversity is heavily weighed into the purple rarity, with anything less being general stat boosts and anything higher being almost exclusively dropped from bosses. Some weapons aren't as diverse as they could, examples being bow literally only having the simple bow category, along with their new Katana weapon type being only regular katanas, while some like the dual wield weapons having a distinct lack of daggers in the higher tiers, mostly consisting of dual swords and axes in the later end weapons.

Recommend to play with 1-3 friends.\r\n\r\n2D sidescrolling rogue-lite that is enjoyable with cute art. \r\nYou start the game by making a character then spawning in the hub area. There are a few NPCs to interact with who will allow you to improve your character via stats, cosmetic or gameplay unlocks, or increase difficulty.\r\n\r\nGameplay: You pick a starting weapon of choice then progress through regions 1-4 where the levels in each region are randomized. When each level is beat you are given a random choice of 3 treasures. Each level will then let you have a minor choice of what you will face next: easy, hard, challenge, or a level with a merchant. There are a few unique levels that you will come across, however.\r\nOnce you've progressed through all the levels you'll encounter a merchant then a boss, after which you'll move to the next region.\r\n\r\nIf you make it through all regions and fight the final boss you'll be sent back with a bit of game lore on how it is that you're able to die and repeat the game. Also, turns out, there may be a true final boss that can only be accessed by increasing the game's difficulty. The difficulty increases are done by making gameplay restrictions, such as number of choices when picking items, reduced healing, etc.\r\n\r\nDownsides: the basic combat mechanics aren't complex. There's not an enormous amount of content. There are some translation errors that cause issues with interpreting what exactly an item does. Some items have descriptions like [does Error amount of damage], but you're still able to get the gist of what they do.\r\n\r\nPros: combat variety comes from different weapons and equipment. Devs seem regularly active with a clear roadmap. Hopefully this game does well enough for them to create more content. The art is cute and there's a surprising amount of character customization.",

I love this game, and I do recommend it!\n\nHowever, buyer beware that 1) The game isn't finished yet (though they are updating it consistently), and 2) The multiplayer is extremely bad about disconnections. Most of the time this isn't an issue but when you have a friend that disconnects, they will not be able to rejoin - which can be a serious dealbreaker.",

Recommend to play with 1-3 friends.\r\n\r\n2D sidescrolling rogue-lite that is enjoyable with cute art. \r\nYou start the game by making a character then spawning in the hub area. There are a few NPCs to interact with who will allow you to improve your character via stats, cosmetic or gameplay unlocks, or increase difficulty.\r\n\r\nGameplay: You pick a starting weapon of choice then progress through regions 1-4 where the levels in each region are randomized. When each level is beat you are given a random choice of 3 treasures. Each level will then let you have a minor choice of what you will face next: easy, hard, challenge, or a level with a merchant. There are a few unique levels that you will come across, however.\r\nOnce you've progressed through all the levels you'll encounter a merchant then a boss, after which you'll move to the next region.\r\n\r\nIf you make it through all regions and fight the final boss you'll be sent back with a bit of game lore on how it is that you're able to die and repeat the game. Also, turns out, there may be a true final boss that can only be accessed by increasing the game's difficulty. The difficulty increases are done by making gameplay restrictions, such as number of choices when picking items, reduced healing, etc.\r\n\r\nDownsides: the basic combat mechanics aren't complex. There's not an enormous amount of content. There are some translation errors that cause issues with interpreting what exactly an item does. Some items have descriptions like [does Error amount of damage], but you're still able to get the gist of what they do.\r\n\r\nPros: combat variety comes from different weapons and equipment. Devs seem regularly active with a clear roadmap. Hopefully this game does well enough for them to create more content. The art is cute and there's a surprising amount of character customization.",

It has a lot of weapon variety and even within those weapons there are sometimes other types.\r\n\r\nMy issues with this game arise with how short a run can last. It *is* a roguelike, but it still feels short, and runs don't feel as random as others do. I frequently am capable of getting a similar build each run with enough knowledge of what I am going for. The item diversity is heavily weighed into the purple rarity, with anything less being general stat boosts and anything higher being almost exclusively dropped from bosses. Some weapons aren't as diverse as they could, examples being bow literally only having the simple bow category, along with their new Katana weapon type being only regular katanas, while some like the dual wield weapons having a distinct lack of daggers in the higher tiers, mostly consisting of dual swords and axes in the later end weapons. Certain sets are also missing in some weapons, like the Sanctuary set being a constant in every category... besides the 3 newest added weapon types.",

      "review": "Fun, straight-forward roguelike.  Perfect for newbies to the genre, and fun for veteran players.  No need to play the first Lost Castle to enjoy this.  Would recommend to everyone.\n\nRoguelikes are games where one or several earned rewards from a playthrough is saved, but everything else is reset upon restarting.  In Lost Castle 2, gold drops to \"upgrade your town\" so each run becomes easier.  Gold is also used to buy permanent glamour for your unique character.  Almost everything else - weapons, armors, their upgrades, your treasure found... it all resets every playthrough.\n\nGame is easily approachable.  Every run, you choose from 1 of 9 different weapons to try, each with a unique combo system.  Then assign 1 of 3 classes of armor.  Those items are supported with dozens of treasures, allowing very different builds.  Newbies can be successful creating a build without knowledge of item combinations.  With more plays, stronger builds can be foreseen.  Again, nothing here is complicated, but lots of diversity.  Single-target, multi-target, area-of-effect, damage-over-time, summons, transformations, throws, dashes, blocks - you can even RIDE your enemies.  I rode an Anglerfish.  I even BECAME one!\n\nDifficulty can be scaled - easy, normal, and torment levels - enough to challenge anyone, even veterans.  Bosses have fun mechanics, and not every attack is telegraphed.  Pathing to various zones and random boss encounters also keeps things fresh.  Completing a run feels good.  Overall, a solid title.  I'll hang out by the campfire for a while, I think.",
