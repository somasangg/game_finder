I'm a father who barely has time to play so i've always looked for a game i can play casually and without any pressure of being stuck in a match for minutes or hours. I randomly came up to this game on YouTube and decided to give it a try after watching some reviews and I am sold. This game is very fun yet serious, doesn't require for you to stay logged in a match for long periods of time and is offline. I highly recommend this game as an entry for extraction shooters or for any other father who is looking for a game they can play in short period of times.",

Can still be quite challenging whilst keeping that gameplay loop of dopamine hits when the right item drops.\r\n\r\nSome stand out positives:\r\nFantastic game with a lot of progression systems to keep the player pushing forward. If you ever feel stuck or struggling, you can grind some of the meta-progression to get stronger.\r\nSteam Workshop Support with a huge amount of QOL mods; if you find any annoyances within the game, there is likely a mod to remove/adjust it.\r\nDifficulty options to adjust if you find the game too easy or too difficult.\r\nAmazing sound design, can be very immersive.

And you will be angry, trust me but its worth it to overcome the challenges thrown in your way\nMy loot is gone for good if I die and man I did die a lot but its really fun grinding for gear and pushing the limits \n\nThe bosses are unfair at some points, fk you Lordon, and require some really good preparation and tactics. \nLittle hint: not all NPCs are friendly to each other *wink wink* - so use that to your advantage \n\nI actually lowered the difficulty twice out of rage but it didn't feel right and pushed my ego to overcome the challenges on extreme - its so worth it \n\nIm currently on the third map, which kicks my ass quite a lot due to enemies having better gear, weapons and ammunition and its really worth it if you get to kill and loot them\n\nThe progression feels good so far and if youre lucky with drops you can get a nice headstart in terms of money (i found 2 ledX in my first 5hrs of playtime and 4 graphic cards in the first 15hrs but I kept them) \n\nCustomization in this game feels good and matters a lot - try not to use stock weapons too much \neach weapon is useable, some more than others but I didn't see a \"meta\" so far (there might be later on to farm the endgame more efficiently but I dont know) \n\nI can't say too much about the story as I often just skipped the letters found in the world which contain a bit of story but I will read them all - I dont expect too much tho \n\nI also can't say too much about the economy since I am a hoarder by heart (my stash is worth over 500k now) but it doesn't feel impossible or unfair if you die a lot and need to rebuy gear \n\nMods are a great addition to the game and I am using a few QoL mods like a hunger/thirst tracker, how much items are worth so I dont have to memorize their sell prices and a sped up timer for the abilities you can unlock (which can take some time to finish) \n\nOh, ENVELOPES are super cool! Gacha is great and these things can give you really good loot, IF youre lucky! \n\nThe game is overall an 8/10 for me so far and well worth the price, even more so in future sales \n\nI hope they continue to update the game with new content as this game is an evergreen in my eyes",

These NPCs will provide you with an easier access to some materials for crafting as well as more quests with more rewards.\r\nThe game also rewards very long term planning as you can see the requirements for every upgrade from the get-go allowing you to mark important items that you shouldn't sell wihch makes progression a lot smoother.\r\n\r\n[h3]Progression[/h3]\r\nAs you raid and extract and complete quests, you will get experience, this experience will allow you to level up which unlocks access to new upgrades both for your character but also for your base facilities which can be upgraded to provide even better services.\r\nAll these upgrades require materials and money which means you'll need to either choose carefully how you spend your money or you'll just need to do some extra quests and raids to get more money and materials. Given that you have no time pressure you could just sit back and farm towards something you really want and complete side quests along the way.\r\n\r\n[h3]Sound design[/h3]\r\nThe sound design is great and its inclusion into gameplay makes it feel all the more satisfying as you hear gunshots in the distance indicating a skirmish between two rival factions which also indicates where you can find loot.\r\nBut it goes much deeper than that as the sound the player makes is also very important to the gameplay.\r\nFor instance, if you walk you make noise and if you run you make even more noise, making enemies aware of your presence that much faster. However if you aim by holding right click you will also sneak which makes no noise and allows you to sneak past enemies provided they don't see you.\r\nBut you can also use the sound to your advantage as enemies will check out any noise that they hear, allowing you to stay behind cover and bait them into traps like mines, bear traps or just a regular ambush where you engage at your prefered distance.\r\nThe sound enemies make is of equal importance as it allows you to know not only where they are but also their state as much like in Metal Gear, enemies have a sound for being on alert and a sound for engaging in combat allowing you to gather intel without even seeing the enemy. Also hearing the enemy shoot their guns obviously tells you what weapon they are using which allows you to engage at long range for instance if they use a close range weapon like a shotgun.\r\n\r\n[h2]Conclusion/TL;DR[/h2]\r\n\r\nAll in all a very addicting game with a simple gameplay loop that can be stretched over a long period if you want with a difficulty that can be set at any time through options and gameplay.",

But once you get to Jlabs, it becomes considerably less fun and more of a grind. Specifically, the chore of finding keys; it is not obvious where or how to find them and you must search reddit for the answers from people who stumbled upon them. The quests and base building also stagnate/drop off once you get to Jlabs, which makes the game feel empty as you soullessly search through boxes and crates hoping to find something new and useful. A lot of this can be fixed by adding more quests, more items, more NPCs, more base building opportunities, increasing the drop rate of rare items and keys late game, adding more environmental events, etc. \n\nThis review is just my opinion on what the devs can do to take it from great to legendary. <3 Thanks so much for making this awesome game. I can't wait to see how you improve it in the future!\n\ntldr, I hope the team just adds more quality stuff late game to keep it interesting and engaging.",

It takes the best parts of the Escape from Tarkov formula and removes the frustrating PvP stress.\r\n\r\nWhat you got:\r\n1) Challenging Gameplay: Despite the cartoon ducks, the game is extremely difficult and requires tactical thinking. Combat is sudden, fast, and tense. Every single raid is a high-stakes challenge.\r\n2) Deep Progression Loop: The core appeal is the PvE progression. You get an engaging storyline via quests, hideout upgrading, crafting, and, most importantly, incredibly detailed weapon modding.\r\n3) Why It Works: You get all the adrenaline rush from a successful \"extraction\" and valuable loot, but none of the pain of losing everything to cheaters or campers. It delivers the same risk-and-reward, but at a more relaxed pace.\r\n\r\nMy Verdict: This is not just a meme it’s a complete, well-optimized product. Escape from Duckov proves that the extraction shooter genre works perfectly without PvP. A true masterpiece!",

It achieves the same feeling high-stakes extraction shooters like Tarkov do - when you have a lot of loot you FEEL the pressure mounting. You have to stategize, what resources do you use? What item do you maybe drop? What is most important?\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it is a more welcoming experience:\r\n1. (except for the highest/custom difficulties) you have a chance to retrieve your gear and loot if you die\r\n2. There are a few ways to teleport around the map, unlock a shortcut etc which give you a feeling of map progression. You master an area, and then get to traverse it easier\r\n3. Going back to your hideout is VERY easy and low risk, unlike in Tarkov, which makes for an - again\r\n- more welcoming overall experience. There is pressure when exploring new, dangerous areas, but I like the balance achieved here a TON more. Tarkov kind of burned me out with how extractions were often more deadly and high-stakes than they are here\r\n\r\nIt is a \"top down\" (well, at an angle) shooter with decent mechanics. Dodging melee attacks is pretty fun, but most importantly - shooting feels good, too. Weapons have distinct handling, you really feel the differences between them.

There's a million little missions that give you some minor goal to accomplish in the day. Even though they're simple they avoid feeling like a chore and prevent you from ever feeling aimless. When you die you get a second chance to get your stuff, yet the world doesn't reset when you enter the map but at the start of the day, so if you rush out to reclaim your stuff the guy who got you will be near by to get you again. Dealing with loss is the driving point of the game; it adds stakes. Duckov is the best at having a fast recovery. Your crafting guarantees a base level that's fit perfectly between where you want to be and starting too far from scratch. There's a lot of times where you have to  go and fetch items; despite the vast variety, you can find what you're looking for. Duckov is never frustrating. It's never too easy or too difficult.

It has a great loop that keeps the player thinking, \"One more raid.\" The Largest issue I have with the game at the moment is that there is only a purple timer for the storms. I wish there were something that, when you died or when you rest, said there was a storm. The night is no way worse than a storm, and yet before you leave the bunker, you get a small warning about it being night. Going back to get your stuff and spawning into a storm is one of the more frustrating aspects of the game.\r\nThat aside, it's really a fantastic game.",

There are quests, but those largely just push you to explore, and once it stops being completely fresh, that's because it's opened up more and you have things to do or build.",

THE QUESTS FU*CKING SUCKKKKKKKK.\r\nYou get these random-ass tasks like “find this one weird item” which you probably sold five minutes ago.

Why not give me something good/game changing?\r\n\r\nAnd don’t even get me started on the item management. If you thought the game is about shooting. YOU'RE DEAD WRONG. The main gameplay is actually trying to figure out which item in your storage to delete.\r\nYou just sit there thinking “which random piece of crap do I sell to make space for more crap.” And you can’t even relax because what if that random piece of crap turns out to be a rare quest item later. Then you have to loot for hours again to find it, just to realize you actually need three of them. \r\n\r\nIt’s such a shame because the base idea is good, but it turns into a repetitive grind that kills all the fun.\r\n\r\nBut hey, OVERWHELMINGLY positive on steam BTW.\r\n\r\nPs: If you're a future game developer - Just copy another game as shittily as you can, put a cute mascot in it and the people will eat it up.

There is a particular enemy in the game that is invisible and you need thermal goggles (or a blindfold) to kill. The blueprints are trapped behind a green key carded area in JLab. Despite running JLab over 50 times, I have yet to find a green key card. I tried cheeseing the vendor as well over 2 dozen times, running back and forth and reloading, no dice. This is incredibly stupid. Please increase the drop rates of these key cards, or give us alternative means to craft these stupid goggles.\r\n\r\nSecond, I am beyond tired of having max gear only to dumpstered by some mini-boss where my health goes from 100 to 0 in .05 seconds, the game hitches while it tries to load the death animation, everything freezes, and I die. Like, you only have 2 means of defense. Armor and dodge rolls. Armor is set value. You have it or you dont. And you cant dodge roll out of the way of half these mini-bosses. Misel one shots you if you are anywhere even remotely near a rocket exploding. The dumb jukebox just fire hoses you with bullets with no window to counter. And the Wanderers with Special AP will kill you in 3 bullets of a 5 bullet burst. Its so ridiculously overtuned I can't even believe I have to post this. \r\n\r\nLastly, item RNG in general needs to be completely rebalanced or with alternative (or guaranteed) methods of obtaining certain progression specific items. Yogurts, Homemade Candy, Cake... these are needed constantly and yet despite over 35 hours in the game, I think I've found 2 pieces of cake. Need a uPhone? Good luck. Never, not once, have I found a uPhone. The rarity on some of these items needs to be completely overhauled. \r\n\r\nSo many minor gripes that just add up too. Silencers dont seem to do anything, worthless. The game willingly lets you launch into a storm without a warning despite you having no protective gear. The game also doesnt tell you absolutely KEY information that you will only find on Google because a million other people have hit the same wall (ie, you can craft every other medkit except large for some unknown reason?)\r\n\r\nIt just needs a lot of re-tuning and a complete re-distribution of its loot table with more indicators what you really need and where to find it. Until then, this is just a frustrating slot of fetch quests and absolutely crawling degrees of progression masked behind a cute facade.",

You get out, find items that you kept finding from time to time and never used. Then you finally sell them, because even in loading screen tooltips devs prompt you to sell. Then 30 minutes later you get a quest or a building blueprint that requires those sold items. And to complete, you have to go back to the area you thought you were done with and start the grind.\n\nProgression also looks odd. Like getting the ability to fish. I could make a fishing pole from the start, but I couldn't fish - no bait. Then I finally unlocked a bulding that gives me a blueprint to craft the said bait... and over the next 2 hours I got 1/3 crackers required to make the bait (food items appear to be very random and there is quite a few of them). So... a feature initially \"possible\" after an hour of gameplay, but couldn't do it once in the span of the next 9 hours. Neat.\n\nAgain, the game has some fun aspects, but such a high rating?

You're getting more of a consistent extraction game experience but without the heights of multiplayer to make the experience better. After a while it gets boring looting the same boxes to complete all the goofy quests for progression. The ducks obviously aren't too different from one another besides having more health and doing more damage.\n\nYour first 10 hours will be fun and cute because it is ducks, but then once you get passed 10 hours you're really going to start feeling the game run thin.

I got my moneys worth and I think for the experience you're getting here it runs a little long but plenty of people probably like that it runs long.

There are other more detailed issues (like enemy scaling seems absolutely ridiculous) but I don't want to spend too much time on this.\n\nI think the biggest issue here is that the enemies simply do not fear combat while clearly being able to take more damage then you on average and do not have to deal with the jank as you have. So tactics are for the ring in your lower back if they can just run around you with no issue. You can not do tactics if you are the only one restricted by having to watch out and activate or uses any extra tools. \n\nAnd then you loose your progression.\nWhats the point?",

The first few hours are okay, nice shooting, cool atmosphere, but once you beat the first boss, you’ve basically seen everything. Every new area is just a copy-paste: same enemies, same loot, same boring loop.\n\nThe weapon system is a mess with 18 stats for each weapon and most of them are useless. In the second zone you unlock many new \"high level\" weapons but they all feel similar, where is the fun unlocking skins ??? There is no progression feeling whatsoever. Skill trees are scattered between random buildings, storage is way too limited with boring upgrades, and quests are painfully dull. It feels like an AI-generated template dressed up as a real game.\n\nWhat’s even weirder? The Overwhelmingly Positive reviews. They read like they were written by bots and liked by bots, hundreds of likes for nonsense like “9.5/10 worth every penny!”, \"This game nails progression more than anything\", \"The quests aren't particularly interesting, but that's not why we're here.\", \"The amount of content this game has is INSANE, 20 hours in and barely scratched the surface\", \"base-building feel so rewarding\"... what the actual **** ?!\n\nConsidering how fundamentally simple the rest of the game is, dismissing the quest system as “not the main focus” is absurd. When the core experience lacks depth, every element, especially quests, becomes crucial to keeping players engaged. It’s pure nonsense, and yet the person who wrote that got hundreds of likes for it...\n\nGood gunfeel, but beyond that it’s empty, repetitive, and suspiciously overhyped. The base building is one of the poorest, most basic, and most generic base-building systems in video game history: you unlock a “building” (which is more like a booth), and once you have the materials, you just place it on a grid in the middle of your bunker. And beyond that, I do not see how it could be \"so rewarding\" to build those booths. Seriously....\n\nIn the end, if you filter the Steam reviews and look at the negative ones, they all share the same point: the game’s appeal drops off sharply after the first few hours. Most of those players have between 5 and 20 hours on record. Not a coincidence.",

Firstly, inventory management is a mess - spending half your time deciding what to keep and what to throw away. Base building is a bit of a joke, just unlocking some vendors that give you quests and with which you can trade. Lastly, the death penalty is insane - having only ONE chance to retrieve your gear before it disappears is incredibly punishing, especially if you've upgraded your weapons. \n\nThe game has a strong foundation and I'm willing to give it another chance but several things need to improve",

But that fun and sense of curiosity lasts for about 30 hours, and after that it all starts to feel repetitive, tiresome, and kind of suffocating.\n\nWhat disappointed me the most were the quests. About 99% of them are either “go kill this specific enemy with this specific weapon” or “go find this item and bring it back.” The so-called “four endings” were also a huge letdown - they’re almost identical, differing only by a couple of small details in the cutscene and some final text. Besides that, the game has a bunch of smaller issues that I won’t go into - partly because I’m too lazy, partly because they’re pretty niche and not everyone would care, and also because a lot of them can be fixed with mods anyway.\n\nWould I recommend this game?\n\nAt full price - no, unless you really enjoy repetitive grind and copy-paste quests. \n\nOn a 40-50% discount, and if they ever add co-op - then yeah, maybe.",

And then majestically spawned on top again. Thank god, thought I'd lost everything. No wait... I can't move... No wait I can... sort of... But my bullets are instantly hitting an invisible wall. Well shit, this sucks. Oh... Oh the sniper boss has just decided to spawn on me, good. Well at least I'm behind an invisible wall...\n\n... Oh, no wait... He can shoot me. Okay that's me dead.

      "review": "Let me say first the reason for its negative review is because of the grind + RNG and some serious BS grind.... The game itself is fun but then it becomes a grindfest at the latter half.\n\nWithout spoiling too much, there is an area in this game and in order for you to get upgrades ( the last part of your HP upgrades ), you need 3 specific items and these 3 specific items can be only obtain in a certain crate. The total crate in this area is roughly 20 (if you are lucky all 18 spawns but sometimes it could be less). Within those 18 crates, 8 of those crates are being lock by keys which are randomly drop OR obtain in 2 specific houses. To add more grind, those crates arent guaranteed drop. It can be either 1 of those 3 or it could be a notebook / disk / some other cr*p. So you probably have 12 left but 3 of them are being block by certain stuffs. Also within those 3 specific item upgrades, each of them needs to be collected more than 10+ ( I believe its 15 minimum )\n\nOh? It doesnt sound bad? Well this entire area I'm mentioning, the mobster can instantly drop your health from 100-0 if you arent prepared so you have to always be on edge. ( considering if you are playing anything higher than survival )\n\nSo this would how the flowchart be like: Enter area > play as if you are on the edge > run through B1 & B2 looking for crates and open light > hope the crates give you what you want > get angry cause you cant access certain rooms > collect specific item (which you cant stack) > leave the place hopefully alive > repeat about 20-30 times in hope you get what you want( $-6000 ). \n\nOh, small fyi, the last area, you need to grind $ for medicine because for whatever reason, the game doesnt want you to have a full immunity body armor against the storm so you be pumping out storm medicine after storm medicine and each cost roughly $2500. \n\nSo yeah.... I love the first 3/4 of the game, but entering the end game, I did not enjoy the grinding at all. \n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nMy suggestion: Those crates, remove every other RNG item in that pool. Only let it be those 3 items OR let the player be able to buy those. Also in the last area, you should give the players immunity to storm damage early game. The last area is [b] the final area [/b]. Why do the players have to grind for medicine and then you give them the final blueprint against the storm [i]after[/i] the final boss. It then serves no purpose anyway",

Go play STALKER GAMMA and then complain about a game that is hard. Tarkov is not hard; it is unfair dogwater, hence why most people have stopped playing that travesty. Seriously, Tarkov players when difficulty isn't hiding in a corner for an hour waiting to kill some unsuspecting guy and take his loot. My review for duckov still stands, I hope Tarkov players keep seething over the fact that they have the worst game taste in the industry. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGame is generally mechanically fantastic and is a very fun game. However, having players lose the items they had if they die while retrieving them is not fun or fair. Several hours of progress completely lost because never in 100 years did I think a death while attempting to retrieve my items would mean they were all deleted forever instantly. We do not all have hundreds of hours to spend on games. Losing several hours of meaningful progress is insulting and does not make you want to play the game more. \n\nThat choice is too anti-fun and I get the whole risk reward thing, but the fact that I can (due to bullshit) lose all my progress and then essentially be back at square one is just not fun. Unfortunately until I at least see an option to disable this 'feature', I cannot recommend the game. \n\nDo what Zero Sievert does and at least allow us to have some save state to return to, very disappointing to see such anti-fun choices in a generally fun game.",

The shooting isn't even that good: you basically destroy enemies or they destroy you. Named enemies will kill you in two hits and start shooting from off-screen. That's what really sinks the combat for me: safest way to play is to fire at things off screen while they fire at you. At first you figure there'll be a gradual climb in difficulty but you are swimming in tier 3 armor and AP ammo before your first gaming session is done.\n\nI guess if you're into slowly walking around a map opening containers and occasionally getting killed from something that saw you before it was even rendered then this must be a great game.

      "review": "This game is pure frustration.  Every mission is a fetch quest or \"Kill X person with Y specific weapon you have to grind more to get.\"  You collect tons of vendor trash, but don't know what you need to save to complete future missions, and have very limited backpack and storage space.  There are few maps, and they are poorly designed, with lots of blind corners leading no where and endless backtracking.  The baseline \"normal\" difficulty is very difficult.  (Though you can customize it to lower the difficulty as much as you want, this turns off achievements).  By default if you're killed and don't retrieve your stuff from the map on the first try, you lose your items (with limited safety boxes on your pet dog), and thus can lose a lot of your progression.  It seems like this game is targeted to a very specific fandom of players who like insanely difficult survival games.  But if you're a casual player like me who stumbled across it and bought it because it had a lot of positive buzz online, you will be deeply disappointed in your purchase.  I kept playing until I beat it, thinking it would somehow get better, but it does not.  Endless grind.  Do not buy this game unless you've played other similar survival crafting games and love the genre.",
