A multiplayer Survivor-like sounds great in paper and we definitely thought, for $10, why not? \n\nLo and behold, every single week, we keep coming back to this game, which we affectionately call “Lil Wizzies”. The perfection is in its simplicity — a few boards, a bunch of little wizards with different skillsets, endless combinations of builds. \n\nDo we need some more music and soundscape choices? Sure. Can it benefit from some more bosses and enemy types? Absolutely. But as an early access game for $10 that keeps adding onto the roadmap? To say it’s worth every penny is truly an understatement.",

The matchmaking works great to play with strangers if you don't have friends set up and the chat is using hotkeys so there isn't any ego to deal with. I'd imagine it would be fun to play with friends and laugh at each other. To play with Friendly Fire off, you need to select a Covenant which is an empty bubble at the bottom right when you get ready to match make. It took me a bit to figure it out but there are lots of people who play without being able to hurt each other. \nI really look forward to this game progressing and playing more!",

I think you'll be, too.\n-The graphics are a mix of cartunistic and simple 3D geometry (as you can see on the game page) perfect for any age.\n-\n\nRight now, the game doesn't feel like it is an early access game. But so much can (and will be) implemented for QoL (quality of life) mechanics, controls and spell configuration. The Devs also are very community friendly and receptive of feedback.\nMany more spells came out just when i thought the creativity was at its limit.\n\nMy rating would be, from 0 (Garbage - go play something else) to 10 (perfect game, MUST BUY IT):\n8,5/10\nThis game is EASILY one of my:\nTop 5 Bulelt Hell games; and\nTop 15 Co-op games of my list.",

There is a good unique feature where players can complete minigames/objects to unlock stronger upgrades for their weapons.

This makes it almost impossible to kill a teammate unless you are really trying to. In the future this game should try to include more weapons, elements, and enemy types, to add more content.

The art (10/10) and the effects (10/10).\n\nThe soundtrack (8/10) is pretty nice and helps get you in the groove. It gets a bit repetitive after a few hours, but you don't even notice, since you're busy dodging attacks.\n\nI'm giving it a 9/10 for only one reason: for me, it's not totally perfect yet. I feel like it's missing some variety in bosses, enemies, and maps. The game's foundation is incredible, but with more variety in those areas, it would be wonderful.\n\nEven with what it has now, you can easily get 20 hours of gameplay.

It feels like you are playing single player even with a team of 4. Certain spells need a lot of work and some stuff is just clearly better than others. Normal modes don't feel difficult enough even on max difficulty, and endless can easily become ridiculously easy once you max out dodge and/or get the right upgrades along the way that let you constantly regenerate massive amounts of hp. The only time the game is actually hard is if you are playing with 4 people and friendly fire is on, and you're on a hard difficulty on a hard map. The problem is, I don't know the solution to this problem, or even if there is one. More environmental hazards is lame, and simply throwing more enemies, or spongier enemies, at you doesn't seem like the right call. \r\n\r\nIt's a cool idea for a game but I wouldn't recommend it unless this 'genre' of game is your absolute favorite. I'm not even sure what genre this would be... roguelike arena? \r\n\r\nThis game is good at what it is supposed to be, I guess... but I guess I'm just realizing that all of these games are the same.",
