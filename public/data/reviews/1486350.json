While the texture editor is a little underwhelming, i figure this is because they know there's already so many other apps that can use to edit the saved templates from vroid just as well.

Теперь создавать модели стало еще быстрее и приятнее. Особенно радует гибкая система текстурирования, позволяющая воплотить самые смелые дизайнерские решения.\n\nНесмотря на впечатляющий функционал, стоит отметить, что игра ориентирована на создание персонажей в определенном стиле.

This software allows those middle-aged men to create and edit their little anime girl avatars that they use.\n\nWhile it's inexplicably popular (presumably it needs to run while pretending to be a little anime girl), the tool has issues with performance, bad texture editing capabilities, poor translation, [and] limits on the kinds of avatars you can make (apparently almost exclusively little anime girls, but hey, they know their audience).\n\nI can't think of anyone I could recommend this to and I feel it's not exactly the best example of software in the genre. Look elsewhere for your little anime girl avatar requirements.",

Vroid needs to stop making pre-made assets, and focus on their in house art program for editing textures because it is god awful to work with. It's exhausting having to hop back between Vroid and an art program to adjust tiny details. If your program relies on editing textures in house, you have to give your users a proper in house art program. \r\n\r\nThe biggest issue is that needs to be fixed asap is that there no pen stabilization, so if your design requires neat lines or edges, you need to already have the ability to make clean lines without stabilization. Adding a line tool should be next in line.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was an amazing mod a few years ago that someone made that allowed you to edit textures in an art program, and it would apply it in real time in Vroid. It also had other QoL changes that improved the program, but Vroid made it impossible to use now. I don't understand how a random person could make game changing QoL changes in their free time, but the devs couldn't be bothered to the same work. Instead they just make pre-made assets and release them once in a while.\r\n\r\nIf you are just wanting to make models for fun using other people's assets, then this is a good program. If you want to make very customized characters that look good, I cannot recommend this app. Unless you feel like you can put up with the frustration and wasting more time trying to draw textures that look good.",
