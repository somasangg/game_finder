      "review": "In my fifteen-year career as a professional Truck Wrangler at the Alabama Trucker's Home in Virginia, I have never been so DISGUSTED in my entire life by a sickening MOCKERY of a game as this one.\n\nFirstly, a minor irritation, when designing the company logo at the start of the game, there was no 'swastika' option. Disappointing.\n\nFirst of all, the TRUCKS. Oh boy, the trucks... it you can call them that. I've seen better trucks tumble out of a gypsy's tattered backside than some of the 'trucks' on this game. I mean, what were the developers thinking with this? It simply *boggles* the mind, to quote a great author.\n\nSecondly, the EURO aspect of the game left me sorely disappointed. I mean, not one mention of God's glorious U S of A was mentioned in the game. I know, strictly speaking, the US isnt in Europe, but given the sheer size of the States, and the grand number of trucks teeming within it's borders, surely that's a perfect opportunity to fly the stars and stripes and give a nod to the Original Truckers - us guys.\n\nThirdly, the in-game radio is SHAMBOLIC. I mean, Only 3 country stations to choose from? Who do they think I am? If I wanted to listen to opera singing I'd just KICK a CAT or something. Disgraceful!\n\nAnd the controls. Jesus Christ almighty, I have never struggled to drive a truck before. In my years before the truck-cident that claimed most of my legs, I was able to drive from Alaska to Hawaii every morning and night, up-hill both ways, without so much as braking (HA what a pun) a sweat. But now in this game, it's a miracle if I can get the truck out of the parking lot. Then the fact that I was forced to drive on the wrong, most un-American side of the road. Blasphemy!\n\nIn summary, 8/10 a MUST RECOMMEND A+ **** 56% this game might just be the biggest mistake you ever make. Peace out and God Bless x",

A good way to whittle away a rainy night at home. \n\nI'll consider purchasing when it comes down in price.",

I read that people with game controllers and PC steering wheel hardware find it easier to manipulate the steering.\nLovely graphics, variable weather, 1 minute of in-game travel time takes 2 seconds of real time. This sim is excellent because (unlike city-building or character sims) you can play this one for 30 min and then, when your current shipping contract is complete, walk away to make dinner.\nIt didn't get 5/5 from me because the demo didn't take me to the point where I could start my own shipping company or buy my own truck. After experiencing about 30% of what's possible in this game, I can't give it the 5/5 that I suspect it so richly deserves.",

      "review": "In my fifteen-year career as a professional Truck Wrangler at the Alabama Trucker's Home in Virginia, I have never been so DISGUSTED in my entire life by a sickening MOCKERY of a game as this one.\n\nFirstly, a minor irritation, when designing the company logo at the start of the game, there was no 'swastika' option. Disappointing.\n\nFirst of all, the TRUCKS. Oh boy, the trucks... it you can call them that. I've seen better trucks tumble out of a gypsy's tattered backside than some of the 'trucks' on this game. I mean, what were the developers thinking with this? It simply *boggles* the mind, to quote a great author.\n\nSecondly, the EURO aspect of the game left me sorely disappointed. I mean, not one mention of God's glorious U S of A was mentioned in the game. I know, strictly speaking, the US isnt in Europe, but given the sheer size of the States, and the grand number of trucks teeming within it's borders, surely that's a perfect opportunity to fly the stars and stripes and give a nod to the Original Truckers - us guys.\n\nThirdly, the in-game radio is SHAMBOLIC. I mean, Only 3 country stations to choose from? Who do they think I am? If I wanted to listen to opera singing I'd just KICK a CAT or something. Disgraceful!\n\nAnd the controls. Jesus Christ almighty, I have never struggled to drive a truck before. In my years before the truck-cident that claimed most of my legs, I was able to drive from Alaska to Hawaii every morning and night, up-hill both ways, without so much as braking (HA what a pun) a sweat. But now in this game, it's a miracle if I can get the truck out of the parking lot. Then the fact that I was forced to drive on the wrong, most un-American side of the road. Blasphemy!\n\nIn summary, 8/10 a MUST RECOMMEND A+ **** 56% this game might just be the biggest mistake you ever make. Peace out and God Bless x",
