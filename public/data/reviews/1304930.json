Enemies and traps are scattered all throughout the map and can create different experiences each playthrough.\n\nI've played around three matches and had a blast with randoms, and with friends. The game optimization is great too, and I haven't experienced any technical issues or stutters.\n\nLooking forward to playing much more of this game.",

So far, I've played both solo and in a group, and have learned some important things about myself along the way: \n\n🔸 I am a coward.\n🔸 [i]Especially[/i] if I can't fight back.\n🔸 Apparently, anxiety triggers my usually mild asthma. \n🔸 In an apocalypse, you'll find me in trash cans or dumpsters.\n🔸 My username is too short.\n🔸 If no one comes back for me, I'll die in a trash bag.\n🔸 I kinda like floral wallpaper.\n\nAll in all, I [i]think[/i] I'm having fun aside from the asthma thing?  It's gruesome and disgusting and absolutely terrible -- the tutorial is basically Jigsaw Hitler's wet dream -- but it's also clever, with interesting puzzles, a lot of level variety, and some solid customization features.  Hilariously, some of the \"coziest\" gamers on my friends list have the most hours in this, and I actually do understand why. \n\nAt the same time, there's that same \"pay to play\" nonsense that turned me off to [i]Disney Dreamlight Valley[/i]: daily logins, daily and weekly tasks, spend real coin to purchase new clown suits, etc.  It's not as bad, but worth keeping in mind. \n\nDo I recommend this?  I don't even know.  No.  Yes?  Sort of?  The last level I played, my husband's doppelgänger stabbed me multiple times and a friend politely reminded me of my Criminal Justice background as we destroyed evidence and bludgeoned a judge to death.  Before that, I received unwanted dental surgery from a puppet and spent several panicky minutes kiting literally every monster on the level until I found an appropriate trash bin to hide in. \n\nIf this kind of fuck-ery speaks to you, then yeah, check it out; it's actually a very smart and well-made game, if punishing and overly gory.  But if anything in this ramble didn't sit right with you, I'd look at some other reviews before letting a \"scientist\" screw nightvision goggles into my head.\n\n[quote][b]Follow [u][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45365863/]Eekz Today[/url][/u] for more crafting, life sim, management, strategy, story-rich recommendations (plus whatever nightmare fuel this is).[/b][/quote]",

You get used to the shocking gore and jumpscares in the game and try to become a good tool as the propaganda expects .You keep coming back,doing the same tasks over and over again to get more rebirths and satisfy Dr. Eastermann.

      "review": "First of all do not compare this game to dead by daylight or expect it to be a dead by daylight replacement. This isn't to say that the game isn't worthy to be a dead by daylight contender or whatever (because personally Outlast trials blows that game out the water with its quality) but mainly to get the point across that this game is not at all comparable to dead by daylight as they both play VERY differently. \r\n\r\nI love that there is a narrative that the game is clear about as you start, sure the multiplayer aspect and gameplay loop is there but as the updates progress more lore and files release and you understand more about the Murkoff and events that link to the first and second Outlast games since in the timeline the game happens well before those two. However let's say you never had interest in the single player games and jumped straight into Outlast trials.\r\n\r\nThe trials themselves are a bit lengthy, this is a game where you set sufficient time for maybe 1-5 runs of the trials at least because these trials take a while to complete. Much of the enjoyment comes from interactions with the NPC enemies that roam the trials as you can't fight back beyond stunning them out of attacking your friends / killing them or staggering them with an object or three of the six rigs you are provided. Ultimately in the trials you want to do them without getting hurt and triggering traps for a high grade and the gameplay loop basically revolves around going in, doing the trials and side tasks for currency and levels for tickets to upgrade your talents and drip and bedroom furniture. At the time reviewing though the game is VERY generous with cosmetics which is refreshing, community still pretty active though unfortunately for solo players the game can't be played offline. \r\n\r\nThe game can be scary too, even if you get used to the game at times there are moments that may catch you off guard due to the unpredictable nature of some of the NPC, the max difficulty is pretty hard as well, it is recommended you spend a lot of time learning the game on standard difficulty too. \r\n\r\nVery fun multiplayer horror game, runs very well too despite looking so great.

      "review": "There is so much going on in this game, I cannot summarize everything in a short review. For a long long time, I was very skeptical about Outlast Trials as a multiplayer game. But holy sh*t, they managed to create the best horror / escape room game with the classic but even more twisted Outlast flavor. Just to address the elephant in the room, you can play each trial solo, but the game is clearly designed to be played with other people, it is just much better fun. ...And so much replayability, so much difficulty variations, and so so much randomness. Even the puzzles are randomized, so just you to know, there isn't such thing as memorizing a map after 1-2 runs and then doing it blindly, as so many things are different for each run, like literally every 2nd little thing in the game is randomized, and multiply that with the experience of your teammates and the possible outcomes. Mentioning teammates, there is max 4 players in each run including you, so you will play with 3 others, and their experience will be very random. Sometimes there are fresh installs in your team, sometimes old timer veterans... You just never know... As for the fact, this can matter, as experienced players can make the trial less pain and you can learn from them. So anyways, the game features some sort of complexity in its mechanisms, so be prepared that you will be very confused in the first couple of hours. After that, the pieces start to fall into their places and you will get a grip on what The Outlast Trials is about. You will like the puzzles and the atmosphere, trust me. My only complain is the invasion mode, which was almost always a frustrating sh*tfest to play. The other game modes and maps are very well made, excellent craftsmanship there. I enjoyed grinding my character in this game, fun cosmetics, very rewarding and justified rating system that rates your performance for the given run. I rate this for 9 / 10 as the -1 goes for the dogwater invasion mode, as the impostors are way too overpowered right now. But you know what, find out all this by yourself.... Buy the game, install the game, play the game... and we will let you out. 9 / 10",

Seriously, the amount of cool cosmetics I've unlocked from just playing it is the literal best. I wonder how they make money outside game sales. Imagine every cool skin you pay $5, $10, or $20 for in other games, you get 99% of them for free. The quality of free and paid skins is the same, something I've never seen before, it is beyond stupid how much they give you. I just hope they can maintain this game for years despite this. \n\n\nOutlast Trials is a non-action, non-friendslop horror game with disgusting but well written villians. Its dark humor might make pearl clutchers fear for those who enjoy this game. Outlast Trials puts the Saw movies in the kiddie corner, as there will be moments that make you squirm.\n\nAs someone who doesn't even enjoy the non-action horror genre, I got bored in the singleplayer options of Outlast, this game won me over with the sheer amount of quality content with its [i](as of time of writing, 42 missions, there is still the Christmas update incoming that will add a couple more)[/i]\nThese missions all have engaging and varied objectives, which is the evolution I wanted from Payday 2 to Payday 3 where you interact with the game world instead of having fake timers and standing capture the hill style as an objective. \nIt also helps that each mission has a story reason for doing what you do, like throwing hearts at carnival miningames to teach either your character, or someone held hostage a lesson, just like the Saw movies. If you want to see how to make a unique and top tier live service game, get Outlast Trails. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/ABexTBDGmlo",

      "review": "I normally stay away from horror or gore focused games, so I started the game with some hesitation. The beginning is very intense, especially the tutorial. The dark rooms, the constant pressure and the unsettling sound design made me think I would stop fairly quickly, simply because the genre usually does not work for me. After I started playing with friends and got used to the atmosphere, my view changed much faster than expected. Playing in a group makes the experience more enjoyable and less overwhelming, even though the game also works well solo. What surprised me most was how motivating the gameplay loop is. Completing objectives together feels rewarding and the game manages to stay tense without becoming frustrating.\n\nOne of the reasons I keep coming back are the daily and weekly tasks. They add variety and give you a reason to log in regularly. The seasonal content also adds long term progression. Collecting stamps to unlock new outfits and cosmetics is simple but fun and it gives the game a bit more depth without turning it into a grind. The developers deserve credit for supporting the game so actively. There are regular content updates, new events and small improvements that show the game is still being worked on. Visually, the game looks very good. The environments are detailed, the lighting is strong and the overall atmosphere is exactly what you would expect from a horror title. Performance has been stable for me as well. The only real bug I ran into was falling through the floor once when I died, but it never happened again and did not impact the overall experience.\n\nIn the end, the game exceeded my expectations. I thought I would not last long because I am not a horror fan, but now I find myself returning to it on a daily base. With the combination of coop, content updates and a progression system, I can easily recommend it, even to players who normally avoid this genre!",

      "review": "I did not want this game. I am not remotely a gore fan, I haven't even watched the most popular films. \r\n\r\nOutlast Trials was a Halloween gift, an attempt for our group of friends to do escape games together throughout the season. \r\n\r\nTo say I was skeptical is putting it mildly, and my attempt at the tutorial ended up in screaming, hiding, and bailing out. \r\n\r\nSeventy two hours later, I've got most of the achievements, and I play at least a match every night. \r\n\r\nOutlast Trials is not for the faint of heart, the content is incredibly graphic, certainly not for children. At a certain point, I do think you can ignore that element and focus on the objectives or even on the story itself and what it means- that being a very clear antifascist, anticapitalist, prodiversity message throughout. I think some people will appreciate it, and others will ignore it for the base imagery.\r\n\r\nIf you're into games like Dead By Daylight or Friday the 13th, you'll probably like this. Imagine an escape room with hide and seek and the ability to fight back. \r\n\r\nYou can play longer or shorter trials, some of which you can get through in under fifteen minutes, and you can play solo, with friends, or through matchmaking, all are very viable. \r\n\r\nThere's even a new mode you can invade other trials in, it's a lot of fun, and if you're looking for something a little less complicated than a trial to play really quick alone or with friends, it's a great option. \r\n\r\nSomething I had not expected that's brought a lot of enjoyment has been the \"sleep room\". Between trials you'll go back and hang out with others, randoms, and whoever is in your group. You can play chess, arm wrestle, play pong, or even challenge each other on a Stroop test. \r\n\r\nPossibly the best part of the sleep room is that you'll be able to customize your own room. There are in game purchases for coins to unlock catalogues faster, but if you look around you'll find you can actually get through it all without making any purchases if you spend your coins wisely. \r\n\r\nDespite the nature of the game, I currently have the coziest Christmas room decked out in 50s aesthetic. \r\n\r\nYou'll also find a mirror for player customization in your room, little outfits, or separate items. You'll win some through trials, achievements, badges, seasonal events, or filling out your catalogues, same as room decorations. There's not much customization where face or body type are concerned, but I think you'll find it doesn't really matter all that much. \r\n\r\nOverall, I think anyone who likes to be scared should try it, even if you think it may be a bit much, especially if you'll have friends along for the ride. It's a great game with a lot of fun features to keep you entertained and on your toes.",

That is the best part - the horror does not need to have exploding magic to truly hit, as none of the enemies are supernatural. This was my step out of the so called comfort zone - as I gave it a try, I could not stop playing it ever since. The more I learned of the mechanics, the more confident not only as a player, where I stopped relying on hiding spots, but even as a person I became. It contributed to my personal growth too, along side giving so much inspiration as a full time artist and an okayish writer to how to properly write good - no, INCREDIBLE characters and improve on ones already written, where you feel both pity and fear, understanding and judgement.

I knew it would be creepy - it's Outlast, after all - but the way this game mixes atmosphere, teamwork, and outright panic makes it stand out not just in the series, but in the horror genre in general.\n\n** THE EXPERIENCE **\n\nThe atmosphere is honestly incredible. Every location feels like it was handcrafted to mess with your nerves. The whole Cold War–era setting combined with Murkoff’s twisted experiments gives the game a really unique vibe that keeps you hooked and uncomfortable at the same time.\n\nEverything from the lighting to the sound design keeps you on edge. You hear a whisper or a sudden bang and immediately start questioning your next move. The enemies feel smarter and more reactive than in previous Outlast games, so even familiar situations somehow stay tense.\n\nBetween trials, the Sleep Room hub is this weird mix of calm and unsettling—a place to breathe, but not fully relax. It creates a nice rhythm between the chaos of the trials and the moments where you regroup and prepare.\n\nThe multiplayer aspect is where the game really shines. Playing with others doesn’t kill the fear at all, it actually makes everything more chaotic and stressful in the best way possible. Trying to complete objectives while someone screams that an enemy is right behind them somehow manages to be both terrifying and hilarious. With the recently added option to make your own trials the game feels even more unpredictable, and when your team finally pulls off a good run, it feels like a real accomplishment.\n\nThe progression system is surprisingly satisfying too. You always feel like you're working toward something, and it keeps you wanting to complete \"just one more run\". Once you have reached level 99 you are able to relapse (prestige) which increases your displayed relapse level (prestige level) for some bragging rights and resets your level progression to level 1, so the grind to level 99 starts all over again. Every time you relapse (prestige) you get 1 permanent unlock which enables you to unlock one of your favorite upgrades. Make sure you choose wisely!  \n\n** THE TEAM BEHIND THE GAME **\n\nRed Barrels really knocked it out of the park with this one. You can tell they put a lot of care into expanding the Outlast world without losing what made it memorable. The game feels polished yet still raw and disturbing in all the right ways.\n\nWhat really stands out, though, is how committed the developers are to keeping the game alive. They keep pushing out updates, new content, seasonal events - you name it. It’s clear they listen to the community and genuinely want to keep the experience fresh for players.\n\n** FINAL THOUGHTS **\n\nThe Outlast Trials is easily one of the most intense and enjoyable horror experiences I’ve had in years. It captures the classic Outlast terror but adds new layers of teamwork, tension, and replayability. If you’re into horror games that really make your heart race, this one is absolutely worth picking up. Just be ready for some genuinely nerve-wracking moments.",

Noise attracts enemies. Light exposes you. Success depends on timing and route discipline.\n\nTools provide small advantages. Stun items, healing syringes, and lockpicks buy seconds. Resource scarcity forces careful use. Crafting is limited but useful. Improvised solutions matter.\n\nEnemy variety shapes tension. Some foes patrol. Others chase aggressively. Special enemies disrupt hiding. Behavioral patterns require observation. Mistakes cascade fast.\n\nVisual design uses darkness and narrow corridors. Flashlights create limited safety. Blood, graffiti, and alarms build atmosphere. Performance remains stable. Level layouts blend maze structure with scripted set pieces.\n\nAudio drives fear. Footsteps, screams, and alarms provide direction cues. Voice acting reinforces threat tone. Music spikes during chases. Headphones improve spatial awareness.\n\nThe game suits players who enjoy cooperative stealth under pressure. It is punishing but fair. Randomization supports replay.

      "review": "After many updates later the game has grown more on the positive side in my opinion. Devs are active and are constantly working on it. Gameplay is fun especially with friends. \nSOLO\nCertain trials are a bit more of a chore solo, but that's definitely because it was more designed towards coop. Solo IS possible and doable just bear in mind that you need to be more on top of your game for certain objectives if you want good grades. Solo you get lives to work around and can even find pills around the map to give back more lives if any are lost during a solo run.\nCOOP\nDefinitely one of my top favorite coop games especially in a horror genre. Even if you don't always directly work with others during trials you all still work towards the same goals which is completing objectives so you can escape. Rigs can be used to assist yourself or others. Helping each other when in major danger of deadly enemies. New players will definitely have a fun time when working alongside others and share the scares for the first time. Even better if you have a crew of friends wanting to give a try together for the first time. Community is more on the positive side despite of the new Invasion update since it's more PVE focused opposed to PvP which is still very new to the scene. Experienced players are more likely to help especially if you ask for it and need some guidance. Coop actions is definitely a cool concept to have in the game that way to create shortcuts.\nHORROR\nThis being an Outlast game. There's no short supply of scares especially for new folk wanting to try it out for the first time. Creepy as well as deadly environments, lore and enemies. You got traps to be on the lookout for and there's different genre of enemies. Regular in trial enemies such as \"Grunts\" and \"Giants\" that patrol to find and kill Reagent players. \"Special Ex Pops\" that spawn into trials for a duration to cause reagents trouble and then finally \"Prime Assets\" basically the boss enemies for the different areas that Trials take place in. You'll be learning how each enemy works and how to deal with them over time.\nGAMEPLAY\nGameplay is simple yet can be tricky for newcomers since it's hard to learn while under stress and panicking from the horror experience they'll go through. Simply as a Reagent you run and hide from enemies while completing all kinds of unique objectives to progress in a trial in order to get out. You're able to use Rigs that can be selected in the Play HUB before entering trials that can give a huge edge whether dealing with enemies, the environment, allies or objectives. Players can find useable items around the map to help them recover, get away from danger or even sometimes an item that's mandatory to complete a puzzle for an objective. There is a progression system for your character and even a prestige system if you find yourself wanting to keep playing for more rewards. Multiple endings for the game. Lots of lore if you enjoy learning about the world in Outlast Trials. \nCHALLENGE?\nThe trials can be made more difficult by your choice if you wanna challenge yourself or alongside your crew. You can start by increasing difficulty which will add \"Modifiers\" mixing up the trials with all kinds of effects whether it be limiting items, affecting the environment itself or increasing enemy quantity as well as their damage etc. You can even create your own trials and go nuts to make the hardest trial you can think of or simply what you think would be fun.\nMONEY FOR COSMETICS?\nNO it is NOT necessary to put money into the game in order to earn cool cosmetics or rewards in the game. The devs with this current update however are now allowing players IF they want to spend money they can to get cosmetics right away. You naturally earn cosmetics and rewards by simply playing the game and using the earned currency to purchase things from a multiple catalogs that also give you \"Coins\" to buy more catalogs and earn more free rewards.\nRecommend?\nYES if you wanna have a good scare, enjoy progression, lore or simply want to play with some friends and have a laugh while being spooked then give this game a try. I always enjoy meeting new players and getting to see their experience for the first time.",

As well as bald machete-in-hand crackheads foaming at the mouth trying to sniff you out to stab you repeatedly. And if you are playing with other players, there will be a junkie trying to disguise as one of you and if you let them get too close, they will pull out the Michael Myers handy kitchen knife and attempt to gut you, before they are toppled over by a player drop kicking them.\nDo you also enjoy nice beautiful, peaceful scenery? Well that's not here unfortunately but instead you get to see gory body parts (wow) lots of dead people (yay) and more crazy crackheads jumping out of lockers and bins to beat your face in as you scream for help.

      "review": "it’s rather entertaining game that, from the very beginning, plunges you into a dark and mysterious atmosphere, where you must figure out your first steps in the vastness of a new landscape. the locations and even the smallest design details are stunning at the very first glance and leave you in awe of the further specifics you'll inevitably encounter along the way.\nthe first trial can seem a little incomprehensible and leave you feeling confused, so I sincerely recommend playing a few trials on your own without a team in order to understand the quests and their specifics, including the possible actions of ex-pops and other monsters towards you. however, even if you decide to play with others, it won't be a problem, as I've mostly encountered friendly and polite players who will definitely point you in the right direction if your skills aren't quite perfect. naturally, in all multiplayer games there are exceptions among players who may not behave in the most appropriate manner, but this doesn't change the fact that the vast majority are actually quite friendly.\nthe gaming experience itself can vary depending on the chosen difficulty, the trial, and sometimes whether you're in a team or not, as to get a high score you need to avoid damage from monsters and complete secondary objectives. for this reason, it's often beneficial to play with others, so that the tasks are at least somewhat evenly distributed. furthermore, your teammates can save you from various traps and monster grabs during the game, so this is another aspect that can make your gaming experience somewhat easier. this is also followed by the fact that you have the opportunity to improve your physical abilities in the game through tickets and then equip a rig that can assist you during trials.\nin this game you can also choose the room design and various objects/posters that can be placed there. you can purchase them from catalogs or simply drop them over time by completing various trials. besides all that, you can collect various clothing items which can be obtained in the same way. your room also has a radio where you can view your badges, newspapers after completing rebirth, as well as documents related to the lore of ex-pops, murkoff company workers, and people associated with them. in my opinion, this is a rather interesting opportunity to delve into the history of the game's characters by studying various interviews, personal diary entries and other documents. \nthe trials themselves are quite engaging, although they can be nerve-wracking at times if you're not familiar with some of the processes involved. with the new update “invasion”, the walkthrough has become slightly unbalanced, especially if you're not playing alone, because during some trials you need to keep certain objectives in hand and also focus on using your rig at the right moment against an imposter. this creates some kind of counterbalance in favor of the imposter, since they don't need to carry acid or track a guy with yellow lights bulbs with a tracker. however, I think this update is a good possibility to \"feel like you're in someone else’s skin”, and it clearly succeeded. it's also encouraging that with the update, we now have the opportunity to purchase desired catalogs that were previously unavailable to the new players (like me, for example).\noverall, this game is an unforgettable experience, and even if it may have some flaws, it's still an extremely interesting one",

      "review": "I'll preface by saying that these types of games are completely foreign to me. Realistic graphics? Not my thing. A game seemingly tailor made for people who only watch cartel beheadings? You've already pretty much lost me. That said, this game is pretty good.\n\nThe gore can be a bit much to the point of being self-indulgent, but it tries to craft an uncomfortable setting and does what it set out to do. You will inevitably get over the initial shock value of the bloodstained corridors; Binding of Isaac came to mind in how its gore and body horror became an afterthought on repeated playthroughs. That said, there's still some truly visceral imagery that will snap you out of that desensitized haze. Definitely not for everyone by any means. If you are not acquainted with stressful situations or have lived a life sheltered from life's adversities, this game may prove to be a challenge. I've learned that through my repeated therapies. It can get incredibly nerve-wracking, especially on higher difficulties. You will inevitably struggle with the hordes of enemies thwarting your objectives; it pushed me to my limit. That said, when everything comes together and you outsmart the enemies while getting an A+ on a mission, it's a hit of serotonin that keeps me going.\n\nAlso helps that this game isn't super complicated, it's fairly straightforward. It is pretty rough starting out with none of the rigs or medications unlocked, but if you have friends to carry you, it's not too bad. The rigs and amps provide some build diversity and keep it feeling fresh. Each rig makes the game play different and gives you a new role to play in the group. If one rig doesn't suit you, chances are you will find one that suits your playstyle. The objectives can be a little obtuse at first, but the introductory missions are nice for easing into it. Hardest part I would say is getting a feel for the map layouts while trying not to die, but you get used to it.\n\nJust make sure you have a group of friends to play it with. You [i]can[/i] play solo, but you will probably get frustrated when enemies inevitably camp the objective and you don't have some buds to lure them away. Definitely possible, but the game is clearly not designed with solo play in mind.\n\n[h2]Buy this if:[/h2]\n- You have friends\n- You don't mind a little anxiety and discomfort",

I turned on the sound notification thing on the UI and it helped me figure out what noise I was making that was attracting others to my position.\r\nI really enjoyed this game because of the variety of game elements and how we interact with the game affects the experience we have with it.\r\n It does have a lot of horror elements and addresses sensitive content with as much as you would like to read into. \r\nI love science fiction and horror and this fills my need for adventure, stealth, and RPG games.\r\n I have trouble sometimes with some of the gore but it doesn't affect my enjoyment of the other game elements. I like that they give the Nudity Filter option. I don't use it but thank you for having that.\r\n\r\nI think a big part of this game is what you enjoy bringing to each trial or even just hanging out in the trial room with people waiting for a trial. \r\nI play solo matches often because I move slowly through the trials which they love to punish you for by sending out specialists to hunt you and push you further along the trial. I took over an hour playing a trial that was 15 minutes par. I was new to the map and had trouble navigating.\r\nI enjoyed every moment. The atmosphere and pacing of this game is great and allows you to be creative with your goals.\r\n\r\nI like having my own room to set up and something to kind of just enjoy in between trials to reset and plan out the next one.\r\nThe art in the game is awesome, I like the decorations and trinkets and outfits designs. I think they provide enough that everyone can find what they like and appeals to their Reagent designs and backstory. \r\nOne of my favorite things about this is the bigger world and flexibility for fans to enjoy the game universe in their own ways and really get creative with the game.",

If you like horror, puzzle games, gore and a dash of sexual deviancy this game is most definitely for you. Buy it.\n\n10/10 chess is the real game",

Yeah its yet another outlast trying its best to shock and awe its players via throwing shit at them with absolutely 0 subtlety but somehow this works for me now.\r\n\r\nI guess i fell in love with its level design, i mean there is always at least 1 way around those pesky ex-pops (and usually more) which is revolutionary for outlast. Also i am still shocked how fair and rewarding the progression is compared to industry standard nowdays. There are 0 battlepasses or some other shite meant to squeeze every last dime out of you and the price for the dlcs and catalogs is more than fair for the content they provide. Theres no FOMO (fear of missing out) either, if you missed an event all the content will return some time after. Just for this alone this game deserves all the praise in the world.",

Just be wary that you may not get your items back if things fail on their side because they won't take responsibility for it in any way whatsoever.

      "review": "To preface this, I have been playing this game for over a year and it's one of my favorite games to play. Red Barrel's recent behavior, though, is completely unacceptable with their sudden attacks on the player base. A couple days ago, the Youtuber Sebba along with his group of invaders got completely banned from the Outlast Trials for 1 year for unspecified \"toxic behavior\". When I say completely banned, he quite literally cannot enter the game, even in offline mode despite it being a feature. During the game Sebba got banned from, his voice chat was off and he was never given any reason for his ban. When confronted, the devs did not address the issue at all and just said that everything was ok and to send feedback via their support forum if they thought that the duration was unjustified despite not telling Sebba what he did. Although Sebba is the largest case of this, this has sadly not an isolated incident as other players have also been receiving suspicious bans. From what we know, \"toxic behavior\" could include something like spawn camping, which if that's the case is a balancing issue and the devs should be focusing on taking responsibility and fixing it themselves like most other online pvp games rather than passive aggressively going after players with rules only known by them. Until this is fully addressed, I would highly advise you not buy the game or support the developers as they have shown that they do not care about their players or their dedication and are more than happy taking your $40 plus DLC and microtransactions and throwing it all in the trash.\n\nUpdate: In the past week some new key information has come out that has only worsened the situation. A person on reddit uploaded a video of them getting a player banned for using the strategy of placing a blind mine in front of a locker, confirming our suspicions that they are banning players entirely from the game for any unspecific behavior they do not like without telling players what they did. Some other interesting details that have come out are that players who are actually using glitches have been abusing flaws in the game like going out of bounds in the police station and carnival levels that had been reported to Red Barrels over a year ago. Red Barrels has been banning these players for months and have still not patched these year old bugs, showing a lack in quality assurance when it comes to the Invasion update. The person who reported Sebba also shared their screenshots of their reports to Red Barrels only confirming that there was \"potential cheating\" as stated by the moderator themself. With how broad the definition of cheating is as previously defined, we still have no way to know if Red Barrels was actually justified in their actions against Sebba and his entire team. Yet again I will say, until this situation is fully addressed, I would highly advise you not buy the game or support the developers as they continue to show that they do not care about their players or their dedication and are more than happy taking your $40 plus DLC and microtransactions and throwing it all in the trash for no reason whatsoever.",

Just be wary that you may not get your items back if things fail on their side because they won't take responsibility for it in any way whatsoever. I guess we're just expected to record our sessions if we are clearing pages of their event catalogues, but I wouldn't be surprised if they disregard that evidence as well.\n\nEnjoy the game, just know you can get screwed out of hours of your time.",

      "review": "To preface this, I have been playing this game for over a year and it's one of my favorite games to play. Red Barrel's recent behavior, though, is completely unacceptable with their sudden attacks on the player base. A couple days ago, the Youtuber Sebba along with his group of invaders got completely banned from the Outlast Trials for 1 year for unspecified \"toxic behavior\". When I say completely banned, he quite literally cannot enter the game, even in offline mode despite it being a feature. During the game Sebba got banned from, his voice chat was off and he was never given any reason for his ban. When confronted, the devs did not address the issue at all and just said that everything was ok and to send feedback via their support forum if they thought that the duration was unjustified despite not telling Sebba what he did. Although Sebba is the largest case of this, this has sadly not an isolated incident as other players have also been receiving suspicious bans. From what we know, \"toxic behavior\" could include something like spawn camping, which if that's the case is a balancing issue and the devs should be focusing on taking responsibility and fixing it themselves like most other online pvp games rather than passive aggressively going after players with rules only known by them. Until this is fully addressed, I would highly advise you not buy the game or support the developers as they have shown that they do not care about their players or their dedication and are more than happy taking your $40 plus DLC and microtransactions and throwing it all in the trash.\n\nUpdate: In the past week some new key information has come out that has only worsened the situation. A person on reddit uploaded a video of them getting a player banned for using the strategy of placing a blind mine in front of a locker, confirming our suspicions that they are banning players entirely from the game for any unspecific behavior they do not like without telling players what they did. Some other interesting details that have come out are that players who are actually using glitches have been abusing flaws in the game like going out of bounds in the police station and carnival levels that had been reported to Red Barrels over a year ago. Red Barrels has been banning these players for months and have still not patched these year old bugs, showing a lack in quality assurance when it comes to the Invasion update. The person who reported Sebba also shared their screenshots of their reports to Red Barrels only confirming that there was \"potential cheating\" as stated by the moderator themself. With how broad the definition of cheating is as previously defined, we still have no way to know if Red Barrels was actually justified in their actions against Sebba and his entire team. Yet again I will say, until this situation is fully addressed, I would highly advise you not buy the game or support the developers as they continue to show that they do not care about their players or their dedication and are more than happy taking your $40 plus DLC and microtransactions and throwing it all in the trash for no reason whatsoever.",

To use it at all is a disgrace and it needs to be removed and replaced with actual art. \n\nIf making background art or a few posters is too expensive then you shouldn’t be making a game.

      "review": "An at times annoyingly repetitive co-op horror game with an Outlast skin pasted over it. Every trial consists of repeating mindless and repetitive objectives with almost zero direction whatsoever. Often times you'll need to collect keys or complete puzzles, all marked with a certain symbol of which there'll be red herring ones that exist solely to waste your time. You're actively encouraged to run around like a headless chicken until you just happen to run across whatever you're looking for. You're almost never required to actually think about what you're supposed to be doing, all you do is shut your brain off and mindlessly press buttons until you're suddenly done the trial.\n\nAll of this was still serviceable until a certain trial, \"Pleasure the Prosecutor,\" which may be the most annoying set of tasks I've ever had to do in a co-op game. The mission consists of tracking down enemies across a large map, using a microwave gun three times on them to blow up their heads and take a key from their corpse. These enemies run away after every shock so you have to track them down three times in order to get the key. You then use this key to open a room, pull a lever, and stand in the room until a progress meter reaches 100%, keep in mind that the levers will automatically pull back down twice during the duration of this and you have to track down which ones turned off and turn them back on all while evading enemies. Completing this task gets you one piece of a mannequin. Yeah, just one. You have to do this three times. The whole process of tracking down the same enemy three different times across the map to get a key so you can wait in a room and pull levers three times so that you can get one piece of a mannequin has to be done three separate times, successfully taking a game that already had a very repetitive gameplay loop and making it egregiously annoying. No amount of banter between friends means anything when all of you are just annoyed because the level is absolutely abysmal.\n\nThe consistency of content being added to the game is appreciated but none of it truly feels unique enough to justify spending a significant amount of time playing. It's a fun enough game to play with friends if you can get it on sale, but in this case, your time is more valuable than your money. If you don't enjoy losing your mind doing repetitive objectives, I'd avoid this one like the plague and just hope they can bring it back with an Outlast 3.",

After entering the shuttle to start a trial, the TVs never lower, and everyone is just stuck sitting in the chairs until they leave the match. This issue has been going on for a while now, and they don't seem to have made any effort to fix it, or even really acknowledge the problem. This coupled with a shrinking, and relatively toxic, player-base means this game gets a negative review until they at the very least make the game that I PAID FOR able to be played, and not just be a lobby simulator. From what I understand this bug only affects PC players, and not even all of us, so they don't actually have any intention to fix it at all. Actual garbage. Maybe they should focus on making sure their game runs instead of adding a cash-shop. Typical corporate greed. Not to mention they are too lazy to actually work on their game, instead opting to let shitty AI design it for them, no wonder it doesn't work. STOP THE USE OF AI FOR \"CREATIVE\" WORKS. Basically, the devs are lazy and want to cash in on an IP without ever having to do anything ever again, and their game is in obvious shambles because of it.

I can get the cosmetic for free? Means nothing if someone else can just purchase it, it's a waste of time at this point when I can just wait for it to be over and just play the regular trials to get the cosmetics.
