The gameplay is fun, the visuals are amazing, the augment system has a lot of variety. The problem is that they took all these cool concepts and crunched it into (what was) an Epic Store exclusive with NFT elements in an already hyper-saturated BR market. There's definitely a feeling of \"studio/artist vs corporate boardroom\" in the mix, which kind of makes it a bit jumbled and unfocused. Not to mention the game's playerbase is rather sparse, there are definitely some matches where I feel like I'm playing against really badly coded bots. \n\nThere's so much cool stuff going on here, and has all the workings of a great core game loop. However, I feel like this game has been effectively kneecapped by poor management and marketing. The actual meat-and-potatoes are solid, but I have a feeling something like this could have worked really well as a single player game with a larger scope, or perhaps even an extraction shooter (which I'm sure they're trying to shoehorn in to keep up with the kids).

Prices are inflated, and the system feels designed for profit—not gameplay.\n\nRampant Cheating, Poor Moderation:\nCheaters are everywhere. There’s no real anti-cheat, and support is non-existent. Players report bugs or hacks and get no response.\n\nInconsistent Community Support:\nOnly select voices get heard—usually early investors or influencers. The average player is ignored.\n\nMarketplace Manipulation:\nThe devs appear to favor marketplace changes that boost their own token profits rather than balance the game.

Currently, the marketplace is experiencing some issues, as the game is still in its early access stage. Several features still need improvement before the official launch.\n \nAlthough your experience may not have been ideal, we hope the game has still brought you some enjoyment. Rest assured, our team is working hard to improve and stabilize everything. We aim to meet your expectations and provide you with the best possible experience as development progresses.\n \nPlease know that we’re always here to listen to your concerns and questions, and we’ll do our best to provide you with the most suitable resolution. \n \nPlease confirm if you'd like to receive the one-week OTG Pro subscription so we can proceed with the request and have our team process the compensation for the inconvenience this has caused you.\n \nThank you for your patience and understanding in this matter. \n\nBest,\n\nZigg\nGunzilla Games Support\n\n\t\n\nSerravym\n\nJun 16, 2025, 17:32 GMT+2\nThank you, \nI just wanted the confirmation after months of having the issue on teams radar, I dont even care about the week so long as you post in broadcast on discord so that everyone who may or may not have noticed can claim that week, and you just openly acknowledge it. \n\nthe gameplay is great the game got back into gaming and shooters more so after 4 years off, i only get worked up because every issue my friends experience is mostly skill gap and some of the constant changes which i can handle most people want yall to succeed myself included, its just been a uniquely awful experience with the marketplace issues. no matter my opinion keep up the good work and pace for way ahead just own up to this please and let others in the community get there week, im already sub'd out to nov anyways\n\n\t\n\nZigg (Off The Grid)\n\nJun 16, 2025, 15:13 GMT+2\nHello again, Serravym,\n \nThank you for your patience and understanding while waiting for our update. \n \nI received an update from the team, and they confirmed that, unfortunately, the Pierser Scope has been permanently removed from the game, with no plans to bring it back at this time. That is why we’re offering a one-week subscription as compensation.\n \nAdditionally, our team has confirmed that NFTs transferred to the Mainnet will temporarily display a \"Validating\" status. This is due to the processing time required to complete the migration for all players transitioning to the Mainnet. As a result, some players may experience longer-than-expected validation times.\n \nThe duration of the \"Validating\" status depends on the processing queue for NFTs being transferred. In some cases, the status may clear quickly, while in others, it may take longer. We kindly ask for your patience during this time.\n \nRest assured, all NFTs currently marked as \"Validating\" will be processed and cleared accordingly.\n \nPlease confirm if you would like to receive the compensation for your missing item so our team can proceed with crediting it to your account.\n \nI am looking forward to your reply.   \n\nBest,\n\nZigg\nGunzilla Games Support",

My first handful of matches were buttery smooth with no connectivity issues, likely because the lobbies were filled with bots. Still, the experience was fun enough to make me want more.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, once the game decided I was ready for the real competition, things went downhill. I started getting matched with what seemed like full squads, and while that challenge was welcome, the sudden drop in performance was not. Lag spikes, sluggish controls, and occasional unplayable matches quickly soured the experience.\r\n\r\nThere’s a great game hiding under the hood here — one with the potential to stand out in the genre — but until the connectivity issues are ironed out, Off the Grid feels like a missed opportunity rather than a daily go-to.",

Not fun.\n\nPeople aren't serious or invested in the game. You'll start a game just for your teammates to not even be present and die right at the start. I muted everyone's mics because you just hear 6 year old's talking and peoples TVs. I think it's another issue with being free to play.\n\n4 out of 5 matches are awful. Teammates not sticking together or not sure what to do at all. The fifth game would be great when you get paired with someone that is actually trying. \n\nThe progression sucks. The game is here to sell GUN coins,memberships, and cosmetics. Earning them to buy cosmetics is slow. There are random loot containers so you never know what you'll get. You can't keep any weapons from the match. The HEX cubes (loot containers) must be extracted and other teams will make sure you don't.   \n\nThere's so many store / merch / membership pages to click through before and after matches - it's exhausting. \n\nHUD is confusing and tiny. \n\nThe big concern I have is optimization. It's rough! The game runs OKAY - 60% GPU load but in the lobby menus it's AWFUL. Like RUINING my computer awful. 90%+ GPU load! My fans are going INSANE while waiting in the lobby. WHY?

Updates are vague, missed deadlines are never explained, and the community is left guessing.\n\nShady NFT/Marketplace Practices:\nDespite claiming blockchain is “optional,” the entire in-game economy is built around it. Prices are inflated, and the system feels designed for profit—not gameplay.\n\nRampant Cheating, Poor Moderation:\nCheaters are everywhere. There’s no real anti-cheat, and support is non-existent. Players report bugs or hacks and get no response.\n\nInconsistent Community Support:\nOnly select voices get heard—usually early investors or influencers. The average player is ignored.\n\nMarketplace Manipulation:\nThe devs appear to favor marketplace changes that boost their own token profits rather than balance the game.

That is why we’re offering a one-week subscription as compensation.\n \nAdditionally, our team has confirmed that NFTs transferred to the Mainnet will temporarily display a \"Validating\" status. This is due to the processing time required to complete the migration for all players transitioning to the Mainnet. As a result, some players may experience longer-than-expected validation times.\n \nThe duration of the \"Validating\" status depends on the processing queue for NFTs being transferred. In some cases, the status may clear quickly, while in others, it may take longer. We kindly ask for your patience during this time.\n \nRest assured, all NFTs currently marked as \"Validating\" will be processed and cleared accordingly.\n \nPlease confirm if you would like to receive the compensation for your missing item so our team can proceed with crediting it to your account.\n \nI am looking forward to your reply.   \n\nBest,\n\nZigg\nGunzilla Games Support",

My first handful of matches were buttery smooth with no connectivity issues, likely because the lobbies were filled with bots. Still, the experience was fun enough to make me want more.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, once the game decided I was ready for the real competition, things went downhill. I started getting matched with what seemed like full squads, and while that challenge was welcome, the sudden drop in performance was not. Lag spikes, sluggish controls, and occasional unplayable matches quickly soured the experience.\r\n\r\nThere’s a great game hiding under the hood here — one with the potential to stand out in the genre — but until the connectivity issues are ironed out, Off the Grid feels like a missed opportunity rather than a daily go-to.",
