I'll always pick Chill Pulse; it's supposed to help you focus, not bombard you with stuff just to scratch the brain itch. \nI recently bought it and honestly it's been a huge help. I can focus better on my studies and it really calms down the ADHD monkey brain. The songs are great, some help me stay in the zone, others are perfect for breaks because they're a bit more catchy. You can also turn them off and leave just nature sounds in the background, which is really nice. I've also been making progress on my book since I started using it and that is truly shocking for me. It actually helps me form a routine and stay consistent and somehow it tricks my brain into this because I see it like a game that I like to play, so it's like a quest.

If you have adhd traits and your brain doesn’t respond to “shoulds”—instead visual feedback, small wins, little rewards to look forward to, i really recommend it. personally, it helps me concentrate and find a sense of purpose in my tasks.\n\nbecause it’s already good, I think the devs deserve to know what could make it even better:\n\n- confirmation button when purchasing fish. because i’ve bought them by accident more than once.\n- there’s an optional break alarm, but i think there should also be an alarm (toggleable, of course) for when your break timer ends.\n- someone else mentioned this, but: no sunny weather option?? wild.\n- why can you only put an earring on one ear? please consider symmetry.\n\nnow onto less important, but still nice-to-have things:\n\n- little bit of character customization like changing her hair color would be fun.\n-more shirts. obviously. everyone wants more shirts. hawaii mode has quite a few, but this girl desperately needs more sweaters if you ask me.\n- since people with adhd seem to benefit most from this game, maximizing customization and sensory comfort in that direction (making sure it doesn’t become overwhelming or distracting!) would probably bring even more sales. just a word of advice.\n\nedit. also, if the post-its could be put directly onto the screen near the character, instead of having a section of their own? that’d be pretty dope.",

      "review": "I’ve tried this out for a couple of days, so here’s my take:\n\nfirst of all, it’s very useful for the right people. If you have adhd traits and your brain doesn’t respond to “shoulds”—instead visual feedback, small wins, little rewards to look forward to, i really recommend it. personally, it helps me concentrate and find a sense of purpose in my tasks.\n\nbecause it’s already good, I think the devs deserve to know what could make it even better:\n\n- confirmation button when purchasing fish. because i’ve bought them by accident more than once.\n- there’s an optional break alarm, but i think there should also be an alarm (toggleable, of course) for when your break timer ends.\n- someone else mentioned this, but: no sunny weather option?? wild.\n- why can you only put an earring on one ear? please consider symmetry.\n\nnow onto less important, but still nice-to-have things:\n\n- little bit of character customization like changing her hair color would be fun.\n-more shirts. obviously. everyone wants more shirts. hawaii mode has quite a few, but this girl desperately needs more sweaters if you ask me.\n- since people with adhd seem to benefit most from this game, maximizing customization and sensory comfort in that direction (making sure it doesn’t become overwhelming or distracting!) would probably bring even more sales. just a word of advice.\n\nedit. also, if the post-its could be put directly onto the screen near the character, instead of having a section of their own? that’d be pretty dope.",

I'll always pick Chill Pulse; it's supposed to help you focus, not bombard you with stuff just to scratch the brain itch. \nI recently bought it and honestly it's been a huge help. I can focus better on my studies and it really calms down the ADHD monkey brain. The songs are great, some help me stay in the zone, others are perfect for breaks because they're a bit more catchy. You can also turn them off and leave just nature sounds in the background, which is really nice. I've also been making progress on my book since I started using it and that is truly shocking for me. It actually helps me form a routine and stay consistent and somehow it tricks my brain into this because I see it like a game that I like to play, so it's like a quest. I love the cozy graphics, the interface which is very easy to use and the Pomodoro timer with the alarm is super helpful, together with the calendar and to-do list. Oh and the letters! Sometimes I send one and the replies make me giggle, it's such a cute touch!\nThank you for creating this. ♥",

All the scenarios follow the same dynamic and it becomes repetitive, the story associated with each stage is a good mechanic, but it also feels poorly implemented. The music and background sounds are VERY limited, which makes no sense. The only reason I would recommend this game over \"Spirit City\" or others is if you prefer the pixel art aesthetic (which is why I bought Chill Pulse over others, but ended up regretting it) and/or if you really hate 3D art.
