It could be so vast with tons of features but they just don't care. \ni've been playing this game since 2006, with every year at least 500h+.

The graphics look the same, the career is the same menu that needs 8 clicks to get where you need it to be. You can still use the same buttons to relay, effort, etc. and these core mechanics haven't changed a bit. The sprints work the same, just line some up and use effort when the one in front is tired and GG EZ WIN. \n\nFor a game that has been around so long it's crazy how much in almost 25 years things haven't changed. If I purely look at the graphics on my 4k game PC which is brand new and runs everything on ultra high, I could honestly not tell you the difference from this version or 2016.
