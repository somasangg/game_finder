      "review": "Per uno che viene da FIFA, NBA2K è migliaia di volte meglio come gioco di sport a squadre e più soddisfacente. Sono un giocatore vecchio stile, solo offline, modalità franchigia (MyNBA). La modalità Mynba è nettamente migliore della modalità allenatore di FIFA, è tutto quello che avrei voluto da Fifa in anni di sviluppo della serie. Inoltre in modo un po furbo 2k lascia una bella parte di lavoro alla community, che rifinisce il gioco con Sliders, roster personalizzati, i migliori, aumentano l'aspetto simulativo della modalità che ho citato in modo sostanziale. So che è un modo furbo per non spendere troppo lavoro su una modalità poco remunerativa economicamente, però almeno viene concesso un modo per migliorare il gioco! La prima volta che giocai ad nba2k notai la quantità di attributi e tendenze per i giocatori, rimasi strabiliato, per non parlare dei parametri modificabili per quanto riguarda l'AI che simula l'andamento del campionato. In poche parole per chi fa i rosters e gli sliders personalizzati, viene dato un strumento molto potente che se calibrato a dovere crea la simulazione sportiva a squadre migliore sul mercato. La controparte calcistica, non è ancora riuscita a dare uno stile diverso di gioco da squadra a squadra e da giocatore a giocatore e penso sia una vergogna nel 2025!\r\nInsomma se siete dei giocatori dei calcistici e vi piace anche un po il basket vale la pena provare, la curva di apprendimento è ripida, ma poi il gioco diventa molto soddisfacente!",

      "review": "[h1]CONSENSUS 🗑️[/h1]\n[b]While the core basketball simulation remains stellar, [i]NBA 2K25[/i] is an aggressively monetized title whose annual, full-price release schedule and predatory VC tactics demonstrate a profound disrespect for the MyPlayer community's time and wallet.[/b]\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h1]FULL REVIEW 📝[/h1]\n[b]Score: 59% (Rotten)[/b] 🚨\n\nLet me be clear: the basketball simulation in [i]NBA 2K25[/i] is still the best in the business. The animations, the tactical depth, and the feeling of a genuine NBA game are all here. The problem isn’t the game itself; the problem is the business model designed to make the MyPlayer experience unplayable unless you pay extra, and then forces you to repeat the entire cycle in 12 months.\n\n[h2]The Cash Grab That Ruins Everything 💸[/h2]\nThe experience is defined by its disrespect of your time. If you primarily play MyPlayer, you begin at a painfully low overall rating (60 OVR) to ensure that competing online is miserable, [b]forcing you to spend upwards of $100 just to be viable[/b]. The City isn't a social hub; it's a relentless, virtual billboard designed to manufacture FOMO and push microtransactions at every turn.\n\n[h2]The Annual Treadmill 📉[/h2]\nThe worst offender is the annual release cycle. Every September, 2K demands players return to the beginning of the grueling grind, forcing a massive, mandatory re-investment of time or money just to make the exact same MyPlayer build competitive. This yearly reset cannibalizes the online player base and kills community momentum, all while delivering minimal, iterative gameplay updates. It is the definition of a cash grab based on forced repetition.\n\n[h2]The Inevitable Fix: A Better Structural Model 🤝[/h2]\nThe annual full-price release makes no sense for a game built entirely around the seasonal, progression-based treadmill of MyPlayer. [i]NBA 2K[/i] already functions as a live service game—with seasons, battle passes, and constant monetization—but it insists on charging full price every year. Transitioning to a single, perpetually updated model with paid seasonal content and roster updates would be a more honest structure for this core experience. Such a change would:\n[list]\n[*] [b]Unify the Community:[/b] The online player base would stop being fractured across multiple titles, leading to better and faster matchmaking.\n[*] [b]Validate Investment:[/b] A new cycle could focus on competitive seasonal resets and fresh builds, making the year-long journey feel worthwhile instead of a mandatory, expensive re-grind.\n[*] [b]Be More Honest:[/b] The current monetization is only truly justified in a perpetual service model, not a boxed product.\n[/list]\n\nUntil 2K respects the time and wallet of its loyal players, this game will remain a brilliant basketball sim wrapped in a predatory shell.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]THE VERDICT ⚖️[/h1]\nA technical marvel that is an ethical disaster for its MyPlayer community. Don't buy [i]NBA 2K25[/i] unless you are prepared to buy it twice, and repeat the same grind next year.",

The focus on VC affects the overall sense of progression. It doesn’t feel like your player grows through practice or understanding of the game, but rather through how much of money you’re willing to spend on the game.\n\nThe actual basketball gameplay is somewhat enjoyable when everything works out. There are moments where the experience can feel immersive. However, these moments are often overshadowed by the fact that this game still heavily relies on VC and micro transactions to progress and to basically do anything in this game. It is very hard to continue playing and stay motivated when the path forward feels so incredibly slow unless, you're willing to pay an additional amount of money on top of the 70 dollars you already spent on the game.\n\nDO NOT SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS GAME, OR ANY NBA2K GAME. DO NOT SPEND YOUR PRECIOUS AND VALUABLE TIME ON THIS PIECE OF SHIT. SPEND YOUR MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE, AND SPEND TIME WITH YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS INSTEAD. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID.

Its super choppy and lags in some areas and is decently smooth elsewhere even after tuning the settings to a lower preset. The shooting mechanics in this 2K is pretty good but that's about everything that is good about this game imo.",

Do i really have to been saving the game exiting to menu to prevent the risk of losing match progression? Nah never buy this game if it isnt on 90% discount or even free. if Sports game does not deal with year to year new game release, 2k are going to lose the loyalty of their long term users, i started playing 2k on 2k14, tried, 2k15, 2k16, 2k17 and 2k18, i quit playing due compatibilty issues on a low end pc i had years ago. I upgrade computer and give it a try 2k21, 2k,23  and 2k25. and its only getting worse on technical and optimization issues.",

I guess it's a small price to pay for being able to properly render every bead of sweat on LeBron's forehead.",

Making teammates dumb when in a lead. Players don't actually dribble the ball, there is no ball physics when dribbling. CPU always does a canned dribble step 3 pointer that 100% makes it all the time no matter if your in the face. Early 2000s NBA2K needs to come back because at least the physics, CPU and shooting were way better. Would not recommend at full price and only at at deep discount.",

      "review": "Possibly the least user friendly sports game I've ever played, leaving me completely baffled.\n\nAttributes in mycareer are completely unaffarodable, leaving you stuck playing as a terrible player, more often than not out of position. You cannot request a trade if the situation is bad. The quests require you to do either completely tedious side quests and discussions, often to place adverts or some famous cunt, or they require you to hit a target completely unachievable for your level. \n\nThe AI is straight up moronic, they just block you half the time and constantly just hoik up fade away 3 pointers, which obviously go in being the AI. Whilst you cannot hit an open shot regardless of stats unless you green it, and don't even think about it if its even moderately contested.\n\nYou are constantly stuck in animations, taking your character about 5-6 business days to finish a block animation or dribble move, don't even get me started on the AI locking you in the paint forcing a 3 second turnover. \n\nThe movement is completely unresponsive with the AI blasting past you because your guy refuses to react, combining this with being stuck in animations, your player has the agility and dexterity of a dead sloth, half the time refusing to pick up the ball or just catch a rebound.\n\nMyGM is laggy as fuck and has a habit of crashing.\n\nThe UI is slow, confusing and buggy.\n\nThe settings menu is borderline useless and difficult to find, with most settings having to be changed in only the main menu.\n\nYou get spammed with shitty statistics every single time the ball goes out of play, meaning you're not even playing the game, which may be an upside.\n\nIts fucking awful.",
