      "review": "The core of the game—the fishing itself—feels very polished and satisfying. Casting your line and using various retrieval techniques like \"Twitching\" or \"Stop & Go\" to trigger a bite feels great.\nThe game goes into great detail regarding your equipment. You assemble your own individual setup consisting of rod, reel, line, and bait. Attributes such as reel drag (max drag), line strength/test, stretch, and lure size are crucial for success. A big plus is the ability to carry and use multiple rods simultaneously, increasing your chances of a catch. The time of day also plays a major role, as fish are active at different times.\n\nThe game requires economic thinking. Traveling to different locations can be quite expensive, meaning if you go unprepared, you will lose money. You are forced to fish profitably to ensure the trip yields a return on investment.\nThis creates a strong motivation to tweak your setups to improve bite rates and profit margins. Whether you build a \"universal setup\" or specialize in specific fish is up to you—as long as the cash flow is positive at the end of the day.\n\nThere is practically no manual or tutorial explaining exactly how mechanics work. The motto is strictly \"Trial and Error.\" While the shop descriptions for products are immersive—written almost like real-life advertisements that hint at their function—the game can be unnecessarily confusing. For example, some fish have cryptic preferences for baits like \"narrow spoons\" or \"nano spoons,\" but the shop doesn't use these names (listing only \"casting\" or \"slop spoons\" instead). This is very confusing for new players.\nAdditionally, you get bottlenecked by your gear. Essential items, like stronger fishing lines, are unlocked quite late, which artificially slows down progress.\n\nProgression is a double-edged sword. Without \"Premium\" status, leveling takes a long time. If you want to progress faster and get more XP and money, you have to pay (approx. €10/month). While you do receive a small amount of premium currency at the start to buy some advantageous gear, the shop itself is a bit of a mess. Premium goods and tournament rewards are mixed in with regular items, and there is no option to hide them, making the shop cluttered.\n\nThe game offers a fantastic fishing feel and motivates players through the search for the perfect setup. However, high travel costs and a lack of explanations make the entry difficult. It is a game for patient players who are willing to learn through failure and don’t mind a certain amount of grind (or reaching for their wallet).",

      "review": "Introduction: Why did I start? And why am I still playing?\nI started Fishing Planet almost by accident — I was looking for something calm to take my mind off shooters and RPGs. I thought, \"Fishing? Easy. Calmly. Naturally.\" Oh, how wrong I was.\n\nIt's not just fishing. This is a simulator where every detail — from the wind to the depth, from the type of bait to the behavior of the fish — matters. And if you want to catch a trophy perch or a giant catfish, get ready for it to be a battle, not a walk.\n\nGameplay: Realism on the verge of fanaticism\n1. The physics and behavior of fish are your main opponent\nThe fish here is not just a model that bites on a timer. She's thinking. She has:\n\nBehavioral patterns: Some fish are active in the morning, others in the evening. Some like shade, others like open water.\nReaction to the bait: if you pull too hard, she may get scared and leave. If it's too slow, it ignores you.\nResistance: that's where the fun begins. Each fish pulls in its own way. Pike — sharp, short bursts. Catfish is a powerful, exhausting drawling fight. And the salmon? He just wants to escape into the ocean. And you're going to have to stop him.\n, Advice for a beginner: Take your time! Even if the fish bites, do not immediately raise the rod. Let her \"play\", let her swallow. Otherwise, it's a cliff. \n\n2. Gear: Set up like in a combat simulator\nHere you can choose:\n\nFishing rods (spinning, fly fishing, float, bottom) — each for its own style.\nCoils — with different gear ratios, brakes, and weights.\nFishing lines — monofilament, braided, fluorocarbon — each type affects sensitivity and strength.\nBaits are wobblers, spinners, silicone, live bait... and each one works under certain conditions.\nSubtlety: For example, it is better to use slow baits in cold water. They're fast in the heat. And if the water is cloudy, bright colors. And yes, depending on the depth, you need to change the weight of the bait. Have you forgotten? The fish won't bite. \n\n3. Environment: Not just a background, it's part of the game\nFishing Planet maps are not just beautiful pictures. They're alive:\n\nThe wind affects the wave → changes the casting trajectory.\nWater temperature — fish behaves differently.\nTime of day — morning/evening = peak activity.\nThe weather — rain, clouds, sun — affects everything.\nUnderwater terrain — rocks, driftwood, grass — fish hide where you don't expect them.\nLife Hack: Use the echo sounder! It will show you where the fish is, at what depth and what size. Without him, you're a blind fisherman. \n\nGame modes: From singles to tournaments\n, Free fishing\nIdeal for beginners and those who just want to relax. You choose a location, gear, and go ahead. But even here you can spend hours catching one fish, because it doesn't want to bite. That's life.\n\n, Tournaments\nEverything is serious here. You're being evaluated by:\n\nThe size of the fish\nThe number of people caught\nFishing time\nTournaments are held in real time, which means you need to be online at the right time. And yes, the competitors are real fans. It happens that you lose because you didn't notice a change in the weather.\n\n, Survival Mode\nThe toughest one. You fish to get money for gear, food, and boat repairs. If you don't catch them, you'll starve to death. Yes, in a fishing game. 😅\n\n🖥️ Graphics and sound: Dive to 200%\nThe graphics are one of the best in the genre. The water looks real, reflections, waves, splashes — everything is at the highest level. Especially on a good PC.\n\nSound is a different story. The sound of waves, chirping birds, squishing fish in the water — creates an atmosphere as if you are really on the shore of the lake.\n\nMinus: The game may slow down on weak PCs. Especially on large maps with lots of objects. \n\nMonetization: Free, but with a catch\nThe game is free, but there is an in-game store.:\n\nPremium class gear — for real money.\nLocations — some are only available for a fee.\nThe skins for fishing rods and boats are purely decorative.\nBut! You can play it completely for free. You'll just have to wait a little while until you save up money for the best gear. Or... Become a fishing master and win tournaments.\n\nIn my opinion, Monetization is not intrusive. It doesn't hurt if you're not a fan of shopping. But if you want to get the best reel quickly, pay up. \n\n, Community and multiplayer\nYou can catch with friends or random players. Sometimes it's fun when everyone is trying to catch one big fish. Sometimes it's stressful when someone steals your \"hot\" spot.\n\nThere are forums and Discord servers where tactics, gear, and locations are discussed. A very active community.\n\n, Pros and cons\n, Advantages:\nIncredible realism\nDeep mechanics of gear and fish behavior\nBeautiful graphics and sound\nDifferent modes — from relaxation to extreme survival\nFree foundation\n, Cons:\nLearning curve — it will be difficult for beginners\nSometimes bugs (for example, fish freezes or doesn't bite for no reason)\nMonetization can be annoying if you want everything at once.\nSome locations require purchase\nBottom line: Who is this game for?\n✅ For you if:\n\nDo you like deep mechanics simulators?\nDo you like realism and detail?\nAre you ready to learn and experiment\nDo you want to relax, but still receive a challenge?\n Not for you if:\n\nDo you want fast, simple fishing without strategy\nDo not tolerate when the game \"does not work\" — you need to work\nNot ready to waste time studying gear and conditions\nFinal verdict: 9/10\nFishing Planet is not just a game. It's an experience. This is that rare simulator that makes you feel like a real fisherman — with joy from the first catch and despair from the tenth cliff. There is no \"easy\" here. There is — \"interesting\". And that's what makes it unique.\n\nLast word: If you haven't caught at least one fish in 5 hours, don't give up. Just change the bait. Or the time of day. Or the weather. Or... start over. After all, fishing is about patience. And about winning over yourself. \n\nP.S. Yes, I'm still trying to catch that 120-centimeter pike in the \"Big Lake\". If you have any advice, write to us. I'm desperate. 😅",

This game has the best fishing simulation while you're on the edge of a lake and that part was fun, as fun as fishing is. But the rest of the game isnt fun at all, I wouldnt even consider the rest of it a game, its more like a fishing simulator inside of an ad. I put 10 bucks into it to experience what the game was but they still peppered me with in game ads even as a premium subscriber or whatever. Even everything physical outside of the 80% of the game thats made up of UI and ads is pretty bad, character customization is basically, you can be a different race. You're character walks around like a dummy on a stick with a wheel at its base, and you walk in very confined spaces, dictated by invisible walls.

      "review": "Game is pretty fun but there are a few galring QoL issues that don't make sense coming from a game expecting $$$ micro-transactions.\n\n1. Character takes unecessary amount of time switiching rods as automatic actions are performed after each cast. Would prefer to have the choice to manually reset the rod after each cast so multi-rod fishing seems more feasible. It was nice to see that the different rod stands had an effect on switching speed but having the character stand in front of you, motionless while he/she flicks some lever on the rod, all the while a fish on another line escapes is pure rage bait from the devs.\n\n2. Really hostile pricing models. The ideal tackle or line, lure etc. etc. that you might want for the fish you're going for will be gate kept via the in game currency. forcing you into a suboptimal set up purely because you dont want to spend real money on the game.\n\n3. The amount of false positives with fish being lost to line tension is ridiculous. Tension could be maintained perfectly and the fish will somehow fall off as its being pulled from the water into your hand. If you want to keep that mechanic in the game then at least give us the option of a net or something to help pull the fish in. Level 30 currently and no such option available.\n\n4. The amount of times ive lost multiple fish because the game won't let me switch rods on a holder is becoming an issue to the point I have to change my review and not recommend this game unless you have prior experience in similar games. Its a level of cruelty that shouldnt be an issue, if the devs simply played their game. And certainly one would expect issues like this to be non existent after being out for 10 years. Truly a terrible experience. Please do something about it as it is limiting this game severely\n\nIf you don't care about optimisation and just want to throw a line in the water to get some fish then its a pretty good game. The more you try to optimise, the more the game breaks ://\n\nEdit: complete cash grab of a game. Just don't play it in general honestly",

Below are just a few reason to be wary of developers who use Denuvo.\n\nDenuvo performs constant integrity checks, encryption/decryption, and verification of the game executable during runtime, which can consume CPU resources.\n\nIndependent testing showed frame-time spikes and longer load times when Denuvo was enabled.\n\nSome versions of Denuvo require periodic, or constant, online authentication. This can lock out legitimate users when Denuvo’s servers are down or when internet access is unreliable.\n\nBecause Denuvo performs repeated reads (and possibly writes), this can contribute to increased wear on SSDs.\n\nBecause Denuvo is proprietary, users don’t really know exactly what checks are happening, how often, or how invasive they are.\n\nIf Fishing Planet removes Denuvo in the future, I'll gladly update my review, but as it stands, I can't recommend it.",

If your designing a fishing game and decide to include lines getting snagged and you suggest a solution and the solution is the equivalent of chucking the fishing rod into the lake than im not playing anymore. Update the tutorial or fix the bug that disappears the entire fishing rod upon cutting the line. Do no recommend, graphics and pop up ads are way too high for this level of BS",

      "review": "Game is pretty fun but there are a few galring QoL issues that don't make sense coming from a game expecting $$$ micro-transactions.\n\n1. Character takes unecessary amount of time switiching rods as automatic actions are performed after each cast. Would prefer to have the choice to manually reset the rod after each cast so multi-rod fishing seems more feasible. It was nice to see that the different rod stands had an effect on switching speed but having the character stand in front of you, motionless while he/she flicks some lever on the rod, all the while a fish on another line escapes is pure rage bait from the devs.\n\n2. Really hostile pricing models. The ideal tackle or line, lure etc. etc. that you might want for the fish you're going for will be gate kept via the in game currency. forcing you into a suboptimal set up purely because you dont want to spend real money on the game.\n\n3. The amount of false positives with fish being lost to line tension is ridiculous. Tension could be maintained perfectly and the fish will somehow fall off as its being pulled from the water into your hand. If you want to keep that mechanic in the game then at least give us the option of a net or something to help pull the fish in. Level 30 currently and no such option available.\n\n4. The amount of times ive lost multiple fish because the game won't let me switch rods on a holder is becoming an issue to the point I have to change my review and not recommend this game unless you have prior experience in similar games. Its a level of cruelty that shouldnt be an issue, if the devs simply played their game. And certainly one would expect issues like this to be non existent after being out for 10 years. Truly a terrible experience. Please do something about it as it is limiting this game severely\n\nIf you don't care about optimisation and just want to throw a line in the water to get some fish then its a pretty good game. The more you try to optimise, the more the game breaks ://\n\nEdit: complete cash grab of a game. Just don't play it in general honestly",

This can lock out legitimate users when Denuvo’s servers are down or when internet access is unreliable.\n\nBecause Denuvo performs repeated reads (and possibly writes), this can contribute to increased wear on SSDs.\n\nBecause Denuvo is proprietary, users don’t really know exactly what checks are happening, how often, or how invasive they are.\n\nIf Fishing Planet removes Denuvo in the future, I'll gladly update my review, but as it stands, I can't recommend it.",
