Units carry over from one campaign to the next, retaining their skills, and heroes can be attached to them for even greater impact. \n\nThe campaign DLCs are highly recommended for the full experience, with the last two (Axis Operations 1945 and 1946) even offering an alternative history path where the war doesn’t end in 1945 but continues into 1946 with different outcomes. \n\nA must-play for fans of the genre and anyone who enjoys turn-based hex strategy games.",
