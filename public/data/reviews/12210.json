There was just something about the atmosphere, the story, and the music that stuck with me. Fast forward to this year — I finally got the opportunity to play it, and wow… it was everything I hoped for and more.\n\nFrom the moment I stepped into Liberty City as Niko Bellic, I was completely hooked. The story is simply perfect — it’s emotional, dark, funny, and deeply human all at once. Every character feels alive, with their own personalities, struggles, and quirks. You can tell how much care went into every little detail. The world feels gritty and real, like you’re walking through an actual living city full of stories.\n\nThe missions are fantastic, the writing is top-tier, and the soundtrack still gives me chills. Even after all these years, the game’s atmosphere and storytelling easily rival (and in my opinion, surpass) most modern open-world games.\n\nI got this game on a Steam sale for a ridiculously low price, but honestly, it deserves every bit of its full price and more. This is one of those rare games that remind you why you fell in love with gaming in the first place.\n\nI’m definitely going to replay it again soon — next time, I’ll try to 100% it and grab every single achievement. GTA IV isn’t just a game, it’s an experience — one I’ll never forget.",

Tu não vai ficar trilionário ao zerar, tu não vai ter um final feliz e não vai ter um carrão em cada esquina para você usar nas missões. Você vai contar os centavos pra comprar as coisas, vai ter que tomar decisões difíceis que moldam a história e seu caráter até o fim e vai usar mais o táxi do que um carro tunado nas missões (algo que esse jogo é excelente).\n\nMesmo com várias limitações que fazem dele um jogo menos ''divertido'' para o cara médio, GTA IV é pra mim o melhor GTA de todos, a história é anos-luz a frente dos outros, GTA V pode ser muito maior e muito mais popular que o GTA IV, mas o GTA IV tem algo que o GTA V não tem: Alma.",

      "review": "Definitely shows its age but has some of its own merits. First off, theres graphical issues, as I had a lot of stuttering in cutscenes and had to limit FPS to 60 even though there was higher options. Also playing on higher than 60 FPS made cars and bikes spin out regularly and messed with their handling for some reason. I also got crashing when alt tabbing the game, as well as crashing during a specific DLC mission that I had to lower draw distance to minimal just to play it. \r\n\r\nThe game looks alright, and it plays fine enough, but in making the game more grounded it did lose some of its charm. The cars are more boring, theres only like 2 versions of 3-4 types of guns, meaning you've seen it all in the first 40-50% of the game, and theres way less jets and helicopters. The game also has no mid mission cutscenes which is such a moronic game design flaw, especially when that was a big issue of earlier GTA games. The missions are also quite repetitive, its mostly just go here and shoot them, drive this person here, or go there and pick this up. The story of Niko is alright but I didn't find myself caring that much. \r\n\r\nThe DLCs are a mixed bag. The first one adds nothing, just a bike you're on that is more annoying to drive and more fragile than bikes so you won't want to use it much. Thankfully the second DLC adds a few new guns and has some helicopter mission so its more enjoyable. Overall the games are fine, but a bit antiquated on mission design, lack of chekpoints in first one, boring cars and guns, and too much repetition. It holds up alright but I was kind of sick of it by the time it was overl 7.5/10.",

The improvements are night and day — smoother performance, modern compatibility, and quality-of-life fixes that make everything feel fresh again. FusionFix doesn’t just patch issues, it elevates the game to what it always should have been.\n\nThis is hands down the best way to play.

Don’t even bother launching the game without it - it fixes a ton of issues and makes the experience smooth, especially from September 2025 onward. Download the offline installer and patch the game.\nNow, about the game itself - the story is great. Niko and Roman’s journey is gritty, emotional and full of that old-school Slavic vibe. You’ve got Russian phrases, Vladivostok FM on the radio and that cold, grey as well as autumn style NYC atmosphere that just hits differently. It’s not a cheerful game but the dark humor is still there. There are choices that actually affect the story, which is always a plus.\nTook me around 28 hours to finish the main story and all the side missions. Honestly, it’s kind of sad how few people actually finish the game, and even fewer touch the DLCs - Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, which are both excellent in their own right.\nHard to believe this came out in 2008. The level of detail, the writing, the world-building - it’s all still impressive by today’s standards. And if you’re playing on a handheld like the Steam deck, it’s surprisingly kind to your battery too.\nThis game is a piece of art. If you haven’t played it yet, you’re missing out.",

The freedom to roam, complete missions, or simply enjoy the environment adds to the game's charm, making it a memorable experience for both newcomers and long-time fans of the series.

You have environmental destructions like water tanks that can be shot upon and collapse upon NPCs, Over-the-top vehicle destructions; when a burning car is lightly touched it will explode on impact and thus creates a chain reaction, and finally the Euphoria ragdoll system who has yet to be overthrown by even RDR2 — creating a cinematic and somewhat realistic bodily reaction when injured or interacted on. However, GTA IV is an old game that it suffers from optimization issues. My suggestion is to downgrade it first before playing and install some patches. The community has provided a tool for it, simplifying the process. It also suffers from outdated game design and clunky movement. Even so, it still provides an excellent gameplay experience.\r\n\r\nLet us not forget the story of GTA IV. You are an immigrant, an outlaw biker, and a nightclub bouncer. All of which are struggling to make ends meet in the Land of Opportunity. You will meet many cast of peculiar characters, many of which are in the same boat as you but also many who inflict upon hardships to people like you.

These are not necessarily game-breaking bugs, but they are noticeable and occasionally can't be ignored; at worst it requires fiddling with CPU configurations or FPS capping.\r\n\r\nThe DLCs were additionally fun and (mostly) engaging - TLAD was weak in certain aspects of character development with neglecting supporting characters beyond superficial details; TBOGT lacked either of these issues, however.

I heard they toned it down or even removed it in GTA5, one of the many reasons ive not been interested in more GTA games. Anyway, its fun to see how long you can keep a car going, bend the frame, a wheel and get a few thousand bulletholes with no lights or windows, its just something satisfying about how it all works.\r\n\r\nNot to mention sending cars into space with the \"haunted\" playground.\r\n\r\nEven though there is a lot of fun to be had, i just think Vice City had a much better setting and characters than IV, and i havent played VC in maybe 20 years.\r\n\r\nI also wonder how long we will have radio stations in GTA IV since they keep patching out music they lost contracts over.\r\n\r\nMy enjoyment score for this game 82%\r\n\r\nIts just one of those games where you fuck around in, like a sandbox with a purpose.\r\n\r\nBut like i said, i wish the cop stuff was expanded upon, i wished that GTA VI was going to be 80s again and i also wish that it had two sides you could play, cop and criminal, but it looks like its gonna be the 3rd installment in a row taking place in the present and ofc once again you are a criminal, so im gonna skip that one as well.",

      "review": "Definitely a fun game that has aged relatively well. Currently working on getting all of the achievements (finishing up TBoGT mission challenges and drug wars at the time of writing this). The main story is pretty fun with some nice set pieces. The first DLC is definitely forgettable. TBoGT is the defining experience in this game IMO. Lots of things added in this DLC which are staples in GTA V such as the buzzard, sticky bombs, parachutes, booty calls, etc.\r\n\r\nMy absolute largest complaint is the quality of the port. This game is buggy as shit. So many instances of the game freezing, certain missions being totally broken unless you limit your FPS (i.e., climbing into the helicopter in the last mission being fixed by going into the god damn task manager and limiting how many CPU cores can run the game), and other instances of infinite loading screens (momma's boy in TBoGT). The amount of times that I have had to look up some old forum post for how to get a mission to stop being broken is probably about 5 or 6 by the time I played through the entire game. It is really frustrating. Definitely look into downloading the FusionFix mod if you are going to play this game. Super easy installation that resolves a decent amount of issues.\r\n\r\nAll in all the game is fun and worth playing if you can put up with a shitty PC port and an aging story.",

Grand Theft Auto IV follows Niko Bellic, an Eastern European ex-soldier who moves to Liberty City seeking the \"American Dream\". Upon arrival, he discovers his cousin Roman's life is far from the lavish success he described in his letters; instead, Roman is in debt to gangsters and loan sharks. Niko is forced to use his criminal skills to help his cousin and, in the process, becomes further entangled in the city's criminal underworld while also hunting a traitor from his past.\n\nThe Characters: All of the cast of characters are so great, they don't feel cartoony or over the top, they feel like real people, with real struggles, and Niko Bellic, is such a strong and well written character, he's honestly my favourite other then Cj\n\nThe Gameplay: It's fun, engaging and the set pieces are my favourite in the series!\n\nAnd honestly this is a must play for gta fans, and I think it's so much better then GTA5 in my opinion!

There are a few small things I didn’t love, like the driving physics, but at this point that feels like nitpicking given it's still more than functional.\n\nVisually, the game definitely shows its age, being over 15 years old, and the PC port is basically a straight copy of the original Xbox 360 version. My biggest issue is just how poorly optimized the port is. Even with a 7900XTX, I couldn’t get stable 1% lows above 80 FPS. Be aware that this game is far from optimized and won’t deliver a consistently smooth experience.\n\nThat said, I still recommend it—especially if you can get it on sale.

      "review": "I remember when this game came out, how big a step forward it felt in terms of graphics and physics compared to GTA San Andreas. But at the same time, it also felt like a step back in terms of story and map design. The story isn't bad, but it feels like a lot less than the multiple different story arcs we had gotten used to in GTA SA. GTA IV also has different story arcs, but because it is all based in the same city and the type of people you get involved with are very much the same kind of people, it starts feeling a bit repetitive by the end of the story.\n\nI do like the physics in this game a lot more though. After coming back to this game, I realized how much more I like the physics in GTA IV compared to GTA V. Driving and shooting feels so real. It really makes GTA V feel like Mario Kart in comparison.\n\nThe PC version of this game still has major aiming issues though. When shooting from afar, your crosshair will move in small chunks, making it really hard, sometimes almost impossible, to hit a tiny target. I heard this is due to the game being designed for consoles and then ported to PC, but I don't know. It just makes a part of the game unplayable for me and that is a real shame with the physics being so good.\n\nThe expansions for this game are what really bump this up on my list, especially The Ballad of Gay Tony. TBoGT was a more colorful and way more action packed experience than the main story. The new weapons introduced with this expansion were also a joy to play around with, especially the SMGs and the sticky bomb.\n\nI also really like the route they chose to go with in TBoGT. Being a personal bodyguard and mercenary for the rich felt refreshing after playing through most of GTA IV, with Niko still living and dressing like a hobo. In many ways, TBoGT feels a lot like something from GTA V. The lifestyle, the people you meet and associate with, and just the general vibe with expensive booze, yachts, parties, women, the list goes on.\n\nLuis's character and personality is bland though, and the same goes for Johnny in The Lost and Damned. They are not strong, iconic characters like Niko. They don't have memorable voices or voicelines that you instantly connect them to. But while Niko definitely is a better character, I don't think that actually matters much in these expansions, when the missions and all the NPC characters around you are strong personas. Tony, Evan, Mori, Brucie, Yusuf, Billy, Brian, Ashley, Elizabeta, and a lot of the other characters you encounter through the two expansions, all have really unique personalities and are just really memorable characters.\n\nI won't mention much about The Lost and Damned in this review. I have completed it three or four times and while I did enjoy it the times I played it, I didn't find it nearly as interesting as TBoGT. To me, TBoGT is what carries the expansion pack and maybe even the entire game to some extent.\n\nThe way the expansions mix in with the original story is also a really cool addition to the experience. It makes the world feel more believable, and when meeting Niko or Johnny throughout the game, you can kinda guess how far into the game they are and what they have already gone through because you already played their part of the story. I really enjoyed this part.",

      "review": "I had a pretty sour first impression of GTA IV all because of the PC port’s poor optimization. Since it was a PS3 game, I tried playing it on my old computer with a 1070, but it was awful to look at, so I moved on to my stronger PC with a 3080. The game does run smooth enough, but the inconsistent frame rate, buggy cutscenes, and stuttery visuals from far away gave me a clear impression that Rockstar hardly cared about making this game accessible for PC users, considering I had to use a 3080 on a late 2000s game to make it playable.\n\nTo get it out of the way, what is by far the worst part of this game has nothing to do with any of the gameplay or story, but its checkpoint system. When you go to start a mission, you first have to leave your apartment, drive to the mission icon, play a cutscene, and drive to where the job will take place. If you fail a mission or die, you have to do ALL of that over again. It’s horrendously aggravating to retry a mission with a long drive multiple times without having the option to respawn at the start of the mission’s  real action. It made me consider quitting the game by the ten hour mark. I also had problems with Rockstar’s launcher, which sometimes just didn’t launch the game, forcing me to verify my game files to make it work. The only thing that kept me from quitting was the game’s trial by fire: the bank heist. There, I learned all of the niche shooting mechanics the game doesn’t fully reinforce. While it took me a long time to succeed, I wasn’t angry about losing since the mission was fun and challenging. While it’s impossible for the game to account for everything, there are times when the game will do unpredictable things that you can’t possibly prepare for. A hilarious example of this was during a mission where I had to take out three strip club owners. I parked my car right at the entrance for a quick getaway, but one of the targets ran out, looped around the parking lot with his truck, and catapulted my car at me just as I had gotten outside, killing me instantly. There are plenty of bogus ways to die in this game but that absolutely took the cake. There are still plenty of unintuitive missions like the helicopter shooting one or train chasing one, that pissed me off, but I stayed with the game for its impressive world. \n\nMost of the game is spent driving and the devs really prepared for that. The radio not only had songs from people I recognized, like Kanye, but new songs I somehow never heard like Visions from Queen. There are tons of commercials and podcasts that are both hilarious and don’t feel dated at all despite being almost 20 years old. The radio also talks about the crimes you commit. There’s an insane amount of detail in how the cars operate. They all tilt when turning and when receiving damage from bullets or impacts, there are indents exactly where they got hit. I also learned on accident that you can do a burnout on both cars and motorcycles, and they included additional smoke covering the tires to sell the effect. I felt extra immersed in this game whenever I crashed into a car because they changed lanes without signaling, which felt so right, especially for a city. Driving was the most fulfilling when you are racing between cars, sometimes scrapping between two of them, and dodging cars going perpendicular to you. I sometimes pull a Nascar stunt where I grinded my car on the side railings to get past the traffic on a sharp turn. I also like how police cars are fittingly quick, using their sirens gets people to move out of the way, and you can search for people in the car’s computer. Peoples’ sand bagging animations are a lot better than most games we have today and their bodily reactions to getting hit or nudged feel eerily realistic. The gunplay may feel average at first, but it can be quite challenging because of the sheer amount of people you have to shoot at once. This was the first game I opted to use the auto lock-on feature which helps, but it isn’t perfect. Nico will lock on to enemies even after they are killed and switching between one target to another isn’t always responsive. Still, spraying nearby enemies with SMGs, sniping people from afar, and having to carefully aim for upper mass when enemies are behind cover make the action very engaging. The buildings aren’t only highly detailed, but you are expected to go inside them. I most frequented the gun stores and fast food places to regain health and armor, but an indoor area that really impressed me was the Emergency Room. There is a mission where you are supposed to kill a patient, and you can do so by disguising yourself as a nurse and unplugging his life support. The ER felt true to life, as did many other apartments. There are plenty of recognizable landmarks like Star Junction (Times Square) and Middle Park, but my favorite is the Statue of Happiness, which has the likeness of Hillary Clinton holding up a coffee cup. The cup is supposed to symbolize what American society values most: the means to work as much as possible. \n\nThe cutscenes are really fun and there are plenty of different personalities with their own accents and mannerisms, from Italians, to Russians to corrupt bureaucrats. Jacob, the weed smoking Jamaican with the heaviest accent on Earth, was my favorite to see since he not only sticks his head out for Nico, but it’s also entertaining to decipher what he’s saying. Bernie was another highlight who despite being comically gay, is one of the nicest characters to Nico and doesn’t force him to go on suicide missions like everyone else does. The most violent thing he asks of Nico is to punish a violent homophobe. Bernie’s quote, “Honey, YOU are stressed.” sits in the back of my head as I write this. I also like how our perception of certain characters changes, like with Roman. While he welcomed Nico into America, he seemed like an irresponsible low-life. That is until his business and home are burnt down and he rants about all the years it took for him to get this far while struggling to not give in to base desires, like greed and lust, that many other characters already have. The city itself portrays this feeling of being stuck, we move from the ghettos, to the main city, to high class suburbia. These places have different people who drive different cars based on their wealth. Despite moving to nicer homes, Nico always feels like a street rat. One of the unfortunate mechanics of this game is that cars are really hard to keep, even after legitimately purchasing one. They just disappear after a game session, forcing Nico to always commit… grand theft auto. You also have to pay a massive hospital bill after you die. What is most important is Nico’s arc, which ultimately leads to disappointment. There is no victory for Nico. No matter what, his revenge quest does nothing for him and he is forced to lose someone special to him because of his actions. Nico’s pessimism in many of these cutscenes leave a much larger impact than GTA V ever did. You feel bad for him while still knowing he deserves it. Like a lot of people in America, immigrant or not, he’s stuck in a system that doesn’t care. \n\nWhile I did not get the best first impression of GTA IV, it became far more impactful once I took my surroundings and realized how much effort was put into making its world and characters feel too close to home. While Nico may not be inspiring or impactful, he is perfect for the tone of the game, and I doubt a game will ever have a story of hollow disappointment like his again.",

You have to take sharp turns pretty often keeping your eyes on the road and not scrolling through tiktok or smth. In gta5 you can get anywhere with the 2 main highways which makes the driving boring cause you can just hold W.\n\nThe story is also great, making the game an absolute masterpiece.\nHaven't played the episodes from liberty city though, only the main storyline but I'm sure they're as good as Niko's story\n\nThe only thing that was annoying me throughout the entire completion were the bikes literally sliding like on ice when my fps were above 30 (prolly cause the game was meant to work on xbox360/ps3 and r* didn't bother to make the PC port properly)\n\nThat's it, waiting for gta6, hope they won't delay it again 🤞",

      "review": "[h1] GREAT GAME, BROKEN PORT [/h1]\n\n[b] TL;DR: [/b] Grand Theft Auto IV is a fantastic game. By many metrics, one could consider it a perfect game. Its' writing, world building, game mechanics, and physics are near flawless and years ahead of its' time. Unfortunately, as with many console games ported to PC, this game is extremely buggy. It is essentially unplayable without extensive modding. \n\nThat's the basics. More details provided below for context.\n\nThis port was extremely broken upon launch. One of the most cited issues since has been poor optimization, for which the response from Rockstar at the time was that \"higher settings are provided for future generations of PCs with higher specifications than are currently widely available.\" Indeed, as hardware improved over the years, so did performance. Unfortunately, as with many games, GTA IV's physics are tied to framerate. Since the game was designed to run at approximately 30 frames per second, there are several mechanics of the game that break entirely when the game exceeds 30 FPS. These are including, but not limited to:\n\n-Real-time cutscenes (severe physical stuttering and camera zoom)\n-Mission essential timers\n-NPC AI / pathfinding\n-Vehicle physics (turning, braking, sliding, etc)\n-Various minigames (e.g. TLAD's arm-wrestling)\n-Various mission-essential Quick Time Events (the very last mission of the game cannot be completed)\n\nUltimately, the game's engine was not never properly adapted for modern hardware. This means, in addition to the aforementioned issues, you will also deal with these issues:\n\n-Ineffective utilization of CPU cores (even more CPU bottleneck)\n-Inefficient VRAM detection (forcing lower quality textures and reduced draw distances) \n-Improper VSync implementation (screen tearing at high refresh rates and audio stuttering)\n\nLong story short, the game is completely unplayable without mods. So let's talk about how you can go about doing Rockstar's job for them. First, since Rockstar's occasional handful of patches did nothing but break several essential mods, you'll need to use a tool to downgrade the game to a previous version that will work with essential mods that haven't been updated. Once that's done, you'll need to find the specific mods you need (such as FusionFIx, OpenIV, etc.) Of course, several of these mods can conflict, meaning you'll either need to spend several hours modifying the files, or finding the specific versions that run together (for example, FusionFix version 1.10 is the only version that doesn't conflict with DXVK and ZMenu on game version 10.0.7.0,) Now that you've finished your doctorate in aerospace engineering, you can finally play the game. Provided you keep the game locked to 60 FPS, you shouldn't have any more issues. \n\nMy point in discussing this ad nauseam is that you shouldn't have to do all of this work just to play a PC port. This is a extremely beloved and influential game that has sold millions of copies worldwide. And yet, Rockstar has made no effort to fix this game on PC. They've remastered and rereleased nearly every other game in the series. Yet, even with Grand Theft Auto IV's recent cultural resurgence, it appears that Rockstar is concerned with more pressing matters, like milking GTA Online to death, releasing a $60 broken \"remastered\" GTA Trilogy port, and... *checks notes* porting Red Dead Redemption to Netflix. I really fucking wish I was joking.\n\nThis game has a very active community, and high quality mods are still being released. If you've played the game enough and want to experiment with new modded content, go for it. If you haven't played it, you should probably just play it on console. If you don't have a console, go get an Xbox 360 off Ebay or something. Playing Grand Theft Auto IV for the first time on this abysmal dogshit port is something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.\n\nFuck you Rockstar.",

      "review": "With GTA 6 [strike] right around the corner [/strike] delayed to god knows when, I decided to try the one GTA IV game I had never really played. Well, kind of. There was obviously \"that one friend\" who had an xbox and who let you play the game a bit.\nNow like 17 years later giving it a proper try, I'm having some mixed feelings. Now, technologically GTA IV is amazing even by today's standards (when compared to say... Cyberpunk 2077). It might not be as graphically impressive, but when it comes to things like physics and how alive the world feels it still outdoes modern games by a fair margin. The car damage mechanic is really cool (and I'm kind of sad they removed it for gta 5), car and pedestrian physics - although odd and disliked by many, are pretty decent too. Honestly, it's kind of impressive what they did back then.\nBut other than that there's still plenty to dislike. Focusing on just one city was certainly a decision, making it depressing gray, blurry and gloomy (which is apparently because Houser - Rockstar's co-founder, was depressed at the time lmao) which makes a place that's not fun to play in. Add to that the annoying mission design (my pet peeve is the missions where you have to kill a dude that's invulnerable until he gets to a certain point, even when you shot him in the head like a million times), predictable story (honestly play one R* game and you can predict all of them), very little gun and side activity diversity, and the game quickly loses its appeal. The DLCs do actually improve on some of these, but not all.\nThe PC port is also absolute ass. Graphically the game looks worse than the old console versions because apparently they removed a bunch of effects. There's game breaking bugs (i.e. one in the very last mission of the main game that's been there since the original release on console, apparently), and infinite loading screen and crashes and similar issues. While the main game and the 1st DLC is completable without mods, the ballad DLC wasn't because of how unstable the game had become. In short, the port is awful.\nMaybe if I had played this when the game had come out I would've thought of it as the best game ever, but playing it in 2025 I can't really recommend this version of the game.",

The final mission is a nightmare: the game tells you to tap SPACE repeatedly, but all it does is shift the camera, making the mission and the whole game unwinnable.\n\nThe lack of checkpoints is another huge problem. If you enter a cutscene with low health, you’re basically guaranteed to die the moment gameplay resumes, forcing you to replay long sections over and over again. And don’t even get me started on the bikes: they’re so slippery it feels like you’re riding on ice.\n\nOverall, the technical issues and outdated design choices make the game more frustrating than fun.",

It's the same as playing gta v on my steam deck happily only for them to force an anticheat for multiplayer that doesn't work and is only installed to make it impossible to run on linux for some godforsaken reason.\n\nEven when i get around to the actual game, the cars handle by making the tires themselves seem to be coated in a layer of ice, not even the road, they added about 500 pounds of backweight to make them spin out from turning too sharply and all to make it handle more realistically. I gotta say, realistically engaging a parking brake while turning isn't going to make the back swing out unless that parking brake is only affecting the front tires for some reason. You can make braking and handling weighty and grounded just maybe actually use a games engine that utilizes proper physics. I don't think I need to say just how busted that pool table game is where half the time the collisions don't register and it's inconsistent with power of your strikes since the pool table surface seems to be affected by the half-assed-ice they cover the car tires with some spots have incredible grip for the balls while some have no friction causing a glitchy unstable mess.\n\nThis story suffers from what has been 10 hours of nothing but exposition, introductions and an initial start into the plot. It eventually got around to working for mob bosses and actual missions only to make those \"ey the boss's car needs to go over here from here btw um cops will be chasing you so good luck\" which makes the original escort missions 5 times worse since now you're trying to drive on a frictionless road with an awkwardly weighted car against a small army of cop cars that can drive perfectly fine. You'll have chases, more fetch quests and sometimes if you're lucky you might get to shoot 3 people before you need to do a foot chase climbing ladders and pressing the forward button.\n\nLike damn, maybe the game gets good. For a driving focused game around car theft to have the worst handling and driving with really underbaked shooting as a second aspect maybe you should've at the very least had an even quarter decent city map, but instead there are 3 layers of roads each with 1 path to get anywhere making it the least navigatable city I think I've ever encountered in a game.\n\nLike holy shit this is without mentioning how the performance is just horrific, partly due to the new updates and the launcher, but also because if you look towards the seaboard you'll just end up with stuttering because they didn't understand how to optimize the ocean around an island city????",

They have essentially just become Dutch that's probably where the writers got the inspiration from.",

I like the story, and could get really invested into it, but like many R* titles, the gameplay itself is just strange, tedious, and doesn't respect your time as a player. And, for a game praised by so many for its 'sandbox' world, the storyline and missions are rigidly linear, offering little opportunity for improvisation or creativity. 'Go here', 'Do this', 'Collect this', all between cutscenes and loading screens. Vendors and even the world itself are dispensed to you piece by piece, you absolutely cannot start the game and go wild, which is a shame to me. \n\nDoes anyone remember the drama in the news cycle about this game at the time? What's so ironic to me after all these years is that the real 'destruction' you can wield in this game is so heavily gated, you aren't touching a rocket launcher until much, much later in the game, a point many buyers of this title will ever reach. You have nothing starting out, and the moment you get your first weapon is hours into the game, and it's a little gun, at that. \n\nFrankly, the controls are absolute garbage. Driving is garbage. Aiming is garbage. Saving your game is garbage. The launcher they added recently is garbage. I just don't get it.",
