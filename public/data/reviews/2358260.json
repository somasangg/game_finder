      "review": "As a Cricket fan, Cricket 24 is a solid step forward compared to previous Big Ant titles, but it still carries some of the old problems that cricket fans know too well. \n\nThe Good\n1. Improved graphics: Player faces, stadium lighting, and animations look noticeably better. Not perfect, but a clear upgrade.\n2. Licensing: Having more official teams and leagues really adds to the immersion. Career mode feels more authentic now.\n3. Batting feels smoother: Shot timing is more consistent, and playing different strokes feels satisfying, especially when timing a cover drive perfectly.\n4. Atmosphere & presentation: Crowd noise, commentary, and stadium ambience genuinely improve the match experience.\n\nThe Not-So-Good\n1. Bugs & glitches: Classic Big Ant issues. Weird fielding animations, sudden drops in frame rate, and players teleporting/overthrowing for no reason.\n2. Fielding AI: Still the weakest part. Fielders react late or throw to the wrong end at crucial moments.\n3. Career mode lacks depth: Fun at first, but progression feels slow and repetitive.\n4. UI feels outdated: Menus and navigation could be much more modern and intuitive.\n\nOverall Cricket 24 is enjoyable for fans who love cricket games, and it definitely has its moments. But it still needs patches and improvements for the experience to feel polished. If you’re already invested in Big Ant games, you’ll appreciate the upgrades. If you’re new, expect fun gameplay mixed with some frustration.\nExcited For Cricket 26 hope its Optimised and has Better UI, Graphics, improved AI, and Game Mechanism.",

The visuals, updated player rosters, and new tournaments make it feel more complete and immersive compared to previous titles. The batting and bowling mechanics feel smoother, and the atmosphere of real stadiums adds a nice touch to the experience.\r\n\r\nHowever, the game still needs some polishing. There are a few noticeable glitches — especially with back-foot shots, which don’t always connect or animate properly. Some AI behaviors can also feel inconsistent at times. A few patches could easily fix these small issues and make the gameplay feel more realistic.\r\n\r\nOverall, Cricket 24 is a good game with great potential — fun to play, especially for cricket lovers, but it still needs a few updates to iron out the glitches and improve shot timing and animations.

That should tell you two things:\r\n1️⃣ I’m a massive cricket fan.\r\n2️⃣ I’ve given this game way more chances than it deserves.\r\n\r\n✨ The Good:\r\n\r\nWhen it works, batting and bowling can actually feel pretty great.\r\n\r\nStadiums and crowd atmosphere give a nice vibe.\r\n\r\nCareer mode has the right idea but not the polish.\r\n\r\n💀 The Ugly:\r\n\r\n🐞 Bugs everywhere: fielders teleporting, bizarre AI decisions, broken animations.\r\n\r\n🎢 Performance is all over the place—FPS drops, stuttering, random crashes.\r\n\r\n🌐 Online? Forget it. Desyncs, lag, and rage quitters make it unbearable.\r\n\r\n📢 Commentary feels like a broken record on repeat since the last few titles.\r\n\r\n💤 Updates are slow and barely scratch the surface of major issues.\r\n\r\n⚖️ Verdict:\r\nAfter 375 hours, I can say this: Cricket 24 isn’t the “next gen cricket experience” it was marketed as. It’s more like Cricket 22.5 with extra bugs and a shinier menu. Hardcore fans might squeeze out some fun I clearly did, but for most players this game will test your patience more than your cricketing skills.\r\n\r\n⭐ 5/10 – Only buy if you’re desperate for cricket on PC.",

And if you use to with PRO Controles try DBC 14 but remember one thing DBC 14 is a crashing issue in WINDOWS 11...  OVERALL CRICKET  24 is good but CRICKET 22 IS A BETTER VERSION...\n\n***I SAY TO BIG ANT STUDIOUS REMOVE THIS BATSMAN MOVEMENT LOCKED IN THE CREASE, TOTALLY 3RD CLASS mechanics......\n \n*** Batsman running between the wickets is not correct or flow less like cricket 22. cricket 22 is a better running between the wickets mechanics.  \n\n***Remove the internet login chutiyappa. not saving issu madarchod. \nevery time internet is not available. i login the game with my phone internet and start the match and disconnect the my phone internet then i complete the full match then game is saying unable to login the game then i connect the phone internet and i see last match i completed is not saving what the hell is this .

      "review": "🎮 Cricket 24 – A Massive Letdown (Especially Online)\r\n\r\n⭐ Rating: ★☆☆☆☆\r\n\r\nAs someone who genuinely loves cricket and was excited for a modern cricket game, Cricket 24 is a huge disappointment — especially in online mode. Here's why:\r\n\r\n⚠️ 1. Online Mode Is Completely Broken\r\n\r\nOpponents can smash sixes every single ball — no matter what delivery you bowl. Change of pace, line, length — nothing works.\r\n\r\nWhen you bat? Even perfectly timed shots result in mishits. Boundaries feel impossible unless the game randomly decides to let you score.\r\n\r\nThe entire online experience feels rigged and unbalanced, like you’re playing two different versions of the game depending on which end you’re on.\r\n\r\n🐞 2. Game is Full of Bugs (And They’re Not Minor)\r\n\r\nFielders just stand near the ball without picking it up. The opposition runs 4–5 runs before your fielder even reacts.\r\n\r\nStumpings and runouts? A joke. Wicketkeepers throw at invisible stumps or take ages to react while the batter casually gets back in.\r\n\r\nBasic gameplay mechanics feel unpolished and unfinished, even after updates.\r\n\r\n🤷♂️ 3. Devs Show Little Interest in Fixing Core Issues\r\n\r\nThese aren't new bugs. Players have been reporting the same problems since launch — and still, no meaningful fixes.\r\n\r\nInstead of fixing gameplay, we get cosmetic updates or licensing additions no one asked for.\r\n\r\n🎯 Final Verdict:\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a fair, competitive cricket game — look elsewhere. Offline mode is passable, but online is frustrating, unbalanced, and full of game-breaking bugs.\r\nIt feels like the developers rushed this out the door and never cared enough to polish it.\r\n\r\nCricket fans deserve better.

And if you use to with PRO Controles try DBC 14 but remember one thing DBC 14 is a crashing issue in WINDOWS 11...  OVERALL CRICKET  24 is good but CRICKET 22 IS A BETTER VERSION...\n\n***I SAY TO BIG ANT STUDIOUS REMOVE THIS BATSMAN MOVEMENT LOCKED IN THE CREASE, TOTALLY 3RD CLASS mechanics......\n \n*** Batsman running between the wickets is not correct or flow less like cricket 22. cricket 22 is a better running between the wickets mechanics.  \n\n***Remove the internet login chutiyappa. not saving issu madarchod. \nevery time internet is not available. i login the game with my phone internet and start the match and disconnect the my phone internet then i complete the full match then game is saying unable to login the game then i connect the phone internet and i see last match i completed is not saving what the hell is this .

      "review": "🎮 Cricket 24 – A Massive Letdown (Especially Online)\r\n\r\n⭐ Rating: ★☆☆☆☆\r\n\r\nAs someone who genuinely loves cricket and was excited for a modern cricket game, Cricket 24 is a huge disappointment — especially in online mode. Here's why:\r\n\r\n⚠️ 1. Online Mode Is Completely Broken\r\n\r\nOpponents can smash sixes every single ball — no matter what delivery you bowl. Change of pace, line, length — nothing works.\r\n\r\nWhen you bat? Even perfectly timed shots result in mishits. Boundaries feel impossible unless the game randomly decides to let you score.\r\n\r\nThe entire online experience feels rigged and unbalanced, like you’re playing two different versions of the game depending on which end you’re on.\r\n\r\n🐞 2. Game is Full of Bugs (And They’re Not Minor)\r\n\r\nFielders just stand near the ball without picking it up. The opposition runs 4–5 runs before your fielder even reacts.\r\n\r\nStumpings and runouts? A joke. Wicketkeepers throw at invisible stumps or take ages to react while the batter casually gets back in.\r\n\r\nBasic gameplay mechanics feel unpolished and unfinished, even after updates.\r\n\r\n🤷♂️ 3. Devs Show Little Interest in Fixing Core Issues\r\n\r\nThese aren't new bugs. Players have been reporting the same problems since launch — and still, no meaningful fixes.\r\n\r\nInstead of fixing gameplay, we get cosmetic updates or licensing additions no one asked for.\r\n\r\n🎯 Final Verdict:\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a fair, competitive cricket game — look elsewhere. Offline mode is passable, but online is frustrating, unbalanced, and full of game-breaking bugs.\r\nIt feels like the developers rushed this out the door and never cared enough to polish it.\r\n\r\nCricket fans deserve better. This ain’t it.",

That should tell you two things:\r\n1️⃣ I’m a massive cricket fan.\r\n2️⃣ I’ve given this game way more chances than it deserves.\r\n\r\n✨ The Good:\r\n\r\nWhen it works, batting and bowling can actually feel pretty great.\r\n\r\nStadiums and crowd atmosphere give a nice vibe.\r\n\r\nCareer mode has the right idea but not the polish.\r\n\r\n💀 The Ugly:\r\n\r\n🐞 Bugs everywhere: fielders teleporting, bizarre AI decisions, broken animations.\r\n\r\n🎢 Performance is all over the place—FPS drops, stuttering, random crashes.\r\n\r\n🌐 Online? Forget it. Desyncs, lag, and rage quitters make it unbearable.\r\n\r\n📢 Commentary feels like a broken record on repeat since the last few titles.\r\n\r\n💤 Updates are slow and barely scratch the surface of major issues.\r\n\r\n⚖️ Verdict:\r\nAfter 375 hours, I can say this: Cricket 24 isn’t the “next gen cricket experience” it was marketed as. It’s more like Cricket 22.5 with extra bugs and a shinier menu. Hardcore fans might squeeze out some fun I clearly did, but for most players this game will test your patience more than your cricketing skills.\r\n\r\n⭐ 5/10 – Only buy if you’re desperate for cricket on PC.",

A game with such substance has been watered down to just a bunch of shallow features like licensing and fancy designs of jerseys.

For me it mostly just came to working out two or three shots that always worked and hitting them over and over again through club, state & ultimately international level. Ultimately the experience just left me feeling kind of empty by the end as it required very little beyond the initial learning curve and no real problem solving once that way of 'winning' was worked out.\r\n\r\nIf you are a cricket fan you may enjoy this for a time as it is a functional game that works and doesn't have too many bugs but I wouldn't call it a good game, much less a great one.",
