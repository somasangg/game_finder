Crafting is great, enemies are good, difficulty is fair enough to inspire you to want to make something good.

      "review": "To me, this game was even better than I expected from the first impression. Spell crafting games sometimes either give you not-that-different effects, strict limits on what can be combined, or are way too balanced for their own good.\nThis game suffers from none of those problems. Spells are varied, modifiers really do modify spells in sometimes weird ways and balance (in a bad meaning) can fly out of the window when you get your spell comboes right.\nOh, also wands. They have modifiers. A lot of modifiers get generic as you expect, but it gets interesting soon. Perfect accuracy, yet casts in exactly opposite direction than you aim? Gives spells casted by that wand random color (and that happens to be giving it rndom rider effect)? Summons meteors falling all over the place as you move while giving you protection from indiscriminate damage that meteor happens to have? Yeah, it's nice.\n\nSometimes you may think: \"Hey, if I cast butterflies that have orbiting stars that call swords that turn into three swords each on hit/expiration that also spawn multiple lightning zones it might be bad for the game, yeah?\". Well, it kinda is. Yet it mostly much, much better than you can expect. And yeah, this will work exactly as expected, spawning ridiculous amount of entities on the screen. That brings me to Quality of Life. Sometimes, particle-heavy games allow you to spawn too much for your own good and you can no longer see what's going on. Well, it has sliders for their visibility! \n\nI can go on and on, but I think you can already see how excited this game makes me. And I hope, you will like it too!",

Music is nice, there is decent enemy variety, bosses are distinct from one another, the gameplay loop is solid and combines strategy and gameplay well, just like the binding of isaac.\nBut I do have 2 issues:\n1. There isn't enough content in the game to keep playing over 70 hours (assuming I will have unlocked the rest by then), something that isn't true for The Binding of Isaac, which typically takes around 400 hours to get Dead God.\n2. In every run, it feels like only SOME of the unlocked spells drop, as if the game randomly picks 30% of what's unlocked and only gives you these, instead of it being truly random, but I have no proof of this, I simply observed a trend from using the reforging machine multiple times and noticed that despite there being about 50 options for a spell, it was more likely to cycle between the same 5-10 ones, often times even being reforged into the same thing it started from.\n(Honorable mention: The game gives you no i-frames, but there is a relic that gives you 0.6 seconds of i-frames when getting hit. While this is definitely intentional, it's still annoying to see you get absolutely melted by some enemies that chase you and are faster than you, even if you're slightly above base speed. Looking at you, [spoiler] Worm Swarm boss [/spoiler])\n\nThat being said, it's very fun to combine spells and absolutely destroy the framerate with the chaos you've caused. I've had no crashes yet, and the performance was significantly improved in a recent update, judging from framerates. I hope it continues to get more content, as well as crossovers from other indie games. I've also seen the quality of the translation from Chinese go up even within one update.",

It has the promise of hundreds of unique ideas that you can base your run on, and ways to customize the odds of making it happen, giving it potentially a lot of longevity.\n\nAnd with the most recent performance update, it doesn't make a lot of multi-hitting builds put your computer to its knees, which is a great upside for every build.\n\nIt suffers a bit out of being a bit overly complex so it's not by any means a 'chill out' type of game at harder difficulties, but if you are in the mood for it; I'll eat hours of your time.",

      "review": "Magicraft, developed by Wave Games and published by bilibili, is a vibrant and inventive action roguelike that combines fast-paced spellcrafting with the strategic depth of build creation. Set in a world where ancient gods have descended and chaos reigns, the game thrusts you into the role of a wandering mage armed only with a wand and the limitless possibilities of magic. Its premise may sound familiar—survive, grow stronger, and conquer waves of enemies—but the way Magicraft approaches this formula makes it stand out. Every spell you cast, every relic you acquire, and every combination you attempt transforms the battlefield into a chaotic display of creativity. Rather than providing players with a fixed set of abilities, Magicraft gives you the tools to invent your own magical arsenal from scratch, creating an experience that feels both unpredictable and deeply personal.\n\nFrom the very first moments, Magicraft makes a strong visual and mechanical impression. The world is rendered in a bright, cartoonish style filled with sharp outlines, expressive effects, and explosions of color that perfectly complement the game’s high-energy combat. Each spell bursts across the screen with flair, and the fluid animations make battles feel like a living fireworks show of elemental chaos. Despite the exaggerated style, there’s a sense of balance in its presentation—the environments and enemies are distinct enough to read clearly even when the screen is overflowing with visual effects. The setting itself, a floating world torn apart by divine power, provides a fitting backdrop for the game’s premise: an endless struggle between mortals wielding magic and gods reclaiming dominion. It’s an atmosphere that blends mythological grandeur with the playfulness of experimentation, creating an experience that feels epic without taking itself too seriously.\n\nThe core of Magicraft lies in its spellcrafting system, which is one of the most flexible and rewarding mechanics in any modern roguelike. Each run begins with a simple wand containing a few basic spells, but as you progress, you collect hundreds of spell fragments, modifiers, and relics that can be combined in endlessly unique ways. Spells are the building blocks of your power, while modifiers alter their behavior—turning a simple fireball into a homing meteor or a freezing ray into a bouncing projectile. Relics further expand your possibilities by introducing passive bonuses or dramatic gameplay-altering effects, such as increased mana regeneration or chain-casting multiple spells simultaneously. What makes this system so satisfying is its sense of experimentation. There’s no single correct way to play; you’re encouraged to tinker with builds, mix unlikely combinations, and discover overpowered synergies that make each run feel fresh. The joy comes not from following a guide but from stumbling upon a combination that feels uniquely yours.\n\nStructurally, Magicraft follows the familiar rhythm of a roguelike: progress through a series of chapters, face hordes of enemies, defeat bosses, and repeat the process with new builds. Each chapter introduces new enemy types and hazards, keeping the flow of combat dynamic. The combat itself is a blend of precision and improvisation—you’re constantly dodging, aiming, and managing resources while also adapting to the unpredictable effects of your own spells. The gameplay strikes a balance between chaos and control, as even the most carefully constructed builds can produce surprising outcomes when dozens of spells collide on screen. This unpredictability is part of the charm; Magicraft thrives on the thrill of discovery and the sense that every run could spiral into something wildly different from the last.\n\nThe roguelike progression system complements this design beautifully. Even after a failed run, you carry forward a sense of growth through unlockable relics, new spells, and expanded customization options. This layer of persistence ensures that each attempt feels meaningful and contributes to long-term mastery. The difficulty curve is fair, though the randomness of spell drops can make some runs feel significantly easier or harder than others. Over time, as you unlock more content, the early stages become opportunities for experimentation rather than mere repetition. The variety of relics and spells available ensures that no two runs are ever identical, and the player’s growing familiarity with the mechanics allows for increasingly intricate strategies.\n\nOne of Magicraft’s greatest strengths is how empowering it feels. The game’s pacing allows you to go from a humble novice to a god-slaying powerhouse within minutes. Watching your wand evolve from a simple caster into a weapon that unleashes screens full of swirling elemental destruction is immensely satisfying. Yet the game doesn’t lose sight of challenge—each chapter escalates enemy aggression and introduces bosses that test your ability to manage the chaos you’ve created. These encounters are often spectacular, forcing you to think quickly while adapting to ever-changing conditions. Success requires both reflexes and ingenuity, and when you finally overcome a tough boss with a carefully constructed spell combination, the victory feels truly earned.\n\nHowever, Magicraft’s ambition occasionally works against it. The sheer volume of visual effects can overwhelm the player, especially during high-level runs where the screen becomes a storm of overlapping spells. This visual clutter can make it difficult to track enemy attacks or even see your character clearly. Balance is another ongoing challenge—certain spell combinations and relics can trivialize encounters, while others feel underpowered or situational. These inconsistencies don’t break the experience but do remind players that the game’s creativity comes with trade-offs. For some, the occasional imbalance adds to the fun of discovery; for others, it may lead to frustration when a promising build falls flat due to bad luck or poor scaling.\n\nDespite these rough edges, Magicraft’s overall experience is remarkably polished for an indie title of its scope. The controls are tight, the progression is addictive, and the presentation is striking. The soundtrack, filled with energetic orchestral themes and mystical undertones, enhances the sense of adventure and grandeur. The developers at Wave Games clearly approached the project with both passion and technical skill, delivering a roguelike that captures the joy of experimentation while maintaining a strong foundation of replayability. Bilibili’s publishing support ensures a level of polish and accessibility that makes it easy to recommend even to newcomers to the genre.\n\nIn its best moments, Magicraft feels like a celebration of creativity and chaos. It’s a game that invites you to play, fail, and try again—not because you have to, but because you want to see what happens next. The combination of handcrafted spell systems, explosive combat, and imaginative world design creates a loop that’s endlessly rewarding. While it may not achieve the narrative depth or balance of some of its more famous roguelike peers, it more than compensates with charm, imagination, and sheer fun. Every run feels like a new experiment, a chance to craft magic in ways no one else will. For players who love the thrill of invention and the satisfaction of seeing their creations light up the screen, Magicraft stands as one of the most refreshing and enjoyable entries in the modern roguelike genre.\n\nRating: 9/10",

There's not as much depth or variety here as there is with the big hitters, but it's a solid diversion for about 20 hours. That's how long it takes for boredom from repetition to kick in. There aren't very many primary damage dealing spells (there are way more modifiers). And you earn so many relics on each run that you end up encountering the same ones over and over and over, leaving each run feeling not so unique. That said, there is fun to be had in arranging spells on the various wands ala Noita. And I appreciate that the gameplay is focused and tight. Each level is an arena much like in Hades, there's not much exploring involved. The boss fights are fast paced and demanding, and there is a ton of lower enemy variety.

I cannot recommend this game enough.\n\nThe magic spell building with basic components is something I have been looking for for years, and Magicraft does it flawlessly.  Creating new spells and tweaking them throughout runs to turn them into OP instadeath spells scratches an itch in my brain that hasn't been touched in years.\n\nThe meta progression system is done very well in Magicraft as well.  There are tons of upgrades that makes runs wildly different, and they are all generally cheap enough to make them not impossible, but slow enough to keep you focused on what upgrades will help the most.  The starting equipment sets also add a lot of replay value to runs, with each being wildly different.\n\nOnce again, can't recommend this game enough.  10/10 would get addicted again.",

It gets to a point where the whole screen is covered with your projectiles and summons, and everything just blows up. It's so much fun!

Spell crafting games sometimes either give you not-that-different effects, strict limits on what can be combined, or are way too balanced for their own good.\nThis game suffers from none of those problems. Spells are varied, modifiers really do modify spells in sometimes weird ways and balance (in a bad meaning) can fly out of the window when you get your spell comboes right.\nOh, also wands. They have modifiers. A lot of modifiers get generic as you expect, but it gets interesting soon. Perfect accuracy, yet casts in exactly opposite direction than you aim? Gives spells casted by that wand random color (and that happens to be giving it rndom rider effect)? Summons meteors falling all over the place as you move while giving you protection from indiscriminate damage that meteor happens to have? Yeah, it's nice.\n\nSometimes you may think: \"Hey, if I cast butterflies that have orbiting stars that call swords that turn into three swords each on hit/expiration that also spawn multiple lightning zones it might be bad for the game, yeah?\". Well, it kinda is. Yet it mostly much, much better than you can expect. And yeah, this will work exactly as expected, spawning ridiculous amount of entities on the screen. That brings me to Quality of Life. Sometimes, particle-heavy games allow you to spawn too much for your own good and you can no longer see what's going on. Well, it has sliders for their visibility! \n\nI can go on and on, but I think you can already see how excited this game makes me. And I hope, you will like it too!",
