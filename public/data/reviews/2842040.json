I view this game in a similar way people view Hogwarts Legacy. Some people love that game because it takes place in their favorite universe and lets them play a video game for that setting. Some people hate that game due to maybe the combat, story, critic reviews, etc. Some people will still play the game despite what others think of it being a \"bad game\". \n\nBut as I said, if you like Star Wars, have some extra cash to spend (whether full price or on sale), and want a decent story game I would recommend this game.",

      "review": "Journey to a galaxy far, far away and play as Kay Vess, a freelancer who is willing to do almost any job if the credits are right. She'll use her skills to try to survive the syndicate underworld in Star Wars: Outlaws. You'll be zooming around the galaxy trying to hire a crew for a huge heist job, perhaps the biggest score of anyone’s life. The problem is that to get the best crew you’re going to have to jump through some serious hoops to convince them to join you.\r\n\r\nThis game definitely has plenty to keep you busy with when it comes to the puzzle aspects. You will be splicing into computer systems to open doors, turn off security cameras, clear your wanted status with the Empire, and more. You’re also going to have to electric lockpick, by rhythm, your way through doors, systems, and locked chests. The game will have some required upgrades for those two systems so you’ll be forced to come back to certain areas/planets.\r\n\r\nYou’re also going to have to deal with 4 different syndicate factions. These factions, if you’re in their good graces, will give you access to certain perks such as discounts and faction specific equipment. If you’ve ever played against rival organizations you’ll know that you can’t make EVERYONE happy, your actions for one group is going to make another angry. If you do enough to a certain group they will try to kill you on sight ANYTIME you’re even close by. I personally learned that the hard way when it came to The Pykes (ironically one of the very first syndicates you’re introduced to in the game). \r\n\r\nLet’s talk about combat real quick. There’s really two forms of combat you’ll be partaking in, the 3rd person shooter variety and the space craft kind. When it comes to the 3PS version you’ll have to be fast on your feet aiming for the head, and praying that you don’t take too much damage. You do have health bars, and as long as there is still a bit in one bar it can, potentially, heal back to full, but if you’re getting clobbered you’re going to have to use your very limited Bacta Vials to try to bring you back from the edge of death. You’ll be armed with a blaster that you can upgrade as you go through the game, it comes with 3 different shooting modes, and it will be your task to make sure you’re proficient in all 3 and know when it is best to use them. There will also be chances to pick up certain dropped weapons that have a limited amount of ammo that you can use to defeat your enemies.\r\n\r\nNow let’s talk about ship combat, something that until I had most of my ship parts upgraded to close to maximum, I was terrible at. For the most part this form of combat is not going to play that big of a role in the overall game, but there are definitely going to be some situations where you’re going to have to survive through waves of enemy ships, and if you’re not careful you’re going to have quite a few game over moments. You’ll have 3 attack options by the end of the game, and to be honest I think I really only used the lasers and on REALLY rare occasions I’d remember that I had rockets, which never really did enough (in my honest opinion).\r\n\r\nThis game has enough content that you can easily go over 28 hours. I know that because that’s exactly what I did. It pays to explore every area you come upon, you’ll find hidden areas that can give you rare parts, or just give you more credits. Speaking of credits, let me give you some sage advice: If you think you have stockpiled enough credits, you haven’t. Some of the upgrades that you have to make to your Speeder (think hoverbike) or your ship will clean you out. Not only do you need to collect all the parts, but it's going to cost you to complete the upgrade. Another bit of advice is that if there is something that is highlighted as something you can pick up, pick it up, you’re going to need that constant stream of junk that you can sell to vendors to keep your pockets somewhat filled.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite mechanics in this game, and I’ve been saving for one of my final paragraphs, is Nix. Nix is a Merqaal and is your character’s most trusted companion (sidenote, trust is a concept that is going to be all over the place throughout the entire game… except when it comes to Nix). You can use Nix to distract enemies, push buttons, sabotage security systems, attack enemies, and in stressful times give you a little cuteness to calm you down. There are also food vendors on each planet that you visit that if you have the credits you can trigger a quick time event with Nix and both of you will be able to enjoy a new exotic meal together. Those meals will also unlock special abilities for Nix, so you should seriously make sure you get all the food vendors.\r\n\r\nI really liked the game, I played it for 24 hours straight (it was for Extra Life), but even if I wasn’t playing for charity I’d still have put in the hours that I did so that I could play the game from start to finish. The only thing that bugged me about the game, and I’m hoping it was just me, was the random game crashes where the game would just freeze and I would have to restart the game. Thankfully the autosave feature is pretty solid so I never really had to backtrack too much in order to be right back to where I was in the game. If you’re looking for a solid action adventure game set in the Star Wars galaxy I truly believe that you’ll want to have this game in your library.",

      "review": "Since Disney took over the franchise this is the only game which comes close to one of my absolute favorite Star Wars games, Dark Forces.  I think the devs did a great job at creating a game which makes you feel like a small time petty thief who stumbles into a story a little larger than themselves.  Key Vess is an enjoyable protagonist and I like that she is presented as basically being a noob who is constantly in over her head backed up by some great voice acting.  The supporting cast are all entertaining as well and I especially enjoyed ND-5's story arc (though I think his jacket is kind of stupid looking).   The plot itself isn't anything revolutionary but it's functional and presented well enough.  Even though this game isn't an RPG there is still a system of skill progression you unlock by getting to know various experts and I absolutely LOVE this system and it reminds me a bit of the first Division game (which I also loved).  There's just...a lot to love here.\r\n\r\nGraphics-wise this is a very pretty game and Massive's Snowdrop engine really shines here.  Everything looks grungy and lived in and really gives you the feel of being in your own Star Wars story.  On the flip side Imperial facilities are very clean and shiny looking.  Photomode is included so you can take great shots of this wonderful engine in action.\r\n\r\nAs for negatives it has me asking the question, \"why is this an open world game?\" often enough but I think they just scrape by in justifying it, as it has you searching the world for goodies and experts to learn new skills from.  The other big negative for me is that mechanics across the board have been done better in other games and are simply good enough here.  Controls can be a bit awkward leading you to commit actions you had no intention of doing from time to time.  The positive to that all of these 6/10 systems come together and gel into an 8/10 game for me.\r\n\r\nI originally played this game on Uplay+ so I can also say mechanically this game has come a long way and the most obvious change happened with the speeder controls.  They were serviceable in their original incarnation but are quite elegant today by comparison.  A number of systems have been improved since release so now is really the time to dive in and enjoy all the wonderful refinements for the first time if you haven't already.\r\n\r\nIn short: it looks great, game mechanics have improved over time, and the sum of the game is greater than its individual parts.  If you're a fan of Star Wars, old or new, do yourself a favor and pick this game up.",

Kay is a fun protagonist just trying to survive and making mistakes along the way. ND-5 and Nix also add a lot of personality and charm to the adventure. The other shipmates are background characters basically.\nThe story won’t change your life, the maps are very good but all space sections are tiny and it would've been better if they were merged into a bigger interesting location, but the overall available parts of the galaxy are still entertaining.

I'm a sucker for the \"stealth until you can't\" 3rd person style game, and this one has a lots of tools to help keep stealth interesting and save your ass in a pinch. \r\n\r\nOnce combat starts, I found the shooting very satisfying. Switching up your blaster mod, trying to do a super reload and making sure your cover isn't getting compromised is a very fun combat loop.  Dangerous enemies are notated and their big attacks are telegraphed. Grenade launchers and snipers are especially deadly.  Picking up unused weapons and firing it until its empty was always fun and worth it and it happens all the time.\r\n\r\nGetting good and learning how to cheat at Sabacc was rewarding, fun and not easy.  The whole way the game presents Sabacc, teaches it to you, then rewards you for it was excellent. For reference, Fallout New Vegas is one of my most played games and I've not once gave a damn about caravan, or that Witcher card one either.  Gambling and card games are not my usual jam but this one struck a chord with me.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere is amazing. The cities are packed and interesting, there's lots to notice, lots of intel leads to explore. there is plenty of content packed most places there is significant population. Exploration of densely packed places is rewarding.  The open areas of wilderness are also beautiful and interesting.  Getting chased by imperials in speeders with tie fighters flying overhead and hearing the imperial chatter regarding your actions was some of the best organic non-scripted moments for me, personally.\r\n\r\nSpace combat and travel was fun, albeit a bit shallow.  Was fun upgrading systems and watching my ship start being able to take hits and then eventually learning how to avoid the hits altogether. It culminates well into the final mission ala classic Star Wars. In fact, the final mission was one of the best in the game. \r\n\r\nI love the game economy. I never felt like I had too much money because everything I had needed upgrading.  Some parts are hard to find, some are expensive.  You get into the habit of keeping an eye out for what you need and the store menus and UI are a huge help with keeping track.  Honestly, having to buy or barter with different vendors all around for specific, expensive, or rare parts felt very Star Wars to me.\r\n\r\nWhat the Luke Skywalker Fantasy is To Jedi Fallen Order,   the Han Solo fantasy is to Star Wars: Outlaws.",

I'm a stealth sucker, so the gameplay is right up my alley for infiltration and the likes. Your speeder and ship are great personal additions and while the space gameplay isn't amazing, it's still better than Starfield and overall fun! \n\nNix (your little pet) is an absolute treasure!

The setting feels immersive, the factions add meaningful variety, and there’s a sense that you can tackle missions in multiple ways depending on your style. When you sneak around, use stealth takedowns, or try to bluff your way through — that’s where the game really shines.\r\n\r\nThat said… if you go in wanting to be a brawler or “guns-blazing” type, Outlaws doesn’t always deliver. My character often feels weak — like there’s no weight behind the blaster-shots or melee hits. Combat works okay in short bursts, but unlike stealthy, calculated infiltration, it rarely feels satisfying.\r\n\r\nSo far, I’m enjoying Outlaws most when I embrace the sneaky scoundrel vibe. If that’s not your thing, I can see how it might feel underwhelming. All in all: a strong, atmospheric Star Wars experience — but not always the “shoot-first, ask questions later” adventure some might expect.",

The first couple of hours I wasn't sure if I'd like the game or not, but once you can finally get off planet and fly around in your ship and the world opens up to you a bit it does get better. \n\nThe environments look amazing, and overall the game runs well. There are some clipping issues that you'll see from time to time which is annoying but it's not like it's the end of the world. \n\nHowever I do have to compare the game to Jedi Survivor, since it's another major SW title that released just a year prior and that I played 5 months ago, Outlaws runs significantly better and it's not even a contest. Although personally I find that Jedi Survivor does a much better job of feeling like a Star Wars game, whereas Outlaws could easily be it's own IP if you just switch up all the aliens to new species and change a few other things. Idk if that's subconcious thing about playing as a Jedi vs just a normal human making me feel that way or just the overall atmosphere of the game, but that's just the feeling I get when playing it. \n\nMy biggest complaint about the game would have to be the speed in which Kay Vess walks/runs. The speed in which she walks reminds me of being stuck behind one of these a**holes in a grocery store with zero sense of spacial awareness that walks perfectly down the middle of the aisle so you can't get around them as they walk about 30% slower than your normal pace. \n\nOverall I'd say it's a 7/10, and worth buying on sale.

      "review": "Wow. What a refreshing and great take on the Star Wars universe. Taking place between Empire and Return of the Jedi, you play as Kay Vess, up and coming smuggler and criminal who has to build her reputation throughout the underworld. Eventually you're recruited to do a grand heist where you need to assemble a team of experts in order to break into a nearly impenetrable vault.\r\nThe gameplay and atmosphere and world building and interactions with characters are all sensational, when I landed on Tatooinee and started exploring I literally felt like I was in a playable version of the original Star Wars movie (A New Hope). \r\nIt's so so so so refreshing to NOT play as a force wielder and just be a normal ass person trying to make their way in the Galaxy. People have 0 respect or love for you and it's really cool to see the day to day interactions of the various nobodies in the Star Wars universe. It's extremely believable too that Kay is super inexperienced and new to all of this so you're learning right alongside her.\r\nThe story was fantastic, the last mission had me genuinely feeling PTSD and the DLCs were great as well. Special shout out to the second DLC featuring the almighty Hondo Ohnaka. I found myself dying of laughter at several of his voice lines.\r\n\r\nAll and all it's just an amazing game and the fact that there would've been a sequel kills me. There needs to be more to Kay Vess' story down the line",

      "review": "TLDR: Lots of potential, but sadly it will likely go unrealized.\n\nI initially bought the game on sale because I'd heard that all the bugs had been more or less ironed out, and that it had gotten the atmosphere of Star Wars right. Thankfully, I did get what I paid for, but I think there's so much that can be improved. Here are some places where I feel it has performed above my expectations, some points where I felt it fell slightly short, and some areas where I feel it is just irredeemable short of a major content update.\n\nPleasant surprises: \n\n1. When you dial enemy health up to max, stormtroopers actually feel like a menace. You have to, as Thanos says, 'go for the head', and their armor finally feels like it makes a difference in terms of stopping blaster bolts. \n\n2. The Empire's recruitment campaigns and canvassing is actually quite believable (sign up and make a difference!), and not at all comic-book-villain-esque (wanna be evil? Get a cool black uniform? Join us and TAKE OVER THE UNIVERSE!!!)... unlike a certain other villain that will be mentioned later.\n\n3. The speederbike conveys the feeling of effortless, hovering speed very well.\n\n4. Truly breathtaking scenery and epic platforming areas. Potential horror spin-off? Who knows.\n\n5. Kay Vess's skepticism of the Rebel Alliance. I haven't played the whole thing through yet, but I'm pleased to note that she doesn't just up and join them within the first 10 minutes of meeting them, which is absolutely consistent with her character thus far. Even in later encounters, she's wary and guarded, working with them only because she absolutely has to.\n\n6. The planet approach and takeoff scenes. These actually feel like Star Wars! They should have led with the soundtrack for those in the start menu...\n\n\nWeakpoints:\n\n1. Myopic enemies make the stealth aspect of missions overly easy, or not sufficiently challenging.\n\n2. There's not enough depth to the upgrade tree. I'm not asking for a Nioh-style upgrade system, though that could be nice. \n\n3. Kay can only really customize one weapon (her trusty blaster)\n\n4. The first five or eight seconds of the start music is REALLY annoying. It's like they're trying to tell you 'omg, this is going to be such a frantic scrabble for survival in a fast-paced galaxy'... but it's the game's job to SHOW that. Show that in gameplay, don't TELL me that with an accomplishment in the top left corner of the screen that says 'we made it'. An example of a game franchise that does this REALLY well is the Uncharted series (especially 2 and 3). The music is grand, optimistic, and suggests a sense of awe in some places - in short, all the ingredients of an adventure. Then the game takes you and puts you through the wringer, forcing you through some genuinely frustrating and gut-wrenching moments that SHOW you Nathan Drake battling a small army. An example of a game franchise that did this REALLY badly was Mass Effect: Andromeda (Ryder didn't even wait till after his/her first battle to say 'we made it'). To fix this, stop trying to tell me 'we made it', cut out the first 5 seconds of the intro music (the rest of it is actually good), and... well, the rest is actually pretty decent.\n\n\n\nFatal/unfixable flaws (at least not without a massive content update):\n\n1. One of my pet peeves is that Sliro refers to himself and his rivals as being part of 'the Underworld'. Oh, come on. 13-year-olds understand that comic-book villains who prance around in black capes and say 'eeeeevill' are focused on children who are 10 and under. There are so many ways Sliro could have SHOWN the audience that he was not an upright citizen instead of telling them. He could have said something like 'you won't be arrested as long as you don't get caught', or looked over at his aide after receiving a report and said 'all right, pull the trigger - and make sure Governor Pudark gets his cut in unmarked beskar this time.' or 'that man has crossed me for the last time, make sure he's never seen again', or when someone at the table looks at him and says with a nasty grin, 'last week, a village got wiped out in the crossfire between two rival tribes - do you know something about that', he could have smiled, shrugged his shoulders, and said in the most disgustingly mock-innocent voice 'why would I know anything about tribal wars? I just sell blasters to this guy, and blasters to that guy, and what they do with it is their business,' before everyone bursts out laughing, and then he could have said 'I propose a toast - to all the dear, departed villagers!' Even that exaggeratedly heinous and sociopathic dialogue would have been preferable to saying 'the Underworld' while a conveniently-placed source of light casts sinister shadows across his face.\n\n2. Lack of a leveling system in lieu of a deep equipment customization tree. The reason I say 'in lieu of a deep equipment customization tree' is that I was ultimately persuaded by Monster Hunter: World that not having a leveling system was okay as long as you had a diverse and deep customization aspect for your weapons.\n\n3. The use of Nyx for EVERYTHING instead of the Force for SOMET things. This is the BIGGEST issue for me. Without the Force, it isn't Star Wars. They could fix this by letting the ability to sense people be explained by Kay Vess always having this sort of a 'sixth sense' all on her own, and later in the story have someone explain that she had SOME sensitivity in the Force, but that it wasn't strong enough for her to move objects (which would be why she needed Nyx). Then maybe at some point in the story, she could be told that she didn't really need her macrobinoculars to mark people, because her power came from the Force - and then all of a sudden for maybe a final mission, she would be able to sense everyone and everything without marking them with her macrobinoculars, and maybe manages to Force pull something tiny (but mighty enough) to take down a big baddie right at the end. In the post-game, she'd still need Nyx to move objects, but at the same time, she'd still retain some advanced sensing abilities even without her macrobinoculars. The ability to sense what others are thinking (suspicious, giving up the search) can ABSOLUTELY be attributed to the Force, and I'm confident it'd work wonders too if the players were initially given a few game portions without that ability worked in, just to show how much of an edge that ability can give her.",

      "review": "[h1]Star Wars Outlaws Review[/h1]\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Overview[/h1]\nNot perfect and very Ubisoft, but I still had a good time. If you like Star Wars and want to explore familiar planets with a grounded outlaw story, this scratches the itch. If you dislike the Ubisoft formula, this likely will not convert you.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Story Hook[/h1]\nKay Vess pulls a heist that goes sideways and lands on the wrong lists across the Outer Rim. With Nyx at her side, she takes jobs for rival syndicates, plays factions against each other, and hunts for a way out while staying one step ahead of bounty hunters and the Empire. No Force powers, just grit, tricks, and contacts.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]What It Is[/h1]\nA third person open world that sticks close to the studio playbook. Clear markers, outposts, factions, side jobs, reputation to juggle. You are not a Jedi. You are a scrappy thief working the underworld, which feels fresh for the license.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]World and Atmosphere[/h1]\nPlanets look great and feel lived in. Lighting, ship and armor textures, and general art direction are strong. Most areas never feel empty unless that is the point. Cruising the deserts or city edges on the bike is fun even with quirks.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Movement and Combat[/h1]\nTraversal is solid, bike riding is enjoyable but can be clunky. You will clip walls or see odd animations now and then. Gunplay is serviceable. Some melee interactions look silly, like Kay knocking out stormtroopers through helmets. It works, but it is not highly polished.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Kay and Nyx[/h1]\nKay took time to click for me. She is fine, not a new favorite. Nyx is the star. As a companion he fetches items, distracts enemies, opens doors, and adds charm. Their partnership carries many encounters.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Systems and Factions[/h1]\nSmuggler jobs, light stealth, simple upgrades, faction standing. Plenty to do without drowning you in chores. The world usually rewards curiosity and small detours.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Performance and Stability[/h1]\nThe game runs, but it is not very polished. I saw FPS dips in crowded interiors and in some open world spots. Crashes happened. Hardware helps only so much because some hitches feel engine related.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Achievements and Completion[/h1]\nChill and straightforward. Creative objectives, little to no collectible spam, and a clear path to 100 percent. I finished in about 75 hours while taking my time. You can likely do it faster.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]DLC[/h1]\nTwo packs included in my run. Pirate Fortune is a short detour with a new area that I rushed since it did not grab me. Wild Card was shorter but more fun. Season pass coverage can be confusing, check your edition details before buying.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]What Works[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Strong Star Wars vibe and art direction\n[*] Being a non Jedi outlaw feels unique\n[*] Nyx is a great companion\n[*] Open worlds that invite exploration\n[*] Achievement list respects your time\n[/list]\n\n[hr]\n[h1]What Falls Short[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Ubisoft formula fatigue if you are not into it\n[*] Noticeable performance dips and some crashes\n[*] Combat and melee can feel clunky\n[*] Character writing for Kay is uneven\n[/list]\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nRecommended for Star Wars fans who want a big world to explore without lightsabers. Not recommended if the Ubisoft loop turns you off or if technical polish is a hard requirement. I enjoyed it despite the rough edges, mostly because the world sells the fantasy and Nyx kept me smiling.",

However, playing it in it's current state has been enjoyable for me. Performance can leave some to be desired at times. But the worlds are really interesting, the gun play feels surprisingly good. Stealth isn't a forced mechanic which I heard it previously was (at least not for most missions). Story and characters are pretty mediocre to be honest. But I am enjoying the more \"everyman\" star wars story, away from Jedi and the force. Worth a play if you're a star wars fan.",

      "review": "I like hunting treasure, exploring and playing stealth instead of guns blazing play so I have enjoyed this game a lot.  Sure you have the option of gun blazing through everything but where's the challenge in that! So many wonderful stealth tools! I am taking my time, doing contracts, side missions, DLC and main missions,  playing Sabacc and exploring like crazy to see what I can find as the world's are very interesting.  Nix is an amazing companion so of course I had to find all his treasures! Not quite finished the entire ultimate version of the game but I have done nearing the end of the story and can say honestly it's a lot of fun.  I enjoyed all of it, the worlds, the vehicles and the characters. I also appreciated the fast travel system which even allowed skipping space travel if you wanted.  There is a lot of hours of content if you seek it out. My proudest moment was my first successful no-retry stealth take down of an entire Imperial base.   :)\n\nCons:\n* I had to shutoff DLSS to stop the game crashing. This despite running a system that far exceeds the recommended specs. With it off, no more issues but a sacrifice of the best possible graphics for the game..\n* There is a maximum on manual saves.  I wanted more because of the amount of exploring I do,  The auto save is only triggered by specific events so if you are spending time exploring and say, jump the speeder somewhere you cannot get back from, you have to re-load a save that might be an hour or more earlier.  Then it becomes what do I need to go back and repeat...sigh.  I suspect they did this to prevent people save scumming during restricted area or main missions but they took the idea too far when they also limited manual saves.  \nNOTE: I worked around this by doing auto saves and loading those to the cloud when I did a lot of travelling/exploring with treasure finds as those do not get deleted on you.",

      "review": "Star Wars Outlaws – Review\n\nI put just under 60 hours into Star Wars Outlaws, completing nearly all of the main story and side quests I could find, apart from the Radiant contracts. With that much time invested, I can say I had a really good experience overall.\n\nKay Vess turned out to be a surprisingly interesting protagonist, with distinct quirks and some genuinely engaging character beats. Her story was well put together, and her interactions with notable lore figures were a highlight.\n\nThe game is packed with fun easter eggs. Boba Fett and Han Solo showing up in the Jabba’s Palace sequence was a standout moment. I also really enjoyed the chance to duel Lando in Sabacc: not just once in the main story (to unlock ability upgrades), but again in the DLC. It was a clever way to weave character-driven moments into gameplay.\n\nSpeaking of upgrades, I liked how ability progression was handled. Instead of a bland menu system, you complete small challenges to improve your skills. It made the process feel like a natural part of the adventure rather than a checklist.\n\nThe Radiant contracts did get a bit repetitive, but they never felt boring. There was always something fun about doing them.\n\nOne of the biggest wins for this game, though, was ship gameplay. It is rare for an RPG like Outlaws to actually let you fly your own ship, upgrade it, and dive into dogfights, smuggling runs, and all those quintessential “Star Wars outlaw” experiences. That feature alone made the game stand out compared to other Star Wars titles.\n\nI also want to highlight the DLCs. Both added stories were engaging, packed with genuine emotional beats that hit exactly where they were meant to. The writing across the board, in the main game and the DLCs, was strong enough to make me feel angry, sad, and happy in all the right moments. The narrative team clearly knew what they were doing.\n\nIn the end, it is not perfect, but it delivers a strong story, solid mechanics, and that scrappy Star Wars underworld feel.\n\nFinal Score: 8/10",

      "review": "Star Wars Outlaws – A Casual Review\n\nIf you’ve ever dreamed of stepping into the gritty, chaotic underworld of a galaxy far, far away, Star Wars Outlaws delivers on that fantasy. It’s not perfect, and I wish there was more of it, but I had a blast.\n\nI didn’t play the game at launch. It caught a lot of flack back then, and I was hesitant. Partly because of the criticism, partly because of the price, but honestly, I just wasn’t in the mood to be a Star Wars smuggler in August 2024. I’m glad I waited, though, because coming into it fresh, and with any early issues mostly patched up, I found myself really enjoying the ride.\n\nRight from the get-go, the game oozes Star Wars atmosphere. The planets are exactly what you'd expect: classic Star Wars \"mono-climate\" zones, a snowy planet, a jungle world, a windy one, a flashy casino planet, and of course, Tatooine. Each is beautifully crafted, immersive, and full of life (or sand, in Tatooine’s case).\n\nAnd it’s not just the visuals. The sights and sounds of Star Wars are absolutely spot on. From the chatter of aliens and beeping droids as you walk through a busy street, to the hum of engines, the pew-pew of blasters, and the ambient noise that fills the world, the sound design is brilliant. It doesn’t just look like Star Wars, it sounds like it too, and that really helps transport you to the galaxy far far away. You're not just observing the world, you're in it.\n\nSpace exploration? Also very cool. Most planets (except the casino world) have a space zone to explore. One looks like a space junkyard, another feels ripped straight from Solo’s Kessel Run nebula, all super atmospheric. Tatooine’s space is a bit of a letdown, but to be fair, that’s pretty accurate to how the films portray it: vast, empty, and on the edge of nowhere.\n\nThe characters are a strong point. Kay Vess is a great lead, very much her own person. She’s not trying to be Han Solo or Jyn Erso; she feels like a real character in the Star Wars universe with her own arc and personality. Her little companion Nix is adorable and genuinely useful (think Grogu meets your in-game toolkit), and I loved their dynamic. Kay’s co-pilot, a gruff separatist commando droid, plays the Chewie role with a unique twist, though I do wish he was around more during missions.\n\nThe criminal underworld vibe is a major theme, and it’s handled pretty well. Different syndicates have distinct aesthetics and personalities, though if you boil it down, they do play similarly. The reputation system is interesting but a bit too forgiving; I was expecting to make enemies along the way, but I ended up on everyone's good side. No bounty hunters chasing me after 100 hours? C’mon, I wanted that drama!\n\nSpace combat and smuggling missions are fairly simple, but the Pirate DLC spices things up. Adding cargo types makes smuggling feel more meaningful, something most Star Wars games haven’t really explored. SWTOR, for example, never gave the smuggler class this much flavor.\n\nOutfits are surprisingly cool. Not only do they give you that “dress for the planet” vibe (snow gear on the icy world, leather jackets in the jungle, etc.), but they come with set bonuses and perks that actually affect gameplay. You can kit yourself out for stealth or go loud with grenade-boosting gear, it’s a nice, lightweight way to tweak your playstyle without needing to grind skill trees.\n\nSpeaking of skills, the “Expert” system is another neat touch. Instead of unlocking abilities through menus, you go find someone to teach you. It’s very in-universe. The skills themselves aren’t Force powers or anything flashy, but they work well for a scoundrel. I especially liked “Fast Talk,” where you can stall enemies with a quick lie before blasting them, felt super Han Solo.\n\nRiding around on your speeder (or swoop bike, more accurately) also captures that Star Wars spirit. It’s fun, stylish, and helps keep exploration from feeling like a chore.\n\nThere are also a couple of mini-games sprinkled throughout the galaxy that I really enjoyed. Sabacc, for one, was surprisingly fun. I usually steer clear of card games in RPGs, but I ended up playing quite a few hands across the galaxy. The “cheats” system kept it interesting, and one of my highlights was facing off against Lando. Let’s just say I had a winning hand... and then, spoilers, something happened. It was great.\n\nEven the in-game arcade machines were a fun surprise. They're styled like retro 80s games and feel like something you’d find in-universe and in real-world arcades during the original trilogy era. It’s a small thing, but it added a lot of charm and helped tie the world back to the roots of the Star Wars franchise.\n\nAnd the story? Classic Star Wars. No spoilers, but it checks all the right boxes: reluctant hero on the run, a stolen ship, shootouts, quirky aliens, evil Empire entanglements, emotional beats, and a satisfying finale. It’s nothing revolutionary, but it feels like Star Wars, and that’s all I really wanted.\n\nAs someone who’s played other big open-world games like Assassin’s Creed Odyssey and Valhalla, I did find myself wishing Outlaws had more customization, more depth, and more DLC options like those games. But honestly, wanting more is probably a good sign. It means the foundation is solid. I’d rather come away from a game thinking “I wish there was more” than “that was too much.”\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nStar Wars Outlaws nails the vibe. It feels like you're in the Star Wars galaxy, living a rogue's life among smugglers, scoundrels, and syndicates. Sure, I wish the world was bigger, the systems deeper, and the danger more present, but what’s here is a solid foundation and an enjoyable ride.\n\nScore (if I had to give one): 8/10. Not flawless, but full of heart and swagger.",

      "review": "DO NOT BUY\nEven after a year this game is still extremely buggy. Almost unplayable. Within the first 30 minutes of the game (the mission directly after the beginning area mission) I ran into a game ending bug causing me to restart the entire game. Another bug i've ran into is whenever i reload previous saves, my reputation will inexplicably decrease with a certain faction for no reason. This bug has happened to me multiple times. \n\nFurthermore, people advertise this game as the \"GTA of star wars.\" It couldn't be farther from that. Your character is a socially awkward, PG criminal that can do no wrong even in the underworld of star wars. She stammers her way through the underworld with no social tact or strategy. Also, You work with the hutts, pykes, and crimson dawn except you are somehow always on the morally right side. There are no evil options in a game about the criminal underworld of Star Wars. What?! This game is extremely funneled into a good-guy play through and only that.\n\nI feel this game tries to be similar to Jedi Fallen Order except without lightsabers and the force but with blasters and syndicates. It feels almost identical to the fallen order with puzzles, parkour, and massive open world except it has no substance to be its own game. Like a cheap knock off without any thought to the its own characters or story. The main character should be more confident (similar to Han Solo since ive heard she is supposed to be based off of him) and the gameplay should allow you to be more aggressive. \n\nTo sum up, the bugs make this game unplayable. the character is too nice and needs to be more confident and aggressive (I'd prefer to have evil options), and (obviously) Disney seems to not want to deviate from their safe zone. Disney keeps their games very similar to past successes such as Fallen Order taking only limited risks as to hopefully turn a profit. So at the end of the day this game turned out to be a lukewarm trash heap of a clone when it could've been so much more.",

      "review": "⭐ Star Wars Outlaws – 6/10\r\n\r\nVisually striking, thematically hollow, narratively wasted potential.\r\n\r\nI’ve just finished Star Wars Outlaws, and I can honestly say this game is the definition of “so close, yet so far.” Beneath the glossy visuals and cinematic presentation lies a creative tragedy: a sandbox full of missed opportunities and shallow design choices that could have made this one of the greatest Star Wars games ever made.\r\n\r\nLet’s start with the obvious: the world is stunning. On OLED in HDR, the art direction shines — the lighting, the environments, and the sense of scale are genuinely breathtaking. There are moments that feel alive, and Massive Entertainment clearly knows how to make a planet feel like a place. The Snowdrop engine can deliver magic. But that magic quickly fades once you realize how empty the experience is beneath the surface.\r\n\r\nThe writing is serviceable at best. It’s safe, sanitized, and devoid of the grit and complexity that defines the best Star Wars stories. Every character feels like a checkbox archetype. The protagonist — an entirely new and forgettable smuggler — lacks any of the depth or charm that made figures like Han Solo or Cassian Andor resonate. Ubisoft had decades of expanded universe lore to draw from, and they chose to invent the blandest possible scenario instead.\r\n\r\nGameplay? Classic Ubisoft. Outposts, fetch quests, repetitive stealth sections, and “open world” exploration that feels more like a checklist than an adventure. The bones of something good are here, but the studio never commits. The story pretends to be about survival and rebellion, yet never dares to touch the philosophical heart of Star Wars — the corruption of power, the moral ambiguity of empire and rebellion, or the human cost of resistance.\r\n\r\nIt’s a shame, because this could have been so much more. Imagine a story set during the Dark Times — the fall of the Republic, the rise of the Empire — showing the galaxy’s descent into tyranny through the eyes of ordinary people. Or a game set during the Mandalorian Wars, a morally grey era of warriors and Jedi torn by duty and pride. The material is right there. Instead, Ubisoft played it safe and made another open-world checklist game with Star Wars wallpaper.\r\n\r\nEven the technology falters. HDR is inconsistent, with strange softness and shimmering in highlights; FSR upscaling introduces noticeable artefacts, and XeSS helps but at a performance cost. The irony? The game looks better in SDR with AMD’s Radeon Image Sharpening enabled — except you can’t use it in HDR. The visual clarity on OLED is unforgiving, exposing every flaw in the engine’s upscaling and post-processing.\r\n\r\nAnd yet… I still finished it. Because buried under all that mediocrity are flashes of brilliance — the art direction, the score, the occasional moment where the world feels real. When the game stops holding your hand and just lets you exist in the galaxy, you can almost see the masterpiece it could have been.\r\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\r\nA beautiful shell with a hollow core. Ubisoft had the license, the lore, and the technology to make something truly special. Instead, they delivered a focus-tested corporate product — safe, shallow, and forgettable.\r\n\r\n6/10 – “The Force was there, but management said no.”",

I'm calling it the \"ubisoft\" hurdle. Feels like someone made a great game, then management came alone and went \"make it lame!\". So you cut content to sell it back later, deliberatley made the character \"plain\" (my god what is up with that jawline? Did you first create a male character and then last minute decide to go female? And then also forgot that there were some female characters flirting with the main char and just left it in?) , made the game depended on online servers, let it crash and have potato graphics even with latest hardware and added micro transactions.\n\nHow about next time you just upload a picture on steam of ubi management taking an actual dump, just literally a dump on your game, it would save me £60, save you from having to make a game, and it would still send the exact same message to everyone: ubisoft does not give two shits about this game or the gamer, they just like to shit and destroy on a potential good game.\n\nAnd for the love of god, fix the faction reward system, its been broken since launch. Trigger reward threshold, and..... nothing, you dont get the reward. You do realise this makes doing side missions abolutely point less? Like your entire ubi formula of stuffing a map with things fails, as you get nothing for it.\n\nSo my recommendation: buy the game on sale, and just do the main missions.

Very immersive especially with a few story lines going at the same time.\n\nBIGGEST PAIN in the whole game is Ubisoft connect. 50%-75% of the time the game will not authenticate and requires retrying to load. What a load of rubbish for no gain. Drop this hot mess.\n\nThe DLCs mostly good. I got the whole bundle on offer (50% off) so was not hit with additional costs. Would I buy them individually, probably but would be slightly disappointed if I had done so.\n\nThe character bundles definitely NOT worth the cost as they add nothing to the game. Way more fun to collect the clothing components and build your own outfit.\n\nBugs should have been ironed out but still persist. Falling through the floor in Makal's Parlour, jump to the left through the beaded curtain. Sound clips repeatedly playing at times and commentary repeating way past the story line at locations. Game crashes when making some changes to load out at times or starting some story line cut scenes (or was it Ubisoft connect?).\n\nWhy do developers think they need to interject WOKE story lines into the game. No character customisation so forced to play a white feminist female character who plays the victim card. I bought the game to play Star Wars and not as a social commentary.\n\nAm I going to but any additional DLCs. Nope.",

      "review": "[h1]Think twice before buying[/h1]\n\nThis game almost killed my love for Star Wars. But first of all, I want to stress that [b]UBISOFT ARE LIARS[/b]. When you buy the Ultimate Edition, you will not get all the DLC in your Steam library, even though you should. Instead, after two months of correspondence, Ubisoft support told me to “just buy them again” so they would appear in my account. So keep that in mind.\n\nNow about the game: I don’t understand why this droid is on every poster. You probably think, just like I did, that you will be playing alongside him. No! He will be sitting on the ship 98% of the time. And even when he does come outside, he will do absolutely nothing.\n\nThe story. It exists, but at the same time it doesn’t. The game is built around treasure hunting, but you won’t find a single one! I spent 90 hours finishing this game (and collecting everything), and in the end I got nothing. No treasures, no wealth that the main character was searching for. Even the second DLC, which was supposed to lead us to treasures, didn’t. The story seemed close to it, we were in ancient ruins, but in the end you just have to run away, WITHOUT GETTING ANYTHING!\nOh wait, no — you do get something: a line from the droid saying that “the real treasure is friends.”\n\nTo sum up, the only positive thing I can say about this game is the beautiful landscapes. That’s it. This is not Star Wars. This is something else entirely.\n\nP.S. Also, the game has NO New Game+. Which means all the clothes, all the ship, blaster, and speeder upgrades you collected throughout the game (mostly near the end) simply disappear and have no practical use for a second playthrough.\n\nOn top of that, the achievements are broken. If you didn’t perform a certain action “on time” during some quests, you simply won’t be able to complete it after finishing the game. Even though the logic of the game allows you to start it — and it does start — the buttons to pick up the weapon just don’t appear. As a result, to get one achievement, you need to replay the entire game.",

      "review": "So I have a whopping 60 hours in this game with Gold Edition, played through all main story, all DLC. This is not only a review of the game but also because I was forced to use it, it has to be with conjunction to Ubisoft Connect. Formerly, Uplay. An extra launcher that has to be running while you are playing. Even offline. I must also say I haven't bought a Ubisoft game in years and only bought this one after playing 3 hours demo exploring Tatooine and only because this is STAR WARS. \n\nI bought this 55% off because I knew full price was not worth it. I bought all the DLC (Gold Edition) which I knew was going to be a mistake but I wanted that STAR WARS. All of STAR WARS. Additionally, I live in Kazakhstan it was 18674.55 Tenge or at the time of purchase exchange rate it was $34.58 which is considerably less than the price in US even under 55% discount which goes for $110 without a discount in USD and for $49.5 at 55% off. That is additional $14 cheaper. And it was still a bad deal lol!\n\nWhat I liked about this game was combat. I didn't do any sneaking on purpose because I knew it was bad. I just killed everyone, even several times in the game when I was forced not to raise alarms i just shot everyone before they could. So that was nice I could do that. Shooting blasters feel satisfying. I love the blaster holes, the smoke, the effects, explosions, all that very Star Wars like. I ran around with the first fully upgraded Light Plasma mod most of the time. It scratched my gunslinger Red Dead SW itch but I also used all the pick up guns too (those were nice, too bad they end). I tried all the modules but most of them were bad. \n\nWhat I dislike about shooting is the fact that I can't turn off the hit markers. they are huge even when reduced to 75%. And I wanted to install a mod but found out that for some reason some genius tied the hit markers to the rest of UI and HUD so disabling them turns off most of it and requires heavy modding too. Why would they do such a thing beats me especially when they figured out it was annoying and gave us an option to reduce it to 75%. Should've given us an option to reduce it to 1% at least. Or hide it completely and not tie to the rest of HUD. It is immersion breaking. \n\nThe other thing I liked is a plethora of options to choose from. From skipping annoying mini-games, to even highlighting the objects around you when you get lost in a special graphics high contrast mod that almost looks like a dev kit mod. That is nice. You can really customize how you play this game (EXCEPT FOR THE HIT MARKER! Yyy)\n\nThe world of the game is believable. Tatooine is by far the best of all, of course. It is the most iconic Star Wars place and the level designers really put their thought into making the world feel fun to look around at even though there is no really good or fun loot to collect in any Ubisoft game. It was still a lot of fun to explore. Beautifully crafted believable Star Wars world. \n\nThe story starts of promising and fun. You meet cool characters, factions and what is hopefully a good storyline unfolds before you. Quickly becomes boring and mismatched on each planet that you forget you had a story to begin with. It is just 3 quests on each planet that have completely different sub stories and break the pacing of the game. The finale they also ruined. I couldn't wait for it to be over, it became a dull soap opera with boring predictable characters. And your mom. LOL. \n\nTatooine storyline was the best, thankfully they pulled themselves together and worked with SW material and made it believable and iconic. Also it was fun sneaking onto an imperial station off Tashara. But later on it just loses the momentum. Other planets where writers had their creative freedom run wild were rather dull compared to Tatooine. They aren't good at making their own new material without basis. \n\nND-5. I thought this was going to be as cool a droid companion like in SW: Jedi series KX droid. It had all the potential to be as cool being from clone wars, being bad ass, roger roger type droid. Looking menacing they somehow made him ANNOYING as hell. So annoying I had to turn off dialogue while free-roaming in space and every time I heard his voice lecture me it was just boring. Even the voice actor was cast wrong for this role. The robot is an annoying grumpy dad that does not feel like a cool bad-ass murder bot but rather... a boring dad. Voice, emotion, voice lines. Everything makes it a boring dad. I wish it just shut up. It is worse than Kay Vess btw. It is the worst thing. The best thing is probably that fish tank guy Bosnok. He is annoying but in a funny way. In all seriousness, Lady Q'ira, Jabba, Lando, Hutts, Jawas. You know the real Star Wars characters are the best here. Not the protagonists and main characters. Side characters are the best. \n\nDLCs not worth getting each of them I reviewed separately in their own review.\n\nUbisoft Connect gave me lots of pain. I had to repair the game for it to work. It gave me Doplhin 028 error of not being online. I had problems logging in and several times I wanted to played it would not let me in for hours until I found a fix. It just wouldn't let me start the game... I had previously started and they say it can be played in offline mod. \n\nThe game crashes a few times too. Mainly in space. I run it on an old system on Medium, it looks nice. 2080 RTX 3900 ryzen series on m.2 SSD. 16 gb ram. I had no problems with the frame rate. DLSS on. Overall, stable no lag. But had some annoying crashes. \n\nGood thing about Ubisoft Connect is that you can manually upload a single save file for cloud sync. No more than that but you get to control it. Unlike on Steam it backs up everything but if there is a discrepancy in saving it will ask which ones you'd like to keep local saves or the cloud ones and you can accidentally erase the most recent saves on Steam so I have it off. \n\nParkour is annoying at times. Thankfully there is this high contrast mod if you get really lost and don't feel like figuring it out sometimes, wish more games had it. \n\nNix in many ways annoying, plays dead when shouldn't. \n\nThere is not much loot diversity and you kinda just explore for the feel of the world and Star Wars. Side missions are nice but it lacks a cinematic dialogue camera making it more boring than it should be. I haven't beaten all the side quests, some lock map chest treasures behind them, I will maybe eventually come back to this game to just roam around and finish the side quests and intels but I explored the entirety of all maps. \n\nAt the start of the game Kay is rather weak even on easy some enemies can be dangerous but later on she becomes a god. On Very Hard it can be a challenge. Clearly, the game is more designed for stealth. But it is a nice TPS.\n\nSabacc and Food vendor mini-games are fun. I purposely left the button QTE mini-games in and on hard because it made it more fun. Sabacc is also very easy, but some people say they spend 50 hours trying to figure it out lol. To each their own I guess but it is hardly poker. \n\nThis is a standard Ubisoft game. Smaller and more fine crafted than their Assassin's Creed slop. Connect is a pain. Lack of loot variety. Combat is not the worst. Speeder piloting is okay. Ship combat is okay. The reputation idea and choices can be fun to play with. The story becomes awful, characters are awful that you want to mute them. \n\nShould you get it? Absolutely not. Only die hard Star Wars fans should get it. At a huge discount like 55% off or better yet 90% off. Do not get the DLCs they are cash grabs. \n\nWill I come back to play this again? Maybe one day when I need a Star Wars game and there is nothing SW to play I might tackle side quests that I left out but I never again want to play this story. I just want to explore the world and shoot cartels like in Red Dead. The story you can only tolerate once and it will cringe you out anyway.\n\nGood there won't be a sequel",

The story looked good, the combat seemed fun, I loved the idea of it.\n\nLong story short, I purchased it when it was 55% off for the ultimate edition.

I've spent 3 hours in this game, mind you, and only about twenty to thirty minutes of that was me actually being able to play the game.\n\nIt took forty-five minutes and threw restarts to get the game to load the first time around.

Within the first 30 minutes of the game (the mission directly after the beginning area mission) I ran into a game ending bug causing me to restart the entire game. Another bug i've ran into is whenever i reload previous saves, my reputation will inexplicably decrease with a certain faction for no reason. This bug has happened to me multiple times. \n\nFurthermore, people advertise this game as the \"GTA of star wars.\" It couldn't be farther from that. Your character is a socially awkward, PG criminal that can do no wrong even in the underworld of star wars. She stammers her way through the underworld with no social tact or strategy. Also, You work with the hutts, pykes, and crimson dawn except you are somehow always on the morally right side. There are no evil options in a game about the criminal underworld of Star Wars. What?! This game is extremely funneled into a good-guy play through and only that.\n\nI feel this game tries to be similar to Jedi Fallen Order except without lightsabers and the force but with blasters and syndicates. It feels almost identical to the fallen order with puzzles, parkour, and massive open world except it has no substance to be its own game. Like a cheap knock off without any thought to the its own characters or story. The main character should be more confident (similar to Han Solo since ive heard she is supposed to be based off of him) and the gameplay should allow you to be more aggressive. \n\nTo sum up, the bugs make this game unplayable. the character is too nice and needs to be more confident and aggressive (I'd prefer to have evil options), and (obviously) Disney seems to not want to deviate from their safe zone. Disney keeps their games very similar to past successes such as Fallen Order taking only limited risks as to hopefully turn a profit.

      "review": "⭐ Star Wars Outlaws – 6/10\r\n\r\nVisually striking, thematically hollow, narratively wasted potential.\r\n\r\nI’ve just finished Star Wars Outlaws, and I can honestly say this game is the definition of “so close, yet so far.” Beneath the glossy visuals and cinematic presentation lies a creative tragedy: a sandbox full of missed opportunities and shallow design choices that could have made this one of the greatest Star Wars games ever made.\r\n\r\nLet’s start with the obvious: the world is stunning. On OLED in HDR, the art direction shines — the lighting, the environments, and the sense of scale are genuinely breathtaking. There are moments that feel alive, and Massive Entertainment clearly knows how to make a planet feel like a place. The Snowdrop engine can deliver magic. But that magic quickly fades once you realize how empty the experience is beneath the surface.\r\n\r\nThe writing is serviceable at best. It’s safe, sanitized, and devoid of the grit and complexity that defines the best Star Wars stories. Every character feels like a checkbox archetype. The protagonist — an entirely new and forgettable smuggler — lacks any of the depth or charm that made figures like Han Solo or Cassian Andor resonate. Ubisoft had decades of expanded universe lore to draw from, and they chose to invent the blandest possible scenario instead.\r\n\r\nGameplay? Classic Ubisoft. Outposts, fetch quests, repetitive stealth sections, and “open world” exploration that feels more like a checklist than an adventure. The bones of something good are here, but the studio never commits. The story pretends to be about survival and rebellion, yet never dares to touch the philosophical heart of Star Wars — the corruption of power, the moral ambiguity of empire and rebellion, or the human cost of resistance.\r\n\r\nIt’s a shame, because this could have been so much more. Imagine a story set during the Dark Times — the fall of the Republic, the rise of the Empire — showing the galaxy’s descent into tyranny through the eyes of ordinary people. Or a game set during the Mandalorian Wars, a morally grey era of warriors and Jedi torn by duty and pride. The material is right there. Instead, Ubisoft played it safe and made another open-world checklist game with Star Wars wallpaper.\r\n\r\nEven the technology falters. HDR is inconsistent, with strange softness and shimmering in highlights; FSR upscaling introduces noticeable artefacts, and XeSS helps but at a performance cost. The irony? The game looks better in SDR with AMD’s Radeon Image Sharpening enabled — except you can’t use it in HDR. The visual clarity on OLED is unforgiving, exposing every flaw in the engine’s upscaling and post-processing.\r\n\r\nAnd yet… I still finished it. Because buried under all that mediocrity are flashes of brilliance — the art direction, the score, the occasional moment where the world feels real. When the game stops holding your hand and just lets you exist in the galaxy, you can almost see the masterpiece it could have been.\r\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\r\nA beautiful shell with a hollow core. Ubisoft had the license, the lore, and the technology to make something truly special. Instead, they delivered a focus-tested corporate product — safe, shallow, and forgettable.\r\n\r\n6/10 – “The Force was there, but management said no.”",

I'm calling it the \"ubisoft\" hurdle. Feels like someone made a great game, then management came alone and went \"make it lame!\". So you cut content to sell it back later, deliberatley made the character \"plain\" (my god what is up with that jawline? Did you first create a male character and then last minute decide to go female? And then also forgot that there were some female characters flirting with the main char and just left it in?) , made the game depended on online servers, let it crash and have potato graphics even with latest hardware and added micro transactions.\n\nHow about next time you just upload a picture on steam of ubi management taking an actual dump, just literally a dump on your game, it would save me £60, save you from having to make a game, and it would still send the exact same message to everyone: ubisoft does not give two shits about this game or the gamer, they just like to shit and destroy on a potential good game.\n\nAnd for the love of god, fix the faction reward system, its been broken since launch. Trigger reward threshold, and..... nothing, you dont get the reward. You do realise this makes doing side missions abolutely point less? Like your entire ubi formula of stuffing a map with things fails, as you get nothing for it.\n\nSo my recommendation: buy the game on sale, and just do the main missions. You probably finish the game in under 15 hours, worth it if you buy it on sale. There is no point in doing all the side missions and gaining faction rep, it doesn't work.  Thanks UBI!",

When you buy the Ultimate Edition, you will not get all the DLC in your Steam library, even though you should. Instead, after two months of correspondence, Ubisoft support told me to “just buy them again” so they would appear in my account. So keep that in mind.\n\nNow about the game: I don’t understand why this droid is on every poster. You probably think, just like I did, that you will be playing alongside him. No! He will be sitting on the ship 98% of the time. And even when he does come outside, he will do absolutely nothing.\n\nThe story. It exists, but at the same time it doesn’t. The game is built around treasure hunting, but you won’t find a single one! I spent 90 hours finishing this game (and collecting everything), and in the end I got nothing. No treasures, no wealth that the main character was searching for. Even the second DLC, which was supposed to lead us to treasures, didn’t. The story seemed close to it, we were in ancient ruins, but in the end you just have to run away, WITHOUT GETTING ANYTHING!\nOh wait, no — you do get something: a line from the droid saying that “the real treasure is friends.”\n\nTo sum up, the only positive thing I can say about this game is the beautiful landscapes. That’s it. This is not Star Wars. This is something else entirely.\n\nP.S. Also, the game has NO New Game+. Which means all the clothes, all the ship, blaster, and speeder upgrades you collected throughout the game (mostly near the end) simply disappear and have no practical use for a second playthrough.\n\nOn top of that, the achievements are broken. If you didn’t perform a certain action “on time” during some quests, you simply won’t be able to complete it after finishing the game. Even though the logic of the game allows you to start it — and it does start — the buttons to pick up the weapon just don’t appear.

This is not only a review of the game but also because I was forced to use it, it has to be with conjunction to Ubisoft Connect. Formerly, Uplay. An extra launcher that has to be running while you are playing. Even offline. I must also say I haven't bought a Ubisoft game in years and only bought this one after playing 3 hours demo exploring Tatooine and only because this is STAR WARS. \n\nI bought this 55% off because I knew full price was not worth it. I bought all the DLC (Gold Edition) which I knew was going to be a mistake but I wanted that STAR WARS. All of STAR WARS. Additionally, I live in Kazakhstan it was 18674.55 Tenge or at the time of purchase exchange rate it was $34.58 which is considerably less than the price in US even under 55% discount which goes for $110 without a discount in USD and for $49.5 at 55% off. That is additional $14 cheaper. And it was still a bad deal lol!\n\nWhat I liked about this game was combat. I didn't do any sneaking on purpose because I knew it was bad. I just killed everyone, even several times in the game when I was forced not to raise alarms i just shot everyone before they could. So that was nice I could do that. Shooting blasters feel satisfying. I love the blaster holes, the smoke, the effects, explosions, all that very Star Wars like. I ran around with the first fully upgraded Light Plasma mod most of the time. It scratched my gunslinger Red Dead SW itch but I also used all the pick up guns too (those were nice, too bad they end). I tried all the modules but most of them were bad. \n\nWhat I dislike about shooting is the fact that I can't turn off the hit markers. they are huge even when reduced to 75%. And I wanted to install a mod but found out that for some reason some genius tied the hit markers to the rest of UI and HUD so disabling them turns off most of it and requires heavy modding too. Why would they do such a thing beats me especially when they figured out it was annoying and gave us an option to reduce it to 75%. Should've given us an option to reduce it to 1% at least. Or hide it completely and not tie to the rest of HUD. It is immersion breaking. \n\nThe other thing I liked is a plethora of options to choose from. From skipping annoying mini-games, to even highlighting the objects around you when you get lost in a special graphics high contrast mod that almost looks like a dev kit mod. That is nice. You can really customize how you play this game (EXCEPT FOR THE HIT MARKER! Yyy)\n\nThe world of the game is believable. Tatooine is by far the best of all, of course. It is the most iconic Star Wars place and the level designers really put their thought into making the world feel fun to look around at even though there is no really good or fun loot to collect in any Ubisoft game. It was still a lot of fun to explore. Beautifully crafted believable Star Wars world. \n\nThe story starts of promising and fun. You meet cool characters, factions and what is hopefully a good storyline unfolds before you. Quickly becomes boring and mismatched on each planet that you forget you had a story to begin with. It is just 3 quests on each planet that have completely different sub stories and break the pacing of the game. The finale they also ruined. I couldn't wait for it to be over, it became a dull soap opera with boring predictable characters. And your mom. LOL. \n\nTatooine storyline was the best, thankfully they pulled themselves together and worked with SW material and made it believable and iconic. Also it was fun sneaking onto an imperial station off Tashara. But later on it just loses the momentum. Other planets where writers had their creative freedom run wild were rather dull compared to Tatooine. They aren't good at making their own new material without basis. \n\nND-5. I thought this was going to be as cool a droid companion like in SW: Jedi series KX droid. It had all the potential to be as cool being from clone wars, being bad ass, roger roger type droid. Looking menacing they somehow made him ANNOYING as hell. So annoying I had to turn off dialogue while free-roaming in space and every time I heard his voice lecture me it was just boring. Even the voice actor was cast wrong for this role. The robot is an annoying grumpy dad that does not feel like a cool bad-ass murder bot but rather... a boring dad. Voice, emotion, voice lines. Everything makes it a boring dad. I wish it just shut up. It is worse than Kay Vess btw. It is the worst thing. The best thing is probably that fish tank guy Bosnok. He is annoying but in a funny way. In all seriousness, Lady Q'ira, Jabba, Lando, Hutts, Jawas. You know the real Star Wars characters are the best here. Not the protagonists and main characters. Side characters are the best. \n\nDLCs not worth getting each of them I reviewed separately in their own review.\n\nUbisoft Connect gave me lots of pain. I had to repair the game for it to work. It gave me Doplhin 028 error of not being online. I had problems logging in and several times I wanted to played it would not let me in for hours until I found a fix. It just wouldn't let me start the game... I had previously started and they say it can be played in offline mod. \n\nThe game crashes a few times too. Mainly in space. I run it on an old system on Medium, it looks nice. 2080 RTX 3900 ryzen series on m.2 SSD. 16 gb ram. I had no problems with the frame rate. DLSS on. Overall, stable no lag. But had some annoying crashes. \n\nGood thing about Ubisoft Connect is that you can manually upload a single save file for cloud sync. No more than that but you get to control it. Unlike on Steam it backs up everything but if there is a discrepancy in saving it will ask which ones you'd like to keep local saves or the cloud ones and you can accidentally erase the most recent saves on Steam so I have it off. \n\nParkour is annoying at times. Thankfully there is this high contrast mod if you get really lost and don't feel like figuring it out sometimes, wish more games had it. \n\nNix in many ways annoying, plays dead when shouldn't. \n\nThere is not much loot diversity and you kinda just explore for the feel of the world and Star Wars. Side missions are nice but it lacks a cinematic dialogue camera making it more boring than it should be. I haven't beaten all the side quests, some lock map chest treasures behind them, I will maybe eventually come back to this game to just roam around and finish the side quests and intels but I explored the entirety of all maps. \n\nAt the start of the game Kay is rather weak even on easy some enemies can be dangerous but later on she becomes a god. On Very Hard it can be a challenge. Clearly, the game is more designed for stealth. But it is a nice TPS.\n\nSabacc and Food vendor mini-games are fun. I purposely left the button QTE mini-games in and on hard because it made it more fun. Sabacc is also very easy, but some people say they spend 50 hours trying to figure it out lol. To each their own I guess but it is hardly poker. \n\nThis is a standard Ubisoft game. Smaller and more fine crafted than their Assassin's Creed slop. Connect is a pain. Lack of loot variety. Combat is not the worst. Speeder piloting is okay. Ship combat is okay. The reputation idea and choices can be fun to play with. The story becomes awful, characters are awful that you want to mute them. \n\nShould you get it? Absolutely not. Only die hard Star Wars fans should get it. At a huge discount like 55% off or better yet 90% off. Do not get the DLCs they are cash grabs. \n\nWill I come back to play this again? Maybe one day when I need a Star Wars game and there is nothing SW to play I might tackle side quests that I left out but I never again want to play this story. I just want to explore the world and shoot cartels like in Red Dead. The story you can only tolerate once and it will cringe you out anyway.\n\nGood there won't be a sequel",

      "review": "Oct 2025 It crashes a lot. I've tried all the 'fixes' and none of them work. This is a high end system and has no problems running any game whatsoever. Game play wise it's ok. The world looks very good. A lot of the quests are just recycled over and over and it feels like you're playing the same game over and over again but just a different coat of paint. Typical Ubi game I suppose. I mean the game play loop is just that not engaging after awhile and one mission just seems the same as the next on a different map with lots of busy work.\n\nUpdate.\nThanks for your replies. I've moved on from this game. I didn't want to invest any further time. Plus disabling RTXDI makes a lot of difference for my eyes. Running on 5090 plus 9800x3d.",

      "review": "As a big Star Wars fan, I really wanted to love this game. I picked it up mainly because I enjoyed Jedi Fallen Order and Jedi Survivor, so I had high hopes going in.\n\nThe graphics are undeniably good, no complaints there. The world looks amazing, the details are sharp, and it definitely feels like Star Wars on the surface. But the problem is, after a while, it just gets… boring.\n\nThere’s something missing. The missions don’t really feel meaningful, and they don’t pull me in the same way other Star Wars games did. I kept waiting for that moment where I’d be hooked, but it never really came.\n\nI want to love it, but the gameplay loop feels repetitive, and the story doesn’t grab me enough to make me invested. If you’re purely after visuals and the Star Wars atmosphere, it’s solid. But if you’re looking for a deep, engaging experience like Fallen Order or Survivor, this might leave you feeling underwhelmed.\n\nScore: 6/10 – Great visuals, but missing that spark that makes a Star Wars game unforgettable.",

      "review": "Please heavily reconsider if you're buying this game, even at a steep discount.\n\nI've been eyeing this game for a while because, well, Star Wars. I've loved just about every Star Wars universe game that I've played across various consoles and over the years.\n\nI was really excited for this one! It seemed right up my alley. The story looked good, the combat seemed fun, I loved the idea of it.\n\nLong story short, I purchased it when it was 55% off for the ultimate edition. I haven't even been able to get to any of the DLCs or progress past the first chapter. I've spent 3 hours in this game, mind you, and only about twenty to thirty minutes of that was me actually being able to play the game.\n\nIt took forty-five minutes and threw restarts to get the game to load the first time around. The landscape doesn't load properly. When it does, and you're walking around, you fall randomly through the floor, and it'll take another fifteen minutes just to get the game to load again. Dialogue and action prompts will randomly disappear - so good luck progressing.\n\nI told myself I would just suffer through it. Messed around with graphics settings and turned everything down to the lowest setting. I have a really good graphics card and a brand new motherboard. I've moved the game to a SSD instead of my larger external hard drive. I've updated drivers and checked and rechecked compatibility settings.\n\nNothing helps. Seriously, don't waste your time. (I haven't even touched on how much I hate that you need to run it through Ubisoft's launcher that crashes all the time and you need an account through them to even play the game.)",
