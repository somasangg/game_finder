So, while Silksong has improvements over this original, I think this game is a masterpiece, while Silksong is reducing its target audience at a smaller percentage of gamers that excludes me.",

The hand-drawn art, haunting music, and subtle storytelling create an atmosphere that stays with you long after you stop playing. Every area feels like a piece of a fallen kingdom still whispering its history, and exploring it is equal parts beautiful and melancholic. The combat and movement are tight, precise, and deeply rewarding. Progress isn’t handed to you, you earn it, step by step, room by room, sometimes triumphantly and sometimes stubbornly. Yet that struggle makes every breakthrough feel genuine. The game trusts the player, and in doing so, creates a bond rarely seen in modern titles. What truly sets Hollow Knight apart is the emotional journey: the loneliness, the perseverance, and the strange warmth found in unexpected places and characters. It’s a game that doesn’t need to shout; it speaks softly, and that’s what makes it powerful.\nA masterpiece of atmosphere, design, and quiet storytelling. Hollow Knight isn’t just played, it’s felt.",

The animations, and everything else you can think of, are done perfectly.\n\nI finished the game in 32 hours, though I have to admit the last few hours were a bit boring. This was because I saved all the grinding for the end and did all the fun parts first. As someone who gave up on the game across four different saves, believe me when I say: buy this game. Even if you finished a cracked version, go and buy it to support the developers.\n\nI also want to mention that the game isn't as hard as streamers make it seem. Like I said, everything is calculated perfectly. The game doesn't throw impossible fights at you; instead, it gives you limited opportunities and lets you explore. It won't let you kill the final boss right away, but it lets you push your limits as much as you can.\n\nFor example, at the start of the game, you'll see a [spoiler]Grub.[/spoiler] There are three ways to reach it:\n\nYou can pogo off a fly in the room.\n\nYou can wait, return after you've obtained the [spoiler]Mantis Claw.[/spoiler]\n\nYou can wait even longer, after getting the Monarch Wings, to save the [spoiler]Grub.[/spoiler]\n\nThe game never forces you to play one way. This is a very simple example, but the game does this so well that you often feel like there are no limitations.\n\nAlso, since some streamers make the [spoiler]Path of Pain[/spoiler] look incredibly hard—it's not. It took me about 40-45 minutes to beat. For context, I sometimes struggle with basic platforming even with the [spoiler]Wings and Claw![/spoiler]\n\nAnyway, dude, just go and buy it. It's awesome.",

These are just some words that can describe Hollow Knight.\n\nThis masterpiece reminds you, right at the beginning of the game, how bad you are at orientation, cause let's be honest, everyone got lost in Hallownest at their first playthrough :D. However, when you are patient enough and keep playing, you will discover a whole new small universe in the gaming world, and the hidden, magnificent gem among indie games. If you are a Soulslike enthusiast, you also won’t regret it, because bosses are hard, yet balanced, and extremely rewarding in the end. Although bosses are tough, you will love fighting them, and the feeling of finishing the boss for the first time is irreplaceable. I must highlight creativity in making the locations, creatures, bosses, and story, which punctuate the game experience even more.\nI’m sure that if you give it a try, it will definitely find its special empty place in your heart, just as it did in mine. <3",

This may be biased, but I have no complaints about this game. Anyone is able to play this, as difficulty increases steadily enough to allow the player to get better before any harder challenges. I adore all of the bosses, even the less imperative, hidden ones. There's a mountain of secrets to discover throughout your journey, and it rewards you for experimenting. Additionally, there are challenges outside of combat, such as the White Palace, which mainly includes unique parkour. I would honestly be willing to pay every time to replay this game. Compared to other games these days, Hollow Knight is cheap, and beyond worth playing at least once.

      "review": "A lot of things have already been said about Hollow Knight since its release. I originally started the game in 2021, only to stop playing for a while, and while I came back to finish it largely because of the sequel, I've seen many demos and other games since then, and I believe that this has helped me see the game with a better perspective. Hollow Knight is often compared to the \"Soulslike\" subgenre for its difficulty and the borrowing of certain mechanics (like area-resetting save points and the post-death currency spot), it does many things better than similar 2D Metroidvania/Exploraction games. Several of the demos I've played focus too heavily on the clunky combat, constant enemy lunges and dodge-roll mechanics that conflict with the 2D gameplay fundamentals - Hollow Knight's movement remains smooth and responsive, and the invincible dash is probably one of the last upgrades you get, while things like the wall cling, air dash and double jump, all staples of the 2D genres, give you varied options to progress. The difficulty curve is pretty well designed with only a few noticeable bumps, and the exploration aspect lets you adjust the challenge. The n-th \"Ruined kingdom\" plot gets a fresh coat of paint and a new perspective through its unique artstyle and character designs. \r\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed my time in Hallownest, and my criticisms are very few. 1) Some aspects of the mapping system, which feel like unnecessary hurdles, 2) the Godmasters DLC being largely a rehash (crazy coming from a Yakuza fan, I know) and 3) some aspects of the soundrack, which is not me throwing shade at Christopher Larkin, but rather expressing my dissatisfaction with the state of music in Western games in general. Hollow Knight has amazing themes with strong melodies like Crystal Peak, Greenpath and Queen's Gardens, and Team Cherry has also used emerging music layers to give the soundtrack more pump in certain scenarios (which is criminally underutilized IMO!), but the more ambient/calm tracks, as great as they sound, might often fit the area, but not the dynamic gameplay.\r\n\r\nBut no matter what my gripes with some elements of the game are, Hollow Knight is something that was clearly made with love for the genre and love for games in general, and I will absolutely recommend everyone to give it a try.\r\n\r\n9 zotelings out of 10.",

      "review": "[h1] Score: ◆◆◆◆◆ (5/5) [/h1] \r\n\r\nTLDR: An unforgettable experience and a must play for metroidvania fans and newcomers alike.\r\n\r\nI understand. I finally understand why this game has the fan base it does and why Hollowsong hype reached unbelievable levels leading up to release. Hollow Knight is a journey that tested my perseverance at multiple points, sometimes edging close to me questioning if I should throw in the towel. HK kept me enthralled with its incredible world building and the deep satisfaction earned by overcoming whatever roadblock I was stuck on. Admittedly my history with metroidvanias is very limited, but I'm eager to dive deeper into the genre after this.\r\n\r\nHK wastes zero time getting you into the game, a theme that was persistent throughout my 45 hour playthrough. It rarely takes control away from the player and when it does, it does so briefly and for good reason. The story and world are there for you to engage with at whatever level you desire. There is a lot of interesting lore and backstory to Hallownest, the ruined subterranean kingdom you explore. What HK does even better is its character, enemy, and boss design. There are literally over 100 enemy types, each with unique and interesting designs. The bosses are simply a delight to fight thanks to their presentation, creative move sets, and of course, the music. When the Dung Defender first dives onto the screen I could not contain the huge grin on my face. Other bosses like Soul Master and the Mantis Lords are excellent examples of showing rather than telling when it comes to defining a character's personality.\r\n\r\nThe world of Hollow Knight is the true star of the show and is incredibly addicting to gradually explore as you unlock more abilities in typical metroidvania fashion. I was originally worried about environmental diversity given the game takes place underground for almost the entire duration, but the developers do an excellent job mixing things up. Biomes feel unique but also fitting and sensible whether you are in typical rocky caverns, crystalline tunnels, a literal underground city, dense jungles, or more. You have to purchase each biome's map from an NPC in a specific location in that biome. This map gives you a basic layout, but requires further exploration if you want a complete map. I think this is great, although I am less of a fan of the map not updating until you sit at a bench. I could also take or leave the fact that you cannot see yourself on the map unless you use up a charm notch, but it is not the end of the world.\r\n\r\nOkay, the combat is also the star of the show. What can I say, this show has a lot of stars. Hollow Knight's moveset is initially very simple since you are left with basically just a nail to swing, a heal, and the ability to move and jump. That is literally it, but as expected with the genre, you will gain abilities as you explore such as a dash that can be upgraded to allow traversal or even damage, spells, special nail attacks, and more. Techniques such as pogoing, in which you use the momentum from striking downwards on an enemy below you to keep yourself in the air, further add to the game's depth. Beyond that you have charms which, when equipped, give special bonuses or even abilities. Charms have a notch value and you are limited in how many charms you can equip by the number of notches you have, although this can be upgraded. This forces you to make decisions about which charms to use and it is common for different setups to work best for different bosses. All of this comes together when you are engaged in boss fights with arenas and tactics that test your aptitude as the Hollow Knight.\r\n\r\nThe music is unsurprisingly fantastic, but the sound design, especially for the enemies and NPCs, is really creative. Entombed Husks and Flukemons are particularly notable for how disgusting they sound, perfectly fitting for where and what they are. The only things I found lacking were a few platforming sections and some annoying enemies, usually of the flying variety. I think flying enemies as a baseline tend to be a nuisance, but certain ones like Primal Aspids and Crystal Hunters take this up a notch while also being found in tougher platforming sections.\r\n\r\nThese moments are fleeting and increasingly rare as you, the Hollow Knight, become stronger. By the end of my playthrough I felt nearly unstoppable outside of the most challenging boss fights. This game came a long way from its beginning as a game jam project on Newgrounds, which was considered a bad game at the time. I am going to let a little time pass before I dig into Silksong, but I am very excited for my next taste of Team Cherry.",

There is constant backtracking, which some people might find annoying, but it only makes it all the more rewarding if you actually remeber where youre supposed to go.\n\nThe fights are very challenging, but not too hard eighter. If youre expecting dark souls level bosses, then you might be slightly dissapointed, as it wont take you hundreds upon hundreds of attempts, but youre not gonna beat them on your first try eighter. Very well balanced if you ask me.\n\nThe fighting system is good, as its not just the same thing over and over again. There are many different bosses, but also many different spells that you collect throughout the whole game, so you dont get overwhelmed at the start, but your options expand over time (then again, most people dont use them unless its requiered).\n\nWhat this game excels at however, is the movement system. Similarly to the fighting system, you acuire new mechanics as you progress and it even makes the fighting in the game feel way better when you know how to use each move.\n\nOverall, i couldnt recommend this game enough. I think everyone should try it at least once. A lot of people lose interest before they even get to greenpath (second main area), which is a real shame, but if it really doesnt entice you enough to keep playing, then maybe metroidvanias arent for you.

Learning the basic mechanics in the first game will help a lot before getting into Silksong.\n\nOne nice thing about Silksong is that it has no DLCs yet, so going for full completion feels more straightforward. In Hollow Knight, there is the main 100 percent game and then three extra DLCs. If you like to play without guides or spoilers, those DLCs can be harder to find and complete.\n\nBasically, try the first Hollow Knight before Silksong.

      "review": "This game is so much fun, but it seems like it desperately doesn't want you to find that out.\n\nI tried to play this game numerous times after it looked so fun in clips I saw of various bosses, but the start was just so confusing and boring that I struggled every time. I felt like I was looping through samey corridors with no idea where I was supposed to be going. I believe this was my fourth time trying to start Hollow Knight, and I told myself that I would just stick with it until I hit that good point, and it finally came.\n\nOnce you get past the rough start, this game is extraordinary. Simple but challenging combat, loads of satisfying movement options that you unlock throughout the game, a really cute art style, and tons of secrets to find across the world. I found myself really really enjoying the game once I got into the swing of things.\n\nHowever, this game does have two painful downsides that I had to mod the game to overcome, otherwise the game just felt like it was artificially stretching out its runtime - the checkpoint and fast travel systems. \n\nWhenever you would die, you'd respawn at a bench and you'd have to collect your soul to regain all your money. This is fine. However, the benches can sometimes be quite far from boss rooms. There are some bosses that are a three or four minute journey away from the nearest bench, meaning every time you die there's effectively a four minute loading screen after each attempt. This isn't engaging or anything, this is just painful. There is a mod that respawns you in the room you died, which fixed this issue for me by allowing me to jump straight back into boss fights.\n\nThe other issue, the fast travel system, is purely because there are so few fast travel points. The world in this game is huge, and each area has a fast travel point. If you've got an area you want to check out for one quick thing, that can sometimes take you upwards of 20 minutes to get there and back to where you came from. This game is full of backtracking and using your new abilities to find secrets in existing areas, so the lack of a variety of fast travel points really hurts this game. The bench warp mod fixed this for me and allowed me to get into the meat of the game much more consistently.\n\nSo while this game is a ton of fun when you're actually exploring or engaging in combat, the rough start and sluggish unmodded pacing definitely hurts the game a lot. Fixing the majority of those issues with mods, this game becomes an absolute joy to play.",

Between the fun bosses as well as exploration, I can say that out of the thirty hours I have sunk here, I have enjoyed a significant majority of them. That is not to say it is all sunshine and rainbows, as there are many sections that I found very annoying, especially runbacks on bosses. This is especially true for a few bosses such as WK and the bee guy. Furthermore, there is a complete change that occurs after a certain checkpoint that makes traversing one area extremely annoying. Other than that, I think that you should definitely experience this game. The first hour is annoying, but from then on, fun awaits.",

The normal bosses are well-balanced and easier to read, while the Dream bosses push your reflexes to the limit, offering thrilling and challenging fights.\n\nExploration is the heart of the game — from the eerie depths of the Forgotten Crossroads to the regal heights of the White Palace, every location feels alive and mysterious. There’s no right or wrong path — just explore, and you’ll constantly discover new secrets, shortcuts, and surprises.\n\nGeo farming feels natural rather than grindy, as enemies, colosseum battles, and exploration all reward you consistently. Charms and spell upgrades add meaningful customization, and spells themselves can devastate mini-bosses with the right build. The Path of Pain stands as the ultimate platforming challenge for those who crave mastery.\n\nWith a beautiful soundtrack, emotional NPC stories, and smooth traversal upgrades, Hollow Knight never stops rewarding your curiosity. Even after 100+ hours for full 112% completion, it remains satisfying from start to finish. For its low price (around $4 on sale), the sheer content, polish, and atmosphere make it a must-play.\n\nTeam Cherry created not just a game, but an experience that defines what a perfect Metroidvania should be. Looking forward to diving into your second masterpiece, Silksong, soon.\n\nOverall Score: 10/10",

Which means, you have to hold it for a second, and if you wanted to turn around to attack and push back an enemy chasing you? Well good job, you just walked into them and took damage.

I would have preferred to have directions or a hint on where to go or something.\nYes exploring is fun, but not when you spend most of your time going over the areas you've already been, running around trying to find what the next objective is. Imagine GTA V but without mission markers. It gets boring and annoying having to google everything.\n\nLater on you can buy markers to put on your map. Great! just mark where I've already been or where I want to come back, right? NOPE, you get a max of 6 markers (for each color) for whatever reason.\n\nOk I'll just remember where I've been, right? Well, what happens when I don't play for a few weeks then come back? already forgot everything.\n\nThen during boss fights, or I guess in general, if you die, instead of respawning nearby, you respawn at the last bench you saved at. It's not fun and frustrating dying and then having to walk all the way back while taking damage along the way.\n\nThen there's also the fact that, for whatever fucking reason, in order to see where you are on the map you need to sacrifice a slot which could be used for other upgrades.

      "review": "As a big fan of Metroidvanias and hard games such as the Dark Souls series, I felt that Hollow Knight would totally be up my alley - but whenever I saw a clip of gameplay I never got excited, so I didn't purchase it. With the release of Silksong and a nice sale, I felt I should finally give it a chance.\nI have put in about 9 hours now, and I'm not sure if I'm going to continue playing, as the game doesn't really feel that engaging to me.\nEDIT: I have finished the game after about 22 hours of playing, and my earlier assessment remains mostly unchanged.\n\n\nThe Negatives:\n\n- The gameplay feels incredibly slow and boring before you get the Dash ability. In the early game, you can do a grand total of three things: walk, slash, jump. No ranged options, dodging, blocking, parrying, or even crouching. Consquently, combat also feels really limited and boring, and this barely changes with the few combat-relevant abilities you subsequently gain. Even towards the end of the game, I never felt that combat was interesting. Another reason for this shortcoming is that:\n\n- Enemies aren't very engaging, and the vast majority of them uses the grand strategy of running into the player character. After some time playing I mostly tried to avoid combat because it's just tedious.\n\n- The environments are visually beautiful, but not very interesting to navigate through; the different biomes all feel pretty much the same. For example, Greenpath looks very different compared to The Crossroads, but it doesn't _feel_ different and it doesn't play different: it's all platforms with pits.\nI also kind of stopped looking for secret passages, because there's rarely anything of interest to find: at best, you'll be rewarded with a bit of money or a cryptic two-liner of lore. The truly relevant stuff such as new charms is usually hidden in plain sight. Related point:\n\n- The environmental / jump & run challenges don't work well with the rest of the game. For example, approaching the City of Tears requires the player to do a number of tricky jumps/dashes, and it's designed well. However, failure is punished with HP loss, and there's not a lot of HP to go around. Consequence: instead of being able to keep trying, the player has to turn around and grind enemies for HP (or die and run all the way back from the last bench).\nOn the one hand, I feel that Hollow Knight could've used more such challenges, and I found the existing ones more engaging than combat; on the other hand, such gameplay lends itself to a game which is more lenient with its challenge (e.g. in 2D Metroid games failure in jump & run segments is often punished just with wasted time, or if HP is lost it is not a significant portion of overall HP).\n\n- The game requires a lot of backtracking. Fast travel points are few and far between, and the world is clearly set up in a way that requires the player to return to previous areas a lot - which sucks, because most areas are barely interesting when you pass them the first time. This also makes enemies & environments appear even more boring, because you are constantly forced to cross sections you'be been in before again and again.\n\n- The map system is dumb. I have to find an NPC in a new area before I can use the map? After I have purchased every single item the mapmaker shop offers, my character can't map on his own in a new area? What nonsense is this? What gameplay benefit is this supposed to achieve?\n\n\nThe Positives:\n\n- Somewhat a matter of taste, but the difficulty feels well-balanced to me; So far, I wouldn't mind if the game was more difficult. The system of gathering Soul to power both HP recovery and abilities is clever.\n\n- NPCs and their dialogues, and the lore in general, is great.\n\n- Charms offer many interesting options for character building.\n\n- Snappy and precise controls.\n\n\nToss-up:\n\n- Music: I'll happily admit that the music is atmospheric, and it fits the game well, but... I can't say I feel it is outstanding.\n\n\nCONCLUSION:\nI don't think Hollow Knight is a bad game, and I can absolutely see why people enjoy it. But if I had to rate it based on my gameplay experience so far, I'd probably give it a 6 or perhaps 7 out of 10. I simply don't see the masterpiece it has been hailed as, and in all honesty, I'd rather play any of the Castlevanias or 2D Metroids instead. As such, I wouldn't recommend Hollow Knight to friends... hence my 'not recommended' rating.",

Spawn points are here and there, so you're not walking so far if you die and have to collect your sole before you die again and lose all your money.

Pros of Hollow Knight I loved the early/mid game and how mysterious the game feels to some one who has never played the game before and the nail combat plus the movement felt real nice to play with, and the challenge of the game did not feel bad at all to me I sure felt it with some bosses and areas but it never felt impossible. Cons of Hollow Knight I want to start this part if the review by saying I did beat the game and got skill but that aside I still feel like I want to point the cons of the game that I have with it. Con one for me will be the art style of the game I am not calling the art bad it just did not pop to me, con two the late game in a whole I did not like the late game of Hollow Knight and for me the late game of Hollow Knight to be after you have done all dreamers and for me I also explored the whole map and picked a fight with every boss I found but I still did not feel good fighting some of these bosses such as White-Defender, Lost Kin, and all dream bosses as a whole accept for Nightmare King Grimm witch to me is the best boss in the whole game and the best boss that team charry has ever made.

      "review": "Came back to leave a review after completing Silksong. I found Hollow Knight really hard to stick with and dropped it multiple times before finally finishing it prior to playing Silksong. \n\nMy biggest complaint is that the storytelling is super vague and expects the player to pick up a big chunk of even the main storyline from environmental clues that aren't necessarily easy to make sense of. I can see how this method of storytelling appeals to people, but it's definitely not my cup of tea, and I struggled to maintain interest. I powered through the game and even after getting the \"true\" ending, still felt like I didn't really understand what is going on at all until I watched a video explaining everything which, looking back, I would never have been able to pick up myself.\n\nStorytelling aside, the combat felt really one-dimensional. Having played Nine Sols before and Silksong after, I can't help but find Hollow Knight's combat system and boss fights lacking and boring, mostly relying on positioning and avoiding enemy attacks with a jump and a simple dash. While I understand that HK's combat is designed and balanced around enemies inflicting touch damage, I'm not a big fan of it, and found that bosses who rely on killing the player with them accidentally running into it are generally just less fun than bosses with more complex skill/movesets. And while Silksong has the same exact system, the combat just feels more fun and rewarding because of how fluid Hornet moves, and the addition of some movement abilities, with the biggest gamechanger being Clawline as a gap-closer or a way to deal with aerial enemies. I understand that Nine Sols has a completely different combat system and it's not fair to compare the combat of the two, but Nine Sols' parry-focused combat is perfect and just feels way way more rewarding than HK's and if you haven't played Nine Sols you should!\n\n5/10",

      "review": "Hollow Knight is such an oddball game to me in the sense that it's an incredible experience when the devs actually design it to challenge you but most of the game is painfully boring.\n\nThe spirit mechanic on paper is fine as a conventional meter system but I think the healing mechanic hurts it. I don't like the fact that it allows wreckless play because most enemies aren't actually capable of doing more than one piece of damage to you before they die and the amount of meter you build by attacking them alleviates it quickly. The few enemies that do are usually slow moving big bodies that either can be trivalized with an attack + dash away tactic or you can safely dash over their heads. This wouldn't be so bad if wasn't for the fact that in the moment to moment, enemies don't typically control much space or pose any threat to you through attrition in a way they can in other metroidvanias. It's way too easy to just ignore them 80% of the time. There's also the issue that since healing takes up the spirit meter you're typically discouraged from using any other ability that utilizes that system since the reward and cost of using any ability isn't worth it when keeping yourself alive is far more rewarding. It gets worse with the weird tuning where nail upgrades make bosses have more health which makes your abilities weaker.\n\nThe level design is a mix of mostly empty hallways with pits and areas that emphasize verticality. Enemy layouts are cookie cutter, usually 3-4 fodder enemies in a hallway or a few easily ignorable flying enemies in more vertical areas. On the rare occassion you may get an enemy that's good at covering space such as the Soul Twister's but the game rarely feels the need to make enemy encounters threatening. This is probably to make the travel between areas less tedious given how limited the fast travel mechanic is but it still feels like a chore especially with how much gating the game has. This may be a necessity given the scale of the game but it just results in a lot of boring back and forth between areas where you'll often end up ignoring enemies after a certain point.\n\nAside from this Hollow Knight does offer the occassional platforming setpiece. These are easily more interesting than most of the moment to moment in Hollow Knight but I feel their main issue is that they're usually overly reliant on one ability and are too easily solved. Even still, I'd much prefer this than the norm with Hollow Knight because it's at least making use of certian mechanics. These setpieces are too sparse and usually optional.\n\nThe way Hollow Knight presents its map system is pretty unique but I wish they'd commit to it. Very early you get upgrades to transform it into a conventional metroidvania map system when the initial premise is you have no map marker and had to read the layouts yourself. On some level I feel this would have been received poorly by a lot of players and you could make the case that it just adds drudgery to a simple concept, but it just comes off as cowardly to not make this the default experience. The caveat they make for this is not severe enough to matter and in any situation where you might not want the pin for tracking your part of the map is within areas that likely will have a seat for you to change it anyway. \n\nHollow Knight's progression is slower than most metroidvanias and that's to its detriment. The game has a lot of bosses but most function under the assumption you only have the dash ability and thus it's a slog to play through because these boss fights are so boring and one note. Too many bosses are overly generous in terms of how big their start up frames are for their attacks and arenas are usually fairly sizable to make dodging them easy. Usually the way bosses are designed in that they focus on one or two attacks and after being hit a number of times they do the attack another time sequentially and I find this boring because you're never changing your solution when engaging with these different phases. What worked the first time is going to work again the second time. It's not until [spoiler]Hollow Knight[/spoiler] where the game's boss fights finally acknowledges that you have more mobility options than just the dash and god I wish the game did this sooner.\n\nNothing about the plot or lore grabbed me. A lot of it is excessively cryptic and the game doesn't really give you much reason to care or ponder what any specific message means. I guess there's some lore heads who like piecing it together but with the bits I decided to invest in it all came off to me as so tepid and uninspired. The crypticness has a purpose in defining its overall vibe but the game didn't sell me enough on its vibe for me to care.\n\nI completed the game within 20 hours and I was under the impression that the post-game wasn't inviting anything valuable to engage with. But my peers insisted I try it out and well... I gotta it admit it changed my perspective of the game.\n\nThe Trial of fools is a damn solid gauntlet that actually had me thinking about the utility of my arts and it's also a case where the specific point you decide to do it changes the experience. Not having the shade cloak; for example, has you thinking about enemies in a very different way. I also love that it tightens the space for certain enemies, making you far more thoughtful about your movement options. It can be a bit tiring to go through multiple attempts given that you might be only filtered by one part of the gauntlet and the rest of it ends up feeling tedious but I respect the game demanding that level of consistency from you.\n\nThe White Palace convinced me that Hollow Knight has merit as a platformer. This is the only case where I felt the game was making me utilize multiple different mechanics and also allowing for ways to approach challenges in unorthodox ways. I think what I like about it too is how it shows the flexibility of the dash button given that it's useful for both platforming and combat. Combining that with the double jump is such a satisfying way to get over obstacles. It was so cool seeing the boost ability be utilized here in the way it was as well, given that the main game only really uses it for gating. My only problem with this section is that there are some areas where it obscures sight of a saw hazard and you could get damaged due to lacking the knowledge that it exists in that area. But other than that, a surprisingly well-designed platform level.\n\nThe post-game/optional boss fights are so bizarre to me in the sense that they feel alien to how bosses are usually designed in the main game. They're a lot more varied in the type of attacks they use and they'll also utilize multiple attacks at once to cover space. [spoiler]The Radiance[/spoiler] is such a great example of this. But others like Lost Kin use spawning enemies to add challenge too, which they clearly didn't have the balls to do in the main game. I gotta say, when I started the Godhome boss gauntlet it highlighted to me how boring most of the game's bosses are and it made me lose all enthusiasm for doing it.\n\nSo it begs the question, why did I put this in \"not recommended?\" On a certain level, I think Hollow Knight is fantastic. But it's also a case where like... only 10% of the game is actually engaging to me, which is more egregious in how a lot of it is DLC. The game's highs are incredible, but I don't even think the game has lows. It's just consistently boring for most of its playtime. The game has such a strong foundation yet Team Cherry rarely feels compelled to push it, and that's what makes Hollow Knight so disappointing to me.",

      "review": "UPD. Fuck this game\n\nThe game is interesting, the atmosphere really pulls you in, but the non-linear story kind of ruined everything. You don’t know where to go or what your objective is. I’m using a step-by-step walkthrough from IGN instead of following the “story.” It would also be better if there were a save point before boss fights, because otherwise you have to spend five minutes running through the same area just to get to the boss fight again. For example, before the boss fight in Mantis Village, you can’t save because a mob blocks the passage that leads to the bench, and if you die during the boss fight, you have to go through the whole path again, which is honestly already pissing me off.\n\nIn my childhood I loved platformers, and I especially liked \"Incredible Jack\" — it had a very good, simple story, good gameplay, and interesting boss fights. And I don’t remember getting frustrated while playing it… I wish this game were like that too, or at least had more save points so you could enjoy the game instead of burning out every five minutes. I don’t understand this new trend of making games so unclear… Most people want to play games to relax, not to break their heads trying to figure things out and looking up hints on the internet.\n\nI really want to finish this game, and maybe with time I’ll get less frustrated. Would I recommend it to others? Most likely yes, but everything I mentioned above really ruins the overall impression of the game.",

      "review": "I don't know, I had heard a lot about how great the game was. Not sure if that's because my expectations were just too high, but I didn't understand most mechanics in the game, especially when it comes to combat. I thought for some time what rating to give to the game. I can't say it's a bad game. It still has great moments and it definitely found its audience, but it annoyed me too often, which led to a negative overall impression.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]:\n- [b]World[/b] is the strongest part of the game. I think this is the reason why everyone loves the game. It is fun to explore overall, especially once you unlock all abilities. The world contains a huge number of secrets and nuances e.g., entire locations could be hidden. Though I don't think some of them are fair or consistent. Usually there's something to give you a hint, but occasionally there are, like, floors/walls without any indications that there's something under/behind them. But I'd say at some point you will need to google anyway. I believe this is forgivable for this game since it is almost impossible to find all secrets by yourself.\n- Quite interesting [b]lore[/b] and [b]atmosphere[/b].\n\n[b]Cons[/b]:\n- [b]Bosses[/b]. 80% of damage comes from contact damage when they make a sudden sidestep. \n[i]I don't think that's a good way to make a battle difficult[/i]. I would understand if bosses had a rich move set, but usually it's just 2-3 moves and the bosses rapidly move around the arena and damage you with their body. So the boss fights in most cases don't feel fun at all.\n- [b]Flying/teleporting enemies[/b]. I cannot describe how I hate fighting them. It feels like you don't have enough means to confront them. They either constantly fly away from you and you have to catch up to try to get them or when trying to run by and ignore them, they simply overtake and contact damage you. Both behavior models are very annoying. The worst part is that there are quite a lot of them. To finish you off, when you hit them, you push them away, beginning the cycle again.\n- [b]Tempo[/b]. The game slows you down a lot for some reason. You can't constantly keep going, there's always something that makes you wait. Especially when you need to go down with a lot of spikes on platforms or enemies and you need to constantly check if there is something below, and you're going to go down a lot. And if you get hit by a spike you get respawned unpredictably, so for the first a couple of seconds you spend to understand where you are. Elevators are personally painful with spikes on top, you can't simply jump down, so you have to call it first, wait, and then go down. There are also enemies designed to block your way or overtake you quickly to do so. At first it could be fun and you could spend a lot of time on each thing on your way, but eventually it becomes a routine and a pain in the ass.\n- [b]Another boss attempt[/b]. Usually, you need to run one hell of a long way to make another try to kill a boss and with the environment forcefully slowing you down, it can be annoying e.g., [spoiler]the 2nd fight with Hornet[/spoiler], there's a long arena with nothing but a few ledges which don't let you use your flight so you have to just run there. And once you arrive there's often an unskippable animation before the fight and you have to watch them over and over. I've heard this is even worse in the sequel and I truly don't understand why it is supposed to be fun in any way.\n- [b]General combat issues[/b]. It could be applied to all the points above. There're often situations when you don't know about enemies but they know about you. So they could attack you behind the screen. It is a regular situation and it is no fun. They could also just run away from you to where you can't see them and then contact damage you. So you often cannot play proactively meaning you have to wait, wait and wait for your enemies to do something before doing something yourself to be sure. Plus, many enemies like shooting homing projectiles going through walls that can get you by surprise and that feels very cheap.\n- [b]Controls[/b]. They don't feel responsive sometimes, like there is no buffer for what you just pressed. Feels like there's a small delay after your input before you can input again. I often encountered situations where my inputs were just ignored without any visible reason why. I don't like it. I also had a problem with unintentionally triggered double jumps near corners or walls.\n\n[b]Cons[/b] but debatable:\n- [b]Abilities[/b]. I am sure some people may like it, but for me it was too slow and disappointing. What you get right away in most games, you have to slowly discover here, like double jumps, wall jumps, or a dash. Most games come with something interesting to stop you from going further, but here it is this simple. And often the game stops your progress with just a slightly bigger gap so you can't jump over it with your normal jump. It didn't feel rewarding for me, more like I was given back what I was supposed to have had to overcome something insignificant.",

      "review": "I really wanted to like this game, but this is probably the most overglazed and overhyped game of all time. It is regularly called the \"Souls-like Metroidvania,\" but a better comparison would be to call it the Fortnite of Metroidvanias becuase it's not really that deep, but appeals to mainstream gamers who aren't really that deep into the Metroidvania genre, or gaming as a whole. And don't get me wrong, this game is fun at times, but it excels at nothing and is rather bland as a whole. If you are looking for a visually striking, creative and innovative Metroidvania with challenging or even souls-like combat, play Blasphemous or Symphony of the Night instead. This game is not that, contrary to what others say.\n\nAs a Metroidvania, it is probably the most shallow and uninteresting Metroidvania I have ever played. The level design is extremely repetitive and bland, The exploration appears open yet lacks any vision and ends up being largely linear and involves you often walking in circles until you find a hidden door you missed. There is very little movement growth, really only getting a dash, wall jump and double jump. Back tracking is not rewarding because by the time you get anything out of it you've already run through the same area 10 times already. The environments also lack visual clarity and often look more or less the same screen from screen. While some Metroidvania's make more use of the map than others, A large portion of this game's upgrades are just adding rudimentary features to the map like showing your cursor on the map or marking merchants on it. This really isn't much of a Metroidvania as much as it is a walking simulator because the movement is so slow and you spend so much time trudging through the same areas over and over.\n\nAs a Souls-like, the Combat is extremely shallow and a complete letdown. Combat in it's entirety really just boils down to just mashing a single button and has virtually zero depth. Parry timing is extremely tight and while it does nullify a single instance of damage, it's ultimately better just to button mash and deal damage than it is to strategically bait out a parry. Dodging provides zero Iframes and is purely a traversal tool here, further limiting combat to this passive game of chicken where you run in, mash, run away, repeat. Even among Metroidvanias, which to be frank, usually have lackluster Combat: Hollow Knight stands out as exceptionally repetitive and bland in virtually every aspect. The only reason this game gets called a souls-like is because it has corpse running (IE: Death = you must recover your body or all your currency is lost) and because it has a parry button. Controls are sluggish and the opposite of tight. Frankly, calling it a Souls-like is an insult to Soulslikes.\n\nThe Art style and Lore seems to carry this game in the eyes of many, but to be honest, that is also rather basic and shallow. Character sprites are minimalistic, bland and even when they are distinct from one another, there isn't much interest to them. The NPC's also have virtually zero dimension to them, so there's not really any reason to be invested in them or their (non-existent) stories. Assets and Backgrounds don't really match in terms of style or level of detail. Characters have thick, blocky lines and no shading or detail whatsoever, while backgrounds are highly detailed, shaded and static.\n\nIf I didn't get this game for under $5, I would probably really disappointed. It's not a terrible game, but there are flash games of equal or superior quality from like 2008 both graphically and mechanically.",

This leads you to taking the wrong turns constantly as you try to find the one and only path, which means endlessly reclearing the same corridors. Now, this wouldn't be that bad if there was a good mini-map, markers or landmarks that would help you get your bearings, but no - there is nothing of the sort, instead you get various shades of gray as you traverse the Same Corridor #69420 for the 10th time. It also wouldn't be that bad if going off the only and only path was rewarding in ANY way, but in 99% of cases you will get nothing or a few geos.\r\n\r\nAll that directly links with the second point that is constant backtracking, which can be somewhat limited if you already KNOW when and where you'll get a certain feature that you'll need to unlock certain doors or collect certain items, but when you're playing for the first time?
