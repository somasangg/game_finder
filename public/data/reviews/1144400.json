      "review": "The game is a romance visual novel set in a secluded mountain village that mixes folklore with modern tourism. The protagonist arrives as an outsider and becomes tied to a myth involving a cursed sword. The narrative balances slice-of-life pacing with supernatural tension. World detail focuses on traditions and local festivals.\n\nGameplay follows standard visual novel structure. You read text and select branching choices. Flags track affection. Some routes require earlier decisions. There are no combat or resource systems. Replay is required to see all endings and extra scenes.\n\nCharacters represent different facets of village life. Personalities range from responsible caretakers to mischievous locals. Dialogue explores trust between insiders and outsiders. Relationship progression is slow and route dependent. Writing leans on calm atmosphere and gradual charm.\n\nVisual presentation uses high quality 2D art. Character sprites are expressive. Backgrounds depict shrines, forests, and rustic homes. Animated effects highlight supernatural moments. Interface navigation is clean.\n\nSound design is strong. Background tracks shift between calm daily life and dramatic scenes. Ambient effects reinforce nature. Voice acting covers major characters and adds emotional detail. Audio quality stays consistent.\n\nThe game suits players who enjoy character-focused romance with light fantasy. Mechanics are shallow but routes are polished. Fans of scenic, atmospheric storytelling will find strong value. Users wanting fast pacing or complex systems may not engage.",

Did all the routes and Murasame's route definitely felt like the true route, and my favourite route. Yuzusoft did a great job at developing these characters throughout the story, even the typical annoying male best friend character Rentarou ended being well written and funny character. I'd recommend getting it on sale, just be prepared for a holy fucking DENSE mc",

The protagonist is dense as hell in some routes but then very perceptive in others. The quality is all over the place, so I'm going to give my thoughts on each route for once.\n\nYoshino's story is frankly all fluff and like one dramatic scene, although it was the only time I teared up I wouldn't call it worth reading, not by a long shot.\n\nMako's story is somewhat compelling, I don't have any faults with it, but I don't think I really recommend it. It just felt very flat to me.\n\nLena's was surprisingly good. It felt like it came out of Majikoi, its humor was great, and it is ironically the lore dump route. It's pretty compelling. Definitely one of the best endings.\n\nMurasame's route is the stand-out route for me. It is the one that actually feels like an attempt at something unique. It's alright, it's not perfect, but I think it is my selection for best route on this one. All of the themes of the work come together pretty well in this one and it bookends the beginning very well. I definitely would save this one for last as it is a good sendoff for the game.\n\nThe bonus route in this one is probably the best Yuzusoft I've played so far, no loli and a relaxing change of pace from the other routes. Wish it wasn't a love triangle but I understand why.\n\nThe music is good, the TL is solid, and I enjoyed it overall, just not to a phenomenal amount. I just wish Yuzusoft had more actual stakes in their stories, as they have good premises that hardly ever end less than absolutely perfectly for everyone. I'm not asking for sad endings or bittersweet ones, but it would be great if insurmountable plot issues arose that required compromise. The hero's journey in these games always seems so short or so easily overcome with just luck and \"the power of love\". Oh well, I'm not the precise target audience for these games I think, just an ancillary one.",

      "review": "The game is a romance visual novel set in a secluded mountain village that mixes folklore with modern tourism. The protagonist arrives as an outsider and becomes tied to a myth involving a cursed sword. The narrative balances slice-of-life pacing with supernatural tension. World detail focuses on traditions and local festivals.\n\nGameplay follows standard visual novel structure. You read text and select branching choices. Flags track affection. Some routes require earlier decisions. There are no combat or resource systems. Replay is required to see all endings and extra scenes.\n\nCharacters represent different facets of village life. Personalities range from responsible caretakers to mischievous locals. Dialogue explores trust between insiders and outsiders. Relationship progression is slow and route dependent. Writing leans on calm atmosphere and gradual charm.\n\nVisual presentation uses high quality 2D art. Character sprites are expressive. Backgrounds depict shrines, forests, and rustic homes. Animated effects highlight supernatural moments. Interface navigation is clean.\n\nSound design is strong. Background tracks shift between calm daily life and dramatic scenes. Ambient effects reinforce nature. Voice acting covers major characters and adds emotional detail. Audio quality stays consistent.\n\nThe game suits players who enjoy character-focused romance with light fantasy. Mechanics are shallow but routes are polished. Fans of scenic, atmospheric storytelling will find strong value. Users wanting fast pacing or complex systems may not engage.",

Did all the routes and Murasame's route definitely felt like the true route, and my favourite route. Yuzusoft did a great job at developing these characters throughout the story, even the typical annoying male best friend character Rentarou ended being well written and funny character. I'd recommend getting it on sale, just be prepared for a holy fucking DENSE mc",

      "review": "This is typical Yuzusoft. Each route has its own set of issues which seemingly don't matter in the other ones, and it is more for entertainment than any sort of interesting themes. The protagonist is dense as hell in some routes but then very perceptive in others. The quality is all over the place, so I'm going to give my thoughts on each route for once.\n\nYoshino's story is frankly all fluff and like one dramatic scene, although it was the only time I teared up I wouldn't call it worth reading, not by a long shot.\n\nMako's story is somewhat compelling, I don't have any faults with it, but I don't think I really recommend it. It just felt very flat to me.\n\nLena's was surprisingly good. It felt like it came out of Majikoi, its humor was great, and it is ironically the lore dump route. It's pretty compelling. Definitely one of the best endings.\n\nMurasame's route is the stand-out route for me. It is the one that actually feels like an attempt at something unique. It's alright, it's not perfect, but I think it is my selection for best route on this one. All of the themes of the work come together pretty well in this one and it bookends the beginning very well. I definitely would save this one for last as it is a good sendoff for the game.\n\nThe bonus route in this one is probably the best Yuzusoft I've played so far, no loli and a relaxing change of pace from the other routes. Wish it wasn't a love triangle but I understand why.\n\nThe music is good, the TL is solid, and I enjoyed it overall, just not to a phenomenal amount. I just wish Yuzusoft had more actual stakes in their stories, as they have good premises that hardly ever end less than absolutely perfectly for everyone. I'm not asking for sad endings or bittersweet ones, but it would be great if insurmountable plot issues arose that required compromise. The hero's journey in these games always seems so short or so easily overcome with just luck and \"the power of love\". Oh well, I'm not the precise target audience for these games I think, just an ancillary one.",

During playing this game i could see how mutch the developers thought about every word and line and the dubbing is so appropriate for each character that it makes the feeling like your really inside the game. The emotion worked strongly and beautifully in every scene and you can feel the emotions of the in-game visuals.\nIn addition, there is a flow chart that allows you to enjoy the game more and experience all the tracks the game offers rather than starting it from the beginning, which was very convenient and gives you the opportunity to enjoy it completely. In conclusion, I want to thank the developers for creating this masterpiece 10/10.",
