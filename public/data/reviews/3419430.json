It's also fun to have your friends' cats also tapping along on the bottom of your screen (or wherever you decide to drag them to, lol). It's cute and doesn't make you feel so alone. The kitty taps when you type, it taps when you click, you can even set it to respond to a game controller so you wrack up points as you play. It's fun, entertaining, and a cute little companion on the long, lonely days. Go BONGO CAT! /ᐠ ◜𖥦 ◝ マ",

I think one of the cats when i wasnt watching knocked 90 points off the rating\n\n I used something like this in the 1990s iirc , for about the same time. 5 minutes with an hour of idle. This one does even less than the 1990s ones and iirc this one had issues like not actually doing anything, or is it me who doesnt actually do anything; umm no. I can confirm i tell my boss I am constantly busy.  The cat didnt swipe my laptop off the table, didnt purr, or rub against me and when i was playing games or watching videos with flashy lights it wasnt chasing them like lazers. ALSO ! Also, no cats brandished a knife. yeah so, i wasnt promised that; but ive come to expect the knife part. I didnt even get bit or scratched tho! It was lacking and since im a true crazy cat person, i dont even have friends to test teh rest of this with (my rl male friends are dogs people and would say 20/100 is 1000 too much after refusing to download it)\n\nMore telling this isnt much of a cat simulator is it didnt look at me headcocked sideways unable to move for a minute at a time trying to figure out why I  downloaded this. *shrug*\n\nIm glad to see so many of you enjoyed it tho, so dev im just recomending ideas for part 2. If you can make the cat knock my dell craptop off the desk in part 2, or in some DLC itll be a surefire winner everyone in every office and every Dell/Hp/Windows 10/11 owner will enjoy!",
