      "review": "Reviewing (mostly) every game (or DLC) in my library, part 472:\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️☆ (9/10)\n\nNot to be a Ubisoft shill or anything, but man, Ubisoft games are great when you don't have someone in your ear telling you constantly how bland their games are. It's strange to call a main-line [i]Assassin's Creed[/i] game underrated, especially one with 30,000 reviews, but I feel like no one talks about [i]Syndicate[/i] which is a shame! [i]Syndicate[/i] is one of the most stylish, confident, and straight-up fun entries in the franchise. It remains dedicated to London and the francise's roots, packed with surprisingly sharp writing and memorable characters. Evie and Jacob’s dual approach—brains and brawn—keeps gameplay fresh while being great protagonists, and the setting is alive and beautiful as ever. Sure, it’s not perfect, but between the slick parkour, Victorian chaos, and an iconic train hideout, it’s easily one of the most replayable AC titles.\n\n🚬 [b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Victorian London, baby. The setting absolutely slaps. London is huge, grimy, and bursting with atmosphere. Smog-filled skies, clanking trains, carriages rattling through cobblestone streets—it nails that Industrial Revolution vibe. You can practically smell the soot and tea. I also liked how the world is divided into districts. You have the poor people slums, but you also have the rich palace, the wide gardens, and the cramped industrial factories. The way class disparity is shown through architecture and NPC behavior is so well done. There's also the river Thames, where you can cross without touching the water due to the moving boats. That was a nice touch. \n\n[*]Combat feels fun. The brawling-focused system fits London’s rough-and-tumble aesthetic perfectly. You’re not fencing anymore: you’re street fighting. Kunais, brass knuckles, cane swords gives you a lot of creativity if you want to stun your opponent or just kill them straight away. There's a lot of side gadgets you can use: throwing knives, smoke bombs, shock bombs, guns, etc. There's a lot of great combat animations too, depending on your weapon.\n\n[*]Rope launcher/grappling hook = actual godsend. Scaling buildings in seconds instead of awkwardly free-climbing brick walls for three minutes? Revolutionary. Every AC after this should include it.\n\n[*]New mechanics, like gang wars and territory takeovers. While it may get tiring, recruiting the Rooks and reclaiming the city from Templars scratches that perfect open world itch. It’s satisfying to slowly turn the map your color. The Rooks are also a new mechanic. You can upgrade and recruit Rooks, which are like your own soldiers, who can distract your enemies and also fight. You can also upgrade your income from the activities as well as your gear. So lots to do!\n\n[*]Strong writing and humor. The Frye twins’ banter is charming without being forced, and the historical cameos (Darwin! Dickens! Queen freakin’ Victoria!) feel fun rather than gimmicky. The dialogue is super sharp and feels natural. Side quests have that airy, posh \"I am richer than you\" London accent. During missions, I stopped before the objective to let the characters talk.\n\n[*] Great protagonists. Usually, the protagonists are usually bland, do good types. But Jacob Frye is a pure rogue: handsome, charming, yet has a heart of gold. And Evie Frye supremacy <3 Evie’s stealth gameplay, calm intelligence, and overall queen energy made her one of my favorite protagonists in the series. Jacob’s chaotic himbo energy is fun too, but Evie’s the heart of the game. I wish she had more missions! I liked their sibling bond, which was realistic. They argue but clearly love each other. I wish we got to see more of their childhood.\n\n[*] Music and atmosphere. The soundtrack adds this moody, orchestral flair that captures both the grit and grandeur of London. Perfect for late-night stealth missions.\n[/list]\n\n⚙️[b] Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]The open-world formula shows its seams. Even though[i] Syndicate[/i] polishes the Ubisoft formula, you still feel the “checklist fatigue” at times. Too many chests, Helix Glitches, and copy-paste activities.\n\n[*] Movement isn't 100% perfect. It's hard to explain, but I felt a lot of \"Yes, go jump off the roof without me telling you!\" or \"No, don't drop down that much!\" Also, you can't manually aim the grappling hook, which is a bummer. It's unclear which ledge you can attach to from time to time.\n\n[*] Still quite a lot of escort/tail/fetch quests! More creativity would be appreciated. \n\n[*] Story pacing stumbles a bit. The main plot’s decent, but the sibling dynamic, fun side quests, and the London setting often outshine the actual Templar conflict, which feels kind of ... background noise-y. It's the same old, same old \"kill the bad Templar who wants to use their bad powers for bad!\"\n\n[*]Underutilized side characters. There’s so much potential with figures like Alexander Graham Bell, Queen Victoria, or Henry Green, but they don’t get enough time to shine.\n\n[*] 100%-ing the game is a PITA. I was going to try, but I got too burnt out.\n\n[*] No modern-day story worth caring about. I know this era of AC tried to move away from Desmond’s arc, but man … the modern storyline here feels like an afterthought. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't memorable either.\n[/list]\n\n[hr]\nIf you enjoyed this review, please check out my curator page to find more: [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45814768-Verdict-Play-or-Pass/]Verdict: Play or Pass.

      "review": "[h1]Assassin’s Creed Syndicate Review[/h1]\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Overview[/h1]\nSyndicate is not the most beloved entry in the series, but it has real charm. London looks and feels great, traversal is fast once the rope launcher clicks, and the twin-protagonist structure adds personality. Combat and some loop design are pretty basic, and it can feel less “Assassin Creed-y” because of the gang focus, yet it is still a fun, different spin that I would recommend.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]What It Is[/h1]\nSet in 1868 during the Industrial Revolution, you play as twins Jacob and Evie Frye. The goal is to loosen Templar grip on London, building your gang The Rooks, and reclaiming districts through assassinations, takeovers, and story arcs tied to historical figures.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]World[/h1]\nVictorian London is the star. Districts feel distinct, streets are busy, landmarks are climbable, and the art team sells the period really well. You also get a moving train hideout that circles the map, plus a short optional World War I rift later on. Ubisoft’s world building really lands here.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Movement and Tools[/h1]\nParkour up and down from Unity returns, then the rope launcher changes everything. You can zip straight up facades or cast a line between rooftops to cross wide streets, which keeps flow high in a city with big avenues. Horse-drawn carriages are drivable and useful for quick escapes.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Combat and Stealth[/h1]\nFist-forward brawling with simple timing. Weapons include cane-sword, kukri, and brass knuckles. It works, but it is pretty bare bones and can get repetitive. Stealth fares better: throwing knives, smoke, hallucinogenic darts, multi-target assassinations, and clear enemy vision cones make sneaking the more interesting path.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Mission Design and Structure[/h1]\nBlack Box style assassinations give you multiple ways in, while district activities fill the map: gang strongholds, bounty hunts, child-labor liberations, Templar hunts, and collectibles. Taking territory to shift control to The Rooks is the loop, and it fits the setting even if it pushes the Creed angle into the background.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Characters[/h1]\nJacob is cheeky chaos, Evie is precise and methodical. You can swap between them in free roam, and certain missions are character-locked. They are likable and carry scenes well, even if they do not evolve much across the story. Supporting cast is solid, and the “historical guest star” moments are fun.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]What Works[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Lively, good-looking London with strong landmark density\n[*] Rope launcher makes urban traversal fast and satisfying\n[*] Stealth toolkit is the better half of the design\n[*] Twin leads with different vibes keep the tone light\n[*] Train hideout and territory system add identity\n[/list]\n\n[hr]\n[h1]What Falls Short[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Brawling is basic and gets samey in longer sessions\n[*] Gang takeover loop can feel like checklist clearing\n[*] Story ties to the Creed feel thin compared to older entries\n[/list]\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nThumbs up. Not a classic, but a genuinely fun, stylish London adventure. If you want a beautiful city to free-run through, snappy stealth, and a different flavor for the series, Syndicate delivers. If you want deep combat or a heavy Creed focus, temper expectations.",

The story was really enjoyable, and London looks absolutely gorgeous – the fog, the rain, the golden leaves, the lanterns, and that atmosphere. It feels so alive, melancholic, and beautiful at the same time. Stealth works well, combat feels satisfying, and the parkour is smooth. I preferred playing as Jacob, but both twins have their own charm.\nAs a fan of this series, I definitely recommend Syndicate.❤️\nEven the Jack the Ripper DLC was dark and interesting.",

      "review": "i had a lot of fun with this one. sometimes two-character games make the abilities available to each very divergent, which can be frustrating if for example you think stealth is boring and are forced to play as someone who dies in a couple of hits. asscreed syndicate has the sense to make one character a bit better at beating people up, and one character a bit better at stalking in the shadows, but both are at least competent at the other's specialty. this heads off any feelings of \"oh god, not this one again\" that otherwise could have developed. smart!\n\ni don't play video games for the story because usually game writing belongs in a dumpster. while i wouldn't say this is an exception, as such, it's all charming in a pulpy, heisty way. evie is a cold, precise archetypal assassin who thinks and plans. jacob acts as a sort of metatextual player insert who at best [i]kind of[/i] understands what's going on, and otherwise seems to be content to enjoy life as a murderous buildering acrobat. the present-day story as usual wobbles back and forth between incomprehensible and very stupid. thankfully it doesn't show up especially often. you also get to hang out with karl marx so if you're the type whose blood pressure spikes when you hear the word \"communism\" you should buy and play the game until your head explodes in fury, you weird loser. lmao.\n\nthe graphics are great. i've only ever been to london once for a couple of days but i recognized many of the landmarks on sight, which was neat. i'm a bit less thrilled with the combat and climbing animations. early asscreed games have stiff fighting with lots of drawn-out animations, with the result that while it's not necessarily very engaging it's cool to watch a guy tear through a crowd like a mower through thick brush. syndicate, by contrast, has very snappy-feeling combat in a bad way. it's jerky and looks pretty stupid most of the time. i did like how depending on where an enemy is standing when you initiate a kill you get context-specific finishers against railings or walls or what have you. climbing, similarly, looks very, very stupid now, as almost every single movement up or down results in the twins going airborne (a dynamic move, this is called in the actual sport). it sucks! it looks ridiculous!\n\nit looks good, plays pretty dang well, and has the decency not to waste a ton of your time on narrative. it certainly feels different from prior games in the series, mostly in positive ways. this is a very good entry.\n\nedit to add: played entirely on a bazzite desktop. i experienced some crashes in the WWI part of the game whenever it tried to show me cutscenes of an alien lady on london bridge. this can be fixed by skipping those cutscenes which is usually good advice for any cutscene in any game, really",

      "review": "Parkour and combat similar if not the same as Unity (which I haven't played yet). There is a semi-RPG system in that just gives better and better gears. The world is littered with collectibles as always, which is fine. But what isn't fine is you can't buy Helix Glitch map with ingame currency but need PREMIUM CURRENCY to have them show up on your world map but it doesn't show up in WW1 world map. Also no Treasure chest map for WW1 ingame. The parkour is very janky with its Climb up and Climb down system, making you climb onto things you don't want to, getting detected, and when you just want to just JUMP DOWN WITHOUT GRABBING ONTO EVERYTHING. I personally like the parkour system in the AC2-AC4. There are perks which give a slight boost and have conditions to them like kill 4 enemies in 12 seconds. I hate the perk system but thankfully isn't required for 100%. You'll be using your grappling hook/zipline a lot like you're in one of the Batman Arkham games. Combat is still simplistic and easy as always. But the movements feels so slippery, heavy, and stiff, causing stealth to suffer.\n\nOver all, 8/10. It feels like GTA and/or Sleeping Dogs but you can climb tall buildings and parkour better. Also, there is that ONE Helix Glitch in WW1 map under the bridge that you have to be very precise when doing a zipline Leap of Faith. Fk whoever thought that was a good idea.",

      "review": "Reviewing (mostly) every game (or DLC) in my library, part 472:\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️☆ (9/10)\n\nNot to be a Ubisoft shill or anything, but man, Ubisoft games are great when you don't have someone in your ear telling you constantly how bland their games are. It's strange to call a main-line [i]Assassin's Creed[/i] game underrated, especially one with 30,000 reviews, but I feel like no one talks about [i]Syndicate[/i] which is a shame! [i]Syndicate[/i] is one of the most stylish, confident, and straight-up fun entries in the franchise. It remains dedicated to London and the francise's roots, packed with surprisingly sharp writing and memorable characters. Evie and Jacob’s dual approach—brains and brawn—keeps gameplay fresh while being great protagonists, and the setting is alive and beautiful as ever. Sure, it’s not perfect, but between the slick parkour, Victorian chaos, and an iconic train hideout, it’s easily one of the most replayable AC titles.\n\n🚬 [b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Victorian London, baby. The setting absolutely slaps. London is huge, grimy, and bursting with atmosphere. Smog-filled skies, clanking trains, carriages rattling through cobblestone streets—it nails that Industrial Revolution vibe. You can practically smell the soot and tea. I also liked how the world is divided into districts. You have the poor people slums, but you also have the rich palace, the wide gardens, and the cramped industrial factories. The way class disparity is shown through architecture and NPC behavior is so well done. There's also the river Thames, where you can cross without touching the water due to the moving boats. That was a nice touch. \n\n[*]Combat feels fun. The brawling-focused system fits London’s rough-and-tumble aesthetic perfectly. You’re not fencing anymore: you’re street fighting. Kunais, brass knuckles, cane swords gives you a lot of creativity if you want to stun your opponent or just kill them straight away. There's a lot of side gadgets you can use: throwing knives, smoke bombs, shock bombs, guns, etc. There's a lot of great combat animations too, depending on your weapon.\n\n[*]Rope launcher/grappling hook = actual godsend. Scaling buildings in seconds instead of awkwardly free-climbing brick walls for three minutes? Revolutionary. Every AC after this should include it.\n\n[*]New mechanics, like gang wars and territory takeovers. While it may get tiring, recruiting the Rooks and reclaiming the city from Templars scratches that perfect open world itch. It’s satisfying to slowly turn the map your color. The Rooks are also a new mechanic. You can upgrade and recruit Rooks, which are like your own soldiers, who can distract your enemies and also fight. You can also upgrade your income from the activities as well as your gear. So lots to do!\n\n[*]Strong writing and humor. The Frye twins’ banter is charming without being forced, and the historical cameos (Darwin! Dickens! Queen freakin’ Victoria!) feel fun rather than gimmicky. The dialogue is super sharp and feels natural. Side quests have that airy, posh \"I am richer than you\" London accent. During missions, I stopped before the objective to let the characters talk.\n\n[*] Great protagonists. Usually, the protagonists are usually bland, do good types. But Jacob Frye is a pure rogue: handsome, charming, yet has a heart of gold. And Evie Frye supremacy <3 Evie’s stealth gameplay, calm intelligence, and overall queen energy made her one of my favorite protagonists in the series. Jacob’s chaotic himbo energy is fun too, but Evie’s the heart of the game. I wish she had more missions! I liked their sibling bond, which was realistic. They argue but clearly love each other. I wish we got to see more of their childhood.\n\n[*] Music and atmosphere. The soundtrack adds this moody, orchestral flair that captures both the grit and grandeur of London. Perfect for late-night stealth missions.\n[/list]\n\n⚙️[b] Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]The open-world formula shows its seams. Even though[i] Syndicate[/i] polishes the Ubisoft formula, you still feel the “checklist fatigue” at times. Too many chests, Helix Glitches, and copy-paste activities.\n\n[*] Movement isn't 100% perfect. It's hard to explain, but I felt a lot of \"Yes, go jump off the roof without me telling you!\" or \"No, don't drop down that much!\" Also, you can't manually aim the grappling hook, which is a bummer. It's unclear which ledge you can attach to from time to time.\n\n[*] Still quite a lot of escort/tail/fetch quests! More creativity would be appreciated. \n\n[*] Story pacing stumbles a bit. The main plot’s decent, but the sibling dynamic, fun side quests, and the London setting often outshine the actual Templar conflict, which feels kind of ... background noise-y. It's the same old, same old \"kill the bad Templar who wants to use their bad powers for bad!\"\n\n[*]Underutilized side characters. There’s so much potential with figures like Alexander Graham Bell, Queen Victoria, or Henry Green, but they don’t get enough time to shine.\n\n[*] 100%-ing the game is a PITA. I was going to try, but I got too burnt out.\n\n[*] No modern-day story worth caring about. I know this era of AC tried to move away from Desmond’s arc, but man … the modern storyline here feels like an afterthought. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't memorable either.\n[/list]\n\n[hr]\nIf you enjoyed this review, please check out my curator page to find more: [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45814768-Verdict-Play-or-Pass/]Verdict: Play or Pass.

      "review": "Assassin’s Creed Syndicate is a criminally underrated gem in the series — stylish, story-driven, and surprisingly full of charm.\r\n\r\nYou play as Jacob and Evie Frye, a sibling duo with wildly different approaches: Jacob punches his way through problems like a Victorian brawler, while Evie prefers brains, stealth, and actual strategy. Their banter, chemistry, and emotional growth are the heart of this game, and they carry the story far better than some past AC leads (looking at you, Unity).\r\n\r\nThe setting? Absolutely gorgeous. Victorian London is dripping with atmosphere — from the smoky factories and crowded streets to historical cameos like Charles Dickens, Karl Marx, and Alexander Graham Bell. You’ll be zipping across rooftops with your rope launcher one minute, and fist-fighting gang leaders in grimy alleys the next.\r\n\r\nHumorous highlight:\r\nYes, you can throw enemies off trains, ride carriages like you're in Fast & Furious: 1868, and then politely talk to Charles Darwin about science. It’s chaotic in the best way. 10/10 would leap off Big Ben again, top hat and all.\r\n\r\nNow, the criticism:\r\nThis is still built on the older AC engine, so you’ll run into some janky combat, occasionally dumb AI, and the usual Ubisoft bloat with side content. The fighting is flashy but shallow, and stealth can feel a bit too forgiving. If you’re used to the newer RPG-heavy AC titles (Origins, Odyssey, Valhalla), this might feel more compact and less open-ended — but that’s not necessarily a bad thing.\r\n\r\nFinal verdict:\r\nIf you're in it for a strong story, memorable characters, and a beautifully realized historical setting, Assassin’s Creed Syndicate delivers. It’s not perfect, but it’s stylish, heartfelt, and honestly a refreshing reminder of what made the classic AC formula great.\r\n\r\nSyndicate didn’t get the love it deserved — and if you’ve slept on it, now’s the time to fix that.",

      "review": "[h1]Assassin’s Creed Syndicate Review[/h1]\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Overview[/h1]\nSyndicate is not the most beloved entry in the series, but it has real charm. London looks and feels great, traversal is fast once the rope launcher clicks, and the twin-protagonist structure adds personality. Combat and some loop design are pretty basic, and it can feel less “Assassin Creed-y” because of the gang focus, yet it is still a fun, different spin that I would recommend.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]What It Is[/h1]\nSet in 1868 during the Industrial Revolution, you play as twins Jacob and Evie Frye. The goal is to loosen Templar grip on London, building your gang The Rooks, and reclaiming districts through assassinations, takeovers, and story arcs tied to historical figures.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]World[/h1]\nVictorian London is the star. Districts feel distinct, streets are busy, landmarks are climbable, and the art team sells the period really well. You also get a moving train hideout that circles the map, plus a short optional World War I rift later on. Ubisoft’s world building really lands here.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Movement and Tools[/h1]\nParkour up and down from Unity returns, then the rope launcher changes everything. You can zip straight up facades or cast a line between rooftops to cross wide streets, which keeps flow high in a city with big avenues. Horse-drawn carriages are drivable and useful for quick escapes.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Combat and Stealth[/h1]\nFist-forward brawling with simple timing. Weapons include cane-sword, kukri, and brass knuckles. It works, but it is pretty bare bones and can get repetitive. Stealth fares better: throwing knives, smoke, hallucinogenic darts, multi-target assassinations, and clear enemy vision cones make sneaking the more interesting path.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Mission Design and Structure[/h1]\nBlack Box style assassinations give you multiple ways in, while district activities fill the map: gang strongholds, bounty hunts, child-labor liberations, Templar hunts, and collectibles. Taking territory to shift control to The Rooks is the loop, and it fits the setting even if it pushes the Creed angle into the background.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Characters[/h1]\nJacob is cheeky chaos, Evie is precise and methodical. You can swap between them in free roam, and certain missions are character-locked. They are likable and carry scenes well, even if they do not evolve much across the story. Supporting cast is solid, and the “historical guest star” moments are fun.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]What Works[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Lively, good-looking London with strong landmark density\n[*] Rope launcher makes urban traversal fast and satisfying\n[*] Stealth toolkit is the better half of the design\n[*] Twin leads with different vibes keep the tone light\n[*] Train hideout and territory system add identity\n[/list]\n\n[hr]\n[h1]What Falls Short[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Brawling is basic and gets samey in longer sessions\n[*] Gang takeover loop can feel like checklist clearing\n[*] Story ties to the Creed feel thin compared to older entries\n[/list]\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nThumbs up. Not a classic, but a genuinely fun, stylish London adventure. If you want a beautiful city to free-run through, snappy stealth, and a different flavor for the series, Syndicate delivers. If you want deep combat or a heavy Creed focus, temper expectations.",

      "review": "i had a lot of fun with this one. sometimes two-character games make the abilities available to each very divergent, which can be frustrating if for example you think stealth is boring and are forced to play as someone who dies in a couple of hits. asscreed syndicate has the sense to make one character a bit better at beating people up, and one character a bit better at stalking in the shadows, but both are at least competent at the other's specialty. this heads off any feelings of \"oh god, not this one again\" that otherwise could have developed. smart!\n\ni don't play video games for the story because usually game writing belongs in a dumpster. while i wouldn't say this is an exception, as such, it's all charming in a pulpy, heisty way. evie is a cold, precise archetypal assassin who thinks and plans. jacob acts as a sort of metatextual player insert who at best [i]kind of[/i] understands what's going on, and otherwise seems to be content to enjoy life as a murderous buildering acrobat. the present-day story as usual wobbles back and forth between incomprehensible and very stupid. thankfully it doesn't show up especially often. you also get to hang out with karl marx so if you're the type whose blood pressure spikes when you hear the word \"communism\" you should buy and play the game until your head explodes in fury, you weird loser. lmao.\n\nthe graphics are great. i've only ever been to london once for a couple of days but i recognized many of the landmarks on sight, which was neat. i'm a bit less thrilled with the combat and climbing animations. early asscreed games have stiff fighting with lots of drawn-out animations, with the result that while it's not necessarily very engaging it's cool to watch a guy tear through a crowd like a mower through thick brush. syndicate, by contrast, has very snappy-feeling combat in a bad way. it's jerky and looks pretty stupid most of the time. i did like how depending on where an enemy is standing when you initiate a kill you get context-specific finishers against railings or walls or what have you. climbing, similarly, looks very, very stupid now, as almost every single movement up or down results in the twins going airborne (a dynamic move, this is called in the actual sport). it sucks! it looks ridiculous!\n\nit looks good, plays pretty dang well, and has the decency not to waste a ton of your time on narrative. it certainly feels different from prior games in the series, mostly in positive ways. this is a very good entry.\n\nedit to add: played entirely on a bazzite desktop. i experienced some crashes in the WWI part of the game whenever it tried to show me cutscenes of an alien lady on london bridge. this can be fixed by skipping those cutscenes which is usually good advice for any cutscene in any game, really",

Following the formulas laid out in AC Brotherhood, it focuses on liberating districts of the city from Templar control, recruiting locals to fight alongside you, and completing unique and interesting missions for historical figures. \r\n\r\nThe city of London is recreated beautifully in this game, and though the rooftops are quite far apart, the hidden blade grappling attachment is a welcome addition to this game in particular, and feels somewhat like Spiderman PS4 in the ways you can grapple between objects and drop down on enemies.\r\n\r\nJacob and Evie are the Frye twins and the dual protagonists of this game, and serve different roles in the story, with Jacob being a headstrong brawler and Evie being a calculative stealthy strategist. Jacob takes the spotlight more often than not, as the AC fandom has a large male fanbase, and Ubisoft likely wanted to pander to them. My largest complaint for the game would definitely have to be that Evie does not get nearly enough time to shine, and seems somewhat relegated to side missions.\r\n\r\nThe combat feels weighty but also can take awhile to whittle down the enemy health bars, so if you're a fan of AC Odyssey, then this shouldn't be too much of an issue, especially once you've leveled up your combat skills. I had fun playing the combat, and truly felt like even if I was underleveled, with good timing I could still come out on top if I played my cards right.\r\n\r\nThe story is not too deep, but serves its purpose well, and the villains, while somewhat cartoony, are menacing in their own right and feel like serious threats in certain brutal scenes, like the test subject in the insane asylum scene and the Starrick piano scene.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack is top notch, though it does feel very different from any other AC game, as it is focused on a very classical british vibe with violins and piano and stuff.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it's a great time, especially for fans of AC Brotherhood's single-city-takeover vibes, and I would definitely recommend it.",

      "review": "Until there's a mixed option for reviews, I'll lean positive in this one because I had more tolerance than outright rage or boredom. (tl,dr: 5/10. Buggy and repetitive. Some fun to be had, when it works. Pretty average overall.)\n\nGraphics and music are decent. LOTS of bugs throughout, ranging from silly (flying/crashing carriages, floating characters, jittery models, missing characters in cutscenes) to game-breaking (freezing on startup, one mission refusing to progress if v-sync is turned off, quest carriages running away before you can get to them, at least a few crashes, etc.)\n\nGrappling hook is cool, making for some quick escapes when necessary. Though, there's no interrupting it once you start. So, if you accidentally grapple to the wrong point or on a VERY high building, there's nothing you can do. Parkour is and has always been janky in this series. Free running is cool when it works, and has you going opposite and physically impossible directions when it doesn't.\n\nCombat is a mixed bag. Fight clubs are fun, but way too easy and repetitive. Base moves work well enough, and multi-kills are satisfying to pull off. Though, it's very finicky on getting them to even trigger despite being surrounded by weakened enemies. At higher levels, gunshots will cut your health down 2/3 of the way regardless of equipment or skills. Which would be fine if the \"F to dodge\" actually worked every time like the standard counter does. Sometimes you dodge and other times you shoot or throw tools at a completely different enemy and still take the hit.\n\nRan into a lot of problems when nearly every interaction uses the \"E\" key. This includes speak, hijack, kidnap, knock out, loot, pick up body, pick up crate, ignite, examine/inspect, counter-attack, and climb down. That is simply too many overlapping scenarios for one fucking keystroke, even if you have to hold for some of them.\n\nStealth and exploration is definitely the strongest aspect. Lots of tools you can use and lots of stealth kill setups in such open-ended environments with plenty of ways to go about encounters. Some fun collectibles (flowers, beers, music boxes, historical posters/illustrations) and a LOT of tedious ones (chests and helix glitches). There are literally HUNDREDS of the latter kind.\n\nStory is serviceable enough. Too many Jacob missions, especially with at least 5 or 6 in a row at one point. And very annoying when they give him more complex stealth missions when Evie is much better suited for those. Sequence 7 could've been cut out entirely. Sequence 8 was peak thanks to Maxwell Roth. Some historical character interactions felt fine while others were contrived and goofy. Conquering boroughs is satisfying enough, but it gets EXTREMELY repetitive.\n\nCarriages are fun enough to drive. Especially with cargo hijacks and escorts. Though, a lot of chases lead to standstills where everyone just sits there and shoots at each other. Which, again, would be fine except you cannot dodge shots while driving. You can shoot back, but otherwise you will just keep taking hits from very long distances. Exotic races are fun, like racing a train or going for a lap record. But street races are bullshit. Every carriage drives at the same speed (ALL using boosts) through narrow streets and ramming them often does basically nothing.\n\nWorld War I sequence was kinda cool. One free bonus borough to conquer for Winston Churchill in 1916. Some decent additions like AA plane raids, generator distractions, and spotlights with snipers. Sci-fi future lore was unnecessary. Finished before overstaying its welcome.\n\n5/10 With a lot of little design changes and bug fixes, this could be a pretty solid entry in the series. But until then, I can only recommend this for one full playthrough if you haven't tried it yet. Especially if you're already a fan of the series. And especially if it's on sale. Do NOT pay full price for this.",

The is better parkour mechanics than Unity, but the crowd density isn't as much as it was before, which may make it difficult for blending in the crowd and assassinate. A new form of moving around has been introduced here with the rope, which is fun and kinda makes you feel like the Batman. There are 2 characters here, Jacob and Evie, twins with contrasting personality. Cant comment of the character progression, as of writing this review, i have played it for 5 hours and I cant talk about the story yet. Hopefully they are going to be good! The game is set in Victorian London and the map looks beautiful just as Paris looked in Unity. \r\nI am gonna have fun with this for a little longer and will update my review if there is anything worth mentioning apart from whats already written!",

      "review": "First playthrough review time.\n\nAssassin’s Creed Syndicate is an action-adventure game released in 2015 by Ubisoft. It is set in a large, open-world city where players can move freely and complete different missions. The game continues the main ideas of the series but adds a few new features that make movement and exploring faster. Players can switch between two main characters during the story, which gives some variety to how each mission can be done.\n\nThe graphics are very well done, with detailed environments and smooth animations. The city setting is full of life and looks impressive, especially on higher settings. Voice acting is strong, matching the setting well, and the performance is stable throughout. The game runs smoothly with almost no loading times, and using a keyboard and mouse works very well with the way the game is designed. Technically, the game feels polished and complete. \n\nI bought the Gold Edition, which includes the base game along with extra content through the Season Pass. This version adds more missions, outfits, weapons, gear, bonus in-game currency, and a small XP boost. I tried to play this game on an older Dell Inspiron 15 laptop back in 2016. It had an i5-6200U processor with Radeon R5 M335 2GB graphics chip. The game ran at extremely low FPS even on the lowest settings, so I ended up uninstalling it.\n\nI personally felt that the Jack the Ripper DLC story was interesting than the base game. It reminded me of Sherlock Holmes: Jack the Ripper, which I played in 2024. Both games share a similar dark tone and setting, making the DLC feel even more engaging.\n\nIn conclusion, this is one of the stronger entries in the series, with a good mix of story and side content. Like AC Unity, there is still plenty to do after finishing the main story, with many optional activities spread across the map. The strong visuals, smooth performance, and overall presentation make it a well-made title for those who like adventure games set in rich, detailed worlds. This is also the only Assassin’s Creed game that feels closest to the modern world in terms of setting and atmosphere.",

      "review": "★ Story & Narrative – 5/10\n\nDespite having such an interesting premise, the main Sequence Memories themselves were underwhelming and are arguably one of the weaker stories in the franchise. Even as a tale about overthrowing a criminal organization and their schemes, the game takes a light-hearted approach on its storytelling, filling the journeys of our protagonists Jacob and Evie Frye with comedic bits and fun hijinks, shying away from covering a more gruesome and darker side of London. However, not all is lost in this category, as a series of side missions known as the London Stories supplement this need, taking us to day-to-day adventures of both thrills and fears featuring historical icons like Charles Darwin, Arthur Dorian Dyle, and Alexander Graham Bell. Nevertheless, the story of Syndicate still makes for a satisfying experience, it just falls short compared to older titles.\n\n★ Gameplay & Mechanics – 8/10\n\nSyndicate changed the classic system to be more streamlined, simplifying mechanics while making way for more imaginative opportunities. The game has a plethora of ways players can interact with a mission, emphasizing strategy and rewarding creative clears.\n\nThe game introduces a familiar leveling system inspired from modern RPG games that grant them access to more abilities, exclusive skills, and equipment with every level progression. There are 9 distinct types of stealth assassinations with over 100 different variations, all ranging from weapons to angles. The combat mechanics also got revamped in this game, as Syndicate introduces an “Arkham-like” brawler system, incentivizing combo-hits and maximizing damage with finishers. Assisting both stealth and combat options are 5 different gadgets players can use. The game also has a dedicated “whistle” button, which attracts enemies to your location for a well-planned assassination.\n\nMuch of these changes scored positively with me, as I’ve always been a fan of the Arkham Combat System and have looked forward to see more games adapt their methods. The stealth in this game is also my favorite iteration of the system thus far, as many of the new features such as the kidnap assassinations feel smooth and intuitive. The game only offering 5 gadgets to play around with feels underwhelming considering past entries, but I can attest that each one of these tools function well within the world setting.\n\n★ Movement – 5/10\n\nSyndicate’s movement is subpar, and is an arguable downgrade from Unity’s for many reasons. While it feels more stable and realized, the system feels out of place because of the wide streets the tall buildings of London, making parkour feel tedious and time-consuming. It has its upsides in lesser developed areas, but in bigger and more established boroughs, parkour is often times the slowest option among other forms of movement.\n\nThe Grappling Hook is the supposed solution for the problem, as it provides players the option to traverse between buildings with deployable ziplines. While it feels intuitive, it also comes off as a lazy attempt to fix the issue, automating many traversal mechanics and interrupting the already subpar parkour flow.\n\nHorse Carriages are the third option for controllable movement in-game and is the fastest way to get around the city besides fast travel. This mechanic enables you to carry passengers, traverse great distances, and shoot at targets, all while steering your horse. Players can also go up to the carriage rooftop, where they can hop to other carriages or engage in combat.\n\n★ Side Content Missions and Collectibles – 5/10\n\nFor the main story, players can accomplish 6 different compilations of London Stories scattered across the map. These are a series of adventures with the associates we meet along the story. Each associate has about 8-10 missions to complete that contributes to the progression tracker.\n\nSimilarly, players can accomplish 5 compilations of Associate Activities, a series of side missions that are distributed across the many boroughs on the map. These activities feature bounty hunts, Templar assassinations, attacking gang strongholds, and liberating children-workers, with about 8-12 missions per activity.\n\nOutside of activities, players can collect 9 different types of Collectibles scattered across the map. These award the player with equipment, data logs, illustrations, and character biographies in the game.\n\nThe game also introduces players to the Assassin’s Creed: Syndicate WW1 storyline, accessible via a portal at the edge of the map. This new storyline is features a new map with 3 Associate Activities, a Collectible to complete, and a London Stories compilation featuring Winston Churchill, a historical figure who fought during WW1.\n\n★ Overall Rating – 7/10\n\nThis rating accounts the existing DLCs for the game, and reviews for them are indicated under their separate pages. Nevertheless, this was a fun game to fully perfect, and I'd still recommend others to play the game in its entirety, despite being a very underrated game.",

      "review": "As someone who considers themselves a fan of the AC series, having played AC1, 2, Brotherhood, Revalations, 3, Black Flag & Rogue countless times over the years, my disappointment with Syndicate is immeasurable. \n\nI always wanted to try this particular entry in the series out, but couldn't due to my low-end laptop. I've been waiting to play this game literally since it came out. And now that I got a steam deck, I finally decided to give it a shot. And my god it's horrid.\n\nThe gameplay? It's alright. I enjoy AC games for parkour, and there's plenty of it here, refined since previous games in some aspects, downgraded in others. The grappling hook is a tad silly, but it does make me feel cool traversing the rooftops of London, and that's all that matters.\n\nThe story though? Nonexistent. \n   Despite choosing one of the most intriguing and interesting settings imaginable, having a great set-up with all the historical figures present and the potential sibling dynamic, Ubisoft managed to conjure the most bland, uninspiring, nothingburger of a narrative the likes of which I haven't seen in a while. \n   There is NOTHING going on in this game. NOTHING. No exploring the relationship of Evie and Jacob, or Evie and Green, no character development on either of the Fryes' part, and the main villian? We see him a total of 8 times before the final mission, where you kill the guy in the most ridiculous and stupid fighting sequence ever known to man. \n   I MEAN FUCK, 4 OUT OF 9 STORY SEQUENCES START WITH JACOB GETTING A RANDOM FUCKING LETTER FROM *SOMEBODY* AND READING IT WITH FOOTAGE OF BIG BEN IN THE BACKGROUND. \"A letter, for me? Kill this guy in this place? Sure will!\". They even reused the voicelines for them, that's how little of a fuck they were giving\n   Throughout the game, you get missions to kill templars, you talk to occasional Charles Dickens once and never meet them again (and I know you're supposed to do the side-missions for that, but I would EXPECT the characters to reappear at least a COUPLE times), and you ride around London in various carriages. That is It. Despite finishing the game a mere minutes ago, I already forgot all of it. \n   The only mildly amusing part of this entire game was Sequence 8, specifically Maxwell Roth (my psychotic bisexual king love him)\n\nThe \"present time\" interludes are, as the rest of the game, unimportant and forgettable. An enormous step-back, not even from the Desmond sequences in 1/2/3, but from the first-person walking-arounds in Black Flag. I don't care about them. There is no reason to.\n\nI can't even compare this game to previous ones.\n\nI am genuinely upset with this game. I wanted it to be good, I gave it the benefit of the doubt until the very last cutscene, but I got nothing in return. Fuck off\nI'll probably rewrite this review once I stop seething. Or perhaps not.\n\nIf you want good AC experience, go play the Ezio trilogy, or the Black Flag.",

It gives me reference about using an activation/CD Key. There is no CD Key.

Jacob, a rough-edged hoodlum who looks much like Hugh Jackman in his prime form, and his sly and empathic sister Evie, supposedly the best female assassin character in the entire series. What's not to like?\n\nThe Thames, overflooded with barges, is a brilliant piece of design — one of the best river environments ever created  for open-world city-based games. The entire London map, from palaces and cathedrals to slums and underground tunnels, is actually a nice place to walk by, to run through like we used to, from the first Assassin's Creed, and to fly upon, with the help of that fantastic rope launcher, that makes you feel almost like Spider-Man. Also, the antagonist, Crawford Starrick, is portrayed as a solid, proper lawful evil main character. He and some of his associates are at least somewhat more interesting to challenge than the usual villains you forget even before you turn over the page with their names.\n\nThe side quests feature encounters with Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, Alexander Graham Bell, and some more interesting historical figures. If you’re willing to pay extra (yes, even on top of the supposedly “complete” Gold Edition), Arthur Conan Doyle himself will be the honoured guest and companion! Many missions are inspired by the detective stories, letting you play the role of Mr. Sherlock for a good third — maybe even half — of the game’s runtime! Again, what's not to like?\n\nWell, for starters, it is the optimisation. Yeah, Ubisoft conveyor, after they pushed out Patrice Désilets, hasn’t  been known for bug-free products. I still remember the memes about Black Flag and AC Unity launch game conditions. I've pre-ordered Watch Dogs and couldn’t play it properly for almost a year after release… all thanks to “optimisation.” However, here we have a supposedly AAA-class game, which was advertised literally everywhere, including all the promo stands and bus side covers in my city. The game that has never dropped below $5, nine years after release, and I repeat, even with the Gold version, some DLC still require an extra purchase! And yet, even now some quests (needed for 100% achievements badge) can't be finished properly, without at least several attempts to find the condition in which the game proceeds like supposed to, and not 'losing synchronisation', due to broken scripts. That issue is especially bad in the Jack the Ripper DLC side quests, but it is presented in many quests of the major campaign as well. \n\nSome quests and game conceptions, like the whole story with carriages, by which this game had a moniker 'Grand Theft Cart' in some reviews, are made very subpar. Also, guess the rarest game achievement, by the way? Yeah, it's 'Without a Grudge', ultimately annoying task to drive those carriages recklessly, for a long time, without any reason but the achievement to do so. \n\nMoreover, some quests and story twists, are made in the way, which leaves me extremely dissatisfied with how the devs, especially story writers, twist the basic historical logic. Even if the Creed-Order crypto history conflict is not related to the events, even if it is strictly gameplay thing, it feels Soooo weak and stupid, that I simply can't get, for which audience was that all made.\n\n[b][i]So, three things: bugs, dubious story collisions, that insults my mind, and also stupid gameplay decisions that made not to interest the player, make him think or explore the history, or tease him with the challenge of some sort, but rather to prolong a gameplay time with the all too boring things.[/i][/b]\n\nSurely, I've enjoyed the sights of London, the development of main story characters, the moving train hub, and some of the game challenges. Even the turf wars and the most part of game collectables searching weren't that bad. The battle system, while made some steps down from the previous games, still felt good enough, and fitted the setting. But on the road to the game completion, weighing down good and bad moments, I can only regret how the bads overcome the good impressions. The bads, major part of which coming from the poor beta-testing and could, at least in theory, have been fixed in the development process. \n\n[b][i]My mark for AC Syndicate is 6.2/10. Not a bad game, probably, and certainly not the worst in the Assassin's Creed line, but after the nice story with altered Liberty War in Assassin's Creed III, this one, even with all those cultural references, left me seriously vexed. Thus, if you haven't played Syndicate yet, I can't recommend it to you for anything but the brief 1-2 hours roof running tour. Ubisoft spoiled this one too.[/i][/b]",

      "review": "As someone who considers themselves a fan of the AC series, having played AC1, 2, Brotherhood, Revalations, 3, Black Flag & Rogue countless times over the years, my disappointment with Syndicate is immeasurable. \n\nI always wanted to try this particular entry in the series out, but couldn't due to my low-end laptop. I've been waiting to play this game literally since it came out. And now that I got a steam deck, I finally decided to give it a shot. And my god it's horrid.\n\nThe gameplay? It's alright. I enjoy AC games for parkour, and there's plenty of it here, refined since previous games in some aspects, downgraded in others. The grappling hook is a tad silly, but it does make me feel cool traversing the rooftops of London, and that's all that matters.\n\nThe story though? Nonexistent. \n   Despite choosing one of the most intriguing and interesting settings imaginable, having a great set-up with all the historical figures present and the potential sibling dynamic, Ubisoft managed to conjure the most bland, uninspiring, nothingburger of a narrative the likes of which I haven't seen in a while. \n   There is NOTHING going on in this game. NOTHING. No exploring the relationship of Evie and Jacob, or Evie and Green, no character development on either of the Fryes' part, and the main villian? We see him a total of 8 times before the final mission, where you kill the guy in the most ridiculous and stupid fighting sequence ever known to man. \n   I MEAN FUCK, 4 OUT OF 9 STORY SEQUENCES START WITH JACOB GETTING A RANDOM FUCKING LETTER FROM *SOMEBODY* AND READING IT WITH FOOTAGE OF BIG BEN IN THE BACKGROUND. \"A letter, for me? Kill this guy in this place? Sure will!\". They even reused the voicelines for them, that's how little of a fuck they were giving\n   Throughout the game, you get missions to kill templars, you talk to occasional Charles Dickens once and never meet them again (and I know you're supposed to do the side-missions for that, but I would EXPECT the characters to reappear at least a COUPLE times), and you ride around London in various carriages. That is It. Despite finishing the game a mere minutes ago, I already forgot all of it. \n   The only mildly amusing part of this entire game was Sequence 8, specifically Maxwell Roth (my psychotic bisexual king love him)\n\nThe \"present time\" interludes are, as the rest of the game, unimportant and forgettable. An enormous step-back, not even from the Desmond sequences in 1/2/3, but from the first-person walking-arounds in Black Flag. I don't care about them. There is no reason to.\n\nI can't even compare this game to previous ones.\n\nI am genuinely upset with this game. I wanted it to be good, I gave it the benefit of the doubt until the very last cutscene, but I got nothing in return. Fuck off\nI'll probably rewrite this review once I stop seething. Or perhaps not.\n\nIf you want good AC experience, go play the Ezio trilogy, or the Black Flag.",

What pissed me off is that cunt music when u grab those photo sounds to that secret vault for something. Dunno for what cuz didn't achieve it. Fck it! So fcking stupid when u fast travel it plays always and pissed u off, if u have managed to meet the vault and put some of em to it then it will play always. Music there is just a few good sounds but didn't catch it long for good. \r\nAmazingly, devastating and fabulous executions. There's just a few for which weapon of 3 kind but for the whole possibilities of doing them is just rough and beautiful. After some 22 hours I was getting bored by them but not only for that.\r\n\r\nEverything felt boring the side quests are much more better then the main game and it's so painful. \r\nThe most bullshit thing that make me ask myself why I love Ezio trilogy cuz for sure not of those cunt chests. This game should be called a walk simulator or travel simulator. There's over 400 more those fckers and it really felt wrong. I did like some half of it and it gives me better equipment upgrades etc. And economic system is much more valued and it's only upgrades. The good thing which this games does better than witcher 3 is suggesting you were to go after reaching some level. Even those fabulous executions will feel terrible horrifying and boring. So now I believe why there wasn't any shouts after this game release. And final part which gives me headache it's that u have a zipline like in a Batman Arkham game. Seriously who designed that? For what?! The last main good thing is that u may travel to world war 1 time and do some good things for your country. Fighting some naz... ehm Templars afterwards :P \r\n\r\nAnyways not worth it but if u are a fanboy just do it. Buy and complete. I will never ever come back to this!",

      "review": "A Polished Facade That Fails to Inspire\n\nAssassin’s Creed Syndicate had the potential to breathe new life into the series — a Victorian London setting, dual protagonists, and a promise of refined gameplay after the bloated Unity. At first glance, it delivers exactly that: a gorgeous city, smooth parkour, and improved performance. But the more time I spent with it, the more it felt like the same tired formula wearing a different hat.\n\nLondon itself is beautiful but empty. The city is huge, full of detail, but completely devoid of meaningful interaction. Most activities boil down to repetitive side missions — liberate this area, beat up those thugs, steal that carriage — repeated across dozens of districts until any sense of novelty is gone. It’s a map-clearing simulator dressed in top hats and cobblestone streets.\n\nThe combat, while flashy, is shallow. Enemies are brain-dead, fights are easy button-mashing affairs, and the supposed “stealth” mechanics still feel clumsy and inconsistent. The addition of the grappling hook should make traversal more dynamic, but instead it makes the world feel smaller, turning parkour into a point-and-click affair.\n\nThen there are the protagonists, Jacob and Evie Frye. While Evie is the more compelling of the two, the writing never gives either enough depth to make them memorable. The tone swings awkwardly between self-serious and goofy, undercutting the atmosphere the setting could have had. Historical figures like Charles Dickens and Alexander Graham Bell make appearances, but they’re reduced to quirky quest givers rather than interesting characters.\n\nPerformance-wise, it’s an improvement over Unity, but still far from perfect — stutters, physics glitches, and occasional crashes persist, especially on PC. Combine that with an endless checklist of uninspired content, and the experience starts to feel like a chore rather than an adventure.\n\nAssassin’s Creed Syndicate is not without charm — its setting and presentation are strong — but everything beneath that veneer feels hollow and uninspired. It’s a game that looks great on the surface but never captures the magic, mystery, or soul that once defined the series.",

And assassination missions are still in the style of unity which leads to so many frustrating situations (no you cannot escape now because the guards you're trying to escape from are still aggroed).\nEtc etc. \n\n So overall I'd say just don't bother man.

From AC3 the franchise is a trainwreck, making a big effort in totally depart from anything interesting of the previous games.\nThe USA sets where bland as butter, losing the conspirancy and mythic elements made the story aimless and introducing convoluted mechanics to distract from the main game just made everything messy and pointless.\n\nWhen I played Unity I hoped that at least, being Paris, we'd have back those cool moments visiting the monuments of Rome,  Florence or walking around  Venice, Everything looked worse than when we had less technology. This again, is a visually lackluster historic recreation, with bad illumination and little care in making real places interesting to navigate or spectacular at first contact. Historically is more fantasy than anything now, even without the conspiracy elements.

Yeah, it's 'Without a Grudge', ultimately annoying task to drive those carriages recklessly, for a long time, without any reason but the achievement to do so. \n\nMoreover, some quests and story twists, are made in the way, which leaves me extremely dissatisfied with how the devs, especially story writers, twist the basic historical logic. Even if the Creed-Order crypto history conflict is not related to the events, even if it is strictly gameplay thing, it feels Soooo weak and stupid, that I simply can't get, for which audience was that all made.\n\n[b][i]So, three things: bugs, dubious story collisions, that insults my mind, and also stupid gameplay decisions that made not to interest the player, make him think or explore the history, or tease him with the challenge of some sort, but rather to prolong a gameplay time with the all too boring things.[/i][/b]\n\nSurely, I've enjoyed the sights of London, the development of main story characters, the moving train hub, and some of the game challenges. Even the turf wars and the most part of game collectables searching weren't that bad. The battle system, while made some steps down from the previous games, still felt good enough, and fitted the setting. But on the road to the game completion, weighing down good and bad moments, I can only regret how the bads overcome the good impressions. The bads, major part of which coming from the poor beta-testing and could, at least in theory, have been fixed in the development process. \n\n[b][i]My mark for AC Syndicate is 6.2/10. Not a bad game, probably, and certainly not the worst in the Assassin's Creed line, but after the nice story with altered Liberty War in Assassin's Creed III, this one, even with all those cultural references, left me seriously vexed. Thus, if you haven't played Syndicate yet, I can't recommend it to you for anything but the brief 1-2 hours roof running tour. Ubisoft spoiled this one too.[/i][/b]",

      "review": "As someone who considers themselves a fan of the AC series, having played AC1, 2, Brotherhood, Revalations, 3, Black Flag & Rogue countless times over the years, my disappointment with Syndicate is immeasurable. \n\nI always wanted to try this particular entry in the series out, but couldn't due to my low-end laptop. I've been waiting to play this game literally since it came out. And now that I got a steam deck, I finally decided to give it a shot. And my god it's horrid.\n\nThe gameplay? It's alright. I enjoy AC games for parkour, and there's plenty of it here, refined since previous games in some aspects, downgraded in others. The grappling hook is a tad silly, but it does make me feel cool traversing the rooftops of London, and that's all that matters.\n\nThe story though? Nonexistent. \n   Despite choosing one of the most intriguing and interesting settings imaginable, having a great set-up with all the historical figures present and the potential sibling dynamic, Ubisoft managed to conjure the most bland, uninspiring, nothingburger of a narrative the likes of which I haven't seen in a while. \n   There is NOTHING going on in this game. NOTHING. No exploring the relationship of Evie and Jacob, or Evie and Green, no character development on either of the Fryes' part, and the main villian? We see him a total of 8 times before the final mission, where you kill the guy in the most ridiculous and stupid fighting sequence ever known to man. \n   I MEAN FUCK, 4 OUT OF 9 STORY SEQUENCES START WITH JACOB GETTING A RANDOM FUCKING LETTER FROM *SOMEBODY* AND READING IT WITH FOOTAGE OF BIG BEN IN THE BACKGROUND. \"A letter, for me? Kill this guy in this place? Sure will!\". They even reused the voicelines for them, that's how little of a fuck they were giving\n   Throughout the game, you get missions to kill templars, you talk to occasional Charles Dickens once and never meet them again (and I know you're supposed to do the side-missions for that, but I would EXPECT the characters to reappear at least a COUPLE times), and you ride around London in various carriages. That is It. Despite finishing the game a mere minutes ago, I already forgot all of it. \n   The only mildly amusing part of this entire game was Sequence 8, specifically Maxwell Roth (my psychotic bisexual king love him)\n\nThe \"present time\" interludes are, as the rest of the game, unimportant and forgettable. An enormous step-back, not even from the Desmond sequences in 1/2/3, but from the first-person walking-arounds in Black Flag. I don't care about them. There is no reason to.\n\nI can't even compare this game to previous ones.\n\nI am genuinely upset with this game. I wanted it to be good, I gave it the benefit of the doubt until the very last cutscene, but I got nothing in return. Fuck off\nI'll probably rewrite this review once I stop seething. Or perhaps not.\n\nIf you want good AC experience, go play the Ezio trilogy, or the Black Flag.",

What pissed me off is that cunt music when u grab those photo sounds to that secret vault for something. Dunno for what cuz didn't achieve it. Fck it! So fcking stupid when u fast travel it plays always and pissed u off, if u have managed to meet the vault and put some of em to it then it will play always. Music there is just a few good sounds but didn't catch it long for good. \r\nAmazingly, devastating and fabulous executions. There's just a few for which weapon of 3 kind but for the whole possibilities of doing them is just rough and beautiful. After some 22 hours I was getting bored by them but not only for that.\r\n\r\nEverything felt boring the side quests are much more better then the main game and it's so painful. \r\nThe most bullshit thing that make me ask myself why I love Ezio trilogy cuz for sure not of those cunt chests. This game should be called a walk simulator or travel simulator. There's over 400 more those fckers and it really felt wrong. I did like some half of it and it gives me better equipment upgrades etc. And economic system is much more valued and it's only upgrades. The good thing which this games does better than witcher 3 is suggesting you were to go after reaching some level. Even those fabulous executions will feel terrible horrifying and boring. So now I believe why there wasn't any shouts after this game release. And final part which gives me headache it's that u have a zipline like in a Batman Arkham game. Seriously who designed that? For what?! The last main good thing is that u may travel to world war 1 time and do some good things for your country. Fighting some naz... ehm Templars afterwards :P \r\n\r\nAnyways not worth it but if u are a fanboy just do it. Buy and complete. I will never ever come back to this!",

      "review": "A Polished Facade That Fails to Inspire\n\nAssassin’s Creed Syndicate had the potential to breathe new life into the series — a Victorian London setting, dual protagonists, and a promise of refined gameplay after the bloated Unity. At first glance, it delivers exactly that: a gorgeous city, smooth parkour, and improved performance. But the more time I spent with it, the more it felt like the same tired formula wearing a different hat.\n\nLondon itself is beautiful but empty. The city is huge, full of detail, but completely devoid of meaningful interaction. Most activities boil down to repetitive side missions — liberate this area, beat up those thugs, steal that carriage — repeated across dozens of districts until any sense of novelty is gone. It’s a map-clearing simulator dressed in top hats and cobblestone streets.\n\nThe combat, while flashy, is shallow. Enemies are brain-dead, fights are easy button-mashing affairs, and the supposed “stealth” mechanics still feel clumsy and inconsistent. The addition of the grappling hook should make traversal more dynamic, but instead it makes the world feel smaller, turning parkour into a point-and-click affair.\n\nThen there are the protagonists, Jacob and Evie Frye. While Evie is the more compelling of the two, the writing never gives either enough depth to make them memorable. The tone swings awkwardly between self-serious and goofy, undercutting the atmosphere the setting could have had. Historical figures like Charles Dickens and Alexander Graham Bell make appearances, but they’re reduced to quirky quest givers rather than interesting characters.\n\nPerformance-wise, it’s an improvement over Unity, but still far from perfect — stutters, physics glitches, and occasional crashes persist, especially on PC. Combine that with an endless checklist of uninspired content, and the experience starts to feel like a chore rather than an adventure.\n\nAssassin’s Creed Syndicate is not without charm — its setting and presentation are strong — but everything beneath that veneer feels hollow and uninspired. It’s a game that looks great on the surface but never captures the magic, mystery, or soul that once defined the series.",

And assassination missions are still in the style of unity which leads to so many frustrating situations (no you cannot escape now because the guards you're trying to escape from are still aggroed).\nEtc etc. \n\n So overall I'd say just don't bother man.

From AC3 the franchise is a trainwreck, making a big effort in totally depart from anything interesting of the previous games.\nThe USA sets where bland as butter, losing the conspirancy and mythic elements made the story aimless and introducing convoluted mechanics to distract from the main game just made everything messy and pointless.\n\nWhen I played Unity I hoped that at least, being Paris, we'd have back those cool moments visiting the monuments of Rome,  Florence or walking around  Venice, Everything looked worse than when we had less technology. This again, is a visually lackluster historic recreation, with bad illumination and little care in making real places interesting to navigate or spectacular at first contact. Historically is more fantasy than anything now, even without the conspiracy elements. Moronic story that barely works with cringey dialogues and characters and sluggish movement, sometimes directly unresponsive. This is going to be my last AC if I manage to follow the main story until the end.\n\n Overstuffed is the feeling. Everything. A lot of things in the bloated scenes barely visible and noisy.

      "review": "Despite the levelling system, Syndicate is considered among Assassin's Creed players as the last 'normal' game, comparing to the next titles, that merged into something gacha-MMO RPG-like. Also, the catchy setting: late-19th-century, steam-infused  London, the capital of the world’s largest empire, and the bright protagonists' duo. Jacob, a rough-edged hoodlum who looks much like Hugh Jackman in his prime form, and his sly and empathic sister Evie, supposedly the best female assassin character in the entire series. What's not to like?\n\nThe Thames, overflooded with barges, is a brilliant piece of design — one of the best river environments ever created  for open-world city-based games. The entire London map, from palaces and cathedrals to slums and underground tunnels, is actually a nice place to walk by, to run through like we used to, from the first Assassin's Creed, and to fly upon, with the help of that fantastic rope launcher, that makes you feel almost like Spider-Man. Also, the antagonist, Crawford Starrick, is portrayed as a solid, proper lawful evil main character. He and some of his associates are at least somewhat more interesting to challenge than the usual villains you forget even before you turn over the page with their names.\n\nThe side quests feature encounters with Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, Alexander Graham Bell, and some more interesting historical figures. If you’re willing to pay extra (yes, even on top of the supposedly “complete” Gold Edition), Arthur Conan Doyle himself will be the honoured guest and companion! Many missions are inspired by the detective stories, letting you play the role of Mr. Sherlock for a good third — maybe even half — of the game’s runtime! Again, what's not to like?\n\nWell, for starters, it is the optimisation. Yeah, Ubisoft conveyor, after they pushed out Patrice Désilets, hasn’t  been known for bug-free products. I still remember the memes about Black Flag and AC Unity launch game conditions. I've pre-ordered Watch Dogs and couldn’t play it properly for almost a year after release… all thanks to “optimisation.” However, here we have a supposedly AAA-class game, which was advertised literally everywhere, including all the promo stands and bus side covers in my city. The game that has never dropped below $5, nine years after release, and I repeat, even with the Gold version, some DLC still require an extra purchase! And yet, even now some quests (needed for 100% achievements badge) can't be finished properly, without at least several attempts to find the condition in which the game proceeds like supposed to, and not 'losing synchronisation', due to broken scripts. That issue is especially bad in the Jack the Ripper DLC side quests, but it is presented in many quests of the major campaign as well. \n\nSome quests and game conceptions, like the whole story with carriages, by which this game had a moniker 'Grand Theft Cart' in some reviews, are made very subpar. Also, guess the rarest game achievement, by the way? Yeah, it's 'Without a Grudge', ultimately annoying task to drive those carriages recklessly, for a long time, without any reason but the achievement to do so. \n\nMoreover, some quests and story twists, are made in the way, which leaves me extremely dissatisfied with how the devs, especially story writers, twist the basic historical logic. Even if the Creed-Order crypto history conflict is not related to the events, even if it is strictly gameplay thing, it feels Soooo weak and stupid, that I simply can't get, for which audience was that all made.\n\n[b][i]So, three things: bugs, dubious story collisions, that insults my mind, and also stupid gameplay decisions that made not to interest the player, make him think or explore the history, or tease him with the challenge of some sort, but rather to prolong a gameplay time with the all too boring things.[/i][/b]\n\nSurely, I've enjoyed the sights of London, the development of main story characters, the moving train hub, and some of the game challenges.

I've been waiting to play this game literally since it came out. And now that I got a steam deck, I finally decided to give it a shot. And my god it's horrid.\n\nThe gameplay? It's alright. I enjoy AC games for parkour, and there's plenty of it here, refined since previous games in some aspects, downgraded in others. The grappling hook is a tad silly, but it does make me feel cool traversing the rooftops of London, and that's all that matters.\n\nThe story though? Nonexistent. \n   Despite choosing one of the most intriguing and interesting settings imaginable, having a great set-up with all the historical figures present and the potential sibling dynamic, Ubisoft managed to conjure the most bland, uninspiring, nothingburger of a narrative the likes of which I haven't seen in a while. \n   There is NOTHING going on in this game. NOTHING. No exploring the relationship of Evie and Jacob, or Evie and Green, no character development on either of the Fryes' part, and the main villian? We see him a total of 8 times before the final mission, where you kill the guy in the most ridiculous and stupid fighting sequence ever known to man. \n   I MEAN FUCK, 4 OUT OF 9 STORY SEQUENCES START WITH JACOB GETTING A RANDOM FUCKING LETTER FROM *SOMEBODY* AND READING IT WITH FOOTAGE OF BIG BEN IN THE BACKGROUND. \"A letter, for me? Kill this guy in this place? Sure will!\". They even reused the voicelines for them, that's how little of a fuck they were giving\n   Throughout the game, you get missions to kill templars, you talk to occasional Charles Dickens once and never meet them again (and I know you're supposed to do the side-missions for that, but I would EXPECT the characters to reappear at least a COUPLE times), and you ride around London in various carriages. That is It. Despite finishing the game a mere minutes ago, I already forgot all of it. \n   The only mildly amusing part of this entire game was Sequence 8, specifically Maxwell Roth (my psychotic bisexual king love him)\n\nThe \"present time\" interludes are, as the rest of the game, unimportant and forgettable. An enormous step-back, not even from the Desmond sequences in 1/2/3, but from the first-person walking-arounds in Black Flag. I don't care about them. There is no reason to.\n\nI can't even compare this game to previous ones.\n\nI am genuinely upset with this game. I wanted it to be good, I gave it the benefit of the doubt until the very last cutscene, but I got nothing in return. Fuck off\nI'll probably rewrite this review once I stop seething. Or perhaps not.\n\nIf you want good AC experience, go play the Ezio trilogy, or the Black Flag.",

That isn't possible for any right thinking consumer or customer as we were called back in the day if the game bugs out and you cannot complete it.\r\nThe last sequence of missions is where it crashed for me, there is an event where we are to tackle a suspect and that puts a cut scene before us. It wouldn't trigger.\r\nIts a known issue and has been for years yet its still there?\r\nI wont play the DLC because I cant finish the story and i'll now be looking to get this game on console to complete it.\r\nSad, but hey ho, there are bigger problems in the world at the moment.\r\n\r\nAnd on that note, if you want to duck out form the real world for a few hours, and you dont mind an incomplete game sitting in your back log. Then the streets of Victorian London in UBI Softs digital vibrance should do the trick for you.",

      "review": "Much better than that cunt game Unity. I mean it's improved in everything. There was some bugs but they only made me laugh didn't pissed me off. What pissed me off is that cunt music when u grab those photo sounds to that secret vault for something. Dunno for what cuz didn't achieve it. Fck it! So fcking stupid when u fast travel it plays always and pissed u off, if u have managed to meet the vault and put some of em to it then it will play always. Music there is just a few good sounds but didn't catch it long for good. \r\nAmazingly, devastating and fabulous executions. There's just a few for which weapon of 3 kind but for the whole possibilities of doing them is just rough and beautiful. After some 22 hours I was getting bored by them but not only for that.\r\n\r\nEverything felt boring the side quests are much more better then the main game and it's so painful. \r\nThe most bullshit thing that make me ask myself why I love Ezio trilogy cuz for sure not of those cunt chests. This game should be called a walk simulator or travel simulator. There's over 400 more those fckers and it really felt wrong. I did like some half of it and it gives me better equipment upgrades etc. And economic system is much more valued and it's only upgrades. The good thing which this games does better than witcher 3 is suggesting you were to go after reaching some level. Even those fabulous executions will feel terrible horrifying and boring. So now I believe why there wasn't any shouts after this game release. And final part which gives me headache it's that u have a zipline like in a Batman Arkham game. Seriously who designed that? For what?! The last main good thing is that u may travel to world war 1 time and do some good things for your country. Fighting some naz... ehm Templars afterwards :P \r\n\r\nAnyways not worth it but if u are a fanboy just do it. Buy and complete. I will never ever come back to this!",

      "review": "The story is pretty boring, the characters are meh. Gameplay gets rather tedious as well with the usual Ubisoft bloat. Scan, clear area checkpoints, and hoover up collectibles along the way to the next major mission. Still some jank with geometry flickering, collision issues, and certain inventory items always resetting to be flagged as new whenever you switch characters. \n\nSome of the main missions can be interesting, but at a certain point you can pretty much just throw knives to kill 80% of the enemies in a scenario and then hallucinogenic dart the rest. Victorian London is okay as a setting, but it's definitely not as interesting as revolutionary Paris. Best part I found was the Dreadful Crimes DLC but I enjoy figuring out whodunnit.\n\nI would only recommend this if it's cheap, you really love AC games, and/or you've got plenty of time to waste.",

Go to details, set the priority to real-time, and set the affinity to 6 cores. Keep in mind, until Ubisoft or somebody makes a mod to fix this anybody above 8 cores will never be able to fully enjoy this also, I turned off Ubisoft overlay Don't know if that helped or not, but also run the game in windowed mode or borderless.",
