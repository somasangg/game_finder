Itemization, hero design, and core mechanics all have a much greater impact on how each game plays out.\n\nIf you prefer micro over macro play, Dota still holds up. It focuses less on pure skill shots and more on positioning, timing, and decision-making. With its many active items and abilities, you often manage anywhere from 2 to 13 buttons, sometimes even controlling multiple units with their own skills.\n\nLoL feels faster and more reaction-based. You die quicker, and crowd control is usually shorter and easier to dodge. In Dota, disables tend to last longer, which shifts the focus toward planning and positioning rather than constant reflexes.\n\nAfter returning to Dota, I can’t go back to LoL. Dota’s hero and item design are more engaging, and fights feel more deliberate—you don’t just evaporate instantly.\n\nBonus points to Dota for its launcher and cosmetics—you can customize music, merge skins, and the client works flawlessly. I once saw a streamer in a match pause, open demo mode to test an interaction, and resume the game within seconds. It’s simply more polished.",

      "review": "🎮 Game Review: 7/10\nPLEASE IMPROVE YOUR RANKING SYSTEM FOR THE LOVE OF THE PLAYERS\n\n🔇 Muted Communication is Killing Teamwork\nThis is a massive problem. If you try to talk strategy or make a complex call, the system instantly flags it as \"communication abuse\" and mutes you. The chat is too restricted. It makes every single match feel like a solo queue bot game with zero real communication. This destroys the entire idea of a strategic team game. You can't coordinate when the game punishes you for trying to talk.\n\n🏆 The Rank Grind is Unbearable\nThe ranking (MMR) system is flat-out unfair and way too slow compared to every other MOBA.\n\nThe issue is getting stuck with people who share your rank medal but are clearly much worse. Other games let you climb fast and leave the bad players behind. Dota 2 locks you in. You have to win a huge number of games just to move up one Division but in the same rank. That's 750 MMR across five divisions. It forces experienced players to constantly carry low-skill teammates, making the whole rank climb feel like an endless, exhausting treadmill.\n\n✨ The Good Stuff\nCosmetics are top-tier. They look incredible and are worth the money. I appreciate that you can still get some quality items for free or with in-game currency.\n\nOptimization is perfect. You can genuinely play this game well, even on a weak, old laptop. It runs smooth.\n\n⚔️ Gameplay: Genius Idea, Broken Balance\nThe core game is brilliant and easy to learn if you put in the time. The best part is how skills can be mixed and used in creative ways that no other game offers.\n\nBut is it balanced? Absolutely not.\n\nThe game has heroes that can abuse their skills because the drawbacks are too small. They have low mana costs and short cooldowns. They just spam abilities nonstop.\n\nThe whole game right now favors the \"Clicker Meta.\" It's not about making smart, strategic plays anymore. It's about how fast you can click and execute actions. The game is basically rewarding high speed over smart decision-making, which is a letdown for a game this deep.",

Even with over 100 hours I am still not the most talented player. The game makes you start out playing with random players of all ranks and skillsets so you are often matched with and against people who know more than you. Some are helpful and understanding, most are incredibly testy. They get angry over small mistakes, cuss, and rally others to start a reporting parade. If Dota changes their social credit system so it actually punishes people who are trolling, insulting, and abusing the game instead of punishing learning curves and the infrequent spotty internet error, I would recommend this game to most people.",

Symbolic of how little Valve seemingly cares for this game at this point, considering how MH is doing as a game. \nThe game has the potential to not suck, but unfortunately, the matchmaking consistently ruins the experience for both seasoned and new players.\n\nEDIT: Reporting is broken. I can see when a report is successful, and I've had dozens of successful reports when it comes to griefing, afks, toxicity, but not a single time have I ever seen any of the painfully obvious smurfs (0 games steamrolling with Invoker or Meepo, stupid crap like that), ever get a penalty. They always seem to get away from the report system. Wonder why that is. Almost like Valve has some interest in there being an influx of \"new player accounts\" and doesn't care whether they're really new players. In which case, they should remove the \"smurfing\" option in the report menu, because clearly it's not against the rules in their eyes.",

      "review": "This game would be cool if it applied a good MMR algorithm for its casual 'turbo' mode. A TON of the community plays this mode because of its speed and quality of life mechanics. Let's just put it this way - less people want to sweat in normal modes (where there's no concede option - so if you're blatantly losing in normal, have fun sitting around for 40min - 1hr+ for the game to end before you're allowed to move to the next. This means enjoy just slowly getting your ass kicked for 40min - 1hr+). Because there's no MMR mechanic in Turbo, it's a complete roll of the dice on player match up. You'll go against 5 pro's while your team has 1 or 2 new players. The devs put a cool little message - \"Be kind to new players\" - because to them, even though most of the community plays this mode, it's the training grounds. The issue - is in the training grounds \"be kind to new players\" - pro's play it. Pro's play it.... because they don't want to play 1hr long normal games. So it creates a toxic experience. So you're either faced with playing a shitty turbo with random MMR game (typically games are not even matched - this happens less of the time than more of the time. By evenly matched I mean either one side or the other just rolls the other team because the algo is so bad at line up. And very occasionally gets it right where the game feels like a good back and forth), or suffer in normals with a much slower pace and much harder mechanics. This game would be cool if 1) It had a good MMR algo for turbo (like introduce ranking in turbo for god sakes lazy ass devs) and 2) They allowed conceding. Since they don't - I can't recommend this game after about 2,300 matches played. 75% turbo. Normals are just... not an option. I can't sit there (like the majority of the community) for 1hr+ at a time and ESPECIALLY when you're getting your ass kicked with no concede and you just have to let the game play out until the enemy team can end it. Absolutely doggy dog dog this game is. Lazy dev force with like 3 people running the show at this point. Cannot recommend.",

Over the years, the old players who respected the game left, and new players came in and ruined it by treating it like a simple game. It’s not a simple game.If you want something easy, go play Mario. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I loved this game, and I know I’m not the only one. There were so many people who truly enjoyed it, but for me, Dota has been dead for a long time. Yet I still keep playing it, and I honestly don’t know why. If you’re a new player or thinking about starting, please respect the game and your teammates. After all, it’s a team game, if you ruin a match, you ruin it for four other people at the same time. Learn the game, think strategically, and if all you want is a casual game, PLEASE never install this game.",

The concept, the constant updates, the pro scene, the custom games… everything about Dota is incredible. But there’s one thing that matters more than all of that.\r\nMatchmaking.\r\nAnd unfortunately, Dota 2’s matchmaking system is so bad that you’ll consistently find yourself leaving games tilted, frustrated, or downright confused. It’s the one flaw that overshadows everything else this masterpiece has to offer. \r\nSo when asked. Would you recommend this game to others? My answer is No. Do not play this game.

For example if pick a sup and the carry is too dumb to make the game a win, you CAN NOT act like a boss and stand up for kills. You gotta just move behind the dumbest core ever till enemy finishes the game in 60 mins. That is what this game has transformed to. A pool of toxicity that when you show creativity, they just throw you to LOW priority. NOW, what is low priority you may ask? Its a match unlike what you installed on your computer. in fact you kinda get to play another game. with only 3 heroes. its a game of chances that this toxic community LOOOOOVEEEES. I've been playing since dota 1. so more than your age probably. I recommend that you don't install this game until they fix the Behavior Score policy. it just ruins your day when you are super niceee and super creative and then coming back to your PC to play a game in which you payed $2000 of skins, and NOPE you can not play this game. you gotta play Single draft with the most stupid players on the surface of this planet till you win 5 matches. and you wont win for like 10 or 12 matches which takes 5 days of a normal human with a JOB ^_^ yeahh. Also the ranking system is super stupid. you just cant win a 1 v 9 game when you get the worst team mates who think of nothing but ruining your experience and revenge on \"why did you tell me to buy wards?\". as Gaben said, he does not care about our feedback.

After she died, it turned out that she misspelled my name in the will and everything she left me was sent to a random person. After that, I sat down and tried to play the game, but my chair broke and i fell onto the floor. In anger, i threw my broken chair at a wall, which made my entire house collapse. Because my house collapsed, all my possessions were buried under the rubble and the only thing that remained was my PC setup. I tried to calm down by playing some Dark Souls III, but my steam library glitched and now the only game I can play is Overwatch 2. While I was playing, I got a phone call saying that I had been convicted for murder and was going to prison for life, because when I collapsed my house, the shock wave caused my neighbours cooking oil to tip onto his turned on gas stove, which blew him up immediately. When I got to prison, they said I was being sentenced to death, and asked for my last meal. I wanted a Big Mac no pickles, but McDonalds got the order wrong and gave me a cold McChicken with extra pickles. Don't trust the price tag on this game, it seems cheap but the cost is really much higher than the actual price tag. This game has ruined my life.",

Is it majorly because of my irresponsibility? Sure. But no game other than this is nearly as addictive once you get into it. It was a dark period of me living in my 14m² playing this game for up to 16 hours per day, with this game giving me illusion of accomplishment with each win, and a need to get my MMR back whenever I lose. A neverending cycle of dopamine rush and withdrawal. Stopping playing it was the best decision of my life. If you ever realise that you are spending too much time in this game - uninstall it and promise to yourlelf that you will never play it again, even when the friends are asking you. If you are responsible or already have an established life thay you are reasonably happy with - this game probably won't hurt you, and it may be good for you. But if you are an irresponsible student with ADHD like me - don't ever even think about getting into this. Because if you like it, you might end up like me.",
