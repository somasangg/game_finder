At first, I honestly doubted and disliked what I saw from other people’s gameplay — it just didn’t feel like classic AC. But after actually playing it myself, I have to say it’s quite impressive and surprisingly fun. It’s definitely different from the OG Assassin’s Creed, but there’s so much to do — the world feels alive, and the side quests really add depth to the story and characters. Overall, it’s a refreshing experience that still carries the spirit of Assassin’s Creed in its own way. maybe i'll try Odyssey or Valhalla maybe....",

      "review": "For me, Assassin’s Creed is a good game, but it doesn’t quite reach greatness. The world-building is exceptional, depicting Egypt during its peak prosperity, with every location in the game being visually stunning and full of mysterious cultural details. Walking through the cities, temples, and deserts feels immersive, and the attention to historical and architectural accuracy is impressive. However, the NPCs still feel somewhat repetitive and lack meaningful interactions, which slightly diminishes the immersion.\n\nThe stealth mechanics are enjoyable and true to the series, though they feel fairly traditional. Having played the Arkham trilogy, I personally don’t find the stealth in Assassin’s Creed particularly groundbreaking. The gameplay loop can become repetitive at times, with base captures and item hunts starting to feel monotonous after a while.\n\nThe Hidden Ones DLC mainly focuses on political intrigue, but it succeeds in showing a more mature Bayek, four years after the events in Siwa. The expansion provides character development and a glimpse into the challenges of leadership within the Hidden Ones. On the other hand, The Curse of the Pharaohs DLC really shines. It delivers the fantasy and mythological elements that feel quintessentially Egyptian: resurrected pharaohs, mummies, Anubis, and the underworld realms like Aaru and Duat are beautifully depicted. The atmosphere and visuals in this DLC elevate the experience, giving players a sense of awe and wonder that contrasts with the more grounded main game.\n\nOverall, while the core gameplay can be a bit repetitive and the NPC interactions limited, the game excels in world-building, atmosphere, and historical immersion, with the DLCs adding both depth and spectacle. I would rate it 7/10.",

The parkour feels very simple you can climb almost anything without much thought, and it lacks the small puzzles and complexity the earlier games had. The only place that gave me that classic “AC parkour feeling” was the pyramids, where I had to find different paths to climb up. Still, despite those issues, the story kept me engaged and I really enjoyed the overall experience.",

The world building is insane, the map is massive, detailed, and straight up gorgeous, and exploring ancient Egypt actually feels like you are walking through a living world.\n\nBayek instantly became one of my favorite protagonists in the series, his story kept me fully locked in from start to finish, and the missions were fun, varied, and never felt like filler.\n\nBut the thing that completely blew me away was the DLC, Curse of the Pharaohs. It is on a different level compared to the usual AC expansions. The atmosphere, the supernatural twists, the crazy dreamlike landscapes, the mix of mythology and history, everything feels fresh and creative. It honestly feels like a whole mini game inside Origins, and I was genuinely impressed by how bold and unique it was.If anyone wants to get into the Assassin’s Creed franchise, I highly recommend starting with Origins.

The game is set in a time and place that is often on the fringes of history but the developers did it justice/\n\nI played the original Assassins Creed back in 2007 and loved it. I then played AC II, Brotherhood and a few of the other earlier games but then hadn't touched an Assassins creed since.\n\nOrigins is brilliant. The world is amazing (I do have a keen interest in ancient history so perhaps I'm biased) and the story is great too. Of the 59 hours I have so far, I have enjoyed all of them. Going to complete the DLC next but definitely recommend.\nThe open-world/RPG aspect is definitely different from the earlier AC games that I enjoyed, but in Origins I did enjoy it. I will have another go at Odyssey at some point.\n\n\nAll the bad reviews are because it launches through the Ubisoft launcher. Whilst not ideal, it really isn't that big of a deal.

      "review": "“Assassin’s Creed Origins” redefines the series with a substantial shift toward action-RPG systems, a vast open world, and a more deliberate approach to storytelling. Set in Ptolemaic Egypt, the game uses its historical backdrop not just as scenery but as a living environment that shapes every aspect of exploration and progression. The transition to a more modern design structure is clear from the opening hours and remains consistent throughout the experience.\n\nThe narrative focuses on Bayek of Siwa, whose personal journey becomes the foundation of the Assassin Brotherhood. The story is more character-driven than earlier entries, with a strong emphasis on emotional motivation and gradual worldbuilding. The pacing is steady, giving room for both intimate moments and large-scale political conflict. Side quests contribute to this structure by offering self-contained stories that expand the setting beyond the main plot.\n\nCombat has been overhauled into a hit-box–based system that rewards timing, positioning, and gear management. Weapons differ meaningfully in speed, reach, and special abilities, encouraging players to experiment with builds. The introduction of leveling and loot systems adds long-term progression, though it shifts the series away from pure stealth. Stealth options remain viable, but now serve as part of a broader tactical toolkit rather than the central focus.\n\nExploration is a major highlight. The world map is expansive, diverse, and densely detailed, ranging from the Nile Delta and deserts to urban centers like Alexandria. Each region has distinct wildlife, architecture, and environmental storytelling. The sense of scale is supported by seamless traversal: climbing, riding, and sailing feel fluid and integrated with mission design. The game's visual fidelity reinforces immersion, especially in its treatment of lighting and landscape composition.\n\nQuest structure benefits from the new RPG influence. Objectives are more varied, conversations include minor branching, and many quests feature unique scenarios. While some tasks rely on familiar patterns, the overall variety keeps progression from becoming monotonous. The XP system ties exploration, combat, and side content together, making optional activities feel purposeful rather than purely supplemental.\n\nTechnical performance is generally stable, with occasional dips in crowded environments. Enemy AI is serviceable but inconsistent, sometimes reacting intelligently and other times failing to respond convincingly. Despite these issues, the core systems remain cohesive. Senu, the eagle companion, is a particularly effective addition, integrating reconnaissance smoothly into both stealth and combat.\n\nOverall, “Assassin’s Creed Origins” marks a significant evolution for the franchise. Its blend of open-world exploration, RPG mechanics, and refined storytelling creates a structure that feels revitalized and modern. While the shift in design philosophy will not appeal equally to all fans, the game’s scale, atmosphere, and mechanical depth make it a standout entry and a strong foundation for the series’ new direction.",

Ubisoft delivered a strong blend of stealth, action, and RPG mechanics that sometimes edges surprisingly close to a lightweight Soulslike. The world is huge, the story is engaging, the skill and level systems feel satisfying, and even the side missions have real effort put into them.\n\nBut here’s the catch: this doesn’t feel like an Assassin’s Creed game. The old identity of the series — being part of a Creed, hunting Templars, following a tightly focused narrative about order vs. freedom — is basically gone here. Origins is a great RPG set in ancient Egypt, but it’s far removed from what the older titles built.\n\nSo here’s my recommendation:\nBuy this if you want a great open-world action RPG with strong story and exploration. Avoid it if you’re looking for the classic Assassin’s Creed experience.\n\nAs a game, it’s absolutely worth your time. As an Assassin’s Creed entry, it’s something else entirely.",

      "review": "[h1]Assassin’s Creed Origins Review[/h1]\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Overview[/h1]\nOrigins was controversial for swapping classic AC systems for a full RPG, but for me the switch works. Egypt looks stunning, exploration is rewarding, and the loot, levels, and abilities fit the fantasy better than I expected. It is not perfect and the activity loop can get repetitive, but as an RPG take on AC this is probably the best in the series.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Story Overview[/h1]\nYou play Bayek of Siwa, a Medjay who travels Ptolemaic Egypt hunting those responsible for a personal tragedy. Alongside Aya, you uncover a wider conspiracy involving powerful figures across the Nile. Your choices and discoveries lead toward the beginnings of what will become the Assassin Brotherhood.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]World and Atmosphere[/h1]\nAncient Egypt is a delight to explore. From the Nile delta and Faiyum to Giza’s pyramids and desert dunes, the world feels huge, detailed, and believable. Sandstorms, starry nights, and sun baked villages sell the mood. Tombs, ruins, and hidden chambers make free roaming feel like real discovery.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Combat and RPG Systems[/h1]\nThis is where the shift lands. Weapons have levels and rarity, enemies have levels, and you build a skill tree across Hunter, Warrior, and Seer. Melee feels weighty, bows have clear roles, and tools like smoke bombs, fire, and poison keep fights interesting. It is easy to grasp but deep enough to tune a playstyle you enjoy.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Exploration and Activities[/h1]\nTombs with light puzzles, papyrus riddles, stone circles, war elephants, and plenty of camps to infiltrate. Senu the eagle replaces old Eagle Vision and makes scouting feel natural. The map is huge and generally rewarding, though clearing every outpost for achievements can start to blur together.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Progression and Gear[/h1]\nLots of loot and crafting. Hunting for materials upgrades quiver, bracers, pouch, and breastplate. Dismantling gear is useful, and late game legendaries change how you approach fights. The tree is generous and lets you unlock what fits your flow rather than forcing one path.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Characters and Performances[/h1]\nBayek is easily one of the strongest AC protagonists, with grounded motives and a believable arc. Aya’s segments add momentum and perspective. Voice acting is solid across allies and villains.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]What Works[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Beautiful, massive Egypt that invites real exploration\n[*] RPG combat and abilities that fit the fantasy\n[*] Senu scouting, tombs, and puzzle side content\n[*] Bayek as a standout lead with strong voice work\n[*] Rewards for curiosity through riddles and secrets\n[/list]\n\n[hr]\n[h1]What Falls Short[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Activity loop can feel repetitive when sweeping every region\n[*] First time RPG systems can be overwhelming if you come straight from older ACs\n[*] Some UI and inventory clutter while juggling lots of loot\n[/list]\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nBig thumbs up. If you can accept the RPG pivot, Origins delivers a gorgeous world, satisfying combat, and a great lead character. It is the AC I recommend when someone wants the series at open world scale with modern systems, even if the checklist grind shows up during 100 percent runs.",

      "review": "Definitely one of the best AC games ever. I just loved the nearly everything about it and I will tell you why.\r\n\r\nThe story - One of the most important parts of AC games is it's story, and in Origins it was amazing. In game you play as Bayek of Siwa and you are the first assassin in the history, later in the plot your actions will lead to creation of order of the Hidden Ones. After every mission I felt closer and closer connection to the main character, I could feel his pain and the way he chose to go. The ending of the game also did not disappoint and I was happy to lump into it's DLCs.\r\n\r\nGameplay - The battle system felt smooth and well made, the amount of weapons you could choose was also great. The only thing that disappointed me a bit was the parkour, it was probably one of the worst in the whole franchise... however that doesn't mean it was bad. And the game misses the option of sprinting for some reason.\r\n\r\nOpen world - It was beautiful, simply amazing... The developers have actually put lots of effort into it and exploring it was an amazing experience, however dessert might get annoying after a while, especially if you are trying to 100% the game. I really liked the idea of random events such as mirage or a sandstorm so that the game felt alive and real. One thing that Ubisoft still need to fix in their games it's the side quests, all of them were \"Go kill that guy and bring me his horse\" or \"Help me free my rebel squad and later go and hunt down enemy captain\", but even though they were very similar I still liked completing them.\r\n\r\nFinal overview - After everything I said this game is definitely worth the price and I wish the other \"new\" AC games such as Valhalla and Odyssey are similar to what we've got in that one...",

I just genuinely enjoy the gameplay.\r\n\r\nAfter playing what I consider the best entry in the series, Assassin’s Creed Unity, followed by the rather dull Assassin’s Creed Syndicate (though I can recommend the novel Assassin’s Creed: Underworld, which takes place before the game), it felt refreshing to dive into Assassin’s Creed Origins and its new direction for the franchise. Even if I miss certain elements—like multi-step side objectives within missions or the feeling of truly having to assassinate a target—I have to say that the new, lighter RPG approach still works well today (especially considering the game originally released in 2017).\r\n\r\nThe world is excellently crafted, and Egypt truly comes to life through the beautiful graphics and small attention to detail. It’s clear the developers put a lot of energy into making the game feel like a fresh start for the series. The story is engaging, and I felt it built toward a satisfying conclusion once I finally reached the end.\r\n\r\nAs for the DLC packs, I’d say they’re mainly for those who want a bit more out of the game—not essential, but enjoyable. There’s nothing inherently wrong with The Hidden Ones or The Curse of the Pharaohs, although they mostly offer more of the same, with the latter expanding into several supernatural environments.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I can confidently say that the game still holds up, nearly a decade after its original release. It’s absolutely worth playing, whether you’re a new assassin or a seasoned master of the Brotherhood!",

Once you're strong enough, any mission can be completed by simply running in and killing everyone without consequence. The resource gathering mechanic is annoying, and you often wind up running circles in the same area to do resource farming.\n\nI do not recommend this as an assassin's creed game. As it's own game though, this is a wonderful experience.

The graphics are stunning, the world feels alive, and the performance is smooth as hell. But yeah, the mechanics definitely have issues especially the climbing system.\r\nBayek literally doesn’t need an edge or surface to climb; he just grabs onto invisible air and starts scaling walls like Spider-Man. It feels fake at times and breaks immersion.\r\n\r\nEven with its flaws,Still, wandering through ancient Egypt as Bayek is something special. The game nails that sense of discovery. Combat feels weighty and responsive, and the world design rewards tombs, puzzles, hidden treasures, everything feels handcrafted.\r\n\r\nNow, about people who hate this game because “it doesn’t have the old Assassin’s Creed vibe” Bro, the game is set in 44 BCE. Why would you expect Ezio-era stealth tech or hidden-blade assassination style in a world that ancient? It makes no sense. If you’re expecting classic Assassin’s Creed stealth — you’ll miss it. But if you’re open to evolution, Origins easily stands among Ubisoft’s best open-world experiences.\r\n\r\nOverall though, I loved it.\r\nVisually and atmospherically, Origins is a masterpiece — it just loses a bit of that assassin soul in favor of RPG mechanics.\r\n\r\n⭐ 8.5 / 10 — A visual gem, but flawed in its assassin core.",

The world of Egypt is stuningly beautifull. You can vist many citys, bandit camps, savannas, tombs etc. The story is brutaly well made. I love how it tells you the creation of the Assassin brotherhood and the begining of it. Bayek is an amazing protagonist. There are many memorable chercters in the game and i love it. The game is an almost perfect Ac game. The game has The Assassins ( Hiden Ones), Templars ( Order of the Anchants), memory choridors and a ton of Isu lore ( Yes the Apple of Eden is here). You fell and you are an assassin. You have most of the assassin tools. ( hidden blade, bow, sleep and poison darts etc). The DLCs expand on the early Assassin brotherhood and the Isu. Even the modern day with Layla is good. Combat, parkour and stealth are simple but very fun. I just wish there was social stealth and some sort of Eagle vision but Senu is still amazing for that. Level scaling is okay and if you keep upgrading the Hidden blade you can assassinate any enemy. Recomended\n\n11/10",

      "review": "Plays unbelievably well on Steam Deck, (stable 45 FPS) given the correct graphics settings. It's a 3rd person, open world, action (and sometimes stealth) RPG. Forget that it has \"Assassin's Creed\" in the name, as this game feels absolutely nothing like Assassin's Creed.Despite that small issue, the game is still really fun, and immersive. Exploring the desert and pyramids can be relaxing and therapeutic. Having Phylakes (bounty hunters) hunt you down can be exciting, although a buzzkill at times, and level gating a lot of the areas seems like an AWFUL idea on paper, but when you're playing the game, it really isn't all that bad. Side quests are hit or miss, usually, typical RPG stuff. Leveling up is almost addicting, I can't put my finger on it. You really feel yourself becoming more powerful. Going back to areas that kicked your ass repeatedly and cleaning house is sooooo satisfying. The loot is just meh, really. Copying what other games were doing at the time really does make it show some age, but it has its own charm.\n\nIs it an Assassin's Creed game? Yes and no, depending on who you're talking to. I say form your own opinion as you play. Is it bad? FUCK NO. If you enjoy a typical 3rd person role-playing game with a lot of shit to do, Assassin's Creed Origins just may as well be for you.\n\nTo add: The variety of this game is ever evolving and changing as you play and explore more of the map and level up. Exploring/atmosphere are both FANTASTIC. Wandering through the desolate desert has some secrets waiting to be discovered. Seriously, if you want to sink some hours into an open-world RPG that isn't The Elder Scrolls or Fallout, etc, give this one a fair and reasonable shot! Sure, it's not as in depth or anywhere near as \"personal\" as a Bethesda RPG, but it's a damn good time, nonetheless. I personally put this game off for YEARS and doubly regret it.\n\nAfter finishing the main story, I can conclude that Bayek is one of my favorite assassin's in the series, well written and spoken with a clear goal. If you tend to like more open ended action RPG's and huge expansive maps, you will find absolutely no need to ever purchase anything in the store. Just play, observe, admire and explore- need I say more? Pick this one up on sale, as it goes relatively cheap. Pick up The Hidden Ones and Pharaohs Curse DLC on sale, (about $5 USD.) Season pass and deluxe editions aren't really worth the extra money unless you have cash to burn, they only give cosmetic outfits. Hidden Ones gives probably one of the best outfits in the game as is. \n\nFINAL SCORE: 9/10\nclimbing and parkour and combat with some predator animals (multiple crocodiles in the water) can be a tad frustrating, but nothing too absurd...

The traditional stealth and parkour elements that used to define the series feel toned down, replaced by a more RPG-style system — with levels, loot, and grinding, much like The Witcher or Skyrim. It’s still enjoyable, but as a long-time Assassin’s Creed player, it often feels like you’re playing an RPG set in Egypt rather than a true Assassin’s Creed game.\r\n\r\nOverall, Assassin’s Creed Origins is breathtaking in its visuals and historical atmosphere, but its core “Assassin’s Creed” soul feels somewhat diluted.

      "review": "[h1] Assassin's Creed: Origins - Beauty Beneath the Grind [/h1]\r\n\r\nEgypt is the saving grace of Origins. It is one of the most stunning digital worlds ever rendered - a land caught between the old gods and the encroaching Hellenistic world. Every dune, every crumbling temple, every bustling market exudes history. Even when the game’s systems falter, Egypt itself compels you forward. Who can stand at the foot of the Great Pyramid and not want to climb it? The environment inspires awe in a way no leveling system ever could.\r\n\r\nHere lies the great failure of Origins though: Ubisoft replaced mastery with mathematics. The old Assassin’s Creed combat was about precision, timing, and cunning - skill over stats. Origins replaced that with damage numbers, loot rarity, and level gates. Enemies now shrug off assassination attempts simply because they’re a few levels higher. Even completing the main story becomes gated behind mandatory grinding through side quests to meet level requirements. Combat devolves into a repetitive hack-and-slash loop where enemies are health sponges and victory depends more on grinding than strategy.\r\n\r\nCrafting and collectibles suffer the same fate. Instead of building or repairing something meaningful - like the ship upgrades in Black Flag - players are forced to slaughter endless crocodiles to upgrade Bayek’s shoulder guard. Chests and collectibles yield meaningless scraps: a few coins, a handful of leather, and a sliver of XP, gear if you're really lucky. Exploration becomes labor, not discovery. The player doesn’t chase history or hidden secrets - they chase completion percentages.\r\n\r\nBayek of Siwa is a triumph of writing however. His story traces a deeply emotional journey from vengeance to conviction. Bayek is not simply a killer seeking retribution - he’s a man whose pain transforms into purpose. The birth of a secret brotherhood feels like an organic consequence of his loss. He acts out of a need to restore balance in a world ruled by gods and kings who abuse power.\r\n\r\nAya, Bayek’s estranged wife, stands as his equal and complement. While Bayek embodies the heart of the Creed - empathy, justice, and personal conviction - Aya shapes its purpose and future. Their paths diverge as ideals evolve, showing how shared conviction can take different forms without betraying its bond.\r\n\r\nAssassin’s Creed: Origins is a paradox. It tells one of the best stories in the franchise - perhaps one of Ubisoft’s finest narratives ever - but it hides that brilliance under layers of grind and generic RPG mechanics. Egypt and its people breathe life into the game, while Bayek and Aya give it heart and meaning. Yet, the game’s obsession with level systems and loot undermines the very sense of mastery that once defined the series.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Origins is a beautiful tragedy - a masterpiece of setting and storytelling trapped inside an awful game loop. Egypt saves it, Bayek redeems it, but Ubisoft’s mechanics nearly kill it. It's worth playing [b] just [/b] to experience the cinema and emotion of Bayek and Aya's journey.",

Set in Ancient Egypt, it’s visually breathtaking, massive, and immersive from start to finish.\r\n\r\nStory and World\r\n\r\nThe journey of Bayek of Siwa is emotional, personal, and deeply engaging. His quest for justice after his son’s death drives the entire narrative and makes Bayek one of the most beloved protagonists in the series.\r\n\r\nEgypt is the star of the show: deserts, lush oases, grand temples, busy cities like Alexandria and Memphis — all beautifully crafted.\r\n\r\nGameplay\r\n\r\nOrigins introduced skill trees, loot-based progression, and a more tactical combat system.\r\nExploration is highly rewarding: forts, tombs, treasures, hunting, puzzles — there’s always something to discover.\r\n\r\nSenu, Bayek’s eagle, brought a new layer to scouting and stealth, becoming a staple feature in later AC games.\r\n\r\nThe DLCs\r\nThe Hidden Ones\r\n\r\nA story-focused expansion set years after the main plot.\r\nBayek travels to the Sinai Peninsula to confront Roman oppression and witness the early evolution of The Hidden Ones, the precursors of the Assassin Brotherhood.\r\n\r\nThe Curse of the Pharaohs\r\n\r\nThe largest and most ambitious DLC.\r\nIt dives head-first into Egyptian mythology: supernatural enemies, cursed pharaohs, and surreal afterlife realms.\r\n\r\nAssassin’s Creed Origins is a masterpiece — emotional, epic, and visually stunning.\r\nIts DLCs elevate the experience even further, adding depth, scale, and mythology.",

It’s not even parkour anymore, more like playing a bouldering sim.\r\n\r\n- Everything is climbable. Sounds like something positive, right? No. The challenge of finding good ways to scale a building is completely gone. Climbing smooth walls is the new meta.\r\n\r\n- Controls utterly suck on PC and it took me literal hours to get used to them. No funny. Just the truth.\r\n\r\n- The game tries to be an open-world RPG with leveling… however, tanks story-driven gameplay in the process and forces you to level before you can actually take on enemies in certain areas. Last I checked, a blade doesn’t care about the level of the flesh it enters.\r\n\r\n- The drip is horrendous. Assassins need themselves some good drip.\r\n\r\n- WHERE IS MY PRECURSOR DNA X-RAY VISION?!?!? WHY IS THERE A BIRD NOW???? STOP RETCONNING MY LORE.\r\n\r\n- Doing the locations and quests is unrewarding and boring since there are hardly any unique rewards and by the time you get them, you probably out-leveled said loot and just recycled it. There are also only a handful of quest types. 1: “Go off these guys”. 2: “Investigate this thing”. 3: “Fetch, boy”.\r\n\r\n- Can’t do double assassinations. Have to compensate with throwing a knife after an assassination that somehow does more damage than anything else you can do attack-wise despite only ever being body shots/throws — (Older AC titles at least managed to make knife throws headshots). Oh, it also doesn’t work half of the time.\r\n\r\n- Large weapons like maces or spears are shrunk while on your back and grow when you unsheathe them.\r\n\r\n- Switching between your main and secondary weapons will have the one you switched from poof out of existence.\r\n\r\n- Combat animations and moves are wonky and give a strong fantasy feel, but not even a slightly historically accurate one. (Looking at you duel blades in reverse grip…)\r\n\r\n- You WILL get swarmed in combat with as many enemies as possible trying to gank you at the same time.\r\n\r\n- You HAVE to buy all DLCs to 100%/Platinum this game which is like 30 bucks.\r\nIn my personal opinion, this game also has some of the most annoying NPC voice lines, especially the children.\r\n\r\nSPOILERS AHEAD _________ PROCEED WITH CARE\r\n\r\n- The “Real life” is really cringe and bad and you have no emotional connection to the protag.\r\n\r\n- Storyline is 50% getting c*cked by Cleopatra and the other 50% is an ongoing Avatar–Katara’s mother-esque “my son” sob story.\r\n\r\n- Curse of the Pharaoh DLC is so disconnected from this series’ historical roots, it genuinely hurts physically.",

It’s not even parkour anymore, more like playing a bouldering sim.\r\n\r\n- Everything is climbable. Sounds like something positive, right? No. The challenge of finding good ways to scale a building is completely gone. Climbing smooth walls is the new meta.\r\n\r\n- Controls utterly suck on PC and it took me literal hours to get used to them. No funny. Just the truth.\r\n\r\n- The game tries to be an open-world RPG with leveling… however, tanks story-driven gameplay in the process and forces you to level before you can actually take on enemies in certain areas. Last I checked, a blade doesn’t care about the level of the flesh it enters.\r\n\r\n- The drip is horrendous. Assassins need themselves some good drip.\r\n\r\n- WHERE IS MY PRECURSOR DNA X-RAY VISION?!?!? WHY IS THERE A BIRD NOW???? STOP RETCONNING MY LORE.\r\n\r\n- Doing the locations and quests is unrewarding and boring since there are hardly any unique rewards and by the time you get them, you probably out-leveled said loot and just recycled it. There are also only a handful of quest types. 1: “Go off these guys”. 2: “Investigate this thing”. 3: “Fetch, boy”.\r\n\r\n- Can’t do double assassinations. Have to compensate with throwing a knife after an assassination that somehow does more damage than anything else you can do attack-wise despite only ever being body shots/throws — (Older AC titles at least managed to make knife throws headshots). Oh, it also doesn’t work half of the time.\r\n\r\n- Large weapons like maces or spears are shrunk while on your back and grow when you unsheathe them.\r\n\r\n- Switching between your main and secondary weapons will have the one you switched from poof out of existence.\r\n\r\n- Combat animations and moves are wonky and give a strong fantasy feel, but not even a slightly historically accurate one. (Looking at you duel blades in reverse grip…)\r\n\r\n- You WILL get swarmed in combat with as many enemies as possible trying to gank you at the same time.\r\n\r\n- You HAVE to buy all DLCs to 100%/Platinum this game which is like 30 bucks.\r\nIn my personal opinion, this game also has some of the most annoying NPC voice lines, especially the children.\r\n\r\nSPOILERS AHEAD _________ PROCEED WITH CARE\r\n\r\n- The “Real life” is really cringe and bad and you have no emotional connection to the protag.\r\n\r\n- Storyline is 50% getting c*cked by Cleopatra and the other 50% is an ongoing Avatar–Katara’s mother-esque “my son” sob story.\r\n\r\n- Curse of the Pharaoh DLC is so disconnected from this series’ historical roots, it genuinely hurts physically.",

It's so bad that you have to upgrade the hidden blade, and it can't one shot assassinate the enemies when stealthly killing them so it's kind of useless. To kill an enemy stealthly, you have to grind your levels like what? Aren't side quests supposed to be optional? Get this game if you want to waste your time grinding to become fair.",

Maybe I'm just used to the tightness and finesse of say Ghost of Tsushima, Horizon Dawn, etc. but I just feel this game is flat in comparison (maybe unfairly so givenb its vintage and advancements in gameplay.\r\n\r\nPros\r\nGraphics are fine\r\nStory is average to good.\r\nPlenty of side quests.\r\nLots of upgrades available.\r\n\r\nCons\r\nAbility tree seems like it makes very little difference and is really basic options.\r\nGameplay is monotonous. This is my main gripe.\r\nGame controls dont feel good. Its hard to say I played using Xbox 360 controller but it doesnt feel tight and cohesive. Sneaking up on normal difficulty to assassinate is too easy.\r\n\r\nOverall I got my moneys worth but I wont play another AC game for a very long time.",
