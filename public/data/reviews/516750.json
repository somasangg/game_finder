What I didn't expect is realistic survival as a teenager in 1995 Suomi Finland. What kind of car game is this where you can even go to JAIL for not paying fines?!\r\n\r\nNot gonna spoil too much, but all I'm saying is that car parts ain't cheap, so you have to work hard in order to afford them — and boy-o-boy, there are plenty of side jobs the game has to offer. From simple groceries for grandma or advert delivery to pumping sewage tanks or operating heavy-duty farming machinery.\r\n\r\nIt's crazy how simple the game looks, yet how complex it actually is and how much attention to detail it has — from troubleshooting during car assembly to the electric meter that calculates the amount of electricity differently depending on whether the lights are on in the rooms or not.\r\n\r\nFor $7 it has more content than most AAA games these days. Best regards to the developer, ToplessGun — it was the most fun summer I've ever had. 400 hours in and more to go. Can't wait for My Winter Car, hope it comes out at the end of this year.",

      "review": "what is there to say about this masterpiece of a game?\n\nWe start off in a Northern country not like any. Possibily one of those countries where it gets cold during winter, but. if you're good at reading, A congratulations, B how else did you get this far through the review? if someone's reading for you you're cheating and must do 10 pushups. anyhow, if you're good at reading AND ONLY IF you're good at reading and context, you will recognize that the title of the game is my SUMMER car, therefore, the game isn't set during WINTER, otherwise it would be called my WINTER car.\n\nNow, i've done plenty of mistakes, and right there, above i have made quite the big mistake that can be never forgiven. I've called this a game. This piece of fiction is like no other, it will take you through a journey of emotions and pure unbottled adrenaline in like, 24 hours or something, yesterday i learnt clocks have hands and apparently the 24 hour format is favoured by many and enjoyed even by the former television star Julia Pogrebinska, who would probably also tell you to play this masterpiece, she's got good taste.\n\nAnyhow, you start off with a cutscene that explains the birds and the bees, which to be strictly scientific, have nothing to do with what they're used to set an example for, but hey, i don't make the rules, i don't follow them either. And you get out of what seems to be a very narrow hole, on the back of a car, which is driving, at this point you'll notice 2 things, You probably didn't hit your soft spot (good) or you hit your soft spot (very bad)\n\nOnce you are done remembering that coming out of your parental figure isn't even the beginning of what life holds for you, you're ready to live life in FINLAND (i think, i'm not a GPS system) during SUMMER! so, to start off, the weather is rich, rich with wasps, because the pricks will do just about anything in their power to turn you into a colander. (buy DDT when you have it)\n\nOther than the wasps being your sworn enemy, you have a couple of things you need to care for, Dirtyness (if it gets too low you have to play either warzone or league of legends, resulting in the following loss of life of the player character.) Pee meter, which reminds you that bladders are a very real thing, even though pee is stored in the testes (checkmate pee deniers), and hunger and thirst.\n\nHunger is a lovely throwback to far cry 2, because, far cry 2 was rich with food (and jammed guns) in it's african context, while, Finland, is more akin to a barren land where the only source of nourishment is the bearded gnome behind the counter also known as Teimo, and no you don't have to eat him, you have to buy food from him.\n\nThirst? well, thirst is often known as the silent killer, aka Agent 47, but, to scare it away, it's pretty easy, just stay hydrated, also known as making out with the nearest faucet, and no before you ask, you can't drink gasoline and not expect consequences, i,e. the awesome everlasting taste.\n\nThere's also stress, which is supposed to remind you how it feels to be a \"professional\" counter strike player and being one wrong eco round out of your house and under a wonderful bridge, now known to you as home, enjoy it bucko. Anyhow, when stress goes all the way up you die, and you know what, well earned, because you DIDN'T SMOKE MARLBORO REDS, like, what are you doing? philip morris only cares for you! and that's what you need the ciggies for, to keep stress at bay and possibly not dying from an aneurysm, which i could be having as i'm thinking too much when typing this. And you can also swear like the average person when stressed too i guess, just remember to draw the right keystroke out of the million keybinds there are in the game.\n\nso we've gone over the SURVIVAL mechanics of the experience, yes that's right YOU SURVIVE in Finland, you don't LIVE, you don't THRIVE, you SURVIVE. it's a struggle everyday and this art piece lets you remember that every ticking second.\n\nIf you weren't amused by the game mechanics that remember your frail vitality, then the next game mechanic is for you, the game has JOBS! that's right, the best part is, they are very hard to obtain. Except for picking strawberries, which pays as you would've expected, just enough to remember you can either accept your miserable life or, indulge in the sweet escapism of the cigarettes that you can buy from Teimo.\n\nThe other jobs are, making firewood, which you won't need if you don't know how to properly set up the radiator of your car and suck at refueling, or smoke at the gas pump (not reccomended) pumping sewage out of sewage wells, which, much unlike wishing wells, will only fetch you the worst of diseases when jumping in them (turns out heap a titties isn't the same as hepatitis)\n\nthere's other one time jobs, but i think i've scared the living hell out of the reader by now, so this concludes the late november halloween scare for the reader, and i can move on to the next aspect of the game. the CAR that makes the title, \"my summer CAR\" that's right, there's a car, and if you were oblivious enough not to pay attention, the car is, in your garage, and much like my love life due to personal flaws, it's all over the place, a true tried and tested mess, and well, unlike it it can be fixed with a wrench set, lucky you.\n\nSo, the fixing car part should and technically is sort of straight forward if you know a modicum of how a fossil fuel vehicle runs, unless you're thinking of coal trains, because this baby here runs on tyres, and everyone knows trains can't fit 'cause i've never heard of a 195/65/R15 train, unless you can't read (go back up to the start of the review).Anyhow, once you get your hands on the car parts, there's most of them in the garage, except for a few which you have to buy or possibly find if you have the talented skill of omnipresence and are able to tell if Fleetari's been good or bad for this christmas.\nAnyhow, when you'll fix the car, it will be almost impossible not to mess up, or give up on it, lucky you there's other methods of transportation, such as:\nThe clown bike, a 2 stroke maybe 1 cylinder moped, if you ever wondered what riding a chainsaw feels like it's more or less the same except with a higher risk of injury and death\nThe blue van, comes with 4 wheels and an engine, did i also mention the seats and steering wheel? which is more the initial car comes with, because unlike that one, this one comes pre-assembled, like your computer if you don't care about custom builds.\nThe rustbucket with wasps inside. That one takes a bit to unlock, but i won't be telling that, otherwise i'd be spoiling stuff, i'll tell you how to borrow it indefinitely. You can submerge the car inside of some not drinkable water, drag it out, and then use the universal masterkey known as Screwdriver, once you screwed the car good, it will get turned on, it might take a few attempts, dw, size or technique don't matter, just do your best champ and try to outlast the car, it might just take 3 seconds if you're lucky.\n\nThen there's fleetari's car, cool i guess, comes with an american flag, and the distinct supercharger that makes you feel like you're looking through the driver's hatch of a T34, and much like a t34 driver, underestimating the situation, can and will very much make you the proud owner of a headstone with your custom social media status on it.\nHonorable mentions\nThe Bus - this guy goes places, but i never could bother to use it\nThe Boat - it gets you places but it's running on fumes, silence of the lambs possibly served as a warning not to get on a boat with little to no fuel.\nYour Cousin - Much like the dude from no country for old men your life's at the mercy of a coin flip, when in the car, he will make you feel like royalty, to be clear, you'll feel like Princess Diana, except you're not raring to share a passionate kiss with the finnish forestry, right? And if you're on foot, you will kiss the grill, then the bumper, then the pavement.\n\n10/10",

I seriously want to enjoy this game but it makes it impossible. Only play if you have no job, no life goals, no hobbys, and want an extremly frustrating and confusing experience. Will probably log another 50 hours on this game cuz i hate it so much",
