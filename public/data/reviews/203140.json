      "review": "I actually really like it. i love my little screwed up and flawed videogames that have a strong artistic core and direction and really bold art. just another example of why you shouldnt take everyone elses opinion too seriously. from as far as i can tell this game has either been forgotten or swept under the rug for most people. the thing is is that hitman absolution isnt a bad game by any definition of the word. it plays well, looks and sounds great. has great level design and it is more then the sum of its part. dare i say this is io interactives best game. yes.\r\n\r\nthe reason why most games i play have zero impact on me, even if they are fun, is that they either go full art or full game. what i mean by that is that you could have a game that tells a great story and has brilliant commitment to a singular vision and the aim to give the player an experience over mere interaction with systems. the problem with these games is that they are rarely ever benifit from the medium that they are created in. they are usually very mechanically light and have a movie like pace to them. then you have the opposite where gameplay is king and the art usually takes a backseat to pure interactivity. where feedback, rewards and progression become the centre focus other the giving the player any kind of \"experience\"\r\n\r\nthese are both great but to me this has always been the fustrating balance this artform had to teeter on. its very rarely where a game can be both game and art, my favorites are allways the one that manages this balance.\r\n\r\nhitman absolution is one that manages it. these small levels are so rich with atmosphere and have such a tight and consistent direction. every inch of them has something going on, little stories here and there. little pieces of character. enviromental storytelling in every room. so much effort has been put into characterisation and making this world seem real. the game has such a style to it. it feels almost like an exploitation film. you have all these odd moments sprinkled across the game and it is just a sight to behold. i kept playing to see what weird twisted idea the game developers would come up with next. what depraved, ugly and comicly dark imagery the game would present to me with full confidence.\r\n\r\nalso, ontop of the game being an incredibly rich package of asthetics. one where every single room feels like it had a mandate to tell some kind of small story or tell you about the world or something. the game dosent forget to be a videogame. hitman absolution is fun to play.\r\n\r\nthe level design keeps shaking things up. one second your in some sewer section underneath a hotel dealing with gangsters and thugs, then you take the elevator up to find a bunch of hotel rooms that all have unique inhabitants. you sneak onto the window ledge in the rain and scoot by some patrols and onto the fancy top floor with a big dining hall. after you meet the antagonist and he sets the roof of the hotel on fire you escape a nearby library and then make your way (after a helicopter chase) to this hippie activist loft. and after that you are on a train platform and have to find away to get one of the trains back within crowds of communtors and cops searching for you with their flashlights.\r\n\r\nthat is one mission. one.\r\n\r\nthe game flows between sneaky tense stealth and brutal gun fights. its this ever switching game of cat and mouse where you never feel fully in control. this seems intentional as the game frequently puts you in positions where your not forced into a gun fight but it is implied that the game will not descriminate or punish you for killing a few guards. and, astheticly, it fits this game well. after a exciting and loud gunfight you hid for a little bit and then get back to the tense stealth. this is done throughout the whole game and these little pockets of action sandwiched between the sneaky moments is flawlessly done, best out of any game i have ever played. ever.\r\n\r\ni would not recommend this game to many people. certainly not people that are expecting a \"normal\" hitman experience. this game seemingly dosent even want you to use the disguise mechanic (and i suggest you dont too) since in cutscenes 47 is always in his suit and each level is broken up into smaller pieces in a linear sequence its more about these bespoke stealth challenges rather then this huge sandbox map like the later games. i dont know who i would reccomend this too. im not even sure why i decided to play it in the first place. but im glad i did.\r\n\r\nhitman absolution is an absolute piece of work. the focus on smaller, linear levels brings this game a richness and density that you cannot get anywhere else. if i was to describe this game in a single word it would be \"bold\". everything is bold. the levels are bold. the ideas are bold. the gameplay is bold. the way everything looks and sounds and plays is incredibly bold. so there is my recomendation to you. i either have awful taste in art and videogames or this game is auctualy saying something that makes my brain tickle. this is a cult classic in the making. i have played alot of games and no game is quite like this one. weirdly in my head this game is similar to killer7 or dead rising, kane and lynch 2, cruelty squad and the original portal. a group of games i like to call \"they are great but i dont know why / games with lots of interesting artistic and gameplay decisions that somehow come together\"\r\n\r\nTLDR: if you like weird games (that are auctually fun) as much as i do then that is the only time i would recommend hitman absolution. this game is the roughest of diamonds and is seemingly extremely hard to appreciate and it is not perfect or anything. dont expect a traditonal \"good time\". expect to have your senses shocked and to be weirded out. this game will make you feel gross and mean. the rest of it will perplex you, arouse you, excite you and everything inbetween\r\n\r\na future cult classic in the making. the spiritual successor to kane and lynch 2. yes that is a statement worth sending someone to the psych ward over\r\n\r\nUNRATED/10",

The stealth gameplay, engaging story, and Agent 47’s finesse and badassery remains captivating till this day! The Contracts mode being discontinued in 2018 was not a significant issue, and completing the achievements was straightforward with minimal research. Highly recommended for both longtime fans and newcomers.",

You take a cop’s uniform, and another cop a mile away doesn’t instantly know you’re Agent 47 he just sees another cop doing his job. But in Absolution? You can walk through the entire goddamn city and everyone looks at you like you’ve got a gallon of cum up you're ass. \n\nIt’s still a fun game, but man, the instinct system drives me insane.",

      "review": "In my personal opinion, this is the best Hitman game of the entire franchise, with Blood Money being the second best. This game perfectly recreates the previous Agent 47 in the Blood Money game. His style, his brute force tactics, his fearlessness pursuit of extremely dangerous organizations and individuals, his expertise of weapons handling and fighting skills, and remorseless emotions came back with a beautiful facelift of graphics, level design, storyline, and NPC AI. Unfortunately, this game comes without the weapons customization option. You wont always be able to use your preferred weapon, and you won't have weapons caches. It does, however, allow you to completely conceal larger weapons unlike Blood Money.\r\nThis game's storyline takes you on an emotional roller coaster which reminisces on 47's past and his work to prevent similar events from happening. He finds himself charged with the task of protecting a girl (Victoria) from being taken by the very agency who created them.  This proves to be a nearly impossible task as almost everything that could go wrong absolutely goes wrong.\r\nIt's super fun, and 100% worth the price. \r\nThis game should be in everyone's game library.",

Only this year, after watching a gameplay of HITMAN 3 (or WOA if you prefer) that I saw the reason why people loved this series. The game seemed so badass, with 47 being so meticulous and prepared to kill a target who has nothing to do with him and was only his job. This is what specifically drew my attention, the fact that you had a stealth gameplay to kill someone just because it is your job, with the world around being full of life and real, existing no matter if 47 is doing something or not.\r\n So I went on looking for the available games to play on Steam, and there were many, actually ALL the games. The one I wanted was WOA, but it was too expensive and I didn't know if it would run on my PC, so I bought (on sale) the \"necessary pack\" or something like that, containing ABSOLUTION and BLOOD MONEY for less than a sandwich. I OBVIOUSLY bought it and got excited to play my 2 new HITMAN games.\r\n I started off by this in specific, ABSOLUTION, which seemed more close to WOA (at least I thought) because it is \"recent\" and had better graphics (how silly).\r\n  As soon as I started playing I noticed many things: One of them was already that the game had an amazing portability, running smoothly on my average PC, then its graphics and artstyle, which are great for its time and have personality, and of course, its good gameplay.\r\nBut as time passed, I felt a lack of HITMAN, a lack of that feeling of really being a the amazing assassin paid for the job and leaving with no traces. What happens is that this game's story is focused on Agent 47 fighting a battle he wasn't paid to fight, not forbidding empathy and just chasing a bunch of people to rescue a whatever girl, the \"targets\" have no relevance to the story or even have a reason to kill most of them, and when the targets are a big deal, such as the main villains, they die in the most anticlimatic ways possible. \r\nThe story is lame, not well written, and I know this is a HITMAN game, but that is where the problem is: HITMAN doesn't need a story, at least not a cinematic and \"deep\" one such as this because it ruins the essence of the other games. \r\nIt is not a bad game, but a terrible HITMAN GAME.\r\nI feel like you could change the title to \"JOHN WICK ABSOLUTION\" that it would fit better, as even the stealth is sometimes terrible and forces you to just give up and start shooting everyone.",

Only this year, after watching a gameplay of HITMAN 3 (or WOA if you prefer) that I saw the reason why people loved this series. The game seemed so badass, with 47 being so meticulous and prepared to kill a target who has nothing to do with him and was only his job. This is what specifically drew my attention, the fact that you had a stealth gameplay to kill someone just because it is your job, with the world around being full of life and real, existing no matter if 47 is doing something or not.\r\n So I went on looking for the available games to play on Steam, and there were many, actually ALL the games. The one I wanted was WOA, but it was too expensive and I didn't know if it would run on my PC, so I bought (on sale) the \"necessary pack\" or something like that, containing ABSOLUTION and BLOOD MONEY for less than a sandwich. I OBVIOUSLY bought it and got excited to play my 2 new HITMAN games.\r\n I started off by this in specific, ABSOLUTION, which seemed more close to WOA (at least I thought) because it is \"recent\" and had better graphics (how silly).\r\n  As soon as I started playing I noticed many things: One of them was already that the game had an amazing portability, running smoothly on my average PC, then its graphics and artstyle, which are great for its time and have personality, and of course, its good gameplay.\r\nBut as time passed, I felt a lack of HITMAN, a lack of that feeling of really being a the amazing assassin paid for the job and leaving with no traces. What happens is that this game's story is focused on Agent 47 fighting a battle he wasn't paid to fight, not forbidding empathy and just chasing a bunch of people to rescue a whatever girl, the \"targets\" have no relevance to the story or even have a reason to kill most of them, and when the targets are a big deal, such as the main villains, they die in the most anticlimatic ways possible. \r\nThe story is lame, not well written, and I know this is a HITMAN game, but that is where the problem is: HITMAN doesn't need a story, at least not a cinematic and \"deep\" one such as this because it ruins the essence of the other games. \r\nIt is not a bad game, but a terrible HITMAN GAME.\r\nI feel like you could change the title to \"JOHN WICK ABSOLUTION\" that it would fit better, as even the stealth is sometimes terrible and forces you to just give up and start shooting everyone.",
