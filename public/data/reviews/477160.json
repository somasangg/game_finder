This game was a very good part of my childhood. I stopped playing the game around when the miniature level came out. Now with a PC I can experience all the shortcuts and glitches I experienced before. Also the music design is beautiful and I didn't appreciate it enough before. This review is a thank you because the joy you brought me, the memories.",

The music makes funerals seem like a happy place that's how depressing and joyless it was and the grab mechanics are pretty horrible but a part from that it's a cool game.\n\nPretty broken achievement wise tho, because if you're playing with someone the host needs to be the one doing everything since it doesn't count if the guest does it.\n\nOverall it was a bit tedious (some achievements) but still very fun 8/10, would throw my friend of the map again.",

      "review": "\"Human: Fall Flat\" is one of those games that’s way more fun than it has any right to be. The physics are wobbly, the controls feel awkward at first — and yet somehow, that’s exactly what makes it so entertaining.\r\n\r\nOnce you get the hang of the mechanics, the game really opens up — and playing with friends takes it to another level entirely. The random, unplanned chaos leads to so many hilarious moments that you’ll likely remember for a while!\r\n\r\nThere are tons of levels to play through, and even the tutorial is fun. The best part is, it doesn’t have to end there — the community-made levels add endless replayability, especially when you bring them into a multiplayer lobby.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy puzzle-solving, lighthearted chaos, and games that don’t take themselves too seriously, this one’s an easy recommendation. Definitely got my money’s worth.\r\n\r\nAlso worth mentioning — if you’ve got the skills, try learning to climb walls like Spider-Man! Thanks, devs!",

Back to the start.\n\nBut the real chaos begins when you play with friends. One tries to help, another just gets in the way, and the third stands there laughing. And when your friend messes up, falls, or accidentally throws you off the edge — you’re mad for five seconds, then laugh together anyway.\n\nIn Human Fall Flat, it’s impossible to play “perfectly,” but you’ll have tons of fun with everyone’s clumsy fails.

I appreciate the simplicity of the graphics so it can run on my laptop. I manage to get 30fps and sometimes more on the lowest graphics and on 1280 x 720 screen resolution. The only issue I have with this game is that if you use a laptop, you have to use the trackpad/intergrated mouse to look around. This may not sound like a problem, until it refuses to respond for a moment, and you have to stop what you're doing and shuffle it so it works again. And you will always have this issue. If you do decide to play this way, it's okay, but I really wish the developers can solve this problem because the game forgets that I use it to look around. My set up is WASD = Move, Trackpad/Intergrated Mouse = Look Around, Q/E = Left/Right Hand, N = Play Dead, and M = Player names. The set up works and that's really all I have to say about it. You're better off using a USB attached or Bluetooth controller. Other than this one persistent issue, I would recommend the game.",

Resolution or any other texture, shadow, etc setting has no effect on performance at all. Game goes from buttery smooth 144fps to 5fps and back again, sometimes stutter/freezing as someone joins our game. The graphics are far too simple for the engine to be pushing my system.\n\nI cant imagine this game is this badly optimized after this much time, and this many positive reviews. Ill try to read their forums to see why it plays like garbage I guess?\n\nEdit: F this dev. They ignore customer service emails, and others have reported the issue (FPS drop in multiplayer) for years, meanwhile the dev is working on a sequel? I think not.",
