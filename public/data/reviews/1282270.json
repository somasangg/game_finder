It's 3rd person so you can see behind cover in certain situations. There is double jump and gliding. It may sound daunting but it's rather simple and easy mechanics.\nGame requires decent aim, so mouse and keyboard. Gamepads are supported, it works well for melee/knife only mod.\nUnlike Valorant or CS this one is more like Team Fortress where your agent is a class and comes with only 1 main weapon. You have sidearms: smg, deagle, shotgun and flamer and a sword, you can change your sidearm each round. You can't change your character main weapon, so if you pick a sniper you play a sniper for the whole half, on halftime you can change your character/class. Instead of buying weapons you buy upgrades for abilities armor and weapons. It is very simple and straightforward, I do feel some upgrades are better than some. There are utilities like nades, flash, healing nades etc. Character abilities are very simple and usually reveal an enemy, deal damage, or both, or they buff you and your team, or debuff enemy, depending on the character you play. There are 22 characters/agents in total.\nThe graphics are clean and easy to see, performance is good too.\nUI is clean for the most part and it's easy to jump into the game.\nThere are bots or players who play like bots. I don't mind. If you think about it most games are like these nowadays.",

I thought that was a \"play more matches so SBMM would know where to place you\" type of thing, but i did play outbreak on release regularly against people, but after returning from a business trip one of the updates broke something and now i just can't get a non-bot lobby for outbreak even tho i know they exist, since people in my friend list are able to get in those matches. i'll update review if i find anything about it.) it is still fun enough of an experience because of how unique and expressive movement is in this game.\n\nAlso for anyone interested, you can easily detect bot lobbies by looking at their chips at the pre-lobby screen, since bots don't have any medals on them. \n\nStill, it does have a low playercount, which is undeniably true. I fear that global servers will go EOS and we won't be transferred to Chinese servers. \nBut if you looking for an actually casual or unique PVP shooter with high skill celling and ability to queue into multiple gamemods at ones (which is a godsend), \nor a PVE game that pretends to be PVP if you into that kind of thing, \nthen this game is for you.\nJust keep in mind that servers ~miiiight~ go EOS sooner or later before buying lots of skins.\n\nBut to be honest - i don't care at this point. It's was a great ride, and if Strinova dies - i leave PVP games with it.\nThanks iDreamSky developer team for reviving my love for PVP games and skill expression, fly high you beautiful bastard.",

It is common to be paired in ranked games with opponents or teammates whose ranks vary widely, disrupting fair competition and the intended ranking system. This issue is worsened by a small player base, leading to long wait times and repeatedly facing the same mismatched players. Additionally, occasional lag spikes and network problems negatively affect gameplay. The monetization system leans towards pay-to-win, making progression and rewards challenging for free-to-play users. While the maps are well-designed and engaging, the presence of toxic players often disrupts the gaming experience, contributing further to player dissatisfaction. These persistent issues overshadow the game's innovative core mechanics and potential.",

      "review": "Amazing gameplay, terrible monetization and advertising. \n     The gunplay and movement in this game is like no other, and while the stringification gimmick is funny looking at first, it's only once you start looking deeper that you realize its potential. The ability to dodge bullets and outplay your opponents with paper mode or, on the other side, shoot your opponents even when they're millimeters wide, means that the skill expression for this game is truly impressive. The characters might be somewhat generic, but are charming and the dorm system truly can make people fall in love with them (at least, the three that exist at the time of writing this post IDREAMSKY GIVE ME KOKONA DORM AND MY LIFE IS YOURS oh wait nvm i already sold my soul to the devil for bablos). The lore, while on hold by the devs, is surprisingly complex, with neither side being inherently good or bad, and with actual stakes behind it despite the nigh immortality this virtual world provides its residents (if i understand it correctly). \n     However, the monetization, as i alluded to before, is absolutely awful and combined with a number of other factors, killed the game on global (the chinese side is very popular tho, i've heard it hits 1 million concurrent users on weekends). Region lock severely limited player interaction and resulted in a lot of people leaving combined with the lackluster f2p rewards (smth like 200+ hrs to unlock all the characters according to some although I don't remember having anywhere near that trouble) and 100 usd only converting to 60 PULLS when you need 160 to guarantee all legendary gacha rewards (3 times that for the upcoming michele legendary btw, holy EA cosplay). The devs also chose to try and appeal to the casual audience, which I'm conflicted about. On one hand it only helped to grow the chinese scene and maybe held some global interest for a little bit. However, generally the people who stick around the longest, especially in a game with such competitive depth, are the competitive players, and IDS have been neglecting those players and the ranked system for about 3 seasons now. Rank inflation and bot lobbies, combined with the games horrible matchmaking system, means that mid and high elo feel absolutely awful to play, with either extremely high toxicity, clueless teammates, or both. \n\nI still highly recommend the game, as it is possibly the most fun and accessible competitive shooter I personally have ever played (if you don't believe me get past the bot lobbies and try the game out, then come back to flame me if you still believe). However, there are so many problems with the game OUTSIDE OF ITS CORE GAMEPLAY that I, even after playing the game since launch and with the amount of hours I have, cannot excuse.",

They're not selling advantages. It's all skins. While the majority of the skins can be bought directly with money or their own currency, the real blingy flashy skins with unique animations and voice lines are behind a gacha system.\nYou can for the most part get enough currency to get the some of the skins, including legendary tier 1 skins after a while, but some  tier 2 skins are locked behind money, which are in rotations.\n\nThe game has basic shooting modes like elimination, demolition and escort, there is also something called Outbreak. Basically an infected mode where players are selected to be monsters, and infect others. They really lean into that lately.\n\nOverall, I really like it.\nToo bad about the player count.

It makes the whole experience feel unbalanced and takes away from the competitive side of the game.\n\nIt’s clear the player base has dropped off over time, which is disappointing because the core gameplay is actually enjoyable. I still find myself coming back to it, but I really hope the developers start focusing on polishing the mechanics, improving matchmaking, and giving long-term players reasons to stay. Constantly adding new skins each update is fine, but it shouldn’t come at the cost of meaningful updates that enhance the game itself.

If I want to play a visual novel game, then I'd rather play that. But in terms of design, the factions are kind of left over with no actual threat. It's like fighting paintball. The game will work more if it is a survival team game, and MOBA is an alternative. You can actually use the mutant models and robot. I want the game to be alive but not the way you see it.

      "review": "Played it from release until the start of season 3 when I stopped, so here's my thoughts.\n\nGood:\n-paper mechanic, although looks goofy, it actually feels fresh and even good as you learn to use it for movement\n-gameplay is actually really smooth which I didnt expect from an anime looking game that I never heard about before (I found it on the daily steam discovery queue)\n-fun with friends, like any multiplayer ig\n-gameplay actually has depth and you can do a lot of things that will help you improve, other than just having good aim\n\nBad:\n-low playerbase which results in many other issues like long waiting time for matchmaking and unbalanced matchmaking and such, making players in ranked be sick and tired and more likely to be toxic, or they stop playing ranked and they flood the casual matches, so you cant even catch a break even if you are trying to play something casual and relax\n-unbalanced characters. even at base, some characters are always better than others, but when you take into account map control and specific strategies and synergies, the right character makes a difference of heaven or hell \n-monetization is really bad, getting 1 legendary skin is way too expensive, and even then you can end up getting the weapon skin instead of the character skin. and this is my personal opinion, but half of the legendary skins arent even that much better than epic skins, all they have is the possibility to spend more to \"customize\" them a.k.a slight changes and different colors, you'd think they would put more effort into making the legendary skins, but apparently its not the case for every character\n-despite being EXPENSIVE and a lot of people actually spending money for the chance of getting skins, myself included, it REALLY doesnt feel like they are putting ANYTHING back into making the game better. from my understanding, all they do is have the servers opened and they just copy the chinese game calabiyau and translate it, so literally any feedback you will have might never even have the possibility to reach the actual devs of the game\n-event rewards are extremely lacking, the CN version of the game is much much better and we global players are treated as cows only to be milked, it really feels like theres no future for this game in the global space. all content creators and pros also left it if Im correct, but that is only natural when theres no tournaments or anything like that with real $ rewards. all you can get is like once in a few months a tournament that gives the equivalent of a few hundreds of dollars of in-game currency\n-menus, UI, events, etc are really bad for a live service game that released 1 year ago. to this day you dont even have a \"claim all\" button for your inbox rewards. do we really need to get to the point where we have to ask for something so basic and obvious?\n-when I played, estimated time for matchmaking always said around 2 minutes, but it could easily reach even 1 hour and on top of that the matchmaking is really REALLY loose, when I was an average joe and ended up in a team of average people, the enemy team had the top1 EU server player at the time and other high ranks. when this happened, I started paying more attention to the names of everyone and noticed I was matched up with players of top300 on a daily basis multiple times, while I was silver or gold, which is like 5 or 6 ranks below them, iirc\n\nI could say more things, but these were the main issues that came to mind.\nLastly, I want to describe my experience of revisiting the game after +/- half an year later. Last I played was the beginning of season 3 and now it is season 6.\nThe changes I noticed:\n\n1. The shop has like 10 times more pages for crap to buy for every possible spender (low spender, dolphin, whale, etc) \nBefore you HAD TO BE a whale to consistently get the limited banner legendary character skins. F2p would have taken you FOREVER unless you got really lucky, since theres absolutely no daily rewards and most events that last WEEKS give like 1-3 pulls (pity is 80 pulls and you get either the character skin or the weapon skin and I think everyone agrees that the character skin is the only thing they want)\n2. They added more half baked crap gamemodes, it feels like Im playing roblox or some modded minecraft modes. This isnt necessarily something bad, but remember how I said the low playerbase amount is a huge issue? Imagine splitting your already low playersbase across even more gamemodes. This has to be one of the worst decisions I've ever seen. When I came back yesterday I waited literally for 1 hour trying to find a match on Escort gamemode and I gave up because it wasnt finding anything(the estimated time told me it will take 1:55 minutes btw, straight up lying in my face)\n3. One good thing I saw was they added some sort of reputation system, so from my understanding if the AI detects you said certain words or other people report you, you lose reputation, and then you cant queue in ranked or even use text chat or VC anymore. This sounds good on paper, but since I couldnt play the game because I was waiting forever to queue, I dont know much besides that, so I have no clue if its well implemented or not.\n4. Very few balance changes (I went to training room and had a quick look at the characters and I noticed very few changed) some of them were good and some of them were good but also not. for example this 1 character Lawine in the past could throw a knife that just scans a pretty large area and pretty much gives wallhacks. Paired with smoking abilities or grenades it was OP. So Im assuming they wanted to nerf that synergy, so now she has 2 knives instead of 1 but it lasts way shorter and activates much faster. So now shes just a map info spamming demon. The enemy team will get very frequent updates on your locations if you are or not somewhere which just imagining about it feels very annoying.\n\nI had the most fun when the game was new and I had no questions, I even recommended the game to friends and made them play it with me. It was fun too, but now? I cant recommend it to anyone, I cant even play it myself anymore",

This decay in player base has left the ranks so highly inflated that even a bottom rank player from season 1 has reached top rank in season 5 (currently the game started season 6). The target audience at this point is mostly the teens who can spend money on skins. There is a chinese version of this game (which is the original version known as CalabiYau) and it is kind of complicated to access. I believe that the CN version is much more active than this global version.",

      "review": "As of now, I reached 500 hours in Strinova (Switched to client launcher earlier this season). And genuinely, I love this game. It's amazing. The gunplay is fun, the mechanics are great, and I genuinely don't get bored of it.\n\n[h3] Nothing [/h3]\nSadly. This season has been a rollercoaster of nothing. Each time I think the developpers are making a step in the right decision (a.k.a. FINALLY listening to our feedbacks even if it was only for two weeks), they make another that comes to slap me right back in the face, like keeping the matchmaking in the horrendous state it is in. It's not fair, fun, and doesn't give us any reason to play past getting the event rewards and completing the battle pass.\n\n[h3] Game modes [/h3]\nIn terms of game modes, Strinova has been struggling. This season was the removal of Crystal Scramble on the chinese servers, which was a perfectly fine game mode that also got gatekept from the global playerbase despite us asking for it. Since season 3's second update, they've also been releasing alot of poorly designed game modes that have no real content and are just scrapped as fast as they get released. Conquest was a wasted potential, Boom Fest was just sad, Bobblehead Brawl was just a \"headshot\" TDM... so on. Only modes that made some sense are Outbreak, which the vast majority of global player hates due to p2w mechanics and just the mode not being fair for most, and Map Workshop, which is a great feature, but that there's no possibility for global players to enjoy since our community isn't growing to support such a mode.\n\n[h3] Cosmetics [/h3]\nI don't think it's the most important part, but I feel like it's important for me to say that skins in this game are absolutely not worth it. They cost more than the average shooter and half of them are locked behind a gacha that's definitely not consumer friendly with epic pity that resets when you roll a legendary or no actual way to guarantee getting every item on a banner without pulling more than the amount needed to get the legendary skin and the gun. I do think being able to get free legendary skins every once in a while f2p is good. But it's hard and the developpers haven't been the most generous in terms of rewards with this season's events, making it a pain for people who missed out on s4's events.\n\n[h3] Visibility [/h3]\nThe studio behind the game has been doing nothing to help the playerbase grow back. They werent present at GameScom unlike games like Fate Trigger and Arknight: Endfield. There hasn't been any form of advertisement after the second week of release and genuinely, the only new players we get are people stumbling upon it randomly on X and YouTube. That's not how you promote a game.\n\n[h3] Future of the game [/h3]\nWith season 5 being not that great, you'd expect season 6 to remedy to those things. But with no Test Servers in China and our only real information being a scythe shown in a 10 seconds clip, the upcoming season is looking very grim and I'm scared that Strinova might just not recover if we go down the current planned path for 2026 (PvE mode, Rework of the dorm system when global has yet to get the 9 dorms, no Demolition map for the rest of 2025). Season 5 was filler, but Strinova can't afford many seasons like that in a row unless they want to end up like Fall Guys, which has not gotten meaningful content in so many seasons.\n\n[h3] So what? [/h3]\nIf you're a new player looking for a shooter with depth and mechanics just to kill time, I'd tell you to play Strinova and that it's cool. I'd really do. But it'd be a lie. Because Strinova is hanging on threads and the developpers seem too hyperfixated on their upcoming mobile version to think about the global playerbase and the version of the game that's available right now.\n\nHopefully this game recovers. But for now it's not.",

      "review": "Played it from release until the start of season 3 when I stopped, so here's my thoughts.\n\nGood:\n-paper mechanic, although looks goofy, it actually feels fresh and even good as you learn to use it for movement\n-gameplay is actually really smooth which I didnt expect from an anime looking game that I never heard about before (I found it on the daily steam discovery queue)\n-fun with friends, like any multiplayer ig\n-gameplay actually has depth and you can do a lot of things that will help you improve, other than just having good aim\n\nBad:\n-low playerbase which results in many other issues like long waiting time for matchmaking and unbalanced matchmaking and such, making players in ranked be sick and tired and more likely to be toxic, or they stop playing ranked and they flood the casual matches, so you cant even catch a break even if you are trying to play something casual and relax\n-unbalanced characters. even at base, some characters are always better than others, but when you take into account map control and specific strategies and synergies, the right character makes a difference of heaven or hell \n-monetization is really bad, getting 1 legendary skin is way too expensive, and even then you can end up getting the weapon skin instead of the character skin. and this is my personal opinion, but half of the legendary skins arent even that much better than epic skins, all they have is the possibility to spend more to \"customize\" them a.k.a slight changes and different colors, you'd think they would put more effort into making the legendary skins, but apparently its not the case for every character\n-despite being EXPENSIVE and a lot of people actually spending money for the chance of getting skins, myself included, it REALLY doesnt feel like they are putting ANYTHING back into making the game better. from my understanding, all they do is have the servers opened and they just copy the chinese game calabiyau and translate it, so literally any feedback you will have might never even have the possibility to reach the actual devs of the game\n-event rewards are extremely lacking, the CN version of the game is much much better and we global players are treated as cows only to be milked, it really feels like theres no future for this game in the global space. all content creators and pros also left it if Im correct, but that is only natural when theres no tournaments or anything like that with real $ rewards. all you can get is like once in a few months a tournament that gives the equivalent of a few hundreds of dollars of in-game currency\n-menus, UI, events, etc are really bad for a live service game that released 1 year ago. to this day you dont even have a \"claim all\" button for your inbox rewards. do we really need to get to the point where we have to ask for something so basic and obvious?\n-when I played, estimated time for matchmaking always said around 2 minutes, but it could easily reach even 1 hour and on top of that the matchmaking is really REALLY loose, when I was an average joe and ended up in a team of average people, the enemy team had the top1 EU server player at the time and other high ranks. when this happened, I started paying more attention to the names of everyone and noticed I was matched up with players of top300 on a daily basis multiple times, while I was silver or gold, which is like 5 or 6 ranks below them, iirc\n\nI could say more things, but these were the main issues that came to mind.\nLastly, I want to describe my experience of revisiting the game after +/- half an year later. Last I played was the beginning of season 3 and now it is season 6.\nThe changes I noticed:\n\n1. The shop has like 10 times more pages for crap to buy for every possible spender (low spender, dolphin, whale, etc) \nBefore you HAD TO BE a whale to consistently get the limited banner legendary character skins. F2p would have taken you FOREVER unless you got really lucky, since theres absolutely no daily rewards and most events that last WEEKS give like 1-3 pulls (pity is 80 pulls and you get either the character skin or the weapon skin and I think everyone agrees that the character skin is the only thing they want)\n2. They added more half baked crap gamemodes, it feels like Im playing roblox or some modded minecraft modes. This isnt necessarily something bad, but remember how I said the low playerbase amount is a huge issue? Imagine splitting your already low playersbase across even more gamemodes. This has to be one of the worst decisions I've ever seen. When I came back yesterday I waited literally for 1 hour trying to find a match on Escort gamemode and I gave up because it wasnt finding anything(the estimated time told me it will take 1:55 minutes btw, straight up lying in my face)\n3. One good thing I saw was they added some sort of reputation system, so from my understanding if the AI detects you said certain words or other people report you, you lose reputation, and then you cant queue in ranked or even use text chat or VC anymore. This sounds good on paper, but since I couldnt play the game because I was waiting forever to queue, I dont know much besides that, so I have no clue if its well implemented or not.\n4. Very few balance changes (I went to training room and had a quick look at the characters and I noticed very few changed) some of them were good and some of them were good but also not. for example this 1 character Lawine in the past could throw a knife that just scans a pretty large area and pretty much gives wallhacks. Paired with smoking abilities or grenades it was OP. So Im assuming they wanted to nerf that synergy, so now she has 2 knives instead of 1 but it lasts way shorter and activates much faster. So now shes just a map info spamming demon. The enemy team will get very frequent updates on your locations if you are or not somewhere which just imagining about it feels very annoying.\n\nI had the most fun when the game was new and I had no questions, I even recommended the game to friends and made them play it with me. It was fun too, but now? I cant recommend it to anyone, I cant even play it myself anymore",

To be honest, there's no story in the game, but there are factions, so they could develop that by adding missions, but no, they make random additions and add pay-to-win skins. They add a game mode where you play two games and you're already fed up... Not to mention the outbreak game mode, where for literally two months the developers force us to play all this because there are only missions with this rotten mode.... \n\n\nIn short, the game is stylish, but the current and future content is literally rubbish.

But matchmaking……… it’s still very less players on this game, and matchmaking finish those guys who continue to play it. I’m playing from alpha test. I spent a lot for and on this  game but…. Really, for me season 4  was the end. I’m singularity, I really know how to handle each character. Season 4, I was singularity with 380+ average round dmg, and with 93% SVP, but my win rate was 35% for 360 matches. And season 5 is not better. A lot of trollers, wintraders, and they even not banned. Hackers also exist, I might even write names of players who hacks, but it uselessx XD. I tried to write to tech support not one time bc of team and some kind of players, but they or dodge questions or reply by script. Developers, I’m begging you, FIX YOUR FUCKING MATCHMAKING. Mostly, what I want to say - ranked matchmaking is based on average round dmg (AVG), but that’s really unfair. It works like, it calculates the sum of all avg and divides it by 5, and that’s how you get the average dmg per team.For example, how it was on one of my lasts matches on singularity/superstring match -1 380 adr player, 1 350, 1 230 player, 1 210 player and 1 260, and if calculate it, it’s near 290 avg per team, and all 5 players of enemy team were 300 adr. On paper it’s equal match 290 and 300 adr, but on reality, we lost 1-9, and we took 1 round only when I did ace clutch. Developers don’t understand that ranked games based on avg is horrible. Very less players play this game for this ranked matchmaking type.but for other way, I understand that it’s almost Impossible to balance this game with out 2h queue.",

Most positive reviews are fake, or from when the game first released. This game doesn't even have over 10k active players.\n\nEdit: The event not tracking correctly wasn't an issue, it was a hidden system undisclosed to the players. To \"fix\" said issue the devs made it so the points track correctly, but raised required points for rewards. \nThat's just a lazy way to fix their deceptive systems.",

One character can just not die and can heal almost all her health like 2 times in one fight!? That's just one example and there's so many broken and unfun characters. The cosmetics are awesome but holy the monetization is atrocious. Queue times are cooked and get worse the lower rank you are. So much potential thrown out the door.

Because the game's mechanics are so easy that the players are so stupid, their brains are just to rush and shoot and forget everything, even how to use their brains, they don't even know how to win the game while their teammates have done almost everything and they only need to use 1% of their brains. I don't know how many times I feel like the game is trying to put all the idiots on my team and push all the other players to the opponent. They play the game like it's CSGO, don't use skills, don't use 2d mode, too delusional about sniper, don't know how to watch the site and can't even see the game's oversized map. Please increase the difficulty of the game so that players can try hard the game instead of just playing to fill the slot.",

The game feels like an eerie gmod map with echoes of its past. \n\nThey won't do anything to bring back the playerbase, and yet are still incredibly greedy for a game at the end of its life.\n\nWhile I want more and more players to come so that the game can be enjoyable again and can say it is worth trying to any new player interested, I won't hide the truth of how dead and greedy the game is.",

Adding on top of that, most servers (including ranked) are most of time (85-95% of the time) fully filled with bots so you're basically fighting pve in a pvp game which gets boring REAL quick.

I don't recommend unless your favourite game is something like Val or OW and you can say no to frivolous spending for gambling on skins. Might as well play some fortnite, skins are cheaper",
