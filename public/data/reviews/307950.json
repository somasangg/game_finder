I know they wanted to limit them by country, but no, that excuse doesn't work either cause premium guns can be used on any operator so no don't say that\n\nhow to fix it? easy up on the slow progression, second. unlock the gun restrictions, its the operators SKILLS that make them unique not their weapons. the Medic was so effing usless in combat and their energy recovered so dang slowly that they might as well not exist. \non top of that, you take the same currency to unlock characters to unlock skills. \nwhy not just have all operators unlocked and then have us use that money to make the ones we want better. \n\nthere are so many ways you could go with this that are better than what you have now. instead you get a thumbs down.",

      "review": "Game is literally unplayable. The game has so much lag that I can't even leave the starting area of any match- and if I get a few seconds of playtime, it teleports me back to the starting area of the map and has me teleporting all over that little area. Every match I've tried to play is so bad that it may as well have hacked my computer and stolen any attempt at control from me. Can't move, can't look around, can't ads, can't switch weapons, can't activate abilities- and I've tried to play. I really have. The worst part is that I can't even give contructive feedback because the game doesn't give enough information for me to figure out wtf is actually the problem. Best I can tell is that the servers are either extremely low quality and/or somewhere in the middle of bumf*ck nowhere China. That would be the only thing I can think of that would cause the lag issues since bad optimization wouldn't cause rubber-banding, lag teleporting, and the other issues I have.\n\nI know the issue isn't my machine or internet because I can play COD or Space Marine 2, or Helldivers 2, or any number of other games with no issues aside from their game servers- COD being the worst about it. I can even play Skyrim modpacks like Lorerim, Wuunduniik, and Nolvus with smooth performance.",
