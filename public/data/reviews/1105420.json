Starting out is tough, but reaching near high mid level, and know-how to gain the daily rewards/events, it gets easier.\n\nThe game does hit roadblocks as limits for certain actions at certain levels. However, it's a casual game, most daily rewards can be done within under an hour. Longer missions such as unlocking advanced research takes longer though, when it gets to be above a month per upgrade or more ... It gets to be even more casual.\n\nBut that's why daily rewards and missions, and events help too in speeding up the process. When there is nothing left to do, it does leave a wanting more type of feeling. But free to play, as a pay to win game has limits, usually the players that like the game they play, are more inclined to spend on the game.\n\nFrom the Start to now, starting out is the toughest part, it's mostly saving diamonds for truces, collecting commanders, and using commanders in Weirwood Tree to advance more ... And the hard part is maintaining a 1K diamonds a day on a 'Free to Play' basis. The training grounds does give diamonds every 3 hours, however, advanced commanders usually do better. Focusing on getting a healer, such as Jeane or Sansa Stark, Simon BlackMyre etc. can provide helpful healing in storyline battles to advance and gain more.\n\nCollecting resources will be a large part as well, on a free to play basis, saving gold dragons for your upgrades for research, troops, will be the most part of the journey. Finding a low populated world can help 'farm' resources and do daily resource collecting possibly easier. But there are most likely others around the same level or higher as you and will attack and vice versa, and it becomes a bit tougher when truces aren't available.\n\nOne way to gain diamonds monthly at an increased rate is the Iron Bank in your city. The iron bank has a wait time but it is worth upgrading to increase output.

It feels like the GoT branding is more of a skin laid over the same old mechanics: build, upgrade, wait, repeat. Events and alliances help a little, but they’re often just more ways to encourage spending.\n\nTo be fair, there are some positives: the interface is clean, the battles look decent, and if you’re a hardcore GoT fan, you’ll probably enjoy seeing the familiar characters and locations.
