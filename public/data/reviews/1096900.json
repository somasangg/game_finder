It’s like saying you don’t need to know how to swim to own a pool. You can still drown, you’ll just look happier doing it.\r\n\r\nThe default hero in my first game was named Harold. I didn’t pick Harold. He just showed up like, “Hey man, I’m your protagonist now.” I said, “Cool, Harold, we’re making a game about saving the world.” He said, “Nah, I’m here for the random encounter system.” Harold doesn’t do quests. He just walks into forests and regrets it.\r\n\r\nThe event system is wild. You can make an NPC do anything. Talk, teleport, dance, explode. I made a guy whose only line was “I forgot my line.” He’s still in there, waiting to remember.\r\n\r\nEvery time I playtest my game, I find a new way to mess it up. Last time my hero got stuck in a chair. Not on the chair. In it. That’s immersion. I call it avant-garde level design.

      "review": "RPG Maker MZ is an incredible toolset, with the capability to create incredible RPG-based games. I've got over 6000 hours on the clock. I've used every pixel of it.\r\n\r\nYeah, it's 2D. But that adds to the charm, imho. 3D based games will RINSE you in assets.\r\n\r\nThe interface is simple enough that you can 'pick up and go' almost right away, and as your mind thinks of more creative things to do and you do eventually reach the limitations of the toolset, you can insert script, and write plugins to do the rest. The toolset is build and designed for it.\r\n\r\n\"Do I need to code?\" No, not really. JavaScript is pretty easy to pick up and understand visually, though, and can help with advanced stuff. But the majority of what you need is a google away.\r\n\r\n\"Do I need to be capable of making art?\" No. But I would advise yes. You can use the stuff that comes with, but your game isn't going to stand out against the thousands of shovel-ware out there.\r\n\r\nWhere it fails: The toolset doesn't. It's the things associated with it.\r\n\r\nThe RPGMaker Forums (english speaking)\r\nI've been using the internet since the 90s. I have never come across a more rude, uppity, self-important, post-count-hungry shower of pricks in all of my life. And I've used 4chan, reddit, twitter AND WoW barrens chat. It doesn't matter how much you search. It doesn't matter if your problem has never existed, it doesn't matter how polite and apologetic you are... the residents of the english speaking forum will find a way to belittle you and make you feel like a prick for posting. But... there are free resources there if you can bear it.\r\n\r\nRPG Maker MZ DLC is recycled MV stuff.\r\nOut of ALL of the DLC for RPGMaker MZ, there are only TWO that actually match the packed-in artwork and style. The 8 Wizards, and the Dark Fantasy. \r\nOther tilesets/portraits/art are either MV tailored, or their own art (which is never, ever enough to build a game around) so a warning there: don't waste money on DLC. I'll pre-empt it now. Learn to draw. Learn to edit your tilesets. Just do it. The DLC is just a cash grab.\r\n\r\nEVERY single generator pack, hero pack, etc, are re-packed MV DLCs, and even though there's file compatibility between MV and MZ, the art style, (and the facing direction of portraits, and the poses in SV battles) differ. MV's parts will make a blistering mess of your generator. Save your money.\r\n\r\nRegarding difference to MV:\r\nThey are virtually the same in structure. The art differs slightly between the two. MZ allows map building with layer control (invaluable), MV does not (learning curve, harder to make map edits on complex maps). MZ allows the collapsing of conditionals in event editor, MV does not. MZ ships with a 64-bit compatible nw.js, MV does not*. MZ by default allows keyboard input for name input, MV uses a console-esque letter selection. MZ has better code support, MV uses older JS libraries.\r\n\r\nWhat else? Oh yeah, Plugins.\r\nMV has a metric TON of plugins to use, these add features to your game, or modify existing ones.\r\nMZ has less, which people will tell you is 'a bad thing' but MV ones can be converted to work in MZ.\r\nThere's paid ones, tht are pretty good, but for most stuff, the free things will get you far.\r\n\r\nLastly... I want to add a warning. If you plan on developing a game, and you've never done it before - it will - irreversibly - change your relationship with video games. The curtain lifts.\r\nYou will see all the shortcuts. \r\nYou will see all the lazy effort, \r\n...and see right through the recycled slop that's shovelled out year after year by 'Big Game'. \r\n...and your library of games you actually play will drop significantly.\r\n\r\n\r\n*compiled games can be made compatible with latest OS releases, but that's extra work",

      "review": "RPG Maker MZ – “I accidentally made a game about sandwiches”\r\n\r\nI bought RPG Maker MZ because I thought it would make me a role-playing game developer. Now I’m a guy who yells at tilesets. Every time I open the program, I feel like I’m standing in a room full of buttons that all want to be pressed, but they don’t know why. It’s like being at a party where everyone’s polite and slightly terrified of variables.\r\n\r\nYou don’t need to know how to code to use it, but that’s a trap. It’s like saying you don’t need to know how to swim to own a pool. You can still drown, you’ll just look happier doing it.\r\n\r\nThe default hero in my first game was named Harold. I didn’t pick Harold. He just showed up like, “Hey man, I’m your protagonist now.” I said, “Cool, Harold, we’re making a game about saving the world.” He said, “Nah, I’m here for the random encounter system.” Harold doesn’t do quests. He just walks into forests and regrets it.\r\n\r\nThe event system is wild. You can make an NPC do anything. Talk, teleport, dance, explode. I made a guy whose only line was “I forgot my line.” He’s still in there, waiting to remember.\r\n\r\nEvery time I playtest my game, I find a new way to mess it up. Last time my hero got stuck in a chair. Not on the chair. In it. That’s immersion. I call it avant-garde level design. My friend called it “broken.” But art is subjective, man.\r\n\r\nRPG Maker MZ has so many plugins, I think it’s secretly an online bazaar. People are out there trading scripts like Pokémon cards. “I’ll give you one animated menu for two weather effects and a parallax background.”\r\n\r\nBut honestly, it’s fun. It’s not perfect, but neither am I. My game crashes sometimes, I crash sometimes. We understand each other.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve ever wanted to make a game without knowing what you’re doing — and have a good time doing it — this is the tool for you. Just remember: your first boss battle will always be against yourself.\r\n\r\n10/10, Harold approves.",

      "review": "Get MV.\n\nI've worked with VX Ace and MV for 10 years. They're great, versatile, and plugins can turn them into almost anything you want. If you know how to code in js, then you can do just about anything with it. However, MZ in particular is... rough compared to the older version. Rough for beginners. The idea behind RPG Maker is an option for people that don't know how to code to make games, or at least get started making games. MZ goes against this idea by making things exceptionally hard if you want to do anything beyond the most basic options within the built-in default engine settings and eventing. \n\nWith MV, plugins by Yanfly make things very convenient for the user. Plug and play, and customize with notetags. The documentation and details for each plugin are easy to understand and work with. The plugins themselves are fully interactable with the engine itself, there's never any issues. \n\nIn contrast, MZ VisuStella plugins are incredibly convoluted and confusing out of the box, without any attempt to make the user experience convenient or easy. The plugins expect you to know code to get any use out of them. It's a drastic difference in plugin design, where MV does its best to make the user experience as easy as possible, and MZ plugin design cares only about its functionality, regardless of user experience or knowledge. \n\nOn top of this, is the fact that any plugin I attempted to use by VisuStella felt like beating my head against a wall due to the fact that anything I wanted to do with it just wouldn't work without making things way too overcomplicated just to do things that in MV would be effortless. The plugins don't play well with MZ's own engine interface, meaning you need to code to get the most of any plugin because a lot of MZ functionality and eventing is incompatible with the plugin parameters. Why design it so horribly inconvenient? \n\nIt's also scummy to me that the js plugins from VisuStella are all given some kind of heavy encryption so you can't customize them in any way. I miss Yanfly, truly. Thankfully, most of the major plugins being developed even now are being designed for both MZ and MV, so you aren't missing out on much going with MV except headache if you choose MZ. However, if you do happen to understand JS and how to apply the documentation for MZ into plugin commands, and can code in general, then you might get just as much or more out of this depending on what your needs are. Either way, hope this paints a picture for people new to RPG Maker.",
