I can certainly understand a lot of the criticism, but any negative thoughts get thrown out of my head when I actually play the game. The combat is amazing, each weapon has such a distinct playstyle and a ton of different options to swap things up, and the monster roster at endgame is a real challenge. The only issue with the combat imo is that basically none of the monsters until master rank are really built around the wirebug mechanic, but even then the combat is so fun it barely matters. If you ask me, this is the best Monster Hunter game",

      "review": "Monster Hunter Rise builds on the core formula of the franchise by delivering fast, fluid hunting gameplay enhanced with new mobility tools and streamlined systems. Set in the village of Kamura, the game emphasizes agility, vertical movement, and cooperative monster hunts. It aims to modernize the traditional structure while retaining the depth and challenge fans expect.\n\nThe introduction of the Wirebug is one of the game’s defining features. This grappling-style mechanic allows players to dash through the air, recover from knockdowns, and perform new weapon-specific silkbind attacks. The added mobility transforms both exploration and combat, giving hunts a more dynamic and responsive feel compared to earlier entries.\n\nWeapons remain as varied and intricate as ever, offering a wide range of playstyles—from heavy, methodical weapons like the Great Sword to agile options like Dual Blades. Each weapon benefits from new Wirebug abilities that expand combo potential and repositioning options. The depth of the weapon system ensures long-term mastery for players who enjoy experimenting.\n\nRise introduces the Rampage, a mode that mixes tower-defense elements with traditional hunting. Players set up defenses, control siege weapons, and face waves of monsters in hectic encounters. While divisive among fans, the mode adds variety and showcases large-scale action distinct from standard hunts. It also contributes valuable crafting materials.\n\nThe environment design emphasizes verticality, allowing players to climb cliffs, traverse rooftops, and uncover hidden areas. Palamutes, the new canine companions, further enhance movement by allowing mounted travel and combat support. Together with the Wirebug, these additions make maps feel more open and faster to navigate.\n\nProgression follows the familiar cycle of hunting monsters, crafting gear, and unlocking harder quests. The gear system remains deep, encouraging players to build loadouts tailored to specific monsters and strategies. Monster designs are varied, combining returning favorites with new creatures inspired by Japanese folklore. Each hunt demands observation, adaptation, and mechanical skill.\n\nOverall, Monster Hunter Rise delivers a refined and energetic evolution of the series. Its mobility enhancements, polished combat, and strong monster roster make it appealing for both newcomers and experienced hunters. While some modes and systems may divide opinion, the core hunting experience is among the most dynamic and satisfying the franchise has offered.",

W/I is more about traditional hunting with tracking monsters, exploring the environments, and using lots of tools and tricks. It has a much higher skill floor level to successfully complete hunts, and a few of the end game hunts require a team. But early and mid game hunts are actually easier than those in Rise, once you actually start combat. \n\nRise/Sunbreak is more straight to the point, with monsters being easy to find and hunts can start within seconds of the hunt starting. Wirebugs are a lot of fun, though a few weapons have wrapped their entire personalities around one or two wirebug moves to the point that they feel spammy, and aren’t very efficient without their spammy moves. Every hunt can be done solo, so there is no pressure to team up for end game content, but there is a sizable population in game still and finding a team for end game isn’t difficult. \n\n9/10 - I can’t give it 10/10 because of spirit birds.

It is like you went back to the sad side of the 90s. Give me a call when you are online! :P \n\nIf you are just starting now you made a great choice to do so, but when you will eventually try to progress through the Hub with the awkward Rampage gatekeeping quests you are in for frustration and disappointment. They are nearly impossible to tackle without at least one more player to help either with arming the posts or shoveling the flames for the big guns every now and then.  \n\nFor a single player with the gear of Village quests, progressing from 3⭐ to 4⭐ in the Hub system which is pretty much the default progression system after the base game, feels like progressing from 6⭐ to 7⭐\n\nAs you probably can understand there are not that many people playing the game and those who do are so advanced that do not care that much to help you progress in the game, so make sure you are armed with patience, for a lot of practice and failure in these gartekeeping Urgent quests of the Hub after the story is over.\n\nIt would take a lot of love and convincing power for someone in Capcom to have a small team revisit the game and fix this. Because for sure they have no other incentive to do so. \n\nNot fix the matchmaking necessarily, that would be complex, difficult and costly, but maybe replace these Urgent Hub progress gatekeepers with something a solo player could handle.

      "review": "TLDR: I hvee the feeling “Monster Fighter” would have been a more appropriate title for the game. Its not bad but it streamlined so much that it stopped being about hunting and a lot more about fighting. If you can play it on PC, more FPS and clearer visuals are a big plus imo, should run on anything, although older GPU’s without any Driver updates may require some file tweaking.\n\n\nBought and played it on the switch when it released. Visuals and performance were fine for the Console and portability, but I never got further into it until the PC release, where I bought and played it with the DLC when that came out. I didn’t play the DLC on Switch and probably never will. The PC version ran fine, but that was to be expected. Clear visuals, even higher FPS. The game has a low visual fidelity so the requirements are low.\n \nMH Rise, like all MH games, has a few gimmicks differentiating it from earlier titles; Spiritbirds, Palamutes and the Wirebugs. It is also the first game in the series that allowed me to see the full Monster Hunter game cycle, which is only completed after the second game you played fully released with all DLC content available. \n\nLike MH World, Rise ditched the sectioned maps and went for Open Maps without a loading screen between fighting areas. This also meant that it had to include several other World related changes, such as healing while walking and generally better Player mobility, and they did, but they also included some stuff previously only seen in older games, particularly Buddy management. \n\nGenerally, fighting Monsters feels the same as it did in World, most if not all moves existing in Rise as well, although with tweaked stats and frame data. Rise, unlike World, wants to be fast and the reason is simple: Its a portable game, going in and finishing a hunt within 10-15m is ideal for a portable experience, therefore damage dealt, especially by the hunter is way higher than it was in world, movement speed is increased and the palamute allows for an even faster map traversal if used as a mount. It’s baffling to me that they also decided to include Spiritbirds the way they did. \nSpiritbirds are small buffs to defense, attack, health and stamina you can collect by running into them, but everything they fill up just screams: you aren’t at full perfomance collect us before you actually start your Hunt. It’s similar to Demons Souls where in your soul form your HP was seemingly halved, when it should increase by halve if you are Human instead. This had its very specific problems to that game, but the Spiritbirds just take out a lot of speed from a game the seemingly tries to be as fast as it can be.\n\nWhy does it seem like that? Eating before a quest has been streamlined, not in a bad way and it works the same it did before, but is way more transparent, good change imo;  there's always a buddy (palico or palamute) at your side, two if you go on a quest alone; the palamutes themselves; gathering doesn’t seem necessary at all / is so fast you just do it while the monster changes area;  you can always see the monster on the map and the wirebug, allowing you to climb everything as long as you have enough stamina, or time your climbing correctly to your stamina loss and wirebug usage. There are so many changes to make a hunt go faster, combined with the most tedious and time consuming activity, collecting collectibles, for every Hunt, with the implication you shouldn’t start hunting until you are fully buffed up. \n\nWirebugs are also very important. Not only can you seemingly climb every wall within the Map but control monsters as well. Its the new mounting mechanic. The way most player utilise it is by mounting another monster on the map, fighting the target monster with the additional monster by spamming heavy moves, ramming the additional one into the target, stunning it for free, allowing your group to deal heavy damage. The idea to fight a monster with another Monster isn’t bad but having the best way to utilize it be so obvious makes hunts very samey when one of the series most defining features was lots of different bosses with lots of different weapons to battle boredom. \nThis wouldn’t be as bad if you couldn’t see every Monster on the map all the time, a feature that took out a big Hunter part out of monster slaying.\nThe last thing Wirebugs have are special moves, ranging from bad to actually useful, some are even funny or allow for very specific playstyles. I think they are a simplified version of the hunter arts featured in Generations and Generations Ultimate, but are appreciated nonetheless and can change your playstyle without having to change your weapon and basic moveset.\n\nThe Monsters themselves are a mixture of old gen, World and entirely new monsters. I liked the roster a lot more than I did with world, especially because not everything looked like a weird mixture of lizard and dragon anymore. More Birds, snakes, and ape like monsters do make a lot of visual difference. Weapon designs are a lot better than they were in world, with actual designs making way for slap on weapon visuals, but we lost visually differing alpha and beta sets in High Rank.\nThe Maps themselves seemed to use MH3 as a base design, but are mostly new besides a few defining landmarks of the older title. There is at least one entirely new map, but they had to redo so much to the point it doesn’t really make a difference. Hot and Cold climate Maps exist but Heat and Cold Potions do not. Didn’t really care about that, more of a convenience feature in a game not concerned about anything else than fighting monsters.\n\nThe game also has siege missions, didn’t like them, but the game doesn’t really force you to do them anyway and the must do’s are so easy, you have to try to fail at them.\n\nI personally felt like the game was more about fighting cool monsters with cool designs with cool weapons, while removing almost every aspect of actually hunting a monster. It made me sad to see this aspect so cleanly removed from the game,especially after world, which leaned a lot into finding monsters and their behaviours to be more efficient, but at the time I could just talk it of as a thing from a portable title to speed up, now parts of that are in a mainline title too and I hate to see it.\n\nStory was typical Monster Hunter stuff, not good, but good enough to make you excited about some new monster to fight",

I genuinely do not see any reason to recommend this game to anyone, and cannot fathom why this game is so beloved. It's not as though I don't have experience with MH and it's not as though I haven't given this game a fair shot (what kind of insane person puts 165 hours into something they hate [i]this much?[/i]), I just cannot see the appeal here in this game or its deeply flawed systems or its one-dimensional approach to combat.\n\nFor the record I also dislike Wilds.",

      "review": "(This includes Sunbreak)\n(+I hate Steam's formatting SO MUCH)\nI hate this game and I feel like I spent enough time trying not to.\n\n+ the music is 9/10, it would be a 10 if they didn't break the golden rule of saving vocals for very specific elder dragon fights\n+ weapons have multiple distinct playstyles!\n+ varied roster of monsters\n+ malzeno is pretty cool\n\n- the entire game is based around counters, every weapon is now effectively a longsword - if this isn't your thing, move along\n- spiribirds are an annoying necessity that require you to memorise and run a path through every zone at the start of every hunt with no exceptions, even Capcom acknowledge they're stupid by giving you a single giant spiribird that buffs every stat to maximum at the start of any hunt in an arena\n- switch and silkbind skills are this game's entire identity and you better like using them because nothing else has any real value - silkbinds can do thousands of damage, but the core moveset of your weapon will do a couple hundred at best and most of the weapons have their entire movesets made irrelevant by silkbinds as a result\n- [b]IMPORTANT NOTE:[/b] invulnerability frames granted by rolls and other sources of evasions are tied to your framerate, the higher your framerate the worse your evasion is so be prepared to cap your FPS to 60 or lower\n- almost every monster follows a pattern of three attacks then roar, this is annoyingly predictable to the point that it just becomes a shopping list of evasive actions to take every time the monster moves\n- speaking of monsters being annoying, there are random attacks that are same-frame multihits meaning they punish you for using specific types of counters or guards, lance in particular gets punished for using insta-block or anchor rage against tetranadon's belly flop because it hits twice for some reason and WILL hit you on the second tick, i wouldn't be so mad about this if it wasn't A) so prevalent throughout the game and B) on the most random fucking attacks like seriously why does the belly flop hit twice\n- talismans and decorations, at least world rewards you for playing the game and even though an attack boost decoration is exceedingly rare, it's not as though having attack boost 7 is gating you from a specific playstyle; this game meanwhile you can expect to be blocked from playing how you want for infinite hours unless you mod in the talisman you want, and in 165 hours my experience with decorations has been getting forced to repeatedly do high rank hunts for rare materials to forge decorations i need for my MASTER RANK equipment - why i can't just do master rank hunts for this is beyond me\n- certain skills are just too damn strong - Capcom really doesn't know how to balance, because now instead of agitator and weakness exploit being king, it's the likes of buildup boost, powder mantle and intrepid heart being effectively mandatory, and now elemental completely sweeps the floor with raw in every scenario\n- i didn't even make it to the point where this is applies to me, but i've seen enough complaints that endgame is FULL of oneshots which is why intrepid heart is mandatory - Capcom's idea of endgame difficulty was apparently to turn every monster into Fatalis and be capable of oneshotting you at all times\n- anomalies just feel bad to fight, everyone complains about dps checks in monster hunter and yet afflicted monsters are just a dps check from start to finish, only worse because you're just poking the glowing red bits until the monster falls over - god forbid it's mizutsune and you're using a lance, why doesn't anyone talk about how [i]insufferably ass[/i] this is\n- they ruined velkhana so badly that its music doesn't even fit the fight anymore\n- endemic life basically doesn't exist\n- monsters barely interact with eachother at all feel like they follow traffic light rules - they're either fighting or they're not\n- i know it's a switch port but the game looks like trash\n- the UI is STILL terrible my god, both world AND wilds feel better here\n\nI do not buy into the hype and I have thoroughly hated my time playing this. I genuinely do not see any reason to recommend this game to anyone, and cannot fathom why this game is so beloved. It's not as though I don't have experience with MH and it's not as though I haven't given this game a fair shot (what kind of insane person puts 165 hours into something they hate [i]this much?[/i]), I just cannot see the appeal here in this game or its deeply flawed systems or its one-dimensional approach to combat.\n\nFor the record I also dislike Wilds.",

A good game doesn't tell you how to play it, it shows you imo. This was just an instruction manual with pretty graphics. It's a shame because I've heard good things about this game, but I just couldn't get past all the text boxes. Not for me.",
