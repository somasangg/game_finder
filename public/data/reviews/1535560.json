There are also daily discounts on random store perks to make it easier to snatch them all up as a free to play player. I haven't gotten to interact with the seasonal much, but that seems like a really cool way to have an in-game competition between players with great rewards even for just participating.

Loading a mid-game to endgame file (A16) took minutes every now and then. I know some ingame currencies evolve at A30 and A40 - and I suspect that's at least partially tied to this. I often left the game on running overnight and more often than not woke up to the game being frozen & crashed.\n3) It's REALLY easy to corrupt your file - so unlike me, make an account to have your backups. My save was stuck on loading for hours so probably was fucked - and trying to get back to where I was with a new file and a bit of cheatengine broke it again, so I just took a look at the last tab I hadn't unlocked cheating some more, and now I'm bitterly droping it earlier than I wanted to. (afaik dev tries to help with that, but given I did cheat their microtransactions prior to my first save breaking, I wasn't gonna waste their time)\n\nTLDR : Worth playing if you like idle games, but don't try to fiddle with it or run it for too long + make backups.",

But it's a trap, a well conceived trap, to keep you in a state of distraction while managing hundred of meaningless details in a video game. You will still feel empty inside. You will feel starved of accomplishments while playing this, fully knowing that this time is forever lost and you achieve nothing. And at some point, at ascension or reincarnation, or any reset, the feeling of emptiness will grow, because you are not taking care of yourself and instead fall for idle games (which are not games but a trap to tap into your feeble mind). This is exploiting your weaknesses.\r\n\r\nNow that I feel better, I realised this game in fact did NOT help me, nor any moment passed \"playing\" it was entertaining and satisfying. IT WAS NOT.\r\n\r\nFun is elsewhere. Help is also elsewhere.",
