I had plenty of fun revisiting the campaigns, re-engaging with the factions, and simply enjoying that old-school strategy feeling that i loved as a kid.\n\nHowever veterans who already know the ins and outs of the original, you won’t find earth-shattering changes here. The “definitive” label might raise expectations of a full overhaul, but what you get is more of a well-polished restoration. Whether it’s worth the price to YOU comes down to how much YOU value nostalgia, smoother performance, and easier modding over new gameplay features.\n\nAs of this review they do have a team that is actively patching bugs(Old and New) and correcting other issues so that's a plus\n\nI’d give it roughly 8/10 from where I sit now: solid, fun, spiritually intact, but not transformational.",

The first 20 hours in was good and was confused about the graphics as it looked like the same the original, Until I discovered my settings were set to low, once I realised this error I switched the graphics to top tier and thats when I experienced the 'remaster' of the game. Playing the original campaign and winter assault was good, but the x factor is dark crusade. I'm almost completed the story for all the factions which has been amazing so far. Just some tips before you purchase this remaster, don't play Necrons if this is your first time playing the game, because they are slow - wait until you've played a couple of factions. Don't go in expecting sc2 graphics, but if you're in for the nostalgia experience, then this game is for you. When I first learned about the remaster, I was hoping they would include Tyranids as a surprise, but that didn't happen. I give this remaster 9/10. If Tyranids were included, I would have raised it to 11.",

None of the core gameplay has been changed, while all of the elements that bring this Strategy game together, have been tweaked and reworked and updated to a point that makes revisiting this title well worth the asking price.\n\nDawn of War Definitive Edition is extremely polished and feature complete.  This also makes it the perfect time for newcomers to jump into the Dawn of War series.  Not only is it a great strategy game, it is also a great Warhammer 40k game, that follows the lore and subject matter faithfully, encapsulating everything that fans of both WH40k and Strategy games will enjoy if they appreciate a good RTS and the Grim Dark story and universe that the game is set in.\n\nI've only scratched the surface of the definitive version.  However, after playing about 100 hours of the original Dawn of War, I can safely say that this truly is the definitive version, and that all its greatness has been echoed by other reviewers.\n\nWell worth it at full price and even better when on sale.  A great game with great lore and countless hours of gameplay.  This is how you update a classic game for todays standards without compromising its gameplay or artistic direction.",

Some games like Iron Harvest try to capture the same magic, but most seem too preoccupied with changing, adding or \"simplifying\" mechanics to the point that Starcraft 2 is still mainstream today because it just hasn't tried to fix what isn't broken, and hasn't faced competition. \n\nThe original Dawn of War is, and always has been the pinnacle of RTS design in my opinion. From playing it religiously in my youth since launch day to still firing up a campaign every few months in my 30's, nothing matches the incredible squad and upgrade mechanics and balance of resource management. The pacing is perfect, not devolving into early game pure aggression, but not turning into a 4x of late-game deployment either. It's not uncommon to build all the buildings in an average match, even when trying to win fast.\n\nThe only downside to the original Dawn of War has always been the pathing. Large groups of units or multiple selected squads would move weirdly, traffic jams were common, and units would choose strange distances to stand at when firing. This definitive edition is an incredible execution of \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\"! They didn't change a single thing except for the pathing, and modernizing the UI scaling, audio quality, texture resolution and world lighting. Heck, they even kept the original cinematic scream after initially changing it to a dialogue line because feedback craved the original.\n\nThey even preserved mod support! 10/10, refreshed something that was already close to perfect, and that nobody was asking for, at a great price with great reward for loyalty.",

Like the one i just mentioned which hasn't been fixed in their most recent patch or brought up on their \"known issues\" which is also a pain to find as they have several links for it but none actually lead you to the the forum, you can only see it if you view their most recent patch notes and looks at the bottom.\n\nAllied Teammates have no coordination between each other and often you cannot run a quick start game in skirmish (PvAI) due to the inherent incompetence of the allies who run early assaults on enemy bases and lose their troops only to get annihilated while you're still waiting for troops spawn. This happens no matter what difficulty you play on and the AI never attempts to rebuild that initial force in full. This essentially forces you to babysit allied AI so they have a fighting chance against enemy AI which coordinates assaults perfectly. I absolutely love RTS games and this one is good, but the bugs do not help with wanting to play the campaign (which is missing specific cutscenes) or relax on single player skirmish. Which leads to the multiplayer which is fun but if you've ever played an RTS you'd know the sweat is so real it seethes through your screen from the enemy player.\n\nIf they end up fixing the game it might be worth the buy, but as it stands i currently regret my purchase and inability to refund because of too much playtime.",

      "review": "Relic entertainment with their big brains have finally done it! They managed to make a definitive edition of the greatest RTS of all time with almost zero efforts! After a full day of \"hard working\", they slapped a 29.99$ before went to bed. They promised us that they will stay faithful to the original and they did. Everything from original DOW are all here including problems and bugs. That's what I call a faithful remastered!\n\nThe main reasons that made me bought this version are the new promising pathfinding system and more modding support. Now that I've ran out of copium. Let's see what makes this a negative review.\n[list] \n[*]In the ORI ver; the big battle looks awkward and it's hard to micro units efficiently since they will try not to step on each other toes. The DEF ver. fixes these issues by removing the fucking unit occlusions, now you can have 2 tanks or three rhinos humping each other in the glorius HD. Soulstorm seems to fix this but for other modes, nope. \n\n[*]Melee battles respond so much better in DEF. But since you can phase through friendly units, results in a weird disengage or double engages. Instead of fighting one at a time in a tight space, now you'll have 2 or sometimes 3 squads orgies. Occasionally one of them will just say \"I'mma do my own thing\" before marathon 2 kilos passing through the orgies to disrupt your backline, his squads are still fighting with the frontline btw.\n\n  Or one unit of your squad got body blocked by the enemies during retreat, instead of just leave him there. The rest will now run back in a circle, so they can regroup with the lost one. Semper Fi, I guess? The solution to this is to keep commanding them to retreat until that lost one is dead (In ORI I just simply retreat with ease).\n\n[*]What about units stuck into terrains or to each other? Yeah, still there. If you're unlucky then you'll have to delete the entire squad since they won't move until Larry can get out of the creek. I only have to do this once in ORI but somehow DEF manages to surpass that.\n\n[*]Air units sucked in Ori visually and gameplay wise, it looks like they tried not to fly above the ground units so they ended up in janky movements. In DEF, they still sucked but in HD. \n\n[*]Transporter units often refused to take any passengers unless you managed to find the correct meridian angle. And when you unload them there are 50/50 chance that some units will fuse with the transporter, forcing you to load/unload again. I only encounter this once in MP (Soulstorm). But in SP campaigns, it happened a lot to the point I don't even bother using them (except in SS). \n\n[*]Cutscenes still glitch to this day. Where there're supposed to be events and voicelines, they simply skip it. ORI is still fine even with mods so I don't know why.\n\n[*]Campaign bugs still persist including the infamous end mission crashes. This is wild, I've never thought I will see bugsplats again. SS in ORI is not stable at all and require mods to fix the problem. It seems that I'll have to wait for modders to do Relic's job again.\n\n[*]Game expansions and it's rules: They decided to combine every expansions into one launcher and for that I must thank you. But what's the point of combining them, if you can't change the game rules and force the players to only play SS rule in MP. If you not gonna change it then please fix the goddamn awful aerial systems.\n\n[*]Shadow: Your unit shadows will skywalk in SP and MP, must be the work of warp trickery or just another ignored problem. This one isn't presence in ORI so thanks for the new feature, I guess?\n\n[*]Zoom and color: A little bit further is not what I can call an improvement. Even with the maximum zoom out, it's still not that good for big battles which happen a lot more than you think. Combined with some map extra saturated color, you will have almost zero visibility when max zoom out. The mod from ORI does fix this issue with more zoom options. But come on, It's so tiresome to see that they can't do it properly and have to rely on modders. \n  \n[*]Visual upgrade: Yes, overall it's better than ORI which is 20 years old now. But it seemed they heavily relied on the AI upscale to the point that the sprites, face and some body models are so bad when compare to ORI. It's not \"pixelated bad\", it's uncanny and scuffed bad. On initial launch ver. it was so bad to the point that I've to play ORI again just to prove that I was not hallucinating. There's no way any veterans see DEF and said my man Gabriel's face looked better than ORI and really didn't look like he was wearing a human leather face. They've fixed this but still how did you even let this happended at first place? Is it that hard to hire artists to smooth the final products before release? Where's the QC team? \n\n[*]Framerate shouldn't become a problem since they upgraded the game to a newer engine, but in a big fight I sometimes get a significant drop. Don't know why, It's a vanilla and not crazy mods like UA/Uni, runs on SSD with plenty rooms to spare. I chose not to play UA in ORI because in a fullscale war, it ended up with not enjoyable/massive stutters. Why does the new one stutter from a 3 vs 3 that's not even at pop cap?\n\n[*]For modding\nThere's no dedicated mod page in the game or the community except the Mod UI in the menu. You want mods? Go find it yourself, loser LMAO. This doesn't encourage the new players to install mods at all. \nYes, they did it right by saying DEF will support more modding by providing more tools and playgrounds which is superb for all the modders. I just hope the game will actually be able to handle that much craziness in the near future but considering DOW IV is coming out next year, I've lost faith. I feel like this definitive is a nostalgic-bait made purely to cash grab older players by the balls. Todd Howard would be proud of your work.\n[/list]\n[h1]*TLDR*[/h1];\n- [b]Lazy[/b] is what I will define this version on initial launch, a month passed by and it's still a half-assed remastered of a 20 years-old game. Yes there're patches that fix things later on and all these for me, are minor-mid inconveniences that I can simply ignore. But considered that I paid 26.99$ for this. I just can't gives a thumbs up for now.\n\nI still recommend the new players to buy this game with a heavy discount. The game is good because the foundation is just that good. DEF does make some aspects much better than ORI. But definitely not for a full price. \nOverpromise and underdeliver shouldn't be reward with more money than it actually deserved.\nInstead use your money to support the modders that keep doing the god emperor's work for all of us players. May the emperor protects them!\n\n*Edit* There're additional quick-lazy review in the comment with no intention of making them cohesive with the main review; just like how the devs edit this game.",

That would have pleased the community🙌 and also made your job of creating a remaster easier.\n\nInstead, we received a game that still runs on a single thread, with old bugs plus new ones, and with outdated textures, icons, and maps. On top of that, the ability to automatically download missing maps from other players — something games had back in the 2000s — is still missing🫠.\n\nThere are also problems with map loading, player waiting times, and banners. In the lobby, you can’t even see the map preview if the host is using a different language.

That's a good thing right? \nGenerally yes, BUT there are also some you HAVE TO play multiplayer for. Yeah, thanks, no.\nI played way too many multiplayer games in my life and I'm just sick of toxic multiplayer games/game modes.\nI decided for myself not to be near that kind of behaviour anymore\n\nSo I decided to give my opinion in their Discord to see if I am the only one who doesn't want to touch the multiplayer part.\nGuess what, Toxic replies, one after another, so that a mod had to clean up. The same Toxic behaviour you'd expect from the steam forums, and that represents the playerbase in this, a playerbase I definitely want to avoid. \nI know they just want to bump multiplayer numbers with those achievements, but to me it's a dealbreaker.\n\nI will keep an eye out for future updates but my hopes are pretty low. Until something positive happens in that direction, the game stays uninstalled and I will play something else in wait for DoW4.\n\nCheers",

The few improvements provided do not make up for the additional bugs, and the frustrating experience of playing the campaigns during these rounds of patches that break your progress. Clearly Relic is only interested in fleecing its fans with releasing anniversary editions and now lazy \"definitive\" editions in quick succession for DoW and Space Marine.

The path tracing is absolute crap and leads to more problems than not, like the Tau (who have immense range) shooting through solid walls they and mountains shouldn't be able to and still dealing full damage. The devs are fully reliant upon users reporting bugs, as it seems like their list of \"known issues\" dwindles while many still remain present in the game. Like the one i just mentioned which hasn't been fixed in their most recent patch or brought up on their \"known issues\" which is also a pain to find as they have several links for it but none actually lead you to the the forum, you can only see it if you view their most recent patch notes and looks at the bottom.\n\nAllied Teammates have no coordination between each other and often you cannot run a quick start game in skirmish (PvAI) due to the inherent incompetence of the allies who run early assaults on enemy bases and lose their troops only to get annihilated while you're still waiting for troops spawn. This happens no matter what difficulty you play on and the AI never attempts to rebuild that initial force in full. This essentially forces you to babysit allied AI so they have a fighting chance against enemy AI which coordinates assaults perfectly. I absolutely love RTS games and this one is good, but the bugs do not help with wanting to play the campaign (which is missing specific cutscenes) or relax on single player skirmish. Which leads to the multiplayer which is fun but if you've ever played an RTS you'd know the sweat is so real it seethes through your screen from the enemy player.\n\nIf they end up fixing the game it might be worth the buy, but as it stands i currently regret my purchase and inability to refund because of too much playtime.",
