You can mine, fish, catch critters, farm crops, there are collection mechanic for everything, you can dress up your character in so many ways. Game is very generous for free players if you are willing to invest your time. Also store items are rather cheap, I got cool costume and 7 days of premium only for 2 dollars! The only downside that there are hackers who instantly teleport to critters and stones. Oh, also in 12 hours I chatted like 3 times only, so if you are looking for more social game this is not the best option. Overall 7/10. I don't remember when I played so much time in 1 day, so give it a try!",

Some people also put 18-21+ in their profile pic, which is weird. They only come by once in maybe several days in the Plaza. Probably been reported but I don't know. Am a little worried about hidden condo houses. \nAlso, weddings are real. I will not find a lesbian nor do I want one just for the wedding perks.\nHackers are everywhere. They often look into their phone (animation) before teleporting to a nearby boulder to mine or event enemy to fight with an overpowered weapon won with Gacha. PVE and mining events are a haven to hackers because they teleport (do not buy the event currency for the coin stack. I have tried to get a cool looking jacket and I have failed ;-;).\n\nKey note, I report these weirdos and block them but there are too many to count. Even the richest players are hackers. \nLastly, some of the minigames are copied from popular games, some of them being Roblox. Tower of Hell from Roblox? Nah we got Tower of Infinity. Fall Guys? We have Game Party. \n\nOther than that, it's a pretty chill game. \nThe title \"Play Together\" is a suggestion lol. Clubs are mostly there for cards sadly, but parties have RP :D. \nIt can be grindy to get furniture for a large house, vehicles for traveling, and other things. \nI like the animal crossing mechanics as well as the quests and school. While some quests feel like a sell-out, they are all worth it in the end because they are fetch quests. The school is hard to get A+ on report card, but fun.\n Minigames, while copies of original games, are still OK as long as you have the patience to wait for other players to join you. I personally like the fashion show minigame cause it has less people and you can buy VIP with gems. Plus, doing parkour games is easy as long as you get the right timing for jumping (it's like once you take a jump, it's a decision you'll either like or don't like depending on if you get bounced by a wall ;-;). I don't like the infected minigame or the battlegrounds minigame. The infected minigame feels like a closed POV even though its a prop hunt, and the battlegrounds minigame is easy to spend too many tickets just by learning it. \nEvents can either be a letdown or easy. Fishing events are nice and relaxed. Gathering events are somewhat stressful but somewhat fair. \nI would still recommend this game to others as something to play once in a while to decompress. Just keep in mind that this is a free to play game with a LOT of microtransactions (mostly outfits or cheat items for minigames and currency items).\n Do not gamble for outfits lol. I'd recommend some of the outfit sets that don't involve in-currency gems because 1) some look epic such as the zodiac outfits and 2) Gambling sucks. \n\nSo overall, good. Don't recommend to kids or gamblers. Will still play.",

You can earn level achievements, dress up your character with hundreds of clothing items to chose from, make friends, take pictures and videos, drive tons of different vehicles- including skateboards, bikes, boats, helicopters, and sports cars. You can also fish, catch bugs, mine, craft items, farm, host parties, raise pets, raise minime's (babies) collect cute keychain toys, play mini games alone or together with a group, watch YouTube videos together in your house, attend play school, collect name titles, roleplay, and MUCH MORE.. and that's all without paying a cent! I also didn't even mention the in depth story based events released every 2 weeks! You can earn currency, outfits, vehicles, pets, and tons more!! If you enjoy cozy games like Animal Crossing, Roblox, and/or Sims than PLAY TOGETHER is 100% a must try!",

You can mine, fish, catch critters, farm crops, there are collection mechanic for everything, you can dress up your character in so many ways. Game is very generous for free players if you are willing to invest your time. Also store items are rather cheap, I got cool costume and 7 days of premium only for 2 dollars! The only downside that there are hackers who instantly teleport to critters and stones. Oh, also in 12 hours I chatted like 3 times only, so if you are looking for more social game this is not the best option. Overall 7/10. I don't remember when I played so much time in 1 day, so give it a try!",

I'm glad I did because this game is just an all around relaxing and wholesome game. It gives you a ton of free stuff and money every day so those who don't spend money on games don't have to. You don't have to log in every day to keep up with some stupid streak, you can log in whenever and unless it's an event, everything stays the same daily reward wise. The quests are cute and you have arrows to tell you where to go so you're not wandering around lost. I'm not sure about how making friends is because I like playing games like this on my own, but it seems like if you want to make friends there are plenty of nice people that play that would be good game buddies. I have yet to come across trolling creeps so thats another pro about this game. I suggest playing this game if you're into cozy games that don't require a lot of brain power to play.",

Beautiful fishes and pets.\n\nCONS:\n- Terrible rate chance (like it's so hard to get a rare item from grinding. Ex: I spent nearly a week to get a blue diamond or even more if I'm not lucky because all I know about this game is base on luck, the hit chance won't do much)\n- Fishing is crazily bored right now, I have a really good fishing rod (it's VIP, VVIP) and guess what no big fish shadow for over 1-2 hours like who are you kidding man? Are you want people enjoy the game by wasting thier time?\n- Pay to Win is just eating your wallet, like i said this game is base on luck not chance rate. You get things by luck, this game's system is so broken. Grinding is pain in the ass, I love grinding, get a VVIP by own hand not moneny and guess what can't even get a rare fish? Like it's taking sooo longg man, your VVIP fishing rod has 100% probability to see or catch a rare fish. I know that \"probability\" means but dude why you have to be a ♥♥♥♥♥ to make those 100% soooo ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hard to see one big shadow fish bruh?\n- Hackers and cheats, commonly ♥♥♥♥ but still annoying me as ♥♥♥♥!\n\nCONLUSION: The game would be great if they low down the chance rate geting items man. I'm 20+ years old, this game would killing my time so much for just fishing and wait to get just ONE rare fish. I mean the game will earn some young players, kids, they would like the game but for me, pain in the ass because i hate the lucky system.",

      "review": "This review is a bit mixed because even though I do recommend it, I also do NOT recommend it. Why? Because even though this is a fun f2p game that has a vibe to animal crossing (without the villagers being animals) and also having the ability to socialize, the \"f2p\" aspect is very much a term you can use loosely. Play Together has events that change quite often, are very fast paced and if you are not one to heavily farm, you WILL fall behind. If you do not pay for certain items in events, like a fishing event having a new fishing pole with stats that help on specific event, you will have a hard time farming. The majority of events have a certain fishing pole, a gun, or an insect net to use and they are very specific to the event being put out.\n\nAnother note on these stats is that you can better the items with certain coins that the game offers you, but when you see probabilities on getting an S rank (being the best), you will see a 0.0445%. These things are to be considered if you are a person that loves to rush farm, like myself, or if you'd rather take it easy. Basically, it is up to the user to see how you want to play this game.\n\nFor Cons, yes, the items are pretty cheap when it comes to clothes in comparison to other games where you can and will buy skins for over $20. The thing is, it really adds up so save the money for certain clothes you'd like. There are themed draws and you will waste a lot of gems, the thing with these gems is that the game gives you so little for free and its a gacha: probability might not be in your favor. There is a certain type of \"pity\" (for genshin players) and it can take up to 100-200 throws for specific draws, just to keep in consideration. The game also offers you tickets for draws but they are a little harder to farm out from gems, its on personal experience since other players might have more luck then I do.\n\nEven though I am a huge fan of this game and I do consider it to be fun, I do want to be transparent that for the majority of events it is Pay To Win instead of the f2p aspect. I do wish that some packages of clothing could be available for gems for those that cannot waste the money (especially the children) to have the liberty of dressing their avatars a little more nice. I do confess that the clothes that the game offers for stars (the currency in-game) is terrible. I hope one day that this game can have more liberty. \n\nThe most important part that I can elaborate is that: PLEASE DO NOT ASK FOR A REFUND BEFORE CONTACTING CUSTOMER SUPPORT FOR THE GAME, YOU WILL GET YOUR ACCOUNT PERMABANNED.\nand also please make sure to never share your account with someone that will not be in your life for a long time, not even if they offer to buy you a skin, because the security for this game is not the best. They cannot and will not close the session of another player that is logged in on any device in your account and there has been instances of players getting hacked and/or having their items recycled (deleted, because you cannot sell items, only recycle). Please take the security a little more serious and do not give access to players that are NOT your close friends irl.\n\nIf anything else that is important and I forgot, I will edit.

Ex: I spent nearly a week to get a blue diamond or even more if I'm not lucky because all I know about this game is base on luck, the hit chance won't do much)\n- Fishing is crazily bored right now, I have a really good fishing rod (it's VIP, VVIP) and guess what no big fish shadow for over 1-2 hours like who are you kidding man? Are you want people enjoy the game by wasting thier time?\n- Pay to Win is just eating your wallet, like i said this game is base on luck not chance rate. You get things by luck, this game's system is so broken. Grinding is pain in the ass, I love grinding, get a VVIP by own hand not moneny and guess what can't even get a rare fish? Like it's taking sooo longg man, your VVIP fishing rod has 100% probability to see or catch a rare fish.

      "review": "This review is a bit mixed because even though I do recommend it, I also do NOT recommend it. Why? Because even though this is a fun f2p game that has a vibe to animal crossing (without the villagers being animals) and also having the ability to socialize, the \"f2p\" aspect is very much a term you can use loosely. Play Together has events that change quite often, are very fast paced and if you are not one to heavily farm, you WILL fall behind. If you do not pay for certain items in events, like a fishing event having a new fishing pole with stats that help on specific event, you will have a hard time farming. The majority of events have a certain fishing pole, a gun, or an insect net to use and they are very specific to the event being put out.\n\nAnother note on these stats is that you can better the items with certain coins that the game offers you, but when you see probabilities on getting an S rank (being the best), you will see a 0.0445%. These things are to be considered if you are a person that loves to rush farm, like myself, or if you'd rather take it easy. Basically, it is up to the user to see how you want to play this game.\n\nFor Cons, yes, the items are pretty cheap when it comes to clothes in comparison to other games where you can and will buy skins for over $20. The thing is, it really adds up so save the money for certain clothes you'd like. There are themed draws and you will waste a lot of gems, the thing with these gems is that the game gives you so little for free and its a gacha: probability might not be in your favor. There is a certain type of \"pity\" (for genshin players) and it can take up to 100-200 throws for specific draws, just to keep in consideration. The game also offers you tickets for draws but they are a little harder to farm out from gems, its on personal experience since other players might have more luck then I do.\n\nEven though I am a huge fan of this game and I do consider it to be fun, I do want to be transparent that for the majority of events it is Pay To Win instead of the f2p aspect. I do wish that some packages of clothing could be available for gems for those that cannot waste the money (especially the children) to have the liberty of dressing their avatars a little more nice. I do confess that the clothes that the game offers for stars (the currency in-game) is terrible. I hope one day that this game can have more liberty. \n\nThe most important part that I can elaborate is that: PLEASE DO NOT ASK FOR A REFUND BEFORE CONTACTING CUSTOMER SUPPORT FOR THE GAME, YOU WILL GET YOUR ACCOUNT PERMABANNED.\nand also please make sure to never share your account with someone that will not be in your life for a long time, not even if they offer to buy you a skin, because the security for this game is not the best. They cannot and will not close the session of another player that is logged in on any device in your account and there has been instances of players getting hacked and/or having their items recycled (deleted, because you cannot sell items, only recycle). Please take the security a little more serious and do not give access to players that are NOT your close friends irl.\n\nIf anything else that is important and I forgot, I will edit.

      "review": "This review is a bit mixed because even though I do recommend it, I also do NOT recommend it. Why? Because even though this is a fun f2p game that has a vibe to animal crossing (without the villagers being animals) and also having the ability to socialize, the \"f2p\" aspect is very much a term you can use loosely. Play Together has events that change quite often, are very fast paced and if you are not one to heavily farm, you WILL fall behind. If you do not pay for certain items in events, like a fishing event having a new fishing pole with stats that help on specific event, you will have a hard time farming. The majority of events have a certain fishing pole, a gun, or an insect net to use and they are very specific to the event being put out.\n\nAnother note on these stats is that you can better the items with certain coins that the game offers you, but when you see probabilities on getting an S rank (being the best), you will see a 0.0445%. These things are to be considered if you are a person that loves to rush farm, like myself, or if you'd rather take it easy. Basically, it is up to the user to see how you want to play this game.\n\nFor Cons, yes, the items are pretty cheap when it comes to clothes in comparison to other games where you can and will buy skins for over $20. The thing is, it really adds up so save the money for certain clothes you'd like. There are themed draws and you will waste a lot of gems, the thing with these gems is that the game gives you so little for free and its a gacha: probability might not be in your favor. There is a certain type of \"pity\" (for genshin players) and it can take up to 100-200 throws for specific draws, just to keep in consideration. The game also offers you tickets for draws but they are a little harder to farm out from gems, its on personal experience since other players might have more luck then I do.\n\nEven though I am a huge fan of this game and I do consider it to be fun, I do want to be transparent that for the majority of events it is Pay To Win instead of the f2p aspect. I do wish that some packages of clothing could be available for gems for those that cannot waste the money (especially the children) to have the liberty of dressing their avatars a little more nice. I do confess that the clothes that the game offers for stars (the currency in-game) is terrible. I hope one day that this game can have more liberty. \n\nThe most important part that I can elaborate is that: PLEASE DO NOT ASK FOR A REFUND BEFORE CONTACTING CUSTOMER SUPPORT FOR THE GAME, YOU WILL GET YOUR ACCOUNT PERMABANNED.\nand also please make sure to never share your account with someone that will not be in your life for a long time, not even if they offer to buy you a skin, because the security for this game is not the best. They cannot and will not close the session of another player that is logged in on any device in your account and there has been instances of players getting hacked and/or having their items recycled (deleted, because you cannot sell items, only recycle). Please take the security a little more serious and do not give access to players that are NOT your close friends irl.\n\nIf anything else that is important and I forgot, I will edit.

      "review": "Well first let me give this some pros and cons:\nPROS:\n- Graphic is decent nice, it's cute if i want to give it a perfect word to describe.\n- Events are fun, I pretty like the design and creative this game has to offer.\n- Good community, I can add many friends and reach out.\n- Assets or Items are well made. Beautiful fishes and pets.\n\nCONS:\n- Terrible rate chance (like it's so hard to get a rare item from grinding. Ex: I spent nearly a week to get a blue diamond or even more if I'm not lucky because all I know about this game is base on luck, the hit chance won't do much)\n- Fishing is crazily bored right now, I have a really good fishing rod (it's VIP, VVIP) and guess what no big fish shadow for over 1-2 hours like who are you kidding man? Are you want people enjoy the game by wasting thier time?\n- Pay to Win is just eating your wallet, like i said this game is base on luck not chance rate. You get things by luck, this game's system is so broken. Grinding is pain in the ass, I love grinding, get a VVIP by own hand not moneny and guess what can't even get a rare fish? Like it's taking sooo longg man, your VVIP fishing rod has 100% probability to see or catch a rare fish. I know that \"probability\" means but dude why you have to be a ♥♥♥♥♥ to make those 100% soooo ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hard to see one big shadow fish bruh?\n- Hackers and cheats, commonly ♥♥♥♥ but still annoying me as ♥♥♥♥!\n\nCONLUSION: The game would be great if they low down the chance rate geting items man. I'm 20+ years old, this game would killing my time so much for just fishing and wait to get just ONE rare fish. I mean the game will earn some young players, kids, they would like the game but for me, pain in the ass because i hate the lucky system.",

All of the cute customizable options (hair, faces, clothes, etc) are either locked behind a paywall that requires real-life money or is just too expensive for the measely amount of cash you make in-game [i] (why is a shirt 4,000 in-game dollars when I'm only earning a couple hundred bucks per sale? or less per achievement?) [/i] That's not even getting into how the game floods you with gifts and rewards for the first day or so, getting you used to recieving all these gifts and currency only to lock it behind a subscription. Diabolical.\r\n\r\nIn short, way too much going on and I don't really feel like I get to choose what to do- I'm either grinding for funds to spend on stuff I actually want, or I'm running around trying to fulfill what my avatar or their pet/child wants to do. There also doesn't appear to be a way to organize the crops at your housing plot once you plant them. They gave me a sapling shovel, but it doesn't work on any of the fully grown crops- which is really unfortunate.",
