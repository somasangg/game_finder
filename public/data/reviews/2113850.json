Since then I have opened it just about every time I have worked on assignments, I have got every achievement, and reached level 174 in game. As I am writing this I have just submitted the last assessment for my degree, with 1830 hours in this game.\n\nThis productivity tool has helped me so much through all of my studies, using the checklists, stopwatch, and journal, as well as just to have a comforting scene running on a different monitor to help ease some stress. The game offers plenty of customisation, which only gets better with every update, allowing you to create the perfect cozy space for you and your lofi avatar. I lastly want to note the developers, as they're amazing too! Always listening to feedback, and making the best decisions when it comes to DLC, payments, and new content. I hope they are all really proud of what they have created.\n\n10/10",

Having the soothing sound of lo-fi music with white noise play in the background while I tend to my daily tasks makes the overwhelm of daily life so much more tolerable. I love the Homework Radio and Lofi Girl playlists! Normally, even just thinking about doing my chores would paralyze me with fear and stress. With the tools in this game, I don't feel stress nearly as much as I used to.\n\nThere is a journal, a timer, a habit tracker, and a to-do list setting all conveniently placed in the game. The UI is so pretty, and seems methodically implemented. I never have any issues with the way the game is designed. Everything functions the way it should. I've tried other productivity games before, and they were all so buggy and messy. I never have those problems here.\n\nSpirit City Lofi Sessions has genuinely improved my productivity ever since I got it. Thanks to this game, I have come to the point where I look forward to starting my day instead of dreading it. And that is a *huge* deal for someone like me. I can't recommend this game enough.\n\n10/10, and I give this rating with so much love and adoration. Game devs, I hope your food is always delicious and that the weather is always perfect for you, thank you for making this game <3",

      "review": "Firstly, my rating: 5/5 ⭐\r\n\r\nThis lovely gem of a tool also got an update, so I wanted to also recommend this one. \r\n\r\nSpirit City is partly a game, partly a productivity tool and it does both very well. This game gets updates fairly often, and the DLCs are quite reasonably priced. You can decorate your character's space (home and now a train) and your character as well as their spirit companion. There is also a journal, timer and to do list for all of your organization needs. They have vastly improved how these work in recent updates, and they also changed the UI quite a bit. In this last update, they also included the ability to change the color of the UI as well so it blends better with the look you're trying to achieve. All around? Fantastic. \r\n\r\nI do wish there were more eye/face options, but it appears those are in the works via the most recent update. I also kind of hate that the esc key now doesn't leave the current menu you're in, it will immediately just give you a pop-up asking if you want to quit out of the game entirely... but that's a minor and petty annoyance and not really a criticism of the devs. I'm sure there is also a way to probably change the key on that, I just haven't looked for it yet. The game has also crashed more on me now within the last two updates than it ever did in the past, but I'm sure that will get hotfixed since the new patch just came out. All very minor complaints, and nothing that has hindered my enjoyment too much. \r\n\r\nI've played other similar game/tools and they just don't have the same cozy feeling that this one evokes, they've really done a great job at dominating the niche that this game/tool resides in. No one else has done it quite the same way, and I haven't lost interest in this game like I have the others. So, well done. I'm excited to see what the future holds for Spirit City.",

Whether you’re trying to avoid the endless trap of scrolling online or simply need gentle reminders to take breaks, it does a great job at keeping you grounded and on track. With its various functions—timers, ambience settings, focus modes—you can easily shape the tool into whatever suits your workflow.\r\n\r\nThe art is adorable, and the extensive customization options allow you to theme your room and character exactly how you like. It adds a personal touch that makes returning to your little space surprisingly comforting. The lofi music is just right: calming without being boring, and present without ever distracting you or making you want to sing along.\r\n\r\nFor the price, it’s pretty reasonable even at full cost, and it also tends to go on sale often. As for achievements, they’re extremely easy—mostly unlocked by opening different tool functions or setting specific ambience combinations to discover companions.\r\n\r\nOverall, Spirit City: Lofi Sessions is a charming, cozy productivity companion. If you enjoy lofi aesthetics, gentle structure, and a customizable focus space, this is a lovely tool to have in your routine.",

I think if those 2 things were added it'd really take the game into the next level in terms of focus (having the game play on a phone while I focus on other stuff on my computer so I always have knowledge on what tasks I'm working on and how much time I have left) and in terms of enjoyment (I'm certain that people can make absolutely bonkers decorations and player models if we were allowed to put them into the game.)",

I like and listen to lofi, but often I need to concentrate more with no music or I want to listen to my own music, so in the past I've used various websites or YT to play sound effects. I've pretty much switched entirely over to this game!\n\nThis game has lots of sound effects, from city and forest, pink and white noise, or just good rain and snow, even background chatter or food cooking, and the sound effects are great! I haven't been distracted by repeating effects yet. I actually bought this game for  friend just based on how solid the sound effects are!\n\nThere is gamified to do lists and timers and a lovely journal, to say nothing of exploring the space with the cute spirits you can find. I made myself and find myself knitting or sipping tea in various space in game while IRL I do other things. \n\nOverall this is a wonderful game.

It functions best as a body-doubling tool and soundtrack in my experience. It is simply enjoyable to have it up on my second monitor to look at, as well, and the system for unlocking more spirits does encourage long periods of \"play.\" I also love the expansions (yay trains!!).\r\n\r\nOn the less positive side (depending on what you're looking for), I do not find the built-in productivity tools to be enjoyable or worth using. There is a timer, a to-do list, and a journal, but I rarely use them. They give meager rewards for use and I don't enjoy how they look or function, personally. I think there are MUCH better implementations of the pomodoro method, for example, like PomoFarm. So, if you're looking for a game that keeps you on track to maximize productivity, I would not say Spirit City is that. And honestly, the currency takes a long time to earn and when I run out of new Spirits to unlock I find it harder to motivate to play for long periods.\r\n\r\nOverall, I do really recommend this game!

Clicking off the completed tasks helped me stay focused, get the dopamine rush of ticking off a task and also motivated me to continue! I could take a break and customise my character, which was amazing!\n\nI actually mentioned this game in the acknowledgement section of my thesis, this is how important this game is to me and how much of a positive impact it had in task management. I likely have ADHD, with autism lol, and it is crazy good how much this game gripped me and kept me on the right trajectory.\n\nThe spirit companions are so adorable, but sometimes I wish we could have multiple at once!\n\nBut seriously, if you're struggling with keeping on top of tasks, remembering tasks and motivating yourself to do tasks, then this game is a game changer and lifesaver! Thank you so much for making this game :) \n\nI'm now going to prep for my Viva (or defence, for those who use that term) and this game is going to get me through the process I am CERTAIN :) \n\nPS: It's also great for chores and housework",

      "review": "Warning: some sorta spoilers and discussion of other things outside the game, like external programs and other games, thanks 4 reading\n\nSpirit City is a jack-of-all-trades study game that does well in every feature you could need in a comfy study timer and companion with a really affordable price for the base game. You can customise your character, your room, use your timer, take notes and make to-do lists and diary entries. Character and room customisation is a fairly new concept for study programs that this game has brought to pc for the first time, but with the other features listed, they’re standard and available in pretty much any study program. Spirit City’s unique aspect is its creature collection system which lets you collect many different critters, with LOTS more being available in DLCs. Nearly everyone can find a spirit that meshes with their vibe, I kinda couldn’t but I appreciate the companionship of my amogus nonetheless. If you ever wanted to collect funnee animals while getting work done, then you’ll enjoy this. It isn’t really my jam and I kinda treat collecting them as a chore, but it's nice to see what new spirit designs the dev team comes up with.\n\nSo these things are all well and good, but I’ll be ignoring the note, diary, calendar and to-do features of this game and any other games I mention going forward, as there are better, more integratable options out there that are superior in form and function to their game counterparts, like google calendar, todoist, notion, obsidian, etc. I’ll be looking at other aspects of the game, like style, models, atmosphere, ambience and stuff. \n\nThe Spirit City team has put lots of effort in their QoL features, which is great and super nice of them, but I feel that their passion doesn’t quite come through in their in-game character models and animation. The style direction of Spirit City is very cute, fantastical and floaty, which makes the game feel kinda juvenile. Not to say that people can’t like that, I feel like it needs more depth to not appear as so. Like I’m super into Slime Rancher but that game and its sequel have plenty of depth with its themes and relationships between the characters. Ways that I’m looking for this in a game without other characters or a progressive story are in facial expressions and subtle animations, that’s probably much because I understand that animating different expressions for each customisable feature would be super difficult, but without this your character feels much less like a character living and breathing in their world and more like a doll.\n\nWhat I believe to be Spirit City’s greatest feature that sets it apart from other games is the variety in environments that you can visit/set and do your junk in. With all the DLCs available right now, with the latest being All Aboard, you have the standard four places in your room, the kitchen, the dining table, the train carriage and balcony. Each of these places have a different vibe that can also be altered by your design sense (you can change the train carriage to resemble the inside of a spaceship!). The exterior scene of your room window and the train carriage can be changed to a lot of different settings, which is great and nice.\n\nA drawback of Spirit City’s room decoration system is that you can’t place items wherever you want, you can choose what type you want and can change the colours on some of them, but the items are in fixed locations. You can’t choose where the bed will be, which is understandable because it’s an interactable setting, but you also can’t change the location of other furniture, like side tables, or decorations like flower pots, mugs, etc. Maybe there’s a performance function for it?\n\nNow I’ll talk about a few other games that do better in specific aspects that Spirit City doesn’t do so well in. If you want a lighter study program that you can run on your laptop or weaker computer while using it, there’s ChillPulse. It has its drawbacks though, such as the less customisable rooms and characters. In Gogh, you can decorate your rooms however you want, being able to place objects anywhere and on anything. The character animations are similarly lacking (so it could be a limitation thing), but the style direction is very strong (which is also quite cute) so this is less obvious and impactful. In Chill With You, you don’t have a customisable character at all, but you can study alongside the established character and chat between study or work sessions like they’re your study partner. With the subtle facial expressions and stretching animations like they’re really putting effort into their work, it feels pretty… intricate, sorta? Like you know this person and you’re working together to reach your individual goals.\n\nAll in all, Spirit City is a good study game that does well in all aspects, so it’s good if you like it or don’t know what exactly you want from your study game. It welcomes you into its colourful world where people study in their cozy rooms with their spirit buddies. \n\nNow go and feel free to study, reading this must’ve taken a while soz  ﹏𓊝﹏𓂁﹏",

I much prefer the higher BPM sounds to make the ears bleed and brain go brrr. So it's great I have that option in-game. I just wish there was also Spotify integration.\n\nMost \"core features\" unlocked from the start:\nSome of the other games of this variety I've tried lock certain things like locations, time of day, and ambient noises behind levelling. This game does not. Nothing is locked behind levelling up. Gaining levels only grants you \"Spirit Credits\" that you use to purchase additional customizations.\n\nLoads of customization options!!!\n\n\nCONS: \n\nDistracting with the whole levelling up mechanics and using \"Spirit Credits\" to purchase decorations:\nIf you're very much ADHD, this may not be the best idle game to get shit done unless you want to get distracted every so often spending your freshly earned Spirit Credits purchasing decorations. \n\nNo way to filter or sort owned decorations and items:\nFurther enabling the distraction because you have to scroll around to find what you want or are missing. More time shopping and scrolling means less time focusing unless you can ignore it. I cannot for I am a distractable goose. \n\nNo ability to favourite or wishlist items: \nSame idea as the above. Wasting time scrolling and shopping.\n\nLimited number of presets:\nGive me more!! At least one preset for each Scenery configuration please!\n\nCan't copy presets:\nYou start with the defaults each time. Kind of annoying if I want to create a different character based off of a copy of my original character with the eyes, hair colour, etc but different clothes and I have to start everything from scratch.\n\nNO PYJAMAS:\nHow are there slippers but no obvious PJs or sleeping caps???",
