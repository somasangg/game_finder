Don't worry, it isn't like Cookie clicker or the like where you have to setup these crazy combos that may or may not make you 10000000000 resources in one click and then you have to wait 8 hours before you can even attempt it again. The strongest part of this game is the amount of stuff you can unlock to try different methods of making the resource. The biggest issue I can give is tied to the dust resource. At some point you will unlock craft dust and items. These are massive improvements that are required to progress-- however, the rate in which you get the craft dust to first make them and then spend it to upgrade them multiple times, is pathetic. You will find that it is basically mandatory to spend real money to buy the craft dust in order to progress through the items or it would take you many months of logging on every day to chip away at it. I am not kidding, I can't even imagine doing it without buying the dust as even after 500 hours (your dust income increases the further in the game you get) it would take me awhile to get enough to unlock everything, let alone, upgrade them all to legendary. Still, amazing game nonetheless.",

      "review": "A well made idle game.\r\nI would even consider it among the best I've played.\r\nThe game is built around building up mana through \"eternities\" which is this games equivelent to most idle games \"prestige\" and then there is another thing called a \"realm\" which I think is something like a true prestige which I haven't tried yet even with my playtime so realms is the late game.\r\nBuilding up mana is initially done trough clicking a magic orb which lets you earn mana to spend on mana sources and other upgrades and unlock requirements for changing class or picking a pet. Classes are the main fun I've had with this game since each class has it's own abilities and ways of earning experience, leveling up your class lets you unlock abilities to earn mana as much mana as possible to go for challange rewards or progression requirements. Pets are one of the main parts of the game, learning what works best for each class is an important part of the idle wizard journey and is definitely one of my favourite features of the game. \r\nAnother core of the game is the gear which is unlocked later than pretty much all idle games I've seen while still being a core of the game, it's based off of armor, items and relics. each aquired and leveled up in a different way and it can be frustrating since leveling up takes a long time and is based on RNG. Gear can have combo bonuses that increase certain attributes that favour differing playstyles and classes so if you start upgrading gear that favours your favourite class but the rng doesn't upgrade relics and items that also favour that class optimally it feels bad and makes you feel forced to start changing your playstyle just to favour what the RNG keeps giving you so you have to slow down progression a lot until RNG favours you or you can build around the RNG.\r\nThere are some ways to get around this but the main one I can think of right now which I haven't even done is going to the real money store to buy currency so that you can buy either permament upgrades or buy temporary boosts/time skips/dust for gear upgrades.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion the game is great and I recommend it greatly even to beginners in the genre of idlers since it has something for pretty much all parts of the idle genre and does it at a high level. This is not a like some of the low quility \"slop\" idle/clicker games I've seen around, this is one of the best. \r\nIn terms of \"Idler\" this game is a 4/5 since it can sometimes be too unclear why you are stuck in progression and can feel like too much of a waste of time.\r\nIn terms of a game overall I would say more like 3/5 since it's features are so good but too spaced apart so the game gets so long that loses it's fun and starts becoming a bit too repetative because of the spacing.\r\n\r\nIf the developer sped up certain things in the game like attribute point gain and reduced the unlock spacing of features like gear/dungeons and made things like upgrading gear more clear like being able to see what upgrading certain equipment will gain in the end other than enchantment effects, This could be done through some sort of \"log book\" tab in the game, then the game would be essentially without flaws in the gameplay loop of learning and building strategies to progress.",

      "review": "[h1][b] TLDR: While not a bad game, Idle Wizard doesn’t bring much of anything to the idle table that dozens of other games haven’t already done. It’s just very average.[/b] [/h1]\r\n\r\n[h1]PROS: [/h1]\r\n➕Classes with unique abilities\r\n➕Spells and “Bursting”\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1]CONS: [/h1]\r\n➖Font style is not pleasant to read\r\n➖Doesn’t really do anything different\r\n➖Boring music\r\n\r\n[h1] [b] Content (Game world/Narrative) – [4/10] [/b] [/h1]\r\nThe game world is simple and consists of different backgrounds and a UI. Most of the backgrounds cost currency to use, so you’ll be staring at the same one for a long time if you are a free player. \r\n\r\nThere isn’t a plot worth mentioning. \r\n\r\n[h1][b] Gameplay (Mechanics/Difficulty) – [6/10] [/b] [/h1]\r\nThe mechanics present are very similar to other F2P idle games, without much differentiation. The only thing that is actually different is the spell casting and classes. You can choose a type of wizard each playthrough and each type of wizard comes with their own spells to use. The spells are all based on increasing profit (mana) output in various ways. \r\nThe kinda cool part that meshes well with the spell casting is what the game calls “Bursting” where you collect a resource the quickly drains, but also greatly increases profit. You then dump all your spells to maximize gain during this window. It's a nice feeling seeing your profit explode due to stacking buffs. \r\n\r\nI didn’t find this difficult. Just grindy. \r\n\r\n[h1] [b] Graphics (Quality/Technical) – [4/10] [/b] [/h1]\r\nGraphics are pretty basic, considering the bulk of the game is UI, there’s not much to it. There are barely animations, and what art there is for portraits and stuff doesn’t look the best. \r\nAlso, the font style is terrible and hard to read. \r\n\r\nOn the technical side, I encountered no issues or bugs. \r\ni9-13900KF | RTX 4090 | 64GB RAM | 1440p @ 240hz | Windows 11 installed on SSD \r\n\r\n[h1] [b] Audio – [2/10] [/b] [/h1]\r\nAudio is a big let-down, especially for a game that you need to have on constantly to make the most out of it. The same boring song loops over and over. \r\n\r\nI didn’t notice any voice acting. \r\n\r\n[h1] [b] Replay Factor (Longevity) – [5/10] [/b] [/h1]\r\nThere’s some good replay value here, as most F2P idle games are a huge grindfest, its no different here with constant prestige-ing. \r\n\r\n[h1] [b] Final Verdict – [5/10] [/b] [/h1]\r\nIdle Wizard (IW) is a fairly traditional F2P idle game that doesn’t shake up the formula too much. The general loop is you’ve got your typical prestige-type reruns in which you accumulate a currency that you must keep prestigeing to obtain, over and over. \r\n\r\nAs I mentioned above in the mechanics area, I think that the classes and spells add some small creativeness to the game, but it’s not enough to set it apart from the dozens of other entries. \r\n\r\nOverall, I found Idle Wizard to be uninteresting and the loop to be too predictable. I don’t think it’s necessarily a bad game, but it's just very average in the sea of idle F2P games. Due to this I would recommend it, as there’s nothing wrong with it, but just know that if you’ve played other F2P idle games, then you’ve played this one. \r\n\r\nIf you’re looking for something actually different, my recommendation for idle games would be [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Synikx/recommended/1147690?snr=1_5_9__402]NGU Idle[/url] or [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Synikx/recommended/1267910?snr=1_5_9__402]Melvor Idle[/url]. \r\n\r\n[h1] [b] Recommend? (Price) [Y/N] [/b] [/h1]\r\n[h1]Yes[/h1]\r\nIt's free. Try it for an afternoon or two. \r\nYou can find my curator page here: https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Synik_GR",

      "review": "[h1][b] TLDR: While not a bad game, Idle Wizard doesn’t bring much of anything to the idle table that dozens of other games haven’t already done. It’s just very average.[/b] [/h1]\r\n\r\n[h1]PROS: [/h1]\r\n➕Classes with unique abilities\r\n➕Spells and “Bursting”\r\n\r\n\r\n[h1]CONS: [/h1]\r\n➖Font style is not pleasant to read\r\n➖Doesn’t really do anything different\r\n➖Boring music\r\n\r\n[h1] [b] Content (Game world/Narrative) – [4/10] [/b] [/h1]\r\nThe game world is simple and consists of different backgrounds and a UI. Most of the backgrounds cost currency to use, so you’ll be staring at the same one for a long time if you are a free player. \r\n\r\nThere isn’t a plot worth mentioning. \r\n\r\n[h1][b] Gameplay (Mechanics/Difficulty) – [6/10] [/b] [/h1]\r\nThe mechanics present are very similar to other F2P idle games, without much differentiation. The only thing that is actually different is the spell casting and classes. You can choose a type of wizard each playthrough and each type of wizard comes with their own spells to use. The spells are all based on increasing profit (mana) output in various ways. \r\nThe kinda cool part that meshes well with the spell casting is what the game calls “Bursting” where you collect a resource the quickly drains, but also greatly increases profit. You then dump all your spells to maximize gain during this window. It's a nice feeling seeing your profit explode due to stacking buffs. \r\n\r\nI didn’t find this difficult. Just grindy. \r\n\r\n[h1] [b] Graphics (Quality/Technical) – [4/10] [/b] [/h1]\r\nGraphics are pretty basic, considering the bulk of the game is UI, there’s not much to it. There are barely animations, and what art there is for portraits and stuff doesn’t look the best. \r\nAlso, the font style is terrible and hard to read. \r\n\r\nOn the technical side, I encountered no issues or bugs. \r\ni9-13900KF | RTX 4090 | 64GB RAM | 1440p @ 240hz | Windows 11 installed on SSD \r\n\r\n[h1] [b] Audio – [2/10] [/b] [/h1]\r\nAudio is a big let-down, especially for a game that you need to have on constantly to make the most out of it. The same boring song loops over and over. \r\n\r\nI didn’t notice any voice acting. \r\n\r\n[h1] [b] Replay Factor (Longevity) – [5/10] [/b] [/h1]\r\nThere’s some good replay value here, as most F2P idle games are a huge grindfest, its no different here with constant prestige-ing. \r\n\r\n[h1] [b] Final Verdict – [5/10] [/b] [/h1]\r\nIdle Wizard (IW) is a fairly traditional F2P idle game that doesn’t shake up the formula too much. The general loop is you’ve got your typical prestige-type reruns in which you accumulate a currency that you must keep prestigeing to obtain, over and over. \r\n\r\nAs I mentioned above in the mechanics area, I think that the classes and spells add some small creativeness to the game, but it’s not enough to set it apart from the dozens of other entries. \r\n\r\nOverall, I found Idle Wizard to be uninteresting and the loop to be too predictable. I don’t think it’s necessarily a bad game, but it's just very average in the sea of idle F2P games. Due to this I would recommend it, as there’s nothing wrong with it, but just know that if you’ve played other F2P idle games, then you’ve played this one. \r\n\r\nIf you’re looking for something actually different, my recommendation for idle games would be [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Synikx/recommended/1147690?snr=1_5_9__402]NGU Idle[/url] or [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Synikx/recommended/1267910?snr=1_5_9__402]Melvor Idle[/url]. \r\n\r\n[h1] [b] Recommend? (Price) [Y/N] [/b] [/h1]\r\n[h1]Yes[/h1]\r\nIt's free. Try it for an afternoon or two. \r\nYou can find my curator page here: https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Synik_GR",

      "review": "Started playing on Kongregate some time ago. Great idle game that is very interesting with the whole use spells to make resource. Don't worry, it isn't like Cookie clicker or the like where you have to setup these crazy combos that may or may not make you 10000000000 resources in one click and then you have to wait 8 hours before you can even attempt it again. The strongest part of this game is the amount of stuff you can unlock to try different methods of making the resource. The biggest issue I can give is tied to the dust resource. At some point you will unlock craft dust and items. These are massive improvements that are required to progress-- however, the rate in which you get the craft dust to first make them and then spend it to upgrade them multiple times, is pathetic. You will find that it is basically mandatory to spend real money to buy the craft dust in order to progress through the items or it would take you many months of logging on every day to chip away at it. I am not kidding, I can't even imagine doing it without buying the dust as even after 500 hours (your dust income increases the further in the game you get) it would take me awhile to get enough to unlock everything, let alone, upgrade them all to legendary. Still, amazing game nonetheless.",

      "review": "A well made idle game.\r\nI would even consider it among the best I've played.\r\nThe game is built around building up mana through \"eternities\" which is this games equivelent to most idle games \"prestige\" and then there is another thing called a \"realm\" which I think is something like a true prestige which I haven't tried yet even with my playtime so realms is the late game.\r\nBuilding up mana is initially done trough clicking a magic orb which lets you earn mana to spend on mana sources and other upgrades and unlock requirements for changing class or picking a pet. Classes are the main fun I've had with this game since each class has it's own abilities and ways of earning experience, leveling up your class lets you unlock abilities to earn mana as much mana as possible to go for challange rewards or progression requirements. Pets are one of the main parts of the game, learning what works best for each class is an important part of the idle wizard journey and is definitely one of my favourite features of the game. \r\nAnother core of the game is the gear which is unlocked later than pretty much all idle games I've seen while still being a core of the game, it's based off of armor, items and relics. each aquired and leveled up in a different way and it can be frustrating since leveling up takes a long time and is based on RNG. Gear can have combo bonuses that increase certain attributes that favour differing playstyles and classes so if you start upgrading gear that favours your favourite class but the rng doesn't upgrade relics and items that also favour that class optimally it feels bad and makes you feel forced to start changing your playstyle just to favour what the RNG keeps giving you so you have to slow down progression a lot until RNG favours you or you can build around the RNG.\r\nThere are some ways to get around this but the main one I can think of right now which I haven't even done is going to the real money store to buy currency so that you can buy either permament upgrades or buy temporary boosts/time skips/dust for gear upgrades.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion the game is great and I recommend it greatly even to beginners in the genre of idlers since it has something for pretty much all parts of the idle genre and does it at a high level. This is not a like some of the low quility \"slop\" idle/clicker games I've seen around, this is one of the best. \r\nIn terms of \"Idler\" this game is a 4/5 since it can sometimes be too unclear why you are stuck in progression and can feel like too much of a waste of time.\r\nIn terms of a game overall I would say more like 3/5 since it's features are so good but too spaced apart so the game gets so long that loses it's fun and starts becoming a bit too repetative because of the spacing.\r\n\r\nIf the developer sped up certain things in the game like attribute point gain and reduced the unlock spacing of features like gear/dungeons and made things like upgrading gear more clear like being able to see what upgrading certain equipment will gain in the end other than enchantment effects, This could be done through some sort of \"log book\" tab in the game, then the game would be essentially without flaws in the gameplay loop of learning and building strategies to progress.",
