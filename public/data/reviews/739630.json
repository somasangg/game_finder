You're investigating, testing, and figuring out what kind of ghost you're dealing with.",

So if you're reading the review read it closely.\r\n\r\nIf you play this game blind with all new players, even with the tutorial, it will be an exercise in walking into a house, being very very bored and then suddenly dying. This is because the game does not sufficiently communicate it's mechanics at all and they are not easily intuitable in the time it is reasonable to allow it to make it's impression.\r\n\r\nI also think forcing new players to use worse equipment that is much less reliable and readable, while they don't know what it does, rather than building that into the difficulty curve and restricting higher levels to using it is a very... interesting(derogatory) choice.\r\n\r\nIf you are willing to have everyone watch a couple of ten minute tutorial videos on youtube to learn the barest basics, if you're willing to play a patient slow moving puzzle game and willing to grind until you have equipment a ghost will actually interact with in a reasonable time period, then I think I can recommend Phasmophobia to you, quite enthusiastically. \r\nIt's a game that grows on you.\r\n\r\nThe Voice Chat is hot garbage though, drop off is way too sharp, the global chat is way to quiet and you can't rebalance the audio in any way. I like location based voice chat I just think the implementation is very very bad.",

I think if I had any complaints about this game, It would be the large maps, I think a lot of people can agree those maps are very frustrating at times for a lot of different reasons, but obviously you can always just not play them. \n\nSomething I also feel, is that this game could use maybe something spicy in the future. Something to throw off the routine, idk how exactly that could be achieved, but after playing over 200 hours, it becomes a knowledge check, and even challenge runs can get a bit stale. i've thought of workshop maps maybe being a potential solution but I bet that would be a bit more difficult to implement because its a bit hard to know if the navmesh or the AI of the ghost will just break or something.\n\nSo maybe one day there could be a new mode or something to shake things up a bit. but if u choose not to, thats fine, totally fine with me. I will allow it. this once.",

It's arguably the original ghost hunting game, and it's still the best one in terms of mechanics.  \r\n\r\nBut if you want to be blunt, the game has an extremely slow development time.  Even when new things come out, it's not like they are perfect.  My friends and I have found bugs in the new map (Nell's Diner) within the first two weeks of playing it, and we weren't trying to break the game.\r\n\r\nAnd let's be really honest.  This game has only 24 items total in the game.  Twenty four.  But somehow the game needs a massive, confusing UI interface to manage these 24 items as if it was the most sophisticated thing in the universe.  There are RPGs with hundreds of items, where your character has at least six equipment slots, and you can easily buy and sell items in just seconds.  But this game needs a dedicated buy/sell screen, a separate equipment management screen, and a quick loadout screen.",

At least in my experience. \nActually playing the game definitely has its learning curves - I recommend new players play the tutorial to get a lay of the land and if you have friend who plays and are patient have them play a few rounds so you can really experience the game. Otherwise, there are a ton of twitch streamers, youtubers, and even TikTok's that explain the main game mechanics as well as the more niche game mechanics pretty well. \nBe mindful, it is an indie game so it's not perfect but if you have a couple goofy friends and want to \"relax\" for the night it is amazing. \nI'd also recommend looking up game settings from other players especially for the visuals as it can be way too dark in some maps - like dark enough that the game isn't enjoyable. Plenty of fixes for this though that the community has shared! \nOverall this game is a bop especially with the right people!",

      "review": "I’ve been playing Phasmophobia since 2022, and in that time I’ve met just about every type of player you can imagine, the funny ones, the friendly ones, the chaotic loud ones, bad ones, the painfully quiet ones, a few speedrunners, and even a few people I ended up becoming real friends with. For a small co-op horror title, it’s given me more genuine memories than most big-budget games ever did.\n\nI really appreciate that the Devs keep updating the game and pushing it forward. Even when certain patches spark debate, the effort is clear. It matters to players like me who’ve sunk a lot of hours into the game.\n\nThat said, the community’s biggest request is still the same: the game needs bug fixes and stability improvements more urgently than new content drops. Interaction bugs, ghost behavior hiccups, glitches, that get more noticeable the longer you play. Many of us are hoping the Devs prioritize stability before layering on more systems. It would go a long way for new players, especially veterans who’ve been here since the older builds.\n\nThe badge system could use a little love. I enjoy earning achievements in this game, but some of the long grind badges don’t feel equal to the effort they demand. Fifty runs for a map should feel rewarding, yet the designs don’t quite match the time invested. The Farmhouse badge especially feels flat, more like something you earn out of commitment than something you’re excited to show off, no offense. The completionist badge is the same. Finishing everything in the game is a huge milestone, but the final badge doesn't capture the weight of that accomplishment. A bit more detail or creativity would make those long grinds feel genuinely satisfying.\n\nAnd naturally, like any long-running game, Phasmophobia can feel repetitive for players, so I’d love to see the Devs introduce more rare or atmospheric scares that don’t disrupt evidence logic. Things like these would bring back that original tension without breaking the core gameplay.\n\n👻 Rare special events:\n• Mirror doppelganger reflections like delayed movements, reflections looking the wrong way, or a mismatched expression\n• Ghost silhouette overlapping your reflection then snapping back to normal\n• Tall silent shadows crossing doorways\n• TV static figures flickering into view\n• Polaroid-like flashes in empty rooms\n• Camera flash effects or shutter sounds when no one is taking photos\n• Door handles jiggling softly\n• Shadows under beds\n\n👻 Environmental scares:\n• Floorboard creaks that follow your movement\n• Wet footprints from an empty bathroom\n• Reversed children’s laughter\n• Windows fogging from the inside\n• New scratches appearing on the walls\n\n👻 Ghost personality quirks:\n• A Listener ghost that whispers only when everyone goes completely silent\n• A Mocker ghost that mimics one teammate’s voice line once\n\n👻 Voice mimic variants (does not have to be a mimic):\n• Full teammate voice mimic\n• Static mimic over radio\n• A dead teammate mimic that convinces players they heard someone who isn’t alive\n• Hearing your friend’s voice behind you despite them being far away\n\n👻 Psychological scares:\n• Wrong sanity readings for one player\n• Fake local voice lines\n• Heartbeat sounds with no hunt happening\n\n👻 Gameplay spice:\n• Faint house tremors\n• Reliquary items (both harmless and harmful) like:\n- old rosary beads\n- a child’s shoe that triggers the sound of running feet in an empty room\n- rusted keys that randomly open a door somewhere in the house\n- a cracked music box that plays a single note when touched\n\n👻 Extra scares:\n• A figure standing at the end of a hallway for 1-2 seconds\n• Smarter, more reactive Spirit Box responses\n• Dead teammate footsteps that can be heard on spirit boxes or radios\n\nThings like these would bring back that original tension without breaking the core gameplay.\n\nAnd of course, most of us would love new ghost types with actual new behaviors, and maps inspired by real-world haunted locations, old asylums, abandoned hotels, places with real folklore or urban legends behind them. Not exact recreations, just close enough to feel grounded and genuinely unnerving.\n\nEven with its flaws, I still love coming back, hop into lobbies with friends, and random lobbies from time to time, still get spooked in ways I don’t expect, and still hope the game keeps growing. The potential is there, and after three years, I’m still rooting for it.\n\nI’ll keep supporting it and I hope the Devs continue shaping it into something even better. 💜",

I'm a complete nerd for everything this game has to offer, I genuinely love it so much and have had a blast over the years learning each ghost's abilities and other secondary evidence. I love to pull the more psychotically risky moves during hunts to figure out the ghosts, it's a massive thrill when a gamble like that succeeds. My more casual friends love to crack jokes at my expense about my love for this game.\n\nBut genuinely, everyone at Kinetic Games have done a fantastic job with giving this game a lot to offer. It's not flawless, by any means, but what game is? There can be frustrating bugs at times when big updates come around and break things, but the devs are pretty good at fixing the majority of them or at least taking feedback to try and fix them.\n\nBy the time the game inevitably sunsets, it's my goal to have every single unlockable badge, trophy, and whatever other things they have to offer in the future. So far, I've done a pretty great job at keeping up with it and I don't plan to stop.\n\nI'm really excited for what this game will have to offer in the future.

      "review": "After playing Phasmophobia for five years and taking a two-year break, I can’t believe it’s still in early access. It’s almost like the devs just don’t care. It’s been five years, Horror 2.0 still hasn’t come out, and the game is still boring. The ghosts feel uninspired, and honestly, it doesn’t even feel like a horror game anymore — it’s like doing homework. New maps and a progression rework do not make a great game.\n\nSpending $10,000 to upgrade certain items to level 3 is insane when, on Professional, you earn a little over a thousand even with all objectives completed and the book filled. Kinetic Games has really dropped the ball. Games like Ghost Watchers, Demonologist, and Forewarned came out well after Phasmo, and they have far better ghosts.\n\nThe interactions in Phasmophobia have basically stayed the same since release. Seriously? The poltergeist barely does anything. No random screams, no door slams, nothing — just slow door openings and blinking lights. It feels like a game for five-year-olds.\n\nThe new maps aren’t great, either. The lighthouse in particular is way too big. Yes, I know it’s supposed to be a lighthouse, but come on. Phasmophobia is old and tired. It isn’t scary, it isn’t creative, and it’s just bland. Do yourself a favor and play literally any other ghost-hunting game Steam has to offer—unless you enjoy being able to “SPRINT” for two feet before wheezing like a fat guy running up a flight of stairs. It’s ridiculous.\n\nIn closing: Kinetic Games, your game is old, tired, uninspired, uses assets from House Flipper, and desperately needs a serious overhaul—especially in the horror department, for a horror game. I give this game a 1/10. The only reason I kept coming back was hope that the issues would finally be addressed, but they never were, and that’s genuinely disappointing.",

It wasn't scary anymore and got tedious. \n\nIn no particular order:\nThen they promised horror 2.0! basically an update to the unity basic AI and models. And I was psyched. But it never came. \n   Then they made ID cards with different logo's for some reason. I guess someone likes that stuff? It's never used anywhere in game.\n   They made a halloween update wich was fun for a game or 2, collecting pumpkin heads for an ID card pic, or something.\n  They made all the tools have 3 levels, and the video camera you use to look for ghost orbs among other things, got so tiny and useless. It added nothing to the gameplay, and gameplay updates was what was needed.\n  They made ghost foot step rythm a fairly important way to identify ghost types. They had a couple of youtubers who loved this, and therefore leaned more into ghosts being very gimmicky, instead of an experience.\nThey changed the asylum map, and I loved the new version, it gave me some hope. But not enough to revive the gameplay for me.\n\nAnd this is still where we are, 5 years into early access. I look at the updates, but I've no hope for this game. It's thin, vapid and tedious. It was very fun until I started expecting the game to actually go somewhere. There's been 1 update in this time, that had any promise. A few that where fine.

      "review": "Difficulty With Controller & Unclear Game Purpose\n\nAfter spending time with Phasmophobia on a controller, I can say the game becomes much harder than it needs to be. The controls feel clunky, slow, and unintuitive — especially when trying to switch items, open doors smoothly, or navigate the journal. Basic actions that should take one second often take several, which completely breaks the tension in a horror game. Many players have reported the same issues, saying the controller support feels incomplete and unreliable.\n\nOn top of that, the game’s overall purpose can feel unclear if you’re new. While the goal is technically to gather evidence and identify the ghost, the game doesn’t communicate that very well. The loop becomes confusing: explore, collect clues, run from the ghost, open the journal, repeat. Without clear guidance or intuitive menus, it’s easy to feel lost rather than engaged. The concept of ghost hunting is great, but the execution leaves you guessing about what the game expects you to do next.\n\nPhasmophobia has potential and can be fun with friends, but playing with a controller makes the experience frustrating, and the unclear objectives make it harder to enjoy. Until controller support improves or the game explains its systems better, it’s tough to recommend for players who aren’t using mouse and keyboard.",

Every session feels different, the mechanics are cool, and the adrenaline rush is real.\n\nBut I am tired of fighting the game engine more than the actual ghosts.\n\nThe developers have made a fortune on this. They are likely set for life. Yet, for 20€, the state of this game is frankly unacceptable. It feels less like a polished product and more like a PS1 HD mod held together by duct tape and prayers.\n\nCurrently, gameplay consists of 80% hunting ghosts and 20% fighting the code itself.\n\nHere is the reality of the \"immersive\" experience, specifically in VR:\n\nThe Teleport Lottery: VR teleport controls go completely haywire. You will clip through walls, get stuck inside geometry, or just vibrate into the void.\n\nThe Staircase Boss Fight: Unless your teleport line hits the exact top pixel of the stairs, gravity wins. You will fall down repeatedly. Escaping a basement ghost in VR isn't hard because of the ghost; it's impossible because of the stairs.\n\nThe Door Simulator: I get it—manual door control is \"immersive.\" But in VR, it's a nightmare. The swinging kitchen doors in the Diner map? They are practically impassable with teleport controls.\n\nAudio Gaslighting: The room sensing breaks constantly. The audio engine will suddenly decide I'm in a different dimension, making my friend standing right next to me sound muffled and walls away.\n\n** Hungry Floors:** Drop an item? 50/50 chance it clips through the floor and enters the Backrooms, gone forever.\n\nThese aren't \"charming indie quirks.\" These are bugs that current AI could probably diagnose and fix in minutes.\n\nTo the Devs: You struck gold with this concept. It’s brilliant. But you have the resources now. Please, stop adding content for a second and just polish the foundation.\n\nUntil the game stops fighting me, I can't recommend it in good conscience.",

I've watched this project ignore and/or blatantly spurn its own players by not fixing critical audio bugs, actively disallowing mods (because the devs know that fans more dedicated to making this a polished product can and would fix the game's vast shortcomings), and continue blithely working on pretty new content instead of putting out the numerous fires in their code. \n\nI should not need to consistently rely on alternatives like Discord to hear my friends when I'm standing in the same room as them because the game's proximity chat is so broken that, for example, my friends can't hear me talk when we're on opposite sides of the diner counter (effectively >3 feet away) in the new map Nell's Diner. If I play having forgotten that the proximity chat is broken and that I should definitely be using an alternative, God forbid I press my push to talk key while the map is loading, because for WHATEVER reason, that will instantly discontinue all audio from my device to be heard by friends until I completely close the game and then restart it. Behavior like this that is so consistently reproduced in this game (and furthermore a behavior we have observed both before AND after their audio engine updates) is not normal and not hard to fix for a competent dev team and continues to be a huge disruption to this day. \n\nI should not need to waste the time I set aside to play the game, to instead troubleshoot connectivity and server issues. After which, just when I get my hopes up, there are more issues and we decide there’s something better we could be doing with any of our remaining time. At this point it feels like I can only count on one hand the number of times my friends and I have been able to get through a session of playing Phasmophobia without any connectivity issues whatsoever. This should be just the opposite, there’s no reason I should be experiencing server issues so regularly that it’s a miracle when it doesn’t happen. The RNG for rapid-fire pulling tarot cards in this game and nothing happening is better than the seemingly RNG-like server connections. \n\nI should not need to be given pretty little bandaids in the form of new content and map reworks when there are incredibly foundational issues with this game. This dev team doesn’t care about making a game that works well. They don’t care about making their fans feel heard. Most critically, I don’t believe they care about having any integrity whatsoever. The devs of Phasmophobia have said time and time again how they’re working on fixing the bugs that have been brought to their attention. They’ve overpromised on roadmaps and underdelivered in every meaningful way. There are no good reasons why this game should not have been able to stop the incessant bleeding and stitch itself the ♥♥♥♥ up. \n\nI’ve certainly gone on long enough, but I leave you with an analogy. Playing this game feels like entering a popular person’s house for the first time. You’re nervous, you’ve heard it’s a really great house, all your friends are there, they tell you you’ll love it! Then you walk in and there it is. A steamy pile of ♥♥♥♥ right there in the middle of the floor. You’re confused. Why is there ♥♥♥♥? Do they not know it’s there? They can see it, can’t they? If they knew, they’d clean it up, surely. You ask about the ♥♥♥♥. They say, “Well sure, it’s there, just walk around it for now. We’ll clean it!” You believe them. But every time you come back, it’s still there. That hot, steamy, pile of ♥♥♥♥ waiting there for you. No one else seems to mind too much. Certainly not the owners of said house. You’ve even tried cleaning it yourself just for the cleaning materials to be ripped from your hands. “I’ll do it myself,” they say, “you don’t need to concern yourself with this.” Once in a while they cover it with a tissue or two, maybe even a pretty patterned cloth napkin. But it’s still there.\n\nAdmittedly, it has always taken me a little too long to rip the bandaid off. I have tried and tried and tried to love this game, and unfortunately I think this is still one of the better games in the ghost-hunter online co-op genre. I know I’ll probably even keep playing this, partially because I already spent money on it and I’m a cheapskate, and partially because although I feel strongly about these issues, I feel more strongly about the people I’m friends with and connection with them is still important to me. But if the reasons listed above are important issues to you too, please think twice before giving your money to a team of devs that have been reveling in the delights of millions in profits while only giving back the bare minimum in effort.",

At the start of the game you have the worst equipment, so it's really hard to identify ghosts, and if you die you loose all of the stuff you brought. Death is simply super punishing for new players who don't have a lot of stuff to begin with and even less money. You need to stay in a level for a long time as a new player to get clues, as your equipment is trash so low chances of the ghost interacting with them, so your chances of dying and loosing most if not all of your progress is high.",

I don't think the lobby should be a 3D space to begin with because everything you do like buying tools or voting is conducted thru screens so like.. what's the point... it might as well just be a concise screen that U do everything on and um ya\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which actually joining your friends is also an awkward experience. I think using codes to join a lobby isn't ideal and it'd be nice if there was a way to just send an invite through Steam that friends can join with.\r\n\r\nThe actual gameplay, at least on the first two difficulties, feels like nothingburger and we spent like two hours wandering around aimlessly on multiple maps and, even with all the basic tools needed, not getting enough (if any) evidence to correctly guess what kind of ghost it was. Actually in all the time I've played this game I don't think I've ever been able to guess correctly. But maybe i'm just not good at guessing IDK but this is my truth Ty",

Literally give us the ability to cleanse the ghost, otherwise whats the point of playing? When are we getting a model rework too, seriously? Still using the same unity store assets for the players and the ghosts is unacceptable at this point.",

      "review": "ok - yes i down voted it, but only because there is no \"neutral\" option. \nPhasmo is NOT a bad game, i bought it mostly to shut my friend up about getting it and because it had VR support. now- why neutral? the game idea and gameplay is good, but it IS repetitive, and you cant play for more than 2 hours at max each day not getting bored. hunting all the ghosts all feel the same, and sure some walk faster and slower but its mostly always \"get EMF 5 - check temps - put book down - sprit box?\" and the map doesn't really matter. every map has different layouts, but its all the same. no special events for different maps. \n\nnow lets talk about flatscreen vs VR: flatscreen seems very... buggy 50% of the time. when i press E while hovering over a item, half the time you need to click it like 3 times for it to register. this effect gets way worse when you join a multiplayer lobby too. its impossible to do anything beyond pressing E and M1, and there is no immersion. the \"jump scares\" feel off. no camera-shake or effects on the screen, so its just a hologram flying at you with a sound effect. HOWEVER - in VR, you ARE immersed. full built-in motion controls which is really fun, and helps with ACCUARCY when placing / moving things (being able to point your flashlight wherever you want at whatever angle is really helpful believe it or not), its really immersive! its optimized AMAZINGLY (consistent 90 FPS on an ENTRY LEVEL GPU)!! but (yes, BUT...) you need a tier 3 flashlight, or all lights to be on when your in vr. YOU CAN. NOT. SEE. ANYTHING in vr. the brightness setting in settings change what shows on the monitor and does not change in vr sadly. when you spawn in, half the time you are in the ground, and when you reset your \"position in steam VR, everything becomes sideways and tilted, either making you motion sick (not me i didn't), or just effecting gameplay.\n\nbase game features are limited and have very little to do. the ghost is hunting and all you do is hide in a corner and hear footsteps from the ghost- no fun in that because the crucifix only PREVENTS a hunt, and nothing else you can really do anything about it. once it hunts its \"ok hide and don't move!!\" Professional mode is to easy, and anything above that is too hard, and multiplayer has its own bugs, including if your internet goes down lower than normal for even a split second, it nukes its self, and kicks you. in VR, the best looks buggy and everything is miles away from you (if your WATCHING the VR person, if your in VR you wont see it.) I REALLY LIKE THE CURSED ITEMS THOUGH! it does keep it sorta interesting not knowing what it does, but if you find all them... it loses the fun. to be honest... DO NOT PLAY SINGLEPLAYER! ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A FRIEND TO PLAY WITH! there is literally nothing to have fun with if you are single player UNLESS you have mods or are a content creator!\n\nlike i said, i was still able to get lots of fun out of it, which is why i wish i could do a neutral vote, and i also know the devs and the team is working their buts off right now! so neutral, but that's mostly because of my friend playing with me, and having a VR headset. I'm sure in future updates, there will be fixes and more features and i will be here for all of them, so PLEASE DONT come back to this in like 7 years smiting me about how there's \"so much more now\" because i probably know ok bye bye y'all! i hope this helped someone figure out if this is for them!",
