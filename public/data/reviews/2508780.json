      "review": "[h1] One of the Best Framing Games I've Played [/h1]\r\nI would say I'm a fan of games like this, having grown up with a handful of the Harvest Moon/Rune Factory games and having recently played Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town. However, far and away this game is all I could want from an entry in this genre. Having just completed my first in-game year at just about 50 hours of playtime, I think a review is warranted.\r\n[h3] The Cons [/h3]\r\nTo start, I'll get the few cons this game has out of the way. One some people might dislike is the lack of mining in the game, at least in the traditional sense. Unlike similar games, there's no dedicated mine for the player to explore and collect resources from. However, at least for me, this isn't really a problem. I never cared deeply for the mining and found it to either be shallow or annoying in other games, so it's lack of appearance here isn't one I mourn. The other notable \"con\" is the game's lack of a traditional shipping bin, money is made in one of two ways: selling at the titular bazaar or selling to a shopkeeper. The shopkeeper acts as a shipping bin would, giving you an item's standard value while the bazaar has a variety of factors that can increase an item's value. Which leads me into the pros of this game's system.\r\n[h3] The Pros [/h3]\r\nThe bazaar is far and away the best addition to this game, and feels less like a gimmick and more like an evolution of the formula. Rather than shipping items for a standard rate, you're allowed to sell your goods at the bazaar. Each season has different trends, like a supply and demand, that dictate which items are currently popular. While items that aren't trending won't be negatively affected, selling items that are trending can lead to a big increase in profit. On top of giving you more ways to make money, the trends have a secondary effect of incentivising you to grow new crops or produce new items. Which leads into the second major benefit of this game's unique setting: the windmills. Being in a windy town, the player can unlock and use windmills to produce a majority of goods. Instead of buying a mayonnaise maker, you process eggs in one of your windmills to create it. This not only streamlines production, but adds a fun gameplay loop of having to produce items before the deadline of the next bazaar every Saturday. The windmills also produce faster or slower based on the current wind speed which adds an extra reason to check weather forecasts and plan your week leading up to the bazaar. The last addition that doesn't directly impact gameplay, but massively improves the game for me is the voice acting. Characters feel much more lively when they have unique voice lines and fully voiced cutscenes for different occasions. For me, it gives me more of an incentive to improve my relationships with all the townsfolk so that I can see their next social event. There's plenty more I could list about this game like character customization, the romanceable cast, or even the soundtrack but I'd be writing this review longer than I already have.",

      "review": "Fantastic relaxing game to play. Me and my kids both love this game. It's simplicity and ease of doing things adds a specific relaxing factor to it compared to other games similar. For me I am expessially happy it lacks mining in dungeons, now I understand that maybe some people will feel ripped off by not having such a thing. But I am happy to see this game taking a new spin on the genre as a whole rather than a pure copy paste clone of stardew valley. Not that its a bad thing, its just this game offered me something new that reignited the spark of passion I had for games of this genre. My kids play this game almost daily. If my kids like it, I like it.\r\n\r\nThe farming is very simplistic and easy, rather enjoyable compared to being tedious and a chore. Collecting things in the world is enjoyable. Interacting with the town, festivals, and events are so enjoyable compared to other titles. It almost makes the game feel alive and having a soul. Which I never got that feeling playing stardew valley personally or even really with other games of the genre. This game has its own soul and cute charm that makes it fantastic. I just wish it offered easier solutions for unlocking cooking recipes and maybe a bit more clothing customization options. Other than that I genuinely love this game even if the genre as a whole isn't particularly something for me often, but this game is one I can say is the gem out of the genre that I can declare I will sit down and play.",

The variety of crops is awesome with plenty to unlock, Recipes for cooking are extremely plentiful!\n\nCaring for your animals is super cute and you can breed all sorts of adorable variations.\n\nThe NPCs are all enjoyable with distinct personalities and their own storylines. \n\nFull voice acting is amazing (I use JP voices since it sounds better to me)\n\nThe bazaar is so fun! I look foward to it every week\n\nLots of events which are fun!\n\nThe greet feauture is great if you're too lazy to talk to everyone\n\nTrends are great and keep things fresh! \n\ncons:\n\nFishing for me could have a better minigame as it is quite boring and takes a LOT of time, although getting the reel technique and better rods helps a lot.\n\nNO DECORATING! This is the biggest thing for me. I understand not everyone enjoys decorating but I would LOVEEE to be able to decorate my house and my farm. Even if its just different layouts/colour themes for my house or a small area we can make our own.\n\nNot enough variety in clothes\n\nINVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND STORAGE HELLLL\n\nI would love an actual mine (RNG hates me)\n\nPLEASE LET ME COOK FROM STORAGE PLEASEEE\n\nA menu for windmills would be awesome\n\n_____\n\nDEFINITELY WORTH GETTING!

The characters are all very lovable, the new additions make the experience better than the original (at least in my opinion) and the gameplay loop feels fun and addicting. I keep saying to myself \"I'll just play one more day\" and again hours will pass. The last \"Harvest Moon\" game I have enjoyed to this extend was Animal Parade. It truly feels like I have been wrapped in that warm comfortable blanket with the charm of the old titles and the quality of life for the new ones. I truly hope Story of Seasons as a series continues to go into this direction because if so I will absolutely come back around to it. Well worth the money for any old Harvest Moon fan like myself.",

It feels light, simple, and surprisingly addictive in the best way.\n\nWhat makes this game stand out is the bazaar mechanic. Instead of just shipping your crops and forgetting about them, you actually set up your own stall every week and sell your stuff like a real market vendor. It’s honestly one of the most fun loops in the whole SoS/HM series. Seeing people rush to your booth and hearing their reactions to your products? Super satisfying.\n\nThe town vibes are wholesome, the characters are charming without trying too hard, and the pacing feels perfect for relaxed gaming. It’s not the most complex Story of Seasons entry, but that’s exactly why it hits the spot. You farm, you craft, you sell, you vibe. No stress.\n\nIf you want a game that feels peaceful, rewarding, and uniquely built around a weekly bazaar hustle, this one is absolutely worth your time. Perfect with a cup of coffee, a quiet night, or whenever you just want to unwind.",

      "review": "I hadn't played any games in the Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons family since before the name even changed, and considered myself pretty much done with the genre, although I did play Stardew Valley.  There are just too many games and too little time.  But the bachelors in this looked so appealing that I had to give it a try, and this is the game that's won me back.  \n\nThis is an extremely addictive game with a unique gameplay loop.  6 days of the week, you will be working your ass off scrounging up stuff to sell at the bazaar on Sunday.  When Sunday comes, it's a blitz of selling more more more in an attempt to minmax every aspect of this excellent hybrid farming/selling game.  Or, you could probably choose to play this more casually, not teetering on the end of exhaustion at any given time and just develop the bazaar slowly.  I did not try this playstyle, but it exists so go for it if that's your thing!  \n\nThere are tons of crops, fish, bugs, and more to discover in this game.  Lots of fruit trees, loads of recipes.  At 90+ hours, I was not able to make and harvest it all, although I did get pretty close!  I quit shortly after having my baby and am very satisfied with my experience.  The bachelors were as great as I thought they'd be!  It was a hard decision figuring out who to marry, as usually in these games, there's really only one or two choices that I'm interested in at all, but in this game I could imagine marrying any of them.   All characters have their own stories and multiple character events, so it's not just the marriageable characters who got any love.  \n\nOverall this game has me very excited for the future of this series, including future remakes if they are as good as this one.  My only negative would be that there is no mine - I did not know that going in and kept wondering when I'd unlock one!",

The previous Story of Seasons remakes have felt like they're not really adding much to the experience other than updating the graphics and and adding obligatory remake features like having skin tone options, but this one feels very much like they were thinking about how they could improve upon the original game and add to it.

The weekly cycle of growing crops, foraging stuff, and processing everything into more valuable items, then selling it all at the bazaar is pretty fun. The player movement also feels very satisfying, jumping and gliding around the map is actually quite fun.\n\nThat said, it still has some issues. Time flies wayyy too fast, making money is almost too easy once you figure out how the bazaar works, and taking care of animals feels fucking tedious and annoying compared to other games in the genre, also foraging ends up being more profitable than farming half the time because stuff spawns like 2 times a day.\n\nBut even with those problems, I’d still call this the best Story of Seasons remake they've done so far.  The game is still fun and the game runs pretty well, I really hope Hero of Leaf Valley is the next game they decide to remake, because that one’s easily the best in the whole series for me and that game deserves another shot IMO.",

Crafting and Cooking also has a lot of varieties and items that you can create with specific positive buffs which will be useful on your post-game sessions.\n\nIt offers a very rewarding feeling as you progress and reaches the World Rank Bazaar that unlocks everything to make your farming life easier and cozier.

Ich liebe Felix am meisten.^^\r\nLong:\r\nWhat can I say... I was glad the weekend was here. When I started the game, without even meaning to, at least according to Steam, I ended up playing for 16 hours straight. The game design reminded me a lot of Yasuhiro Wada—totally detailed, loving, and beautiful! For example, the hands of the clock in your house tick along with the game time. And all the animals are so super cute that you'd love to have a zoo, but first, you have to start small. To make selling a little easier for you, expand your storage as soon as you can and improve your tools. After that, I hope you've met some diligent little helpers because they give you so much that you'll become a collector. Of all the villagers, I love Felix the most. He shows enthusiasm, unwavering dedication, and that you can find a family anywhere. All the children are super cute. And the dogs from Olive Town are back!\r\nOf course, I immediately changed some key bindings because I couldn't access my sell inventory—the tab key was too cumbersome, so I just put it on R. I play on a German keyboard. By the way, the game is in German, but the voice is synced in English, which I like because I can work on my pronunciation, hahahaha. What I also had to practice at the beginning was gliding in the wind, jumping, and pouring; it’s a bit annoying at first, but you learn it quickly. Small tip: hold the spacebar to glide and test the wind direction beforehand.\r\n\r\nNow I'd better stop, otherwise you'll still be reading in 20 years. I think it's a very well-made game. Oh yes, coins that are meant for a specific person and trash you should pick up. Just so you know. But now I'll stop. Have fun and many THANKS.

This unique focus on sales, strategy, and time management makes earning money feel more involved and exciting than in other farm sims. I highly recommend this title if you are looking for a Story of Seasons experience that adds a distinctive, satisfying entrepreneurial layer to the classic farming formula.",

The only cons I can think of are the grabbing/harvesting hitboxes are weird (you either have to be standing a foot away from the item or right on top of the item to grab it, if you're just within the hitbox it doesn't work), and hopping over water can be really annoying because timing the double jump is a bit difficult, and falling into the water will happen a lot.\n\nIf you like a good game loop, or you loved the old Grand Bazaar game, I highly recommend this one.",

      "review": "I'm currently about midway through autumn of year one, and am enjoying it so far.  I feel I've been a bit spoiled by indie games which gives the player the option to slow in-game time down as the in-game clock feels like it moves at warp speed when it's just the typical \"1 second IRL = 1 minute in game\".\nIntro out of the way, into the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n-You start out with a house, instead of having to build it from a tent or a shack\n-You already have a kitchen (although further tools do need to be purchased later on)\n-Aforementioned house comes equipped with a bath which, for only 30 in-game minutes, restores a good chunk of your stamina\n-The barn is connected to your house, so you can walk right into it after getting up in the morning\n-Fodder for livestock spreads like wildfire, so just the seeds you're gifted are enough to satisfy your animals\n-There are \"happiness points\" which can be spent on bazaar days in order to purchase things from the sprites; the boxes which connect to your storage are very important\n-The \"jump boost\" to watering crops and gathering allows you to water more squares right off the bat\n-Due to the windmills (which do need to be repaired at various points, but it's rather easy to get them completed), you get to upgrade your own tools; no more memorizing three or four different store hours to plan when you should pay for that upgrade\n-You are gifted your first chicken, pet (cat/dog), and horse\n-Dogs and cats help herd your animals in and out of the barn (dogs herd larger animals, and cats herd the chickens)\n-Windmills are your production makers and your seed makers, and windy days speeds up the process.  Raising the star level of your crops by being able to easily make your own fertilizer with weeds is great\n-Selling at the bazaar is easy (if not hectic once you unlock more stalls) and you can get buffs from decorations and the nature sprites\n-Give the nature sprites items to increase the quality of things like foragables (flowers, grass, ect), mushrooms, honey, fish, and bugs\n-There are monthly trending items for the bazaar which will increase your profits on that\n-Many of the competitions can be won in your first year (not all of them, but a good amount)\n-As you increase friendship with villagers, and unlock certain titles via just doing daily chores, NPCs will send you gifts in the mail ranging from needed metals to food (the latter very important to learn recipes)\n-The map is small enough where it doesn't take half a day to get from your farm to the town\n-You can order most seeds (and tree seeds) which you've owned previously\n-You can see likes and dislikes for gifting on the NPC affection level screen, so no more needing to memorize them or write them down\n-Items take time to spoil, and go through a few stages\n-Colored quest markers will appear next to characters on the map, so you know who has a quest/cutscene\n-Resources can spawn at least twice a day (once in the morning and once in the evening) of ever day\n\n--\n\nMiddle of the road:\n-The general store (where you buy your seeds) will sell additional seeds on bazaar days.  While somewhat fun, it also means that you have to wait until whenever it is Saturday in purchase the other two type of seasonal flower and some of the better selling crops.  Flowers aren't as much of an issue, but since some of these crops can take over an in-game week to grow it means you just lost out on a harvest.\n-The mushroom logs and beehives are not on your farm.  While this means more space on your farm, it also means you have to travel up to the mountains to collect from them\n-You do need to keep an eye on your quest list in case you complete one without realizing it, because there's no indication to let you know\n\n--\n\nCons:\n-Everything is so expensive!  This will likely be one of the first things you notice.  Initially, buying seeds will be a profit loss as you do not have access to the windmill with the seed maker ability.  Food items, as well (which are needed to learn food recipes) are extremely expensive\n-Storage is extremely limited.  You can get upgrades (at expensive prices of course), but you run out super quick because almost everything you can farm/collect in the game, including foraged items like weeds and rocks, has a quality-star rating to it\n-Windmills can only make up to 10 of an item at a time, and there can only be six items being produced per windmill\n-The first in-game week is a nightmare of cutscenes every in-game morning.  You gradually unlock every tool you need (frustratingly, the fishing rod is last), and although you can skip some of the tutorials, the cutscene will still eat in-game time from your day\n-The controls for herding your large animals are obnoxious, though thankfully you don't need to bother with it for long if you chose the dog for your first pet\n-Your farm is TINY, and you need to pay thousands in order to unlock another field (and the next one is even more expensive).  This is extremely limiting, particularly since there are many good crops to grow in addition to flowers, special seeds (such as soybeans, wheat, and rice), and tea leaves\n-You can't do anything with the tea leaves when you first unlock them, as you need the yellow windmill before you can start making the tins\n-The only tea leaves you can use to make tins are the autumn ones (for some odd reason), which requires you to spend extra in-game time to slowly (as you can only do it in groups of 10 as I said before) use the windmill to convert your spring/summer tea leaves to autumn ones\n-You need to use the sickle to collect flowers\n-Ore deposits have weird loot pools.  I've struggled with getting silver (often times just getting iron), and even gold deposits sometimes still give me copper\n-EVERYTHING takes stamina; that includes just picking up items like mushrooms and nuts\n-You have a fridge, but you can't access it.  You need to pay (after doing a quest to set up the bazaar stall) in order to get \"freshness upgrades\" so that your items take longer to spoil\n-There is no bug net, and how to catch bugs is one of the few things they neglected to inform you of at the start.  I had to look it up because, near the end of spring of the first year, I was puzzled as to why I didn't have a bug net.  Getting to a certain friendship level with Kevin will unlock the pop-up tutorial on how to catch bugs...but by then, you've likely already looked it up or figured it out yourself\n-The sprite warp boxes only take you back to your farm; you can't use them to warp between locations  (so don't make the mistake of spending the 30k to get the one for your red windmill like I did because I thought it'd let me travel between the boxes)\n-The glider is a bit wonky.  I can't even get up to the sprite house unless there's wind because of how high that platform is, and you lose stamina if you fall in the water and need to be fished out.  The other location(s?) you can get to with the glider also requires some wind to be blowing or you're out of luck on reaching the platform, and the one in the mountains has a weird invisible collider I've hit quite a few times and had to try again\n-One of the characters sometimes roams around an out-of-bounds area (if there is a way to get to him, I haven't discovered it yet)\n\n--\n\nOverall, I'd highly recommend it.  I went in without looking anything up (initially) or watching any videos for the \"do this/don't do this\" suggestions, and it's a fun experience to learn what is worth focusing on as this game is slightly different from some of the other SoS games in terms of what to prioritize growing.",

The game translate the style of the old game to 3d wonderfully, everywhere is colorful and friendly, the music brings happiness and joy. The villagers and character are friendly, and they do interact with eachother! I always enjoy seeing them together when visiting the town.\nOnto the gameplay, the farming sim and the money making. Limiting yourself to only 3 patches of field and 1 \"greenhouse\" means you need to plan accordingly to make the best of a season cycle. So is the windmill crafting, requires alot of mental planning. Farmwork only takes about 4-5 hours if you sleep on time, then you can go into town to interact with other villagers, or go fishing and gathering from the mountain. And once weekend arrive, the main money making time of the entire game starts: the Bazaar. This is probably the best system i've ever had from a farming sim, keeps you on your toes and demands your attention while you watch your labor in a week turn into gold.\nOverall, SoS Grand Bazaar is a phenomenal game for me. Beautiful artstyle, endearing characters, engaging farming system and dopamine-inducing money making. It scratches that itch for a good farming game i've had for a long time.",

      "review": "Context: \nI'm predominantly a Story of Seasons player, having played since the original \"A Wonderful Life\" on Gamecube. My fave HM/SoS games is Animal Parade, Friends of Mineral Town and I have a soft spot for AWL. I'm not too big on many other farming game series, but Fields of Mistria is a favorite of mine outside of SoS.\n\nI got as far as first year winter. Haven't gotten married yet.\n\nGameplay:\nAddicting. Hectic, but addicting. The map is not very big but time moves relatively quickly. You do need to plan your day and maybe even your weeks sometimes so you're getting what you want done. Unlike other SoS games, after farming/resources, checking the windmills, and checking in with some townspeople, it will likely be time for bed before you've combed through ALL nature-y areas for resources.\n\nSpeaking of constraints, I have a love-hate relationship with the storage in this game. It can be expanded upon, but it takes time, so you WILL have to manage it. It's not only from a quantity perspective either, as produce do eventually go bad (gradually and in steps; they usually go down in value as they get old and it takes a bit before they're straight up expired and worthless). \n\nIt's hate because it often verged on being too annoying, but it's also love because it was also a welcome challenge for me. For comparison, in Fields of Mistria I would say storage is of no consequence (your bag storage is still limited), so having to think about storage at all in Grand Bazaar was also fun despite my frustrations.\n\nThe weekly bazaar is a refreshing, dramatic and satisfying remix of simplifying selling things via a shipping bin. Every month there are trending items that essentially sell for more and they will likely dictate what you'll focus on making. I like that there's a good incentive to make and sell things outside of just crops and animal produce. Actually selling is a fun mini game itself, as you have to balance attracting customers, checking them out before they lose interest, and your stock.\n\nThings I like:\nCombined hammer/axe\nGraphics and visual style\nVoiced characters\nCharacter customization (could be improved but I like it)\nMarriage candidates and two new ones\nThe wind and parachute mechanics are fun and useful for navigating\nThe game notifies you and shows you on the map when there are events to see (romance, random, etc.)\nThe events are fun\nWindmills replace the maker machines from Pioneers of Olive Town and they're a huge improvement\nVariety of pets and the fact that they herd your animals\nThe overall gameplay loop\n\nThings that I don't love/could be improved/nitpicks:\nThe horse isn't useful for navigating town faster\nGame interrupts you when your character's energy is low (happens frequently and it's distracting)\nCan't switch tools/items while running\nFishing take a lot of time in the day and the mini game for it isn't fun. It's probably my least favorite type of fishing out of all farming games I've played\nThe spectrum for item quality is wide (whole numbers and .5 increments). This was the biggest exacerbating factor in making storage frustrating\nCan't check Windmill and Animal statuses at will in your menu\nI kind of wish there was more growth (literal size) and customization involved in your house\nNot exploring the whole map in one day is one thing, but it feels rough to not be able to check on my plants and animals on some days, especially for animals.\nFields of Mistria spoiled me in this regard, but I wish the townspeople changed clothing throughout the different seasons\nI've heard there are not many events with your spouse/partner after marriage\n\nYMMV:\nNo mining\nNo combat\n\nConclusion:\nThis game shot up there for me in my list of favorite farming games. It's certainly up there with Animal Parade. I do think it has it beat gameplay wise, but I find that story/event wise it doesn't quite have AP beat.",

      "review": "If you like farming games this game does a really good job in a lot of aspects and has a unique mechanic of operating a weekly bazaar stall.\n\nUnlike previous games in the series and most farming sims in general there isn't other forms of gameplay like combat or caving and is instead replaced with a weekly bazaar so it is smaller overall. Personally I found that the lack of this content as well as the limited farming space helped push me to interact more with the villagers since there wasn't other chores to do as well as really plan for the weekly bazaar and I would go as far to say that the overall compactness that it has is a positive. \n\nThe farming and the bazaar mechanics are great, animal care while the same as others in the series is the best I've seen in farming games, fishing is fun, gathering/mining isn't overly time consuming and is respectable, the music is pleasant, and the cast is lovely. Some of the best quality of life I've seen in a farming game and overall a shorter then most but more enjoyable farm game experience not to mention this remake actually feels like a new game. \n\nFor me it's a 10/10 being my most enjoyed farming game, but, if the caving and combat aspects of these games are something you love it is not present in this game.",

Needs Major quality of life updates before I would recommend this to anyone, Horses cant eat treats if they've already eaten, their gallop sounds like static, if you pass out you instantly start the next day, Ore is completely out of whack, i have over 300 copper with 5 silver and ever growing gold ore pile. The map itself is also pretty small with alot of bloat",

Fix your game. I've played many newer games on my pc including Guardians of Azuma and they played fine.",

      "review": "A bit old school in terms of farming life sims. The gimmick of this one is the shop, but it's nothing groundbreaking: Ring bell, press button to sell item. I'm most disappointed about the character customization. Plenty of feminine options, but you'll only find 2 or 3 traditionally masculine ones, so prepare to twink yourself up or be the default.\n\nOnce in the game, the art design of the NPCs are bizarrely child-like looking, uncomfortably so at many points. Looking at other Story of Seasons games, \"Cartoon-ish\" is very normal, but not child-like. The \"Jules\" screenshot on the store page is a good example. They all look like that, and that's intended to be a fully grown ass man.\n\nI purchased this along with Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, and I would definitely recommend you check out that game instead. Same devs, but I would say the better of the two by far. It's got a few problems of it's own, but if you're debating on one of the two then go with Rune Factory.",
