Fastfoward to now ~ FM26 release looked sketchy so I went searching around steam and found OOTP26 on a 75% off sale. \n\nI haven't paid attention to baseball since my youth in the late 80's. This game has brought back my love of baseball!  What an amazing game!  I'm trying to build up my old SF Giants back to glory and man it's really tough! I'm in my second season right now.  The spreadsheets and depth of information you can glean matches the FM franchise.  The only thing I wish was there is the player interaction part or \"Throw my waterball\" after a loss hahaha. \n\nGreat Job you guys! you earned a customer and brought a dude back to baseball :)",

I used to be all about FM.. but whilst not as sexy, OOTP 26 has it all in terms of creating a universe with a pulse and enough levers and depth and observable connection between action and outcome that makes it fun and sometimes random but does not reward min-max game-play. It's about making decisions but really understanding that like life, there are many variables and in another time another place a different outcome might occur. \r\nI don't know much about baseball, but this is my game. I just love that its so replay-able, and of all the games its the closest to replicating the rhythm and data of a real sporting universe.\r\nDon't get hung up on the 3D game aspect - I love it, but you have to note that its just the games attempt to describe what has already occurred in probability dice-rolls.. I originally would get upset when a player would field a ball with heaps of time to make a throw to make a double play according to the 3D in front of me.. but wouldn't do it.. forget that,. the real thing that occurred is the dice-roll that said the double play didn't occur - the 3D is just the games best approximation to replicate that... its the only real uncanny-valley style thing that can grind. unless you accept that fact.. \r\nIt's just the best sports management game bar none. \r\nBut it took me 5 version purchases across 10 years before I 'got it'... once you do though,, say goodbye to your other games.. you won't be playing them much anymore... :)",

You are behind the desk, calling the shots, building rosters, making trades, and shaping the future of your franchise one spreadsheet at a time.\n\nThis year’s version adds a few great features that make it stand out. The inclusion of the World Baseball Classic mode adds an international touch and gives you something new to manage outside of the usual MLB grind. The updated Player Development Lab is also a big improvement, letting you see progress more clearly and make smarter decisions about how to grow your players.\n\nWhat makes the game so rewarding is its depth. You control everything, from scouting reports to in-game strategies like when to steal or shift defense. Every choice matters, and when your team wins because of a trade or lineup change you made, it feels genuinely satisfying. The 3D match view continues to improve and adds a nice visual payoff for all the planning that goes into each season.\n\nIt is not perfect, though. There are still occasional bugs and a few interface quirks that can slow things down. Long-time players might feel that the jump from last year’s version is more evolutionary than revolutionary. But the core gameplay loop remains one of the best in any sports simulation out there.\n\nIf you love baseball, statistics, and the thrill of long-term strategy, OOTP delivers exactly what you want. It is complex, rewarding, and endlessly replayable.",

      "review": "Alright, overall I'm in love with the game and really addicted to it, but there are things that I dislike or even hate.\n\n- RNG is too much. Team that easily swept season and postseason of one year, next year becomes irrelevant. No injuries, stats didn't drop drastically and mostly increased, opponent teams are not a lot stronger, but when 80 OVR SP has ~5.00 yearly ERA, It doesn't make any sense. Why he still scored that high by scouts if he doesn't perform over the year? And the opposite, when 45 OVR hitter outperforms everyone, but still counted as 45?\n- Roster AI is stupid. It only looks on player stats, not actual baseball stats. It means a lot more micromanagement, which is fine if it wasn't so fucking inconvenient. \n- Roster management is ass. In times when players become inelligable for minor roster, there is no way to tell which players are inelligable outside of bar that appears on the screen when you finish the day. Players there are not even sorted. It's the pain in the ass to sort it out. Same for promotions. I cannot see baseball stats of the players outside of minor league report. It's fine, but it refreshes every time I make roster adjustment so I should find players all over again and it makes me crazy. \n- Sometimes salaries don't make any sense. Bidding war vs AI opponent is an ass. 30 year hitter asks for 7 year contract for 50 mils is insane. It's was 28 mil before bidding war! Everybody now is Juan Soto and every team is Mets.\n- No ways to controllably earn money outside of ticket price. It would be much better If there was an option for merch distribution, advertIsing on stadium. Maybe even using star players as advertising material? MLB the show BTW has advertising options.\n- I't feels more like I playing as team manager with player trading priviliges, not GM. While it's fun to walk prospects from minors to the World Series, there are not much options what to do as GM.\n- You can't ask player to learn new position. In development lab position selection is so fucking random. I lack of 3-baseman so it's natural that 1-baseman learns 3rd base, but no, fuck you, I am centerfielder now. Goddamn.\n\nOther than that, I'm in love with the game and I need a break from it, because I played it for 2 weeks straight like a second job. \n\nWhat I'd like to add:\n\n- More random events. Just rare charities from players and occasional bench-clearing are not enough.\n- More league modifiers after Winter Meetings (and option to increase or decrease the chance of them orruring in the save). \n- Salary cap option. Goddamit, never thought I'd ever be appologetic to Craig Breslow and Chaim Bloom.\n- Player allegiance. It would be great if players had some kind of allegiance. It's funny how FA from NYY come to Sox that easy as well as ex-Sox players become Yankees. Rivalries are cool.",

It seems like they have made every player fit the \"average\" development path, rather than having variance among outcomes create that average.
