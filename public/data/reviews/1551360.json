No\r\nIs this the best racing game ever? No\r\nIs this the best racing game the 2020s can offer you? Yes, most definitely.\r\n\r\nIt's the most respectful game towards gamers in the modern era, FOR SURE, as no extra content is shoved down your throat, you not forced to buy unnecessary sh!t to \"enjoy\" the game. \r\n\"Lootbox\" mechanics are not predatory at all, and the \"SeasonPass\" is nice, easy, fair and what it offers actually worth it for a long time and completely free. \r\n\r\nThe only thing it misses compared to games 20 years ago is the vibe and soul and the sense of new and uncharted, but barely any game have that now days anyway. \r\nBut it tries, as its not just PVE and PVP racing, there's player created content, and various kinds of game modes with cars. Most of them are okay tbf.\r\n\r\nIf you are an achievement-hunter, it's nowhere near as bad as 4 was, yet the stupid Eliminator game mode is still here, but all you have to do is win one.\r\nSounds easy and straight forward, isn't it?\r\nHowever, that game mode is agony, the person who came up with it should not be working on video games full-stop. \r\nSelf harm is more fun and fulfilling than the eliminator game mode.\r\nAs its unfair, unbalanced, FULL RNG and super toxic. \r\n\r\nIf the game would be scored on a scale of 100, the fact that the eliminator is a thing, and if you want all achievements you have to play it too, it would easily bring the game down from 98 to 70, then you play more and more of that stupid, stupid mode and it destroys any love and care you had for this game - until you play actual good mode",

      "review": "Forza Horizon 5 hit me way harder than I expected. The whole vibe is just electric - Mexico feels like one massive sun-soaked festival where something’s popping off every 100 meters. Events, races, wheelspins, new cars, seasonal stuff… the game floods you with content to the point where 100 hours barely scratch the surface. And yeah, I’m already 80+ hours in, still glued to it like it’s day one.\n\nGameplay? Super fun. The handling felt a bit sticky at first, especially on a controller, but that actually made it more addictive. Those cursed corners made me want to bump the difficulty, retry events, and actually learn how to take turns on a high-end car like a human being. The soundtrack slaps too - different stations, different moods, never gets dull.\n\nI’m not a racing game person at all, I just love cars so the physics threw me off at first. But as soon as I got used to it, it turned into a whole advantage. Especially once you dive into the tuning and customization. It’s ridiculous how deep it goes. You can tweak weight, build parameters, tire pressure, engine setups - it all genuinely changes how each car feels.\n\nThe game both looks and sounds insane. Wet roads at night? Peak visuals. Absolute perfection. The sound design/engines/weather, everything just elevates it even more.\n\nFavorite activities? I’m basic in the best way. Give me road races, closed-circuit races, anything on asphalt. Off-road? Miss me with that. But jumping into a new car and discovering how it behaves is pure dopamine. The more I unlock, the more I want to play - it’s that kind of loop.\n\nNow, the one thing that actually tilts me sometimes is the Drivatars. These bots straight up break the laws of physics, break my confidence and sometimes break my will to live. They get traction in places where your car just slides into the shadow realm. The fix? Either race real people online or mentally tune out the bots entirely and focus on your own run. If you stare at their behavior too long, it gets frustrating fast on high difficulty levels.\n\nI’d recommend Forza Horizon 5 to anyone who loves cars, tuning, or arcadey racing vibes. No matter skill level, it just grabs you and doesn’t let go.",

      "review": "Still a really good, solid game to consider, even at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor [b] casual [/b] players, the map is always beautiful and very spacious - each time you drive, even often on the same roads, but at variable scenery (whether it's at the beach, atop of mountains, through the rainforest, or simply over the stretching desert roads) - these driving experiences will never ever feel the same each time, it's always different. \r\n\r\nRelaxed, cruising at controlled, enjoyable speeds, and simply appreciating the splendid views - that's the perfect recipe for a nice, 'spirited driving' experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a [b] competitive [/b] standpoint, it's very easy, even for beginners, to obtain top tier cars and as well to apply free, community-made tunes shared by other players - to build a whole, challenge-worthy but widely varied garage, for relatively non-expensive in-game currencies, also easy to earn and not so timely.\r\n\r\nSometimes however, a few online race tracks might feel 'unforgiving', or the race itself might feel 'unfair' - mainly because of the tricky nature of challenging routes (no room for error or 'skill issues'), and/or also due to other players as well (too good/bad or 'lucky').\r\n\r\nRegardless, as in other games, trying to complete the race is always a must for learning, and so is having good sportsmanship, as I very often noticed, is also present in this game (for instance, racers often using 'Link' (in-game, quick chat feature), to simply say 'sorry' when they make mistakes affecting/impacting other racers).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe game never lacks [b] content [/b], as quite regularly, new challenges/events are added to unlock exclusive and amazing cars (voted by players - very cool), which all players can then get for free (for points earned), and players can even claim any previous ones which they missed (requires a 'backstage pass' which costs higher points, but still free to unlock one previously missed, exclusive car per 'season' - from any earlier season - also very cool). This is yet another reason why many players, including myself often come back to the game.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd say that the [b] price [/b] is also very fair and reasonable - for the amount of content and gameplay, so it's very much worth its value, and even more so - at the 50% off discounted price, especially during certain Steam sales events.\r\n\r\nI'd recommend playing this game using a controller, and of course, on a decent, average gaming rig (this game is also already optimized for your device after each update - very convenient)\r\n\r\n\r\n[b] Overall [/b], I'd highly recommend this game, especially if you are fond of driving, racing or such simulation games. Even I still find it to be the most visually immersive driving game - with good, engaging and some random gameplay as well. Online competition and completing challenges are quite fun sometimes, but, I think it's much better to appreciate the drive along the relaxing views, one place at a time, y'know, and I'd suggest giving this a try too, from time to time.\r\n\r\nAt this point of time, if you are considering getting the game, it'd be much more worthwhile if you'd continue playing - because 150 GB is quite demanding. Another way is you could also use the Steam storage management feature (in settings) to transfer the game to another storage drive and play again later.\r\n\r\n\r\nForza Horizon 6 is also right around the corner (next year), so you could also consider skipping straight to that, however, expect full price for quite some while after release, before eventually the getting lower prices from much later sales events.\r\n\r\nHowever, as seen from several recent games, the graphical recreation and maps of Japan have already been really impressive, and now it's only imaginable what FH6 is going to be like. Only time will tell, but it probably won't disappoint, that's for sure.\r\n\r\nSo, if you don't have FH5 already, I'd still recommend getting it as of right now, and I don't think that it would not be worth it. But again, certain things considered, it's always your choice.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, that's a pretty long review... I guess I might as well become a game critic now :3 \r\nNah but anyways, thanks for reading, I hope that in some way, you have gotten something out of this :>\r\nI wish you a very happy gaming holiday!",

The map, inspired by Mexico, is huge and packed with variety—dense forests, long beaches, desert areas, small towns, and even a volcano. No matter where you go, the world feels lively and full of detail.\n\nThe driving strikes a great balance: it’s realistic enough to feel satisfying, but still forgiving enough that anyone can jump in and have fun. The car list is massive, with everything from old classics to the latest supercars, so there’s always something new to try. Exploring the map and switching between different types of events keeps the game from ever feeling repetitive.\n\nProgression is relaxed and lets you tackle things in whatever order you prefer. There’s always something to do, thanks to the rotating seasons, weekly challenges, and online events. Visually, the game looks fantastic, and it runs smoothly even on less powerful setups.\n\nNot everything is perfect—online features can sometimes be a bit unreliable—but it’s a small complaint in the grand scheme of things.\n\nVerdict:\nForza Horizon 5 is a blast from start to finish. Its world, cars, and sheer amount of content make it an easy recommendation for anyone who enjoys racing games.\n\n⭐ 10/10 – A beautiful and endlessly entertaining open-world racer.",

What stands out the most is the excellent graphic quality - the world of Mexico is brought to life with incredible attention to detail. The landscapes are vibrant, diverse, and full of depth, making every drive across the map truly satisfying. The lighting, weather effects, and overall visual design are all top-tier. The soundtrack fits the atmosphere of the game flawlessly — it boosts the excitement during races and enhances the festival vibe during calmer moments. I was also very positively surprised by the story, which this time is more engaging, richer, and better executed than in the previous entries. The narrative draws you into the world of racing and Mexican culture in a smooth and enjoyable way.\n\nThe only thing I felt was missing is that cars had slightly more detailed models in FH 4 It’s a small remark, but fans of automotive realism might notice it.\n\nDespite this minor drawback, FH 5 is a fantastic game that I can wholeheartedly recommend — beautiful, dynamic, polished, and full of great energy. It’s perfect for both newcomers and long-time fans of the series.",

I was six years late, but when I finally played it I fell in love.\n\nI never had the money for an Xbox or a good PC, so for years I just watched other people play. I built a PC and started FH4 on integrated graphics. I saved up, bought a GPU, and later picked up Forza Horizon 5 on sale.\n\nI played FH5 three years after its release, and it became my most-played game.\n\nEven now I haven’t completed everything, there are too many challenges, too many boards, too many cars. FH4 has about 700 cars; FH5 has around 900. It never ends.\n\nThe story writing is basic and the voice acting is bad, they’re there but you will not care about them because the fun is completing the challenges.\n\nThe Hot Wheels DLC, Rally DLC and the free DLCs (like the donut media one) are great: lots of content, lots of fun.\n\nWhat is annoying is the Premium Edition situation. Years later they still release small car packs with only 4–5 cars each. After 900 hours of playing if you want to have everything you have to buy the Ultimate Car Pack Collection.\n\nThe map is huge but often feels empty. Too much desert, too much jungle, and too many long, empty roads. If the Rally DLC map were part of the main map, the world would feel better it has better, more fun curves.\n\nThe seasons doesn't make sense. It’s Mexico, so it basically like “hot” or “raining,” and that loses a lot of the seasonal atmosphere that FH4 had.\n\nI definitely recommend it, the game is fun if you play alone and its fun if you play with friends, it is just like previous titles but with some better mechanics and more content.",

      "review": "May be the worst Horizon game for now. I'll start with the positives:\n+Car sounds (for the most part) are pretty good. An overall improvement from the previous game. Cars like LFA sound lovely.\n+Simcade driving feels nice enough. I enjoyed it.\n+Graphics and suspension animations are really good.\n+Good for beginners. If you're a racing game newbie, it's an okay game to start.\n+Very good optimization.\n\nNow, here are the negative aspects of this game:\n-The map is just so bad. I feel like im driving in a Fallout game. It is a barren wasteland.\n-There is basically no real storyline and the existing \"story\" missions are just terrible. \n-Voice acting is REALLY annoying.\n-The \"festival\" theme of this game is just bad and tiring.\n-Basically no progression. The game gives you stuff constantly.\n-Bad online experience. Online races suck ass.\n-Bad customization. %90 of cars just dont have any visual customization besides the default ebay spoiler.\n-Dripfed, FOMO content.\n-Bad DLC's. Rally Adventure is a sad attempt at a rally expansion.\n-Most car models are from previous titles, some are from the PS3 era.\n-The previously mentioned simcade driving physics can be a bit janky from time to time.\n-Bad crash models and physics.\n-Bad menu design and slow menus.\n-Speed and drift zones are annoying and contribute nothing to the gameplay. \n-No sense of speed. \n-Really absurd engine modifications. You can just tune everything to pass the sound barrier.\n-170gb\n\nI'm not throwing shade to any developers, as im pretty sure they did their best with the budget and time limit they're given. It's a fun game to boot up from time to time to drive around, but for my experience, thats it. It's a game made by non-car people and you can tell. It may be the most corporate, soulless racing game of all time. It needs more \"character\". No real reason to buy this AT FULL PRICE, especially now the sixth game is on its way. Wait for a sale, if you're interested.",

FH5 has dlss (which works half the time) but no latency settings, so you need to do it manually.\nthe game uses a slightly advanced version of the FH4 engine so it should run as fine but obviously that's not the case.\n\ni've tried to refund the game several times since this bandwidth issue came up but steam declined it of course because of the playtime. nothing better than posting a serious issue which breaks the game 100% and steam comes up with their pre-written copy&paste answer. \nsame goes for the community manager from the dev team with their generic blah blah answer. gosh i hate you all so much it is not even funny anymore. \ncheers",

Considering how many DLC they are, that's a lot of money to spend to own nothing. This is almost a scam. If the cars in those DLCs even become unobtainable --> *That would be a scam*. \r\n2. Upgrading cars require in game currency.\r\n3. \"Wheelspins\" -- an in-game \"prize wheel\". You don't earn currency, it's literally GAMBLING. Doesn't matter how good you are. \r\n4. \"Super Wheelspins\" are SLOT MACHINES. \r\n5. Car upgrades are per-car. Including things like rims and tires. No global unlock. More grind.\r\n6. AI cheats. Random AI cars will suddenly do things that ruin immersion and defy physics. Not cool.\r\n7. Play with a keyboard? Use car aids? Get currency penalized.\r\n8. Many cars are earned through grind currency mechanics.\r\n9. Most cars can be bought with \"vouchers\". \r\n10. The game's frustration/currency/grind/gambling mechanic is design to push you buying vouchers.\r\n11. To buy cars.\r\n12. Cars you already paid for in the DLC you paid for.",

Im sorry but the peel p50 should not be hitting 3k+ mph on the high way stretch. oh and another thing, if i dropped the 100 bucks for the premium edition to ensure i have all the dlc released at a later date, keep true to it, that really pissed me off I didn't get access to the ultimate car packs.",
