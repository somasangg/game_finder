The level of detail and freedom makes every project feel personal, and it’s incredibly satisfying to see my vision come to life.\nWhat really takes it to the next level is the Steam Workshop integration. Pairing the base game with community mods opens up a whole new world of possibilities  from custom furniture and décor to unique layouts and design inspirations. I like to think of it as my ikea lol If you are a creative person you can create and recreate so many different designs. One of my favorite games by far. I highly recommend this games especially if you love shows like on HGTV.",

One of my favorite parts of the game is the gardening system—there are so many plants, tools, and customization options that designing outdoor spaces becomes just as enjoyable and rewarding as decorating the interiors.\n\nThe mechanics in the original game also feel wonderfully smooth and intuitive. The rooming system, in particular, is a standout feature. Being able to create and define individual rooms gives you total creative control and makes every renovation project feel unique and personal.\n\nWhile House Flipper 2 introduces different features, House Flipper 1 remains my go-to because of how polished, content-rich, and satisfying the overall experience is. If you’re looking for a fully developed home-renovation game with tons of creative freedom, House Flipper 1 is absolutely worth recommending.",

The repetitive nature of the game just doesn't justify that massive extra cost. That said, if you can find the base game for under $5, it's worth picking up just to try.\n\nTürkçe:\nHouse Flipper, arada kafa dağıtmak için güzel bir oyun.

Gradually pour in the water, constantly stirring. Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic.\nResting the dough: Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or cover it with a towel and let it rest for 30 minutes.\nPreparing the filling:\nBoiling the potatoes: Peel the potatoes, cut them into large pieces, and boil until tender in salted water.\nPreparing the onions: While the potatoes are boiling, finely chop the onions. Sauté the onions in lard or butter until golden brown.\nMaking the potato puree: Drain the potatoes and mash them. Add the sautéed onions, salt, and pepper to taste, and mix well.\nForming the dumplings:\nRolling out the dough: Roll out the dough into a thin sheet about 2-3 mm thick. Use a glass or cutter to cut out circles approximately 7-8 cm in diameter.\nForming the dumplings: Place a spoonful of potato filling on each circle of dough. Fold the dough in half and pinch the edges tightly to seal the dumplings.\nCooking the dumplings:\nBoiling water: Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add salt.\nCooking the dumplings: Gently drop the dumplings into the boiling water, stirring carefully to prevent sticking. Cook until done (approximately 5-7 minutes after they float to the surface).\nServing:\nRemoving the dumplings: Remove the dumplings with a slotted spoon and place them on a plate.\nServing: Serve the dumplings hot, optionally drizzling with melted butter, sour cream, or sautéed onions.\nEnjoy your meal!",

I understand wanting DLC buyers to feel like they’re getting something valuable, but every time you try to finish the game, they keep adding more and more DLCs. It ruins the fun. On top of that, some of the DLCs aren’t even worth it.\n\nAsking players to spend this much money is just greedy. There’s nearly 600 worth of DLC, and a lot of it doesn’t even look worth buying. Even during sales, the prices barely drop maybe down to 44 or 35 if you’re lucky. The cheaper DLCs are boring, but still required if you want full completion. And bundles don’t help much either.\n\nI completed House Flipper 2, and of course they immediately started releasing [DLC]'s for that as well. Now, to complete it again, you need a DLC that costs around 50. How the achievement count jumped from 36 to 48, I honestly don’t know, but some companies really are greedy.\n\nIf you don’t like games that basically make you pay for achievements, I wouldn’t recommend buying anything from this company unless you have money to spare for devs who seem hungry for every bit they can get.",
