Obviously I understand it's only to an extent, but I've learned a lot about the machinery, what it's used for and how to use it. It taught me what goes into growing an awesome crop and what goes into harvesting that crop. \n\nEven on low graphics, the visuals are amazing. I'm running an i5 with an integrated graphics card that is simply garbage and 8gb of RAM. \n\nI absolutely recommend this game to anyone interested in the farming life.",

      "review": "FS22 is a great game at its core. It has all the aspects of farming you would want. However, there are a number of what feels like \"lazy spots\" in the game, such as a garbage selection of vehicles and equipment for things such as grapes, olives, cotton, beets, and potatoes. Bigger headers are absolutely necessary to make it more bearable, and only have 1-2 options for equipment in general for a number of them seems silly.",

One when I was out of a vehicle my character randomly started jumping, two while on land in one of my fields my Tractor and Cultivator disappeared under ground, and when I exited I noticed my screen flickering and flashing a lot.  When I logged out of the game and logged back into the zone Erlangrat my character was doing the same thing.  Finally when I exited my vehicle there was bouncing of the vehicle and fertilizer happening.  \r\n\r\nMac detaile:\r\nApple M1 Max\r\n32 GB of memory\r\n1TB Drive\r\nRunning MacOS Tahoe 26.1\r\nWith a fresh install of Steam",

Firstly- the graphics engine feels extremely dated, and has a tendency to stutter for the first few minutes playing a save, next the entire game feels like there's a thin coat of petroleum jelly over the graphics, honestly I would say FS19 had better graphics, just because they didn't have the absolute garbage TAA this game has. Finally- the near-requirement to either print out the manual or a bunch of cheatsheets can make things tough for someone getting started. However, if you can get past/mod these things away, you're in for hours of pleasurable farming.",

Working together, dividing up tasks, and expanding your farms as a group makes the time fly by.\r\n\r\nOverall, Farming Simulator 22 isn’t perfect — it has its slow moments and some clunky mechanics — but it’s a solid, relaxing game that’s easy to lose hours in. 7/10",

Id give it a 4/5 stars because ultimaley the grind is gonna suck hours for almost nothing and now that farming sim 25 is the same price your better off buying that, the Ai helpers are actually just flat out special, they get stuck on random things. If they were gonna update these games the Ai is the biggest problem by far. Graphics are decent nothing mind blowing. I wish the AI could actually follow your combine and i don't imagine im the only one who would apprectiate that feature. The AI when i had it do contract work drove into a river leaving the contract 82% done. Kinda boring for normal people. Also your limited on map choice and honestly the mod maps aren't anything that catch my eye the first map is the only good one IMO the other two are near impossible to work on and im personally a fan of big scale farming and i was disaposinted that all the big maps break the Ai causing them to sit there draining money. Overall pretty decent game. But get FS25 if you really wanna spend the money.",

You have to constantly watch the tractor to make sure it doesn't go off track leave small sections of unharvested/mowed crops on your field.

And by the time you have your farm set up and are ready to actually play, you've lost a lot of time and enthusiasm.\n\nI love farming games, and this game can be fun sometimes, especially when you finally have enough money to construct a new building or get new farm animals.

      "review": "There are 3 main issues I have with this game:\n\n1. You can't sell fences. I placed fences all around the perimeter of my 3 farm houses to make the property look neater and divide the 3 areas. Then I realized it ended up costing way too much money, and when I went to sell them (like you can do with every other item in the construction tab) you only get the option to demolish them. So that was $50,000 of in-game money down the drain, and couldn't load a new save. So I never use fences in fear that I'll regret placing them, not to mention they're very expensive.\n\n2. You have to constantly watch the tractor to make sure it doesn't go off track leave small sections of unharvested/mowed crops on your field. It would be great if there was a key you could press that would let you run the tractor parallel to the last line you made. The only way to make field work anything but tedious is to just hire the AI farmer and take the loss in funds.\n\n3. There's an incredibly steep learning curve and many things the tutorial doesn't teach you. The first three hours of the game are spent on researching what kind of equipment you need for what type of crop you are growing, and then spending a significant amount of time transporting the equipment from the store to your farm. And by the time you have your farm set up and are ready to actually play, you've lost a lot of time and enthusiasm.\n\nI love farming games, and this game can be fun sometimes, especially when you finally have enough money to construct a new building or get new farm animals. But for the most part, this game is very boring and tedious and it takes forever to make progress in the game.",
