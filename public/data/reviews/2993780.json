Some Lives are definitely more fun than others, and the higher you get in a Life path, the grind becomes a lot more noticeable. The story is cute and charming, but nothing too special. Overall, it’s a cozy game that’s great if you enjoy progression and chill grinding.",

      "review": "i originally fell in love with the original fantasy life so i was hyped when this game was announced. i think in terms of gameplay features and such the game is very strong and incredibly fun!! i like the new town mechanic and i think its fun to have a whole area to make my own, and i feel satisfied with the difficulty and everything as well. i can definitely see myself sinking more time into the game to get stronger :D \n\nhowever!! i do think this game is missing a lot of the heart and soul i enjoyed with the original fantasy life. like genuinely the original game was so full of life, and the map felt massive!! but in this game, despite there being more areas to explore, i think a lot of it is just missing that unique touch that would make it stand out. i think my biggest gripe is that all of the interior dungeons follow the same layout and look the same. i would understand it for the randomly generated dungeons, but as far as the overworld dungeons go, i really miss them all having their own unique interiors and such. i find it way easier to get lost now because everything looks the same no matter where i go, and it also just makes me feel way more bored when im runing around. like exploring genuinely isnt exciting anymore and it kinda sucks, even in the original FL going through the same dungeons hundreds of times never got old to me because i thought they all looked fun and interesting, now though i just get bored and it makes me not want to farm materials, it feels really demotivating.\n\ntldr!! if youre mostly here for the gameplay mechanics then this game will totally meet your standards!! but if youre looking for the heart of the original game then i fear its not here quite yet :( i do still have hope that theyll add dlc that could maybe change my mind, but we'll have to wait and see. in general though i do still love this game and i would recommend it especially if you can get it on sale :D",

      "review": "First off, my playtime for this game is grossly inaccurate due to playing this on a Rog Ally and leaving it in hibernate for too long...whoops.  My accurate playtime is around 110 hours.\n\nThis is my GOTY for 2025.  I did play the original Fantasy Life shortly after release on the DS, in Japanese, and had mostly forgotten it by the time this sequel came out.  Some references went over my head but overall, knowledge of the first game is not required at all.  \n\nSome of the statements about this being a cozy game feel really off to me.  The marketing stating that it's a \"slow-life JRPG\", I would agree with to some extent, however.  Calling this a cozy game really does it a disservice, as this really plays more like a Japanese MMO, with the content and longevity to back that up.  It deserves to be at a AAA JRPG price point, and not a \"cozy game\" lower price point like something in the vein of Hello Kitty Island Adventure - and this is not a dig at that game, as it is also excellent, but Fantasy Life is a totally different beast with alot more depth and content.  There are some serious story themes in this game that are not at all cozy as well.\n\nThis game, while not really being \"cozy\", can be played as slowly as you like.  Play all the jobs, take forever saving someone who was kidnapped if you want to - he'll be totally fine.  Choose a goal and work toward that and enjoy exploring the giant world that's aptly named Ginormosia.  Exploration in this game is phenomenal and was my favorite part of the experience.  \n\nBuilding the town is something you can also mostly ignore if it's not your thing - you can just plop some stuff down anywhere like I did to meet the goals you need to accomplish.  Later on, after beating the main game, I did get a hankering for building a fleshed-out, themed town, and it was pretty rewarding - not DQ Builders-level of amazing, but much more fun than other games where I've put together a town, such as ACNH.  \n\nThis is a game I will definitely be coming back to if there is any DLC or any major updates.  This game is all pure fun and I recommend it to any JRPG fan, casual or hardcore, who is able to vibe with the cutesy graphical style!",

      "review": "Excellent cozy game for just zoning out and making number go up. Sort of three games in one, a mix of Rune Factory, Breath of the Wild, and Animal Crossing, which isn't as deep as any of them at their particular niches, but manages to blend them in an interesting way. Got my money's worth just getting all of the jobs up to an endgame (but not maximum) level. I think it falls short a bit in the endgame, where I sort of burned out and had little reason to really grind out leveling the Breath of the Wild-style continent's zones or the materials for the very last equipment for each life.\n\nThe story is fairly bland and obvious fare, but good enough to keep you going as long as you're also the type to have natural interest in leveling up all the things as you go. It's very convenient to just be fighting through some enemies, see a tree you need, and swap to woodcutter to gather the materials before going back to your combat life. Each job has at least minimally entertaining minigames involved to make them more interesting than just click node collect node, and robust skill trees give a fair amount of flexibility in how you would like to progress (but you can, in the end, complete every skill node). Completionism at the very end is even rewarded by giving each life a Hero skill that works even when you have a different life selected.\n\nWith a DLC or patch to fill out the endgame this would be even better, but I'd give it about 8/10 as it is for what it is. It took me over 70 hours just to Master (but not Hero) every life and get all the best pre-Legendary gear in each. Good enough for me to set it down and maybe come back if it gets more to do.",

I skipped all cutscenes till the end and focused on the small comfy quests.\n\nThe combat is quite simple, but sometimes requires skill. But the real hook is the Lives. Swap classes like outfits and the game just… let's you. No punishment, and especially no longer the need to travel all the back to the guild like you needed to do in Castele. That was lame. No 40-minute cutscene explaining the Meaning of Destiny, changing lives' tutorials can be skipped.

Gameplay is also very simple, and that works in its favor again. \nThe real juice of this game comes with variety. While I personally would have loved more gameplay options in each Life, what you get is still amazing. The mini games are tied only slightly to your skill and you feel like you get better at them to the point of perfection, but mostly its your gear, which you crafted yourself, and that is awesome. You feel like you've achieved every single upgrade you get since you made it yourself, basically from scratch. Amazing feeling.",

Crafting is fun and in my opinion has a great balance of having a little randomness to keep it from being boring without making it too difficult. The story was very cute. \r\n\r\nThis is one of the few games--or really purchases in general--that had a lot more content than I expected at purchase.  I expected only a cute rpg with some crafting, and was very shocked by the entirety of Ginormosia. The groves are also a fun way to spend time with friends. \r\n\r\nI think the only part of the game I felt was slightly weak was the decorating aspect, but that is mostly because I primarily play decorating games. The assets that come with this game are very well made, though. Still, I am eagerly awaiting the DLC to return to my buddies :3",

If you are looking for a fun and relaxing game that covers a great story, fun combat, and lots of content then this is the game for you. \n\nFrom the quests and challenges the different lifes provide to the side quests and resource gathering, it is all very well done. It is unlike your standard RPG as you can focus on very specific skills that can be completed in any order and have vastly different impacts on how you play the game. There is also free content coming soon in the form of a free to play DLC (something other companies seem to dislike doing) and that will expand the world of this game even more.\n\nThe music and art is an excellent additional point in this games favor, not to mention the characters and dialogue. And you can play this game without having played the first one. I will say, there are some downsides and gripes that I personally have. One of which being the late game XP grind is ROUGH to say the least. Not that it can't be done, but it is a GRIND. Another gripe I have is that not all life quests can be completed without getting materials from only RNG sources. I believe that there should be multiple ways to gather any and all resources, so long as it makes sense for them to be able to be gathered. \n\nOverall, play this game. If you have been thinking about it for a while, and are willing to part with the means of obtaining it, play it. You won't be disappointed but warning, you may become addicted. I speak from experience on that account. And it should be Steam Game of the Year because it got Snubbed otherwise.",

      "review": "If you don't have time for a game to take near complete control of your life then you might want to pause on picking up this gem.  I can't help but drop into this game every couple of days to work on my farm and craft a few items now that I've \"finished\" the game.  I still have stuff that I need to do and I can hop in for a few minutes and get a couple things done.  Sadly this usually means I spend a few hours doing way to much and still wanting to do more.  I have now played this through like 6 times since it launched and I'm prepping my main save for the DLC dropping soon.  \n\nMy pros include an addictive loop of gathering items, crafting, and leveling a variety of lives.  The art style is cute and what you expect from LEVEL5.  The story is decent and keeps you engaged even if it does feel a little rushed toward the end.  The island you get to decorate gives you some amazing freedom in how you express yourself and the mulitplayer gives you the opportunity to visit other player's islands and get some inspiration. The development team continues to take player feedback and make improvements and quality of life updates that make the game even more accessible.\n\nThe cons for me are some of the limitations that seem to be in place just because.  For instance the farming is very limited both in the crops you can grow and the number of farming plots you can have.  Considering there are around 10-15 other fruits and veggies that you can purchase from shops, but can't grow is strange.  You are also locked into only 8 plots for farming when you have 6 farmable crops so you have to pick and choose how you farm to optimize them.  \nThe Multiplayer aspect is fun, but the time limit placed on the activities seems like an odd roadblock. The big mulitplayer zone is locked into 1 hour time limit chunks.  So if you are playing with friends you have re-up the session every hour, which is kinda silly.\nThe story feels truncated toward the end.  Based on what I have heard about the development of the game this was the unfortunate side effect of a troubled development process, which is why some have complained about how this title doesn't compare to the scope and length of the 3DS title.  This is a shame because you can see where the development team has made extensive changes from player feedback.  I only hope the development team continues to add to the game and make improvements.  \n\nDespite my criticisms I can not recommend this game enough. No game is perfect, but this game is tied from my game of the year with Clair Obscure.",

      "review": "Fantasy Life with the addition of an Open World zone and Animal Crossing island.\r\n\r\nThe story is ok. The experience is brought down by time gated mechanics and endless padded grinds to increase playtime. The keyboard/mouse inputs also do not always register with the UI and feels clunky. Overall it starts out fun and then it is death by a thousand papercuts of chores that ruin the experience.\r\n\r\nI am sure there were a lot more annoyances that I came across during gameplay but below were a lot of the ones that came to mind.\r\n\r\nCombat:\r\n-Main character is constantly putting away weapon if you are trying to dodge/run around an enemy to get a better angle.\r\n-Skill buttons do not work unless you have your weapon out, so if you moved too much and your character put away their weapon, you have to draw it again, then use the special even though it is a dedicated keybind.\r\n-Enemies constantly move up and down ledges in the terrain causing you to miss attacks or have to reposition\r\n-If enemies travel too far from their spawn when dodging you, they will reset\r\n\r\nNPC Buddies\r\n-Their damage output is reduced which makes upgrading their gear feel less rewarding\r\n-Their AI will have them running all over the place in combat and sometimes pull other enemies you were not actively fighting.\r\n-They will not engage in combat unless you are actively fighting. So if an enemy aggros you while you are gathering, they will sit there and get attacked until they die, or stand there and watch you get attacked and get your gathering attempt interrupted.\r\n-They have very few voice lines and will constantly say the same phrase over and over and there is no option to mute them\r\n-The main resource to get them on your team is gated by real world time. They reset once each day.\r\n-There is no option to save team presets, so if you are running around with combat buddies and want to swap to gathering buddies, you need to swap each one manually and then swap back after.\r\n\r\nEnemies/Quest/Resources/Misc\r\n-The variety of enemy types is a bit lacking and you can tell it is a game really meant for handheld with the low density.\r\n-Quests to kill enemies usually require more enemies than are in the zones so you need to reset the area multiple times to compete.\r\n-Different tiers of the same enemy model can be in the same group so it is misleading when you need to kill one specific type of enemy and there are multiple types that look almost identical in the group.\r\n-Enemies are hardcoded with a cap of how many items can drop, so even with gear specialized to increase item drops, you are only getting one of a specific item per kill. That is made worse when you need multiples of an item and there is only one instance of an enemy to drop it so you need to keep resting the zone to farm.\r\n-Items to specialize your gear to increase drops are only available in the end game when you have almost completed every life at which point it is more frustrating to have to grind out so much already.\r\n-The endgame dungeon is extremely repetitive and has an hour time limit. You can complete it faster but up to an hour of content to have a chance to get one gather attempt at resources you need or a marginal stat increase it too time consuming and tedious. \r\n-The open world continent is split up into a bunch of regions and each one takes hours of grinding to level up so it will have harder enemies and higher tier loot.\r\n-Mouse interaction with the UI seems to be tracked as the mouse moves over a button not what it is currently hovering over. So if you mouse is over the middle option but by default the menu opens with the left option highlighted when you open it, a mouse click will click the left highlighted button and not the middle button you clicked.\r\n-Long Clicking in combat is not reliable for charging attacks. If you character put their weapon away, you end up long clicking just to draw your weapon. Lives such as Mercenary have particles all around the character so the charge complete animation is easy to miss. If you wanted to cancel a charged move to do a different ability, there is no way to reliably cancel. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Animal Crossing style Island\r\n-Resource flowers only regrow once per day. These are required to advance certain part of the main story quest so you can easily have your progress halted.\r\n-They definitely tie animal crossing with the amount of menus, sub menus and text lines when trying to navigate to relocate something in your base camp.\r\n-Relocating Buildings/Farms have to be done through npc and not freely in design mode. It just makes redesigning tedious and time consuming just so they can have another money sink.\r\n-All island design features are not unlocked until further in the story, so at that point you will need to fight with the menus to either clear your island or move everything around over and over again as you finish your designs.\r\n-Farming gives back less than 50% of the seeds planted to be yet another currency sink. Shop stock of some seeds are also time gated that you can only buy enough for one plot each real life day.",

The first game felt lived in and the characters had actual personalities. The story was charming and funny. But the new one... The word is just... dead. You have a few cities with actual people living there but you can't really do anything there and you don't feel like you develop a relationship with any of them people. The first quest to each life is literally always the same thing. The main levelling and gathering happens in an empty open world where everywhere kinda looks the same. You don't want to explore because there's almost nothing to find. And the story? Oh boy... either the writers were AI bots, high or sleep deprived. Nothing made sense. And I don't mean the charming kids logic type. It simply did not make sense. Characters suddenly appeared without prior introduction, the time travelling feels unnecessarily convoluted and is not explained too well. The story is exclusively driven forward by ex-machina moments. Our bird needs to speak? Sure, let him fall into a random magic vase just lying around. Problem solved. -.- The only thing fun about this was complaining while I played with my brother. (Btw. the little brother mode is a nice idea, but in some areas you can't even control Trip, which is pretty frustrating and feels like just laziness) I think they tried to cram too many different mechanics of other games into one and completely lost their original charm in the process.",

      "review": "As someone who fell in love with the original Fantasy Life on the 3DS, I was ecstatic when I learned that there was a sequel in the making. I was craving to pour in another 300+ hours into this game just like I did with the original game. As of writing this review, I am disheartened to say that I am disappointed with Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time. The gameplay loop, the dungeon design, and the world itself... all of it greatly saddens me.\n\n[Gameplay Loop]\nTo start off, I want to discuss the gameplay loop. Much like in the original, the game has you selecting various lives to pursue all the while making your way though the story. The design is still there, do thing, and progress. Nothing I would say is highly deviating from the 3DS version. The problem is the massive level of grinding you have do, and this is especially worse in the end game. I was so fed up with getting materials and fighting specified monsters. It takes ages to reach destinations of objectives, so it makes the grind not only hard, but also tedious. \n\n[Dungeon Design]\nThis is a good time to discuss the actual dungeon design and the world itself. It is GOD AWFUL! Holy Christ, the dungeons are so uninspired and bland. Worse is that they are long as hell. It takes ages to progress from one floor to the next as each floor is too big. Each room is just a box connected by a hallway that leads to the next box. There is so little creativity in the dungeon design that I was immensely bored because every room looks identical to me. Everywhere looked the same to me, even if I had a map to work with. Did you enjoy the first dungeon that you trekked? Good! Every other dungeon including the last one will be the same since you enjoyed the first one so much! It is just that creatively bankrupted! When you compare this to the original on the 3DS, it is night and day. Sure the 3DS version may not have been peak game design, but the inner environments was not modular, and instead had actual winding hallways and connected tunnels. Not a box with a path connecting from the four cardinal directions. ACTUAL HANDCRAFTED ENVIRONMENTS PEOPLE!\n\n[The Empty World]\nBad dungeon is already a major turn off, but paired with a bad world is horrific. The game has three worlds that you can explore. Those three being the past, the present, and a really bad open world called Ginormousia. I don't really have much to say on the past as it is fine for what it is, but the present is just where you would go to do the bland ass dungeon and work on your home base. Ginormousia on the other hand I wished was just integrated into the past world as it is just boring. There is hardly any interesting things to do in Ginormousia. All you do is fight basic enemies, mine and gather materials, capture towers to build the world map, and open up settlements to procure goods. All of these things are not very fun I assure you. I would had liked it better if the devs just god rid of Ginourmousia entirely, and just added more locations in the past instead as it is the only interesting world of all the three.\n\n[Music]\nOne of the biggest irks to me that this game brings is the music. Let me state that I loved the music of the original Fantasy Life, and I acknowledge that it has a ton of charms. However, the decision to reuse a ton of tracks into this sequel feels like poor direction. I would excuse it if the game had good design, but the game has terrible design. It honestly feels like the music has been grafted into a limping Frankenstein monster to blind the audience by the nostalgia in front of them and hinder their perception of the bland world they are enveloped in. It doesn’t feel like charm, it feels like hypnosis. Once I noticed it, I cannot vibe to the familiar jingle. Instead, I’m just being reminded that I am playing a worse version of a game I once loved.\n\n[The Characters]\nI would say that a lot of the cute and goofy nature of the characters do carry over into this sequel title. However, while charm is present, the cast is bland. I feel like I don’t know the people around the protagonist as well as I should. Compared to the first game, the cast was super diverse and their story had an allure to them that makes you want to actually aid their troubles. Maybe it’s the nostalgia talking, but I feel that I think this way because of how connected the world of the original game was. I can move from the kingdom to the other kingdom on foot, I didn’t need to use a dragon to teleport me there. The journey itself alongside the people I met made me more attached to them. When the king asked me to trek into the desert to quench the fears of a dark sultan, I felt more immersed in my role, and with the visions of the speaking characters. When the princess escaped to go on a journey of her own, I felt compelled to find her and learn more about her story. I just simply do not get that same feeling with the characters of this sequel.\n\nThere is more I would like to talk about, but I am not a very good writer so it is hard for me to convey everything in an efficient way. All in all, I am not very impressed by this sequel. I just hope that if there is another sequel in the minds of the developer, then I hope they decide to make it more like Fantasy Life, and not this.",

      "review": "The positives to this game are a polished appearance, including a character creator with plenty of options, cute and creative looking NPCs, and enjoyable weather systems that include a night and day cycle and rain. The unlockable map is huge. The crafting minigame is creative and pleasing to look at and play. The game entices you to play for hours because there's always something else that you need to do. There are no stretches of confusion as to what you should be doing or boredom.\n\nI would have recommended this game if it had more roleplay elements and less grindy/roguelike elements. I am many hours in and it feels like this game is just you collecting NPCs like cards so you can craft recipes a bit better. There is no emotional depth. You might not realize how grindy and shallow it is until you get a few hours in.\n\nTrying to figure out what to level or harvest or complete next is convoluted and difficult to keep track of with so many professions and tasks (main storyline quests, guild challenges, 14 types of profession quests and unlockable challenges, and side quests). You run through the same areas and dungeons over and over again to reload targets and get drops, and that's largely the game. There is discussion online on how to reset saves so that you have a higher chance of getting the very rare bosses to spawn. When a game turns into this, I feel that the game design is not good.\n\nThere is a limit on your personal island of a maximum of 6 inhabitants out of a total of 49 you can collect. This is ridiculous and annoying for PC players. There should be a default low number that can be raised by choice in your settings. My PC can handle way more villagers than 6. Having a full town of your favorite NPCs would be better, in my opinion. Still, you feel distant and unbonded from your Strangeling (minion) collection. They just say repetitive lines and you whip different ones out sometimes.\n\nNo spoilers, but the main story quest is kind of weird and dumbed down to be child-friendly. I found myself both agreeing with the villain and being confused as to why things were happening the way they were, and why things ended the way they did.\n\nThe game is not voice acted, other than some grunts and noises and small comments. Some Strangelings following you say repetitive voiced lines like \"Got a minute?\" and \"Can we talk?\" Which confuses you and makes you think that you're supposed to talk to them. It's just a random voiced line and it shouldn't have been used for just general commentary.\n\nBeing able to form deeper relationships with NPCs would be a significant improvement. NPCs frequently reference the fact that they love or want to marry someone, but you're just running around like an uninvolved, uninteresting spectator. You can build decorations but outside of two small rooms of your own, you don't really have the option to use most of the wallpapers and floors and indoor decorations. Your NPCs interact with some of the outdoor decorations. Yet it feels empty on your island. There are adorable cats and creatures scattered around the world that you can't interact with. You can't bring them with you to your island. You can't collect or have your own pets. Why overlook so many interesting possibilities?\n\nFor a game that lacks roleplay depth, the combat is not amazing to make up for it. If you cast a large spell or ability, your character freezes in one place and enemies run out of the range of your ability often. With some classes you can't even see where your spell is going to land before you cast. There is a button to randomly select and stick to a target, but sometimes it falls off and I still don't know why. Combat is clumsy, spammy, and unenjoyable.\n\nThere are definitely overlooked things in the programming. If you have a quest item equipped to either yourself or one of your minions, a quest for that item will be marked as falsely completed if you attempt and fail to turn it in. This makes tracking quests a pain in some cases, as they remain in your log but do not show up as a quest in the crafting interface anymore. \n\nYou unlock an \"Activities\" tab which is like \"daily quests,\" only they are really easy to complete tasks and replace themselves with other easy to complete tasks, and you find yourself constantly having to re-open the Activities tab to tediously turn in the daily task you completed, over and over again. It should be auto-completed or something to avoid how repetitive and annoying it is.\n\nOnce you find a certain amount of Strangelings (minions), not anywhere close to the max of 49, you will still receive dropped Strangeling chests from bosses, but they will appear to have no cutscene and nothing inside of them. This has confused multiple people online, including myself, into thinking their game is bugged. These chests should stop dropping once you've gotten all the possible Strangelings from them.\n\nMany loading and processing animations are far too long after you see them multiple times. There should be a way to fast forward through/skip these. Because this game involves a ton of back to back crafting, you just feel like banging your head the whole time, watching NPCs nod their heads while you wait for your crafting to finish. Quest turn ins also have a strange, long delay.\n\nThere is a blurry, vaseline screen effect along the screen edges cannot be disabled by settings and makes it feel like your eyes are watering when you first start the game until you get used to it. This is a very odd design choice.\n\nThis game goes out of its way to make your character completely genderless. There is no male/female option during character creation, only body types. There are no pronouns and NPCs do not refer to you with any. And yet, when you master a profession, you get treated to a long song about yourself and the profession, and some of them are actually gendered male and refer to your character as a he, which is weird.\n\nI can't recommend the game because I really don't like games that are oriented around just grinding. If there was just a bit more of an \"involved\" feel to the game, I would have liked it.",

Maybe play it if you have nothing better to do and have money to burn?\nI played more than a hundred hours of this game, and I still don't think I can recommend it. Ultimately, the problem is that every thing feels very shallow. There are a lot of gameplay elements, but all of them feels half-baked. Starting from the mid game, but especially in the end game, everything is incredibly grindy, and not in a fun way. The story is the generic JRPG fare, the art style is also cute but generic, and the music is nothing to write home about.

      "review": "Let me start by saying I really wanted to like this game.\nUnfortunately that wasn't possible.\nThe good:\nThe outfits and character design are quite adorable.\nThe music is... fine, nothing ground-breaking, but also nothing jarring.\n\nThe bad:\nYour buddies never stop talking when on adventures with you. Every few steps someone is going to repeat the same tired line they've said 50 times already.\nMounts - They... exist? I guess? You get one for free, the rest seem to be purchases or enemy drops but other than needing to use the camel in about 3 whole spots in Ginormosia the entire mechanic is pointless\nThe life system as a whole is... pretty terrible. 14 lives you can freely change between sounds neat on paper, but the implementation is just... bad.\nThere's never a reason to change combat life, the game attempts to convince you that there are enemies that resist certain elements, but I can't say that ever happened, and even so, you can just run buddies in the other combat jobs who, ironically deal way more damage, take more punishment, and just do combat better than the MC ever can.\nThe gathering lives only exist to collect materials to fuel the crafting lives, sound on paper but unless you're dying to collect all the furniture you can literally ignore crafting.\nCrafting is very underpowered, crafted goods don't sell as well as you'd think, and enemies drop so much equipment (typically better than you can craft) that you're drowning in money unless you actually interact with the crafting system.\nEach new area lets you just buy all new equipment, and it's on par with, if not better than anything you can craft until you're nearly done with the area.\nBeing able to craft consumables is useless, you get entirely too much money, making it far faster just to buy potions.\nSo in summary for the life system... you can just pick a single combat job and ignore the other 13 lives entirely, and in fact it makes your game easier to do so.\n\nThe stupid:\nGinormosia - while I haven't quite beaten the game yet, I am on the 4th major island and have literally NEVER been instructed to return, you visit the \"open world\" bit one time in the very beginning and as far as I can tell never have to go back! WHY IS IT EVEN HERE?!? There appears to be some separate story about the strangelings and the dark castle in the center, but the timing of its introduction makes it sound like it should be somewhat relevant but it never is!\nStrangelings - Want to make your game frustrating and chase players away? Add a real-time waiting mechanic! That's right, you have to collect the stupid flowers once a REAL LIFE day to turn strangelings back into people. And some strangelings are mandatory to the main story! Once again interacting with the side content makes the game overall worse, as curing extra strangelings may force you to have to stop playing the main story for 24 hours to get more flowers.\nThe story - Calling it tired would be generous, hell, calling it exhausted might be generous. There's a princess, you're a hero, do saving the world things, or something. Add in the lazy fetch quests that have all the subtlety of a dungeon master who did zero prep work and needs the party to be elsewhere for an undetermined amount of time, REPEATEDLY, and it goes from boring to grating. They literally pull the same plot of: player clears arbitrary obstacle with the help of Mr/Ms McGuffin, moronic professor dashes ahead and gets caught behind the next, different, arbitrary obstacle THREE TIMES, not in total, IN A ROW!\nThe \"locked\" lives - They keep 2 of the lives away from you to use as McGuffins to solve said arbitrary obstacles... but YOU don't actually solve the obstacles WITH those lives, every time you have a \"professional\" of the life to fix it... at that point there's no reason to lock the life away for a later chapter!\nThe guild lady - Frankly I despise this character on a personal level, literally any time she appears on screen you're going to be forced into a stupid, and don't forget pointless, bit of nonsense. Early on you're forced to collect an amount of money for her... which she doesn't even want! Later you have to clean her house for information... which she doesn't give you! Instead there's a random pamphelet on the floor. There are few NPCs in any game or media I desperately wish to use my combat life against, but oh boy does she make the cut!\nInvisible walls - Minor complaint compared to the previous points, but they don't belong in an \"open world\" game, and they pop up quite a bit in this one.\n\nSo in a nutshell... 90% of the game feels like pointless fluff, most of the lives are useless unless you REALLY want to decorate, collecting more strangelings and turning them back actually hampers you progressing the story, and the \"open world\" is in fact a railroad with very clear directions on where you are allowed to go. \nI'm still going to finish the thing as I paid for it, but I'd recommend giving it a pass to anyone looking at that price tag.",

      "review": "If you were looking for the game representation of a 5$ grocery store cake that's 80% icing, this would be it. The glowing reviews are bewildering to me when this is by far the most mediocre game I've played all year. Maybe it's me, maybe it has strong support from a nostalgic, niche fanbase. The game is a complicated mess of an identity crisis and transforms itself into a grueling, monotonous chore as a result. There are multiple elements for which I'm less of a fan and will go over in this review.\n\nStory:\n - By and large a simplistic isekai written for ages that don't reach the double digits. While I didn't outright skip it, I did spend a fair amount of time spamming the A button to jump through the uninspiring dialogue. The game likes to present itself with an infantile campiness as would an unfunny person bragging about how hilarious they are. If it weren't such an integral part of understanding my quest objectives, I would've auto-skipped the entire story. \n\nCharacters:\n- While I can see the Animal Crossing comparison here, I personally don't find that it allows you to scratch the same, laid back, pick up and play itch that Animal Crossing does with Fantasy Life's revolving door of fetch quests that almost certainly require you to play the same carpal tunnel inducing minigame over and over again. It's an amalgamation of flat, one note, unintriguing characters; while some of that could be said about Animal Crossing, this game took the simplicity of Animal Crossing's gameplay mechanics and decided that the direction it needed to go was to add more empty filler. The only reason why any of these characters are even vaguely memorable is because of the archetype they try to fill. When it comes to your party, fortunately the game grants you the option to turn off their voiced dialogue because they will incessantly repeat the same three lines of dialogue every time you mine a rock, chop down a tree, or do anything at all. From a UI perspective, party mechanics also leave something to be desired. Want a group of miners for mining and a group of lumberjacks for woodcutting? There's no way to switch seamlessly between them without going into the menu so you'll constantly be going back to the menu to switch between the party members that you want. The AI is also stupid enough that your lumberjacks/miners will ruin your bonus by chopping/mining when you're mid-animation.\n\n\nSkills:\n- Not only do you have to earn XP in specific skills, you also have to report back to guilds and turn in quests that are worth a certain number of points in order to progress. That means that you have to build a bunch of random crap you never would have cared to build in the first place and that you most likely won't even use, or that you have to continuosuly wait 5 minutes for a special tree to respawn because the RNG wouldn't allow you to get the specific item that you needed. The game forces you to choose between tediously spending hours in the same area, playing the same repetitive mini game or doing a stupid amount of back tracking thanks to the way the devs incongruently both separated and interconnected lives from each other. Your smithing skill is level 50 and you want to complete the chore list of guild quests that it asks of you? Well too bad, you need a material largely only obtainable by having level 50 tayloring, but your tayloring is only level 10 because you never actually needed to use it until the game forced you to make a piece of armor that you never wanted to begin with and will never end up using anyway just to satisfy the guild quest requirement keeping you from progressing. Otherwise, you have to go through (not exaggerating) 16 different drawn out tutorials for each and every single life, some of which you have to back track to complete. Sure, you can skip them, but then you miss out on XP and the weird button mechanics they added to the game.\n\nGeronimosia:\n- This is the specific \"open world\" portion of the game. Think of a Kindergartener's Breath of the Wild map, shrines and Sheikah towers included. That's what this is, just with most of the adventure dumbed down and replaced with, yet again, more grinding. You can scale the loot, level of monsters, etc. by upgrading the Sheikah towers after obtaining a certain number of points in each of these regions; that means hours of grinding so called \"special events\"  only worth 50-200 points a pop that notably do not scale with the upgrading of the region. The top tier of these regions is something like 30000 points and I can't possibly fathom having even a shred of enjoyment out of performing the same \"Kill these spiders\" quest 600 times per region just to obtain it.\n\nMultiplayer:\n- This game isn't even a true multiplayer game. You can only play with the other person for an hour at a time and the whole time you're not even allowed to unlock anything while you play with each other. There's no real benefit to even touching the multiplayer beyond adding to your strangeling conversion points, which aren't all that complicated to obtain in the first place. \n\nMusic:\n- I don't know that I need epic boss music when I'm just cutting down a tree or smashing a rock. Some of the soundtrack is downright fucking annoying, like the song that plays every time you go into any sort of work shop.\n\n\nThis game is just a nine year old's poorly written notepad fanfic about Zelda, Animal Crossing, and just about any Rogue/Mage/Warrior type RPG.",

The experience is brought down by time gated mechanics and endless padded grinds to increase playtime. The keyboard/mouse inputs also do not always register with the UI and feels clunky. Overall it starts out fun and then it is death by a thousand papercuts of chores that ruin the experience.\r\n\r\nI am sure there were a lot more annoyances that I came across during gameplay but below were a lot of the ones that came to mind.\r\n\r\nCombat:\r\n-Main character is constantly putting away weapon if you are trying to dodge/run around an enemy to get a better angle.\r\n-Skill buttons do not work unless you have your weapon out, so if you moved too much and your character put away their weapon, you have to draw it again, then use the special even though it is a dedicated keybind.\r\n-Enemies constantly move up and down ledges in the terrain causing you to miss attacks or have to reposition\r\n-If enemies travel too far from their spawn when dodging you, they will reset\r\n\r\nNPC Buddies\r\n-Their damage output is reduced which makes upgrading their gear feel less rewarding\r\n-Their AI will have them running all over the place in combat and sometimes pull other enemies you were not actively fighting.\r\n-They will not engage in combat unless you are actively fighting. So if an enemy aggros you while you are gathering, they will sit there and get attacked until they die, or stand there and watch you get attacked and get your gathering attempt interrupted.\r\n-They have very few voice lines and will constantly say the same phrase over and over and there is no option to mute them\r\n-The main resource to get them on your team is gated by real world time. They reset once each day.\r\n-There is no option to save team presets, so if you are running around with combat buddies and want to swap to gathering buddies, you need to swap each one manually and then swap back after.\r\n\r\nEnemies/Quest/Resources/Misc\r\n-The variety of enemy types is a bit lacking and you can tell it is a game really meant for handheld with the low density.\r\n-Quests to kill enemies usually require more enemies than are in the zones so you need to reset the area multiple times to compete.\r\n-Different tiers of the same enemy model can be in the same group so it is misleading when you need to kill one specific type of enemy and there are multiple types that look almost identical in the group.\r\n-Enemies are hardcoded with a cap of how many items can drop, so even with gear specialized to increase item drops, you are only getting one of a specific item per kill. That is made worse when you need multiples of an item and there is only one instance of an enemy to drop it so you need to keep resting the zone to farm.\r\n-Items to specialize your gear to increase drops are only available in the end game when you have almost completed every life at which point it is more frustrating to have to grind out so much already.\r\n-The endgame dungeon is extremely repetitive and has an hour time limit. You can complete it faster but up to an hour of content to have a chance to get one gather attempt at resources you need or a marginal stat increase it too time consuming and tedious. \r\n-The open world continent is split up into a bunch of regions and each one takes hours of grinding to level up so it will have harder enemies and higher tier loot.\r\n-Mouse interaction with the UI seems to be tracked as the mouse moves over a button not what it is currently hovering over. So if you mouse is over the middle option but by default the menu opens with the left option highlighted when you open it, a mouse click will click the left highlighted button and not the middle button you clicked.\r\n-Long Clicking in combat is not reliable for charging attacks. If you character put their weapon away, you end up long clicking just to draw your weapon. Lives such as Mercenary have particles all around the character so the charge complete animation is easy to miss. If you wanted to cancel a charged move to do a different ability, there is no way to reliably cancel. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Animal Crossing style Island\r\n-Resource flowers only regrow once per day. These are required to advance certain part of the main story quest so you can easily have your progress halted.\r\n-They definitely tie animal crossing with the amount of menus, sub menus and text lines when trying to navigate to relocate something in your base camp.\r\n-Relocating Buildings/Farms have to be done through npc and not freely in design mode. It just makes redesigning tedious and time consuming just so they can have another money sink.\r\n-All island design features are not unlocked until further in the story, so at that point you will need to fight with the menus to either clear your island or move everything around over and over again as you finish your designs.\r\n-Farming gives back less than 50% of the seeds planted to be yet another currency sink. Shop stock of some seeds are also time gated that you can only buy enough for one plot each real life day.",

The game is a visual treat, but the tiny world map, the characters and the cloying dialogue, all awful. This is a game that does not respect you or your intelligence. You will be prompted with the same tutorials over and over. So many cutscenes of nonstop baby talk. \n\nAlso, this IS NOT co-op. Instead, it plays like the tacked on multiplayer modes of 8-16 bit console games; second player on controller assumes a sidekick character that can walk around and pick up items, a glorified mini-game.",

The first game felt lived in and the characters had actual personalities. The story was charming and funny. But the new one... The word is just... dead. You have a few cities with actual people living there but you can't really do anything there and you don't feel like you develop a relationship with any of them people. The first quest to each life is literally always the same thing. The main levelling and gathering happens in an empty open world where everywhere kinda looks the same. You don't want to explore because there's almost nothing to find. And the story? Oh boy... either the writers were AI bots, high or sleep deprived. Nothing made sense. And I don't mean the charming kids logic type. It simply did not make sense. Characters suddenly appeared without prior introduction, the time travelling feels unnecessarily convoluted and is not explained too well. The story is exclusively driven forward by ex-machina moments. Our bird needs to speak? Sure, let him fall into a random magic vase just lying around. Problem solved. -.- The only thing fun about this was complaining while I played with my brother. (Btw. the little brother mode is a nice idea, but in some areas you can't even control Trip, which is pretty frustrating and feels like just laziness) I think they tried to cram too many different mechanics of other games into one and completely lost their original charm in the process.",

      "review": "As someone who fell in love with the original Fantasy Life on the 3DS, I was ecstatic when I learned that there was a sequel in the making. I was craving to pour in another 300+ hours into this game just like I did with the original game. As of writing this review, I am disheartened to say that I am disappointed with Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time. The gameplay loop, the dungeon design, and the world itself... all of it greatly saddens me.\n\n[Gameplay Loop]\nTo start off, I want to discuss the gameplay loop. Much like in the original, the game has you selecting various lives to pursue all the while making your way though the story. The design is still there, do thing, and progress. Nothing I would say is highly deviating from the 3DS version. The problem is the massive level of grinding you have do, and this is especially worse in the end game. I was so fed up with getting materials and fighting specified monsters. It takes ages to reach destinations of objectives, so it makes the grind not only hard, but also tedious. \n\n[Dungeon Design]\nThis is a good time to discuss the actual dungeon design and the world itself. It is GOD AWFUL! Holy Christ, the dungeons are so uninspired and bland. Worse is that they are long as hell. It takes ages to progress from one floor to the next as each floor is too big. Each room is just a box connected by a hallway that leads to the next box. There is so little creativity in the dungeon design that I was immensely bored because every room looks identical to me. Everywhere looked the same to me, even if I had a map to work with. Did you enjoy the first dungeon that you trekked? Good! Every other dungeon including the last one will be the same since you enjoyed the first one so much! It is just that creatively bankrupted! When you compare this to the original on the 3DS, it is night and day. Sure the 3DS version may not have been peak game design, but the inner environments was not modular, and instead had actual winding hallways and connected tunnels. Not a box with a path connecting from the four cardinal directions. ACTUAL HANDCRAFTED ENVIRONMENTS PEOPLE!\n\n[The Empty World]\nBad dungeon is already a major turn off, but paired with a bad world is horrific. The game has three worlds that you can explore. Those three being the past, the present, and a really bad open world called Ginormousia. I don't really have much to say on the past as it is fine for what it is, but the present is just where you would go to do the bland ass dungeon and work on your home base. Ginormousia on the other hand I wished was just integrated into the past world as it is just boring. There is hardly any interesting things to do in Ginormousia. All you do is fight basic enemies, mine and gather materials, capture towers to build the world map, and open up settlements to procure goods. All of these things are not very fun I assure you. I would had liked it better if the devs just god rid of Ginourmousia entirely, and just added more locations in the past instead as it is the only interesting world of all the three.\n\n[Music]\nOne of the biggest irks to me that this game brings is the music. Let me state that I loved the music of the original Fantasy Life, and I acknowledge that it has a ton of charms. However, the decision to reuse a ton of tracks into this sequel feels like poor direction. I would excuse it if the game had good design, but the game has terrible design. It honestly feels like the music has been grafted into a limping Frankenstein monster to blind the audience by the nostalgia in front of them and hinder their perception of the bland world they are enveloped in. It doesn’t feel like charm, it feels like hypnosis. Once I noticed it, I cannot vibe to the familiar jingle. Instead, I’m just being reminded that I am playing a worse version of a game I once loved.\n\n[The Characters]\nI would say that a lot of the cute and goofy nature of the characters do carry over into this sequel title. However, while charm is present, the cast is bland. I feel like I don’t know the people around the protagonist as well as I should. Compared to the first game, the cast was super diverse and their story had an allure to them that makes you want to actually aid their troubles. Maybe it’s the nostalgia talking, but I feel that I think this way because of how connected the world of the original game was. I can move from the kingdom to the other kingdom on foot, I didn’t need to use a dragon to teleport me there. The journey itself alongside the people I met made me more attached to them. When the king asked me to trek into the desert to quench the fears of a dark sultan, I felt more immersed in my role, and with the visions of the speaking characters. When the princess escaped to go on a journey of her own, I felt compelled to find her and learn more about her story. I just simply do not get that same feeling with the characters of this sequel.\n\nThere is more I would like to talk about, but I am not a very good writer so it is hard for me to convey everything in an efficient way. All in all, I am not very impressed by this sequel. I just hope that if there is another sequel in the minds of the developer, then I hope they decide to make it more like Fantasy Life, and not this.",

      "review": "The positives to this game are a polished appearance, including a character creator with plenty of options, cute and creative looking NPCs, and enjoyable weather systems that include a night and day cycle and rain. The unlockable map is huge. The crafting minigame is creative and pleasing to look at and play. The game entices you to play for hours because there's always something else that you need to do. There are no stretches of confusion as to what you should be doing or boredom.\n\nI would have recommended this game if it had more roleplay elements and less grindy/roguelike elements. I am many hours in and it feels like this game is just you collecting NPCs like cards so you can craft recipes a bit better. There is no emotional depth. You might not realize how grindy and shallow it is until you get a few hours in.\n\nTrying to figure out what to level or harvest or complete next is convoluted and difficult to keep track of with so many professions and tasks (main storyline quests, guild challenges, 14 types of profession quests and unlockable challenges, and side quests). You run through the same areas and dungeons over and over again to reload targets and get drops, and that's largely the game. There is discussion online on how to reset saves so that you have a higher chance of getting the very rare bosses to spawn. When a game turns into this, I feel that the game design is not good.\n\nThere is a limit on your personal island of a maximum of 6 inhabitants out of a total of 49 you can collect. This is ridiculous and annoying for PC players. There should be a default low number that can be raised by choice in your settings. My PC can handle way more villagers than 6. Having a full town of your favorite NPCs would be better, in my opinion. Still, you feel distant and unbonded from your Strangeling (minion) collection. They just say repetitive lines and you whip different ones out sometimes.\n\nNo spoilers, but the main story quest is kind of weird and dumbed down to be child-friendly. I found myself both agreeing with the villain and being confused as to why things were happening the way they were, and why things ended the way they did.\n\nThe game is not voice acted, other than some grunts and noises and small comments. Some Strangelings following you say repetitive voiced lines like \"Got a minute?\" and \"Can we talk?\" Which confuses you and makes you think that you're supposed to talk to them. It's just a random voiced line and it shouldn't have been used for just general commentary.\n\nBeing able to form deeper relationships with NPCs would be a significant improvement. NPCs frequently reference the fact that they love or want to marry someone, but you're just running around like an uninvolved, uninteresting spectator. You can build decorations but outside of two small rooms of your own, you don't really have the option to use most of the wallpapers and floors and indoor decorations. Your NPCs interact with some of the outdoor decorations. Yet it feels empty on your island. There are adorable cats and creatures scattered around the world that you can't interact with. You can't bring them with you to your island. You can't collect or have your own pets. Why overlook so many interesting possibilities?\n\nFor a game that lacks roleplay depth, the combat is not amazing to make up for it. If you cast a large spell or ability, your character freezes in one place and enemies run out of the range of your ability often. With some classes you can't even see where your spell is going to land before you cast. There is a button to randomly select and stick to a target, but sometimes it falls off and I still don't know why. Combat is clumsy, spammy, and unenjoyable.\n\nThere are definitely overlooked things in the programming. If you have a quest item equipped to either yourself or one of your minions, a quest for that item will be marked as falsely completed if you attempt and fail to turn it in. This makes tracking quests a pain in some cases, as they remain in your log but do not show up as a quest in the crafting interface anymore. \n\nYou unlock an \"Activities\" tab which is like \"daily quests,\" only they are really easy to complete tasks and replace themselves with other easy to complete tasks, and you find yourself constantly having to re-open the Activities tab to tediously turn in the daily task you completed, over and over again. It should be auto-completed or something to avoid how repetitive and annoying it is.\n\nOnce you find a certain amount of Strangelings (minions), not anywhere close to the max of 49, you will still receive dropped Strangeling chests from bosses, but they will appear to have no cutscene and nothing inside of them. This has confused multiple people online, including myself, into thinking their game is bugged. These chests should stop dropping once you've gotten all the possible Strangelings from them.\n\nMany loading and processing animations are far too long after you see them multiple times. There should be a way to fast forward through/skip these. Because this game involves a ton of back to back crafting, you just feel like banging your head the whole time, watching NPCs nod their heads while you wait for your crafting to finish. Quest turn ins also have a strange, long delay.\n\nThere is a blurry, vaseline screen effect along the screen edges cannot be disabled by settings and makes it feel like your eyes are watering when you first start the game until you get used to it. This is a very odd design choice.\n\nThis game goes out of its way to make your character completely genderless. There is no male/female option during character creation, only body types. There are no pronouns and NPCs do not refer to you with any. And yet, when you master a profession, you get treated to a long song about yourself and the profession, and some of them are actually gendered male and refer to your character as a he, which is weird.\n\nI can't recommend the game because I really don't like games that are oriented around just grinding. If there was just a bit more of an \"involved\" feel to the game, I would have liked it.",

Ultimately, the problem is that every thing feels very shallow. There are a lot of gameplay elements, but all of them feels half-baked. Starting from the mid game, but especially in the end game, everything is incredibly grindy, and not in a fun way. The story is the generic JRPG fare, the art style is also cute but generic, and the music is nothing to write home about.

      "review": "Let me start by saying I really wanted to like this game.\nUnfortunately that wasn't possible.\nThe good:\nThe outfits and character design are quite adorable.\nThe music is... fine, nothing ground-breaking, but also nothing jarring.\n\nThe bad:\nYour buddies never stop talking when on adventures with you. Every few steps someone is going to repeat the same tired line they've said 50 times already.\nMounts - They... exist? I guess? You get one for free, the rest seem to be purchases or enemy drops but other than needing to use the camel in about 3 whole spots in Ginormosia the entire mechanic is pointless\nThe life system as a whole is... pretty terrible. 14 lives you can freely change between sounds neat on paper, but the implementation is just... bad.\nThere's never a reason to change combat life, the game attempts to convince you that there are enemies that resist certain elements, but I can't say that ever happened, and even so, you can just run buddies in the other combat jobs who, ironically deal way more damage, take more punishment, and just do combat better than the MC ever can.\nThe gathering lives only exist to collect materials to fuel the crafting lives, sound on paper but unless you're dying to collect all the furniture you can literally ignore crafting.\nCrafting is very underpowered, crafted goods don't sell as well as you'd think, and enemies drop so much equipment (typically better than you can craft) that you're drowning in money unless you actually interact with the crafting system.\nEach new area lets you just buy all new equipment, and it's on par with, if not better than anything you can craft until you're nearly done with the area.\nBeing able to craft consumables is useless, you get entirely too much money, making it far faster just to buy potions.\nSo in summary for the life system... you can just pick a single combat job and ignore the other 13 lives entirely, and in fact it makes your game easier to do so.\n\nThe stupid:\nGinormosia - while I haven't quite beaten the game yet, I am on the 4th major island and have literally NEVER been instructed to return, you visit the \"open world\" bit one time in the very beginning and as far as I can tell never have to go back! WHY IS IT EVEN HERE?!? There appears to be some separate story about the strangelings and the dark castle in the center, but the timing of its introduction makes it sound like it should be somewhat relevant but it never is!\nStrangelings - Want to make your game frustrating and chase players away? Add a real-time waiting mechanic! That's right, you have to collect the stupid flowers once a REAL LIFE day to turn strangelings back into people. And some strangelings are mandatory to the main story! Once again interacting with the side content makes the game overall worse, as curing extra strangelings may force you to have to stop playing the main story for 24 hours to get more flowers.\nThe story - Calling it tired would be generous, hell, calling it exhausted might be generous. There's a princess, you're a hero, do saving the world things, or something. Add in the lazy fetch quests that have all the subtlety of a dungeon master who did zero prep work and needs the party to be elsewhere for an undetermined amount of time, REPEATEDLY, and it goes from boring to grating. They literally pull the same plot of: player clears arbitrary obstacle with the help of Mr/Ms McGuffin, moronic professor dashes ahead and gets caught behind the next, different, arbitrary obstacle THREE TIMES, not in total, IN A ROW!\nThe \"locked\" lives - They keep 2 of the lives away from you to use as McGuffins to solve said arbitrary obstacles... but YOU don't actually solve the obstacles WITH those lives, every time you have a \"professional\" of the life to fix it... at that point there's no reason to lock the life away for a later chapter!\nThe guild lady - Frankly I despise this character on a personal level, literally any time she appears on screen you're going to be forced into a stupid, and don't forget pointless, bit of nonsense. Early on you're forced to collect an amount of money for her... which she doesn't even want! Later you have to clean her house for information... which she doesn't give you! Instead there's a random pamphelet on the floor. There are few NPCs in any game or media I desperately wish to use my combat life against, but oh boy does she make the cut!\nInvisible walls - Minor complaint compared to the previous points, but they don't belong in an \"open world\" game, and they pop up quite a bit in this one.\n\nSo in a nutshell... 90% of the game feels like pointless fluff, most of the lives are useless unless you REALLY want to decorate, collecting more strangelings and turning them back actually hampers you progressing the story, and the \"open world\" is in fact a railroad with very clear directions on where you are allowed to go. \nI'm still going to finish the thing as I paid for it, but I'd recommend giving it a pass to anyone looking at that price tag.",

      "review": "If you were looking for the game representation of a 5$ grocery store cake that's 80% icing, this would be it. The glowing reviews are bewildering to me when this is by far the most mediocre game I've played all year. Maybe it's me, maybe it has strong support from a nostalgic, niche fanbase. The game is a complicated mess of an identity crisis and transforms itself into a grueling, monotonous chore as a result. There are multiple elements for which I'm less of a fan and will go over in this review.\n\nStory:\n - By and large a simplistic isekai written for ages that don't reach the double digits. While I didn't outright skip it, I did spend a fair amount of time spamming the A button to jump through the uninspiring dialogue. The game likes to present itself with an infantile campiness as would an unfunny person bragging about how hilarious they are. If it weren't such an integral part of understanding my quest objectives, I would've auto-skipped the entire story. \n\nCharacters:\n- While I can see the Animal Crossing comparison here, I personally don't find that it allows you to scratch the same, laid back, pick up and play itch that Animal Crossing does with Fantasy Life's revolving door of fetch quests that almost certainly require you to play the same carpal tunnel inducing minigame over and over again. It's an amalgamation of flat, one note, unintriguing characters; while some of that could be said about Animal Crossing, this game took the simplicity of Animal Crossing's gameplay mechanics and decided that the direction it needed to go was to add more empty filler. The only reason why any of these characters are even vaguely memorable is because of the archetype they try to fill. When it comes to your party, fortunately the game grants you the option to turn off their voiced dialogue because they will incessantly repeat the same three lines of dialogue every time you mine a rock, chop down a tree, or do anything at all. From a UI perspective, party mechanics also leave something to be desired. Want a group of miners for mining and a group of lumberjacks for woodcutting? There's no way to switch seamlessly between them without going into the menu so you'll constantly be going back to the menu to switch between the party members that you want. The AI is also stupid enough that your lumberjacks/miners will ruin your bonus by chopping/mining when you're mid-animation.\n\n\nSkills:\n- Not only do you have to earn XP in specific skills, you also have to report back to guilds and turn in quests that are worth a certain number of points in order to progress. That means that you have to build a bunch of random crap you never would have cared to build in the first place and that you most likely won't even use, or that you have to continuosuly wait 5 minutes for a special tree to respawn because the RNG wouldn't allow you to get the specific item that you needed. The game forces you to choose between tediously spending hours in the same area, playing the same repetitive mini game or doing a stupid amount of back tracking thanks to the way the devs incongruently both separated and interconnected lives from each other. Your smithing skill is level 50 and you want to complete the chore list of guild quests that it asks of you? Well too bad, you need a material largely only obtainable by having level 50 tayloring, but your tayloring is only level 10 because you never actually needed to use it until the game forced you to make a piece of armor that you never wanted to begin with and will never end up using anyway just to satisfy the guild quest requirement keeping you from progressing. Otherwise, you have to go through (not exaggerating) 16 different drawn out tutorials for each and every single life, some of which you have to back track to complete. Sure, you can skip them, but then you miss out on XP and the weird button mechanics they added to the game.\n\nGeronimosia:\n- This is the specific \"open world\" portion of the game. Think of a Kindergartener's Breath of the Wild map, shrines and Sheikah towers included. That's what this is, just with most of the adventure dumbed down and replaced with, yet again, more grinding. You can scale the loot, level of monsters, etc. by upgrading the Sheikah towers after obtaining a certain number of points in each of these regions; that means hours of grinding so called \"special events\"  only worth 50-200 points a pop that notably do not scale with the upgrading of the region. The top tier of these regions is something like 30000 points and I can't possibly fathom having even a shred of enjoyment out of performing the same \"Kill these spiders\" quest 600 times per region just to obtain it.\n\nMultiplayer:\n- This game isn't even a true multiplayer game. You can only play with the other person for an hour at a time and the whole time you're not even allowed to unlock anything while you play with each other. There's no real benefit to even touching the multiplayer beyond adding to your strangeling conversion points, which aren't all that complicated to obtain in the first place. \n\nMusic:\n- I don't know that I need epic boss music when I'm just cutting down a tree or smashing a rock. Some of the soundtrack is downright fucking annoying, like the song that plays every time you go into any sort of work shop.\n\n\nThis game is just a nine year old's poorly written notepad fanfic about Zelda, Animal Crossing, and just about any Rogue/Mage/Warrior type RPG.",

The experience is brought down by time gated mechanics and endless padded grinds to increase playtime. The keyboard/mouse inputs also do not always register with the UI and feels clunky. Overall it starts out fun and then it is death by a thousand papercuts of chores that ruin the experience.\r\n\r\nI am sure there were a lot more annoyances that I came across during gameplay but below were a lot of the ones that came to mind.\r\n\r\nCombat:\r\n-Main character is constantly putting away weapon if you are trying to dodge/run around an enemy to get a better angle.\r\n-Skill buttons do not work unless you have your weapon out, so if you moved too much and your character put away their weapon, you have to draw it again, then use the special even though it is a dedicated keybind.\r\n-Enemies constantly move up and down ledges in the terrain causing you to miss attacks or have to reposition\r\n-If enemies travel too far from their spawn when dodging you, they will reset\r\n\r\nNPC Buddies\r\n-Their damage output is reduced which makes upgrading their gear feel less rewarding\r\n-Their AI will have them running all over the place in combat and sometimes pull other enemies you were not actively fighting.\r\n-They will not engage in combat unless you are actively fighting. So if an enemy aggros you while you are gathering, they will sit there and get attacked until they die, or stand there and watch you get attacked and get your gathering attempt interrupted.\r\n-They have very few voice lines and will constantly say the same phrase over and over and there is no option to mute them\r\n-The main resource to get them on your team is gated by real world time. They reset once each day.\r\n-There is no option to save team presets, so if you are running around with combat buddies and want to swap to gathering buddies, you need to swap each one manually and then swap back after.\r\n\r\nEnemies/Quest/Resources/Misc\r\n-The variety of enemy types is a bit lacking and you can tell it is a game really meant for handheld with the low density.\r\n-Quests to kill enemies usually require more enemies than are in the zones so you need to reset the area multiple times to compete.\r\n-Different tiers of the same enemy model can be in the same group so it is misleading when you need to kill one specific type of enemy and there are multiple types that look almost identical in the group.\r\n-Enemies are hardcoded with a cap of how many items can drop, so even with gear specialized to increase item drops, you are only getting one of a specific item per kill. That is made worse when you need multiples of an item and there is only one instance of an enemy to drop it so you need to keep resting the zone to farm.\r\n-Items to specialize your gear to increase drops are only available in the end game when you have almost completed every life at which point it is more frustrating to have to grind out so much already.\r\n-The endgame dungeon is extremely repetitive and has an hour time limit. You can complete it faster but up to an hour of content to have a chance to get one gather attempt at resources you need or a marginal stat increase it too time consuming and tedious. \r\n-The open world continent is split up into a bunch of regions and each one takes hours of grinding to level up so it will have harder enemies and higher tier loot.\r\n-Mouse interaction with the UI seems to be tracked as the mouse moves over a button not what it is currently hovering over. So if you mouse is over the middle option but by default the menu opens with the left option highlighted when you open it, a mouse click will click the left highlighted button and not the middle button you clicked.\r\n-Long Clicking in combat is not reliable for charging attacks. If you character put their weapon away, you end up long clicking just to draw your weapon. Lives such as Mercenary have particles all around the character so the charge complete animation is easy to miss. If you wanted to cancel a charged move to do a different ability, there is no way to reliably cancel. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Animal Crossing style Island\r\n-Resource flowers only regrow once per day. These are required to advance certain part of the main story quest so you can easily have your progress halted.\r\n-They definitely tie animal crossing with the amount of menus, sub menus and text lines when trying to navigate to relocate something in your base camp.\r\n-Relocating Buildings/Farms have to be done through npc and not freely in design mode. It just makes redesigning tedious and time consuming just so they can have another money sink.\r\n-All island design features are not unlocked until further in the story, so at that point you will need to fight with the menus to either clear your island or move everything around over and over again as you finish your designs.\r\n-Farming gives back less than 50% of the seeds planted to be yet another currency sink. Shop stock of some seeds are also time gated that you can only buy enough for one plot each real life day.",

The first game felt lived in and the characters had actual personalities. The story was charming and funny. But the new one... The word is just... dead. You have a few cities with actual people living there but you can't really do anything there and you don't feel like you develop a relationship with any of them people. The first quest to each life is literally always the same thing. The main levelling and gathering happens in an empty open world where everywhere kinda looks the same. You don't want to explore because there's almost nothing to find. And the story? Oh boy... either the writers were AI bots, high or sleep deprived. Nothing made sense. And I don't mean the charming kids logic type. It simply did not make sense. Characters suddenly appeared without prior introduction, the time travelling feels unnecessarily convoluted and is not explained too well. The story is exclusively driven forward by ex-machina moments. Our bird needs to speak? Sure, let him fall into a random magic vase just lying around. Problem solved. -.- The only thing fun about this was complaining while I played with my brother. (Btw. the little brother mode is a nice idea, but in some areas you can't even control Trip, which is pretty frustrating and feels like just laziness) I think they tried to cram too many different mechanics of other games into one and completely lost their original charm in the process.",

      "review": "As someone who fell in love with the original Fantasy Life on the 3DS, I was ecstatic when I learned that there was a sequel in the making. I was craving to pour in another 300+ hours into this game just like I did with the original game. As of writing this review, I am disheartened to say that I am disappointed with Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time. The gameplay loop, the dungeon design, and the world itself... all of it greatly saddens me.\n\n[Gameplay Loop]\nTo start off, I want to discuss the gameplay loop. Much like in the original, the game has you selecting various lives to pursue all the while making your way though the story. The design is still there, do thing, and progress. Nothing I would say is highly deviating from the 3DS version. The problem is the massive level of grinding you have do, and this is especially worse in the end game. I was so fed up with getting materials and fighting specified monsters. It takes ages to reach destinations of objectives, so it makes the grind not only hard, but also tedious. \n\n[Dungeon Design]\nThis is a good time to discuss the actual dungeon design and the world itself. It is GOD AWFUL! Holy Christ, the dungeons are so uninspired and bland. Worse is that they are long as hell. It takes ages to progress from one floor to the next as each floor is too big. Each room is just a box connected by a hallway that leads to the next box. There is so little creativity in the dungeon design that I was immensely bored because every room looks identical to me. Everywhere looked the same to me, even if I had a map to work with. Did you enjoy the first dungeon that you trekked? Good! Every other dungeon including the last one will be the same since you enjoyed the first one so much! It is just that creatively bankrupted! When you compare this to the original on the 3DS, it is night and day. Sure the 3DS version may not have been peak game design, but the inner environments was not modular, and instead had actual winding hallways and connected tunnels. Not a box with a path connecting from the four cardinal directions. ACTUAL HANDCRAFTED ENVIRONMENTS PEOPLE!\n\n[The Empty World]\nBad dungeon is already a major turn off, but paired with a bad world is horrific. The game has three worlds that you can explore. Those three being the past, the present, and a really bad open world called Ginormousia. I don't really have much to say on the past as it is fine for what it is, but the present is just where you would go to do the bland ass dungeon and work on your home base. Ginormousia on the other hand I wished was just integrated into the past world as it is just boring. There is hardly any interesting things to do in Ginormousia. All you do is fight basic enemies, mine and gather materials, capture towers to build the world map, and open up settlements to procure goods. All of these things are not very fun I assure you. I would had liked it better if the devs just god rid of Ginourmousia entirely, and just added more locations in the past instead as it is the only interesting world of all the three.\n\n[Music]\nOne of the biggest irks to me that this game brings is the music. Let me state that I loved the music of the original Fantasy Life, and I acknowledge that it has a ton of charms. However, the decision to reuse a ton of tracks into this sequel feels like poor direction. I would excuse it if the game had good design, but the game has terrible design. It honestly feels like the music has been grafted into a limping Frankenstein monster to blind the audience by the nostalgia in front of them and hinder their perception of the bland world they are enveloped in. It doesn’t feel like charm, it feels like hypnosis. Once I noticed it, I cannot vibe to the familiar jingle. Instead, I’m just being reminded that I am playing a worse version of a game I once loved.\n\n[The Characters]\nI would say that a lot of the cute and goofy nature of the characters do carry over into this sequel title. However, while charm is present, the cast is bland. I feel like I don’t know the people around the protagonist as well as I should. Compared to the first game, the cast was super diverse and their story had an allure to them that makes you want to actually aid their troubles. Maybe it’s the nostalgia talking, but I feel that I think this way because of how connected the world of the original game was. I can move from the kingdom to the other kingdom on foot, I didn’t need to use a dragon to teleport me there. The journey itself alongside the people I met made me more attached to them. When the king asked me to trek into the desert to quench the fears of a dark sultan, I felt more immersed in my role, and with the visions of the speaking characters. When the princess escaped to go on a journey of her own, I felt compelled to find her and learn more about her story. I just simply do not get that same feeling with the characters of this sequel.\n\nThere is more I would like to talk about, but I am not a very good writer so it is hard for me to convey everything in an efficient way. All in all, I am not very impressed by this sequel. I just hope that if there is another sequel in the minds of the developer, then I hope they decide to make it more like Fantasy Life, and not this.",

      "review": "The positives to this game are a polished appearance, including a character creator with plenty of options, cute and creative looking NPCs, and enjoyable weather systems that include a night and day cycle and rain. The unlockable map is huge. The crafting minigame is creative and pleasing to look at and play. The game entices you to play for hours because there's always something else that you need to do. There are no stretches of confusion as to what you should be doing or boredom.\n\nI would have recommended this game if it had more roleplay elements and less grindy/roguelike elements. I am many hours in and it feels like this game is just you collecting NPCs like cards so you can craft recipes a bit better. There is no emotional depth. You might not realize how grindy and shallow it is until you get a few hours in.\n\nTrying to figure out what to level or harvest or complete next is convoluted and difficult to keep track of with so many professions and tasks (main storyline quests, guild challenges, 14 types of profession quests and unlockable challenges, and side quests). You run through the same areas and dungeons over and over again to reload targets and get drops, and that's largely the game. There is discussion online on how to reset saves so that you have a higher chance of getting the very rare bosses to spawn. When a game turns into this, I feel that the game design is not good.\n\nThere is a limit on your personal island of a maximum of 6 inhabitants out of a total of 49 you can collect. This is ridiculous and annoying for PC players. There should be a default low number that can be raised by choice in your settings. My PC can handle way more villagers than 6. Having a full town of your favorite NPCs would be better, in my opinion. Still, you feel distant and unbonded from your Strangeling (minion) collection. They just say repetitive lines and you whip different ones out sometimes.\n\nNo spoilers, but the main story quest is kind of weird and dumbed down to be child-friendly. I found myself both agreeing with the villain and being confused as to why things were happening the way they were, and why things ended the way they did.\n\nThe game is not voice acted, other than some grunts and noises and small comments. Some Strangelings following you say repetitive voiced lines like \"Got a minute?\" and \"Can we talk?\" Which confuses you and makes you think that you're supposed to talk to them. It's just a random voiced line and it shouldn't have been used for just general commentary.\n\nBeing able to form deeper relationships with NPCs would be a significant improvement. NPCs frequently reference the fact that they love or want to marry someone, but you're just running around like an uninvolved, uninteresting spectator. You can build decorations but outside of two small rooms of your own, you don't really have the option to use most of the wallpapers and floors and indoor decorations. Your NPCs interact with some of the outdoor decorations. Yet it feels empty on your island. There are adorable cats and creatures scattered around the world that you can't interact with. You can't bring them with you to your island. You can't collect or have your own pets. Why overlook so many interesting possibilities?\n\nFor a game that lacks roleplay depth, the combat is not amazing to make up for it. If you cast a large spell or ability, your character freezes in one place and enemies run out of the range of your ability often. With some classes you can't even see where your spell is going to land before you cast. There is a button to randomly select and stick to a target, but sometimes it falls off and I still don't know why. Combat is clumsy, spammy, and unenjoyable.\n\nThere are definitely overlooked things in the programming. If you have a quest item equipped to either yourself or one of your minions, a quest for that item will be marked as falsely completed if you attempt and fail to turn it in. This makes tracking quests a pain in some cases, as they remain in your log but do not show up as a quest in the crafting interface anymore. \n\nYou unlock an \"Activities\" tab which is like \"daily quests,\" only they are really easy to complete tasks and replace themselves with other easy to complete tasks, and you find yourself constantly having to re-open the Activities tab to tediously turn in the daily task you completed, over and over again. It should be auto-completed or something to avoid how repetitive and annoying it is.\n\nOnce you find a certain amount of Strangelings (minions), not anywhere close to the max of 49, you will still receive dropped Strangeling chests from bosses, but they will appear to have no cutscene and nothing inside of them. This has confused multiple people online, including myself, into thinking their game is bugged. These chests should stop dropping once you've gotten all the possible Strangelings from them.\n\nMany loading and processing animations are far too long after you see them multiple times. There should be a way to fast forward through/skip these. Because this game involves a ton of back to back crafting, you just feel like banging your head the whole time, watching NPCs nod their heads while you wait for your crafting to finish. Quest turn ins also have a strange, long delay.\n\nThere is a blurry, vaseline screen effect along the screen edges cannot be disabled by settings and makes it feel like your eyes are watering when you first start the game until you get used to it. This is a very odd design choice.\n\nThis game goes out of its way to make your character completely genderless. There is no male/female option during character creation, only body types. There are no pronouns and NPCs do not refer to you with any. And yet, when you master a profession, you get treated to a long song about yourself and the profession, and some of them are actually gendered male and refer to your character as a he, which is weird.\n\nI can't recommend the game because I really don't like games that are oriented around just grinding. If there was just a bit more of an \"involved\" feel to the game, I would have liked it.",

Starting from the mid game, but especially in the end game, everything is incredibly grindy, and not in a fun way.

      "review": "Let me start by saying I really wanted to like this game.\nUnfortunately that wasn't possible.\nThe good:\nThe outfits and character design are quite adorable.\nThe music is... fine, nothing ground-breaking, but also nothing jarring.\n\nThe bad:\nYour buddies never stop talking when on adventures with you. Every few steps someone is going to repeat the same tired line they've said 50 times already.\nMounts - They... exist? I guess? You get one for free, the rest seem to be purchases or enemy drops but other than needing to use the camel in about 3 whole spots in Ginormosia the entire mechanic is pointless\nThe life system as a whole is... pretty terrible. 14 lives you can freely change between sounds neat on paper, but the implementation is just... bad.\nThere's never a reason to change combat life, the game attempts to convince you that there are enemies that resist certain elements, but I can't say that ever happened, and even so, you can just run buddies in the other combat jobs who, ironically deal way more damage, take more punishment, and just do combat better than the MC ever can.\nThe gathering lives only exist to collect materials to fuel the crafting lives, sound on paper but unless you're dying to collect all the furniture you can literally ignore crafting.\nCrafting is very underpowered, crafted goods don't sell as well as you'd think, and enemies drop so much equipment (typically better than you can craft) that you're drowning in money unless you actually interact with the crafting system.\nEach new area lets you just buy all new equipment, and it's on par with, if not better than anything you can craft until you're nearly done with the area.\nBeing able to craft consumables is useless, you get entirely too much money, making it far faster just to buy potions.\nSo in summary for the life system... you can just pick a single combat job and ignore the other 13 lives entirely, and in fact it makes your game easier to do so.\n\nThe stupid:\nGinormosia - while I haven't quite beaten the game yet, I am on the 4th major island and have literally NEVER been instructed to return, you visit the \"open world\" bit one time in the very beginning and as far as I can tell never have to go back! WHY IS IT EVEN HERE?!? There appears to be some separate story about the strangelings and the dark castle in the center, but the timing of its introduction makes it sound like it should be somewhat relevant but it never is!\nStrangelings - Want to make your game frustrating and chase players away? Add a real-time waiting mechanic! That's right, you have to collect the stupid flowers once a REAL LIFE day to turn strangelings back into people. And some strangelings are mandatory to the main story! Once again interacting with the side content makes the game overall worse, as curing extra strangelings may force you to have to stop playing the main story for 24 hours to get more flowers.\nThe story - Calling it tired would be generous, hell, calling it exhausted might be generous. There's a princess, you're a hero, do saving the world things, or something. Add in the lazy fetch quests that have all the subtlety of a dungeon master who did zero prep work and needs the party to be elsewhere for an undetermined amount of time, REPEATEDLY, and it goes from boring to grating. They literally pull the same plot of: player clears arbitrary obstacle with the help of Mr/Ms McGuffin, moronic professor dashes ahead and gets caught behind the next, different, arbitrary obstacle THREE TIMES, not in total, IN A ROW!\nThe \"locked\" lives - They keep 2 of the lives away from you to use as McGuffins to solve said arbitrary obstacles... but YOU don't actually solve the obstacles WITH those lives, every time you have a \"professional\" of the life to fix it... at that point there's no reason to lock the life away for a later chapter!\nThe guild lady - Frankly I despise this character on a personal level, literally any time she appears on screen you're going to be forced into a stupid, and don't forget pointless, bit of nonsense. Early on you're forced to collect an amount of money for her... which she doesn't even want! Later you have to clean her house for information... which she doesn't give you! Instead there's a random pamphelet on the floor. There are few NPCs in any game or media I desperately wish to use my combat life against, but oh boy does she make the cut!\nInvisible walls - Minor complaint compared to the previous points, but they don't belong in an \"open world\" game, and they pop up quite a bit in this one.\n\nSo in a nutshell... 90% of the game feels like pointless fluff, most of the lives are useless unless you REALLY want to decorate, collecting more strangelings and turning them back actually hampers you progressing the story, and the \"open world\" is in fact a railroad with very clear directions on where you are allowed to go. \nI'm still going to finish the thing as I paid for it, but I'd recommend giving it a pass to anyone looking at that price tag.",

      "review": "If you were looking for the game representation of a 5$ grocery store cake that's 80% icing, this would be it. The glowing reviews are bewildering to me when this is by far the most mediocre game I've played all year. Maybe it's me, maybe it has strong support from a nostalgic, niche fanbase. The game is a complicated mess of an identity crisis and transforms itself into a grueling, monotonous chore as a result. There are multiple elements for which I'm less of a fan and will go over in this review.\n\nStory:\n - By and large a simplistic isekai written for ages that don't reach the double digits. While I didn't outright skip it, I did spend a fair amount of time spamming the A button to jump through the uninspiring dialogue. The game likes to present itself with an infantile campiness as would an unfunny person bragging about how hilarious they are. If it weren't such an integral part of understanding my quest objectives, I would've auto-skipped the entire story. \n\nCharacters:\n- While I can see the Animal Crossing comparison here, I personally don't find that it allows you to scratch the same, laid back, pick up and play itch that Animal Crossing does with Fantasy Life's revolving door of fetch quests that almost certainly require you to play the same carpal tunnel inducing minigame over and over again. It's an amalgamation of flat, one note, unintriguing characters; while some of that could be said about Animal Crossing, this game took the simplicity of Animal Crossing's gameplay mechanics and decided that the direction it needed to go was to add more empty filler. The only reason why any of these characters are even vaguely memorable is because of the archetype they try to fill. When it comes to your party, fortunately the game grants you the option to turn off their voiced dialogue because they will incessantly repeat the same three lines of dialogue every time you mine a rock, chop down a tree, or do anything at all. From a UI perspective, party mechanics also leave something to be desired. Want a group of miners for mining and a group of lumberjacks for woodcutting? There's no way to switch seamlessly between them without going into the menu so you'll constantly be going back to the menu to switch between the party members that you want. The AI is also stupid enough that your lumberjacks/miners will ruin your bonus by chopping/mining when you're mid-animation.\n\n\nSkills:\n- Not only do you have to earn XP in specific skills, you also have to report back to guilds and turn in quests that are worth a certain number of points in order to progress. That means that you have to build a bunch of random crap you never would have cared to build in the first place and that you most likely won't even use, or that you have to continuosuly wait 5 minutes for a special tree to respawn because the RNG wouldn't allow you to get the specific item that you needed. The game forces you to choose between tediously spending hours in the same area, playing the same repetitive mini game or doing a stupid amount of back tracking thanks to the way the devs incongruently both separated and interconnected lives from each other. Your smithing skill is level 50 and you want to complete the chore list of guild quests that it asks of you? Well too bad, you need a material largely only obtainable by having level 50 tayloring, but your tayloring is only level 10 because you never actually needed to use it until the game forced you to make a piece of armor that you never wanted to begin with and will never end up using anyway just to satisfy the guild quest requirement keeping you from progressing. Otherwise, you have to go through (not exaggerating) 16 different drawn out tutorials for each and every single life, some of which you have to back track to complete. Sure, you can skip them, but then you miss out on XP and the weird button mechanics they added to the game.\n\nGeronimosia:\n- This is the specific \"open world\" portion of the game. Think of a Kindergartener's Breath of the Wild map, shrines and Sheikah towers included. That's what this is, just with most of the adventure dumbed down and replaced with, yet again, more grinding. You can scale the loot, level of monsters, etc. by upgrading the Sheikah towers after obtaining a certain number of points in each of these regions; that means hours of grinding so called \"special events\"  only worth 50-200 points a pop that notably do not scale with the upgrading of the region. The top tier of these regions is something like 30000 points and I can't possibly fathom having even a shred of enjoyment out of performing the same \"Kill these spiders\" quest 600 times per region just to obtain it.\n\nMultiplayer:\n- This game isn't even a true multiplayer game. You can only play with the other person for an hour at a time and the whole time you're not even allowed to unlock anything while you play with each other. There's no real benefit to even touching the multiplayer beyond adding to your strangeling conversion points, which aren't all that complicated to obtain in the first place. \n\nMusic:\n- I don't know that I need epic boss music when I'm just cutting down a tree or smashing a rock. Some of the soundtrack is downright fucking annoying, like the song that plays every time you go into any sort of work shop.\n\n\nThis game is just a nine year old's poorly written notepad fanfic about Zelda, Animal Crossing, and just about any Rogue/Mage/Warrior type RPG.",

The minigame is the same for all the crafting classes.  The minigame is the same for mining and woodcutting.  The minigame for fishing is almost the same as that of mining and woodcutting.  And these minigames are all very simple and mind-numbing.  If you like mindless grinding, then go for it, but it's not really for me.",

      "review": "Fantasy Life with the addition of an Open World zone and Animal Crossing island.\r\n\r\nThe story is ok. The experience is brought down by time gated mechanics and endless padded grinds to increase playtime. The keyboard/mouse inputs also do not always register with the UI and feels clunky. Overall it starts out fun and then it is death by a thousand papercuts of chores that ruin the experience.\r\n\r\nI am sure there were a lot more annoyances that I came across during gameplay but below were a lot of the ones that came to mind.\r\n\r\nCombat:\r\n-Main character is constantly putting away weapon if you are trying to dodge/run around an enemy to get a better angle.\r\n-Skill buttons do not work unless you have your weapon out, so if you moved too much and your character put away their weapon, you have to draw it again, then use the special even though it is a dedicated keybind.\r\n-Enemies constantly move up and down ledges in the terrain causing you to miss attacks or have to reposition\r\n-If enemies travel too far from their spawn when dodging you, they will reset\r\n\r\nNPC Buddies\r\n-Their damage output is reduced which makes upgrading their gear feel less rewarding\r\n-Their AI will have them running all over the place in combat and sometimes pull other enemies you were not actively fighting.\r\n-They will not engage in combat unless you are actively fighting. So if an enemy aggros you while you are gathering, they will sit there and get attacked until they die, or stand there and watch you get attacked and get your gathering attempt interrupted.\r\n-They have very few voice lines and will constantly say the same phrase over and over and there is no option to mute them\r\n-The main resource to get them on your team is gated by real world time. They reset once each day.\r\n-There is no option to save team presets, so if you are running around with combat buddies and want to swap to gathering buddies, you need to swap each one manually and then swap back after.\r\n\r\nEnemies/Quest/Resources/Misc\r\n-The variety of enemy types is a bit lacking and you can tell it is a game really meant for handheld with the low density.\r\n-Quests to kill enemies usually require more enemies than are in the zones so you need to reset the area multiple times to compete.\r\n-Different tiers of the same enemy model can be in the same group so it is misleading when you need to kill one specific type of enemy and there are multiple types that look almost identical in the group.\r\n-Enemies are hardcoded with a cap of how many items can drop, so even with gear specialized to increase item drops, you are only getting one of a specific item per kill. That is made worse when you need multiples of an item and there is only one instance of an enemy to drop it so you need to keep resting the zone to farm.\r\n-Items to specialize your gear to increase drops are only available in the end game when you have almost completed every life at which point it is more frustrating to have to grind out so much already.\r\n-The endgame dungeon is extremely repetitive and has an hour time limit. You can complete it faster but up to an hour of content to have a chance to get one gather attempt at resources you need or a marginal stat increase it too time consuming and tedious. \r\n-The open world continent is split up into a bunch of regions and each one takes hours of grinding to level up so it will have harder enemies and higher tier loot.\r\n-Mouse interaction with the UI seems to be tracked as the mouse moves over a button not what it is currently hovering over. So if you mouse is over the middle option but by default the menu opens with the left option highlighted when you open it, a mouse click will click the left highlighted button and not the middle button you clicked.\r\n-Long Clicking in combat is not reliable for charging attacks. If you character put their weapon away, you end up long clicking just to draw your weapon. Lives such as Mercenary have particles all around the character so the charge complete animation is easy to miss. If you wanted to cancel a charged move to do a different ability, there is no way to reliably cancel. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Animal Crossing style Island\r\n-Resource flowers only regrow once per day. These are required to advance certain part of the main story quest so you can easily have your progress halted.\r\n-They definitely tie animal crossing with the amount of menus, sub menus and text lines when trying to navigate to relocate something in your base camp.\r\n-Relocating Buildings/Farms have to be done through npc and not freely in design mode. It just makes redesigning tedious and time consuming just so they can have another money sink.\r\n-All island design features are not unlocked until further in the story, so at that point you will need to fight with the menus to either clear your island or move everything around over and over again as you finish your designs.\r\n-Farming gives back less than 50% of the seeds planted to be yet another currency sink. Shop stock of some seeds are also time gated that you can only buy enough for one plot each real life day.",

The characters are flat, the ones that have some kind of development disappear in thin air and are not given a conclusion. They wanted to make a bittersweet ending but it's nonsensical and lackluster.\nThe maps feel like they were designed with fixed camera in mind, maybe they should have sticked with that because camera controls and maps are not good.\n\nDoesn't have the same charm as Fantasy Life...",

The game is a visual treat, but the tiny world map, the characters and the cloying dialogue, all awful. This is a game that does not respect you or your intelligence. You will be prompted with the same tutorials over and over. So many cutscenes of nonstop baby talk. \n\nAlso, this IS NOT co-op. Instead, it plays like the tacked on multiplayer modes of 8-16 bit console games; second player on controller assumes a sidekick character that can walk around and pick up items, a glorified mini-game.",
