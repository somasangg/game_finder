      "review": "Not sure if anyone is actually reading the reviews on the demo, but I thought I'd share my thoughts in the event anyone is. That being said let's cut to the chase. This is my first Digimon game. That's right, I have very little knowledge of Digimon in general, and this review will reflect that.\nFirst Impressions:\nFirst impressions were rough, the demo has some bugs regarding changing the graphics settings and resolution. It took me close to an hour to research a work-around for the issues I was having, but I did find solutions. Speaking of graphics; this game isn't winning any graphical fidelity awards. The texture quality is rough, and the AA implementation is also rough. That being said I think that some of the rough edges can be looked over due to the art style the game is going for. The anime-esque flavor does help make the lack of graphical fidelity feel less aggregious. The models of the Digimon are absolutely the best part here. The animations look good, and the moves have impact and weight to them. The UI is clean and futuristic in design, and doesn't clutter the screen. Movement of the player character is a bit janky in that sort-of pocket monster game type of way, it's serviceable but not great. All in all, technically the game is in an acceptable state. Looking back at other Digimon titles, this game seems to follow the trend with how it looks and feels, which I am sure will bother series veterans very little, especially since the real magic of this game has so little to do with any of what I mentioned previously.\n\nThe Magic:\nAs I mentioned in the close of the last section of the review, there is real magic at work in Digimon Story Time Stranger, and that magic is the depth of the creature collecting loop. I started my journey with a Digimon I immediately recognized from years ago when I got curious about Digimon and dabbled in the anime series: Patamon. Little did I know, I had picked what Digi-Nerds often refer to as the strongest starter in the demo. This little yellow blob with wings has the potential to Digivolve, more on that later, into a serious powerhouse if trained and raised correctly. I started out with the Pokemon mindset fully engaged, running around battling any Digimon unfortunate enough to get in my way, or unfortunate enough to be seen, yes that's right, the Digimon in this game appear in the over-world. These over-world Digimon are modeled very well, the models actually look great, the animations are stiff, but the models are excellent and very well detailed for being over-world props essentially. The fun about these encounters is that there isn't always just one Digimon, there are sometimes up to three that appear from a single over-world model. My enjoyment quickly morphed into excitement when I started thinking about all the Digimon I would be collecting. As stated previously I am not a Digi-Master, I am a Digi-Noob and I wouldn't know a bad Digimon from a good one looking at them side by side, BUT I wanted them all. My Pokemon brain had determined I must have them all, I need to CONVERT 'EM ALL. That's right my fellow Digi-Noobs, you do not go out and damage wild Digimon and start launching spherical prisons at them, no, you crush them into raw data and learn how to essentially code them into existence. Kinda cool right? Well it goes further, you can crush even more of these helpless little Digi-Victims to gain even more data to generate a superior specimen. To explain; you defeat a Digimon, and you gain a predetermined amount of progress towards being able to generate a Digimon that is then yours to use or alternatively feed to your other Digimon to make them stronger like some sort of Digi-Cannibalistic witch doctor. Once you've hit 100% progress on collecting data on a Digimon you can generate one for use, however, if your momma didn't raise no b****, then you'll want to farm data for that Digimon up to 200%, because if you do, the Digimon will come out supercharged with better stats. 200% is the cap, but you can get bonuses for any percentage past 100%. My days of Pokemon trained my brain to catch them all, but my inner stat-aholic mandated the need to only generate Digimon at 200% for the best results. As I get near the 3/4 point of the demo, I am ravenous for more Digimon, and I am enjoying the battle system immensely. The battle system has an 'auto' feature that allows your Digimon to battle on their own when you start a battle encounter, assuming you trust the AI or are simply farming Digimon. The speed of the battle can actually be increased too, up to 5X in fact. As a Pokemon veteran, I had no idea how much I needed this kind of feature. The grind was made so easy and quick due to this one feature alone. However, beware, it's a toggle that stays on and from what I can tell only can be toggled in battle, meaning you can accidentally start a boss fight at 5X speed and auto battle, which can and might lead to your complete and udder annilhilation, so keep an eye on this before starting any major battles, or approaching an area where one might kick off. Another nice thing about the battle system comes in the form of a DigiAttack. This allows you to command the Digimon in your team/party to attack the over-world Digimon dealing damage before the fight kicks off, which can actually lead to that over-world Digimon being defeated at the start of the battle. If that over-world Digimon is the only one in that little 'event' for lack of a better term, you skip the battle entirely while still gaining money and EXP from it. Mentioning that, you can have 3 active Digimon in your party, and 3 in reserve who will automagically replace any of your Digimon that get defeated. The battle system is very akin to many JRPGs, turn based, and full of QoL changes from previous titles, like item use not taking a turn, and more. So now that the basics have been established, it's time to get into the real fun: CONVERTING 'EM ALL. Getting mostly all of the Digimon in the demo took me about 6 hours. It's a complex process, that admittedly I had a guide for. The crazy part was how addicting the loop is, because unlike Pokemon, Digimon have multiple evolution paths know as Digivolutions. One Digimon, know as Koromon had a total of 6 different possibilities for it to Digivolve into. Koromon isn't alone, most 'baby' Digimon will have similar numbers of forms they can Digivolve into.  There are levels of Digimon; Baby, Rookie, Champion, Mega, and a few others I am still learning. With each new tier of Digimon, the requirements to Digivolve them into the next form increase, and get more specific. This means that if you want a certain Digivolution you'll have to do things like changing the personality, increasing certain stats, and more before you can Digivolve a Digimon into the desired Digivolution. Yes, I did say personality. There are 16 personality types in Digimon Story Time Stranger that Digimon can have. When you start getting into the later Digivolutions you'll have to have a certain personality type to reach certain desired Digivolutions. They are broke down into 4 categories with 4 sub-categories. I do recommend looking that up online for a better explanation, as I am still learning it myself and would rather not give any sort of bad information. From what I have gathered, after a certain number of battles, you can talk to one of the three over-world models representing the Digimon in your party. During these conversations, they'll ask philosophical questions with a range of responses you can provide, which will start to shape the personality of that particular Digimon. The responses you give will have little icons next to them, which I recommend looking up and memorizing, that indicate which personality type that response will push your Digimon to.\n\nI had more to share, but hit the character limit -_-",

I have played every world and cyber sleuth and hackers memory as well and digimon survive. Survive was more of just a straight up nonstop story i was reading more like watching an anime. Cyber Sleuth was good but i LOVED hackers memory story and main character much more. I played next order also world game not bad either good game waaaay more grindy. Now usually im a HUGE world fan and all that grind but after hackers memory and cybersleuth they really grew on me... Now this demo. Amazing. The graphics the fighting style its literally beautiful.You go back and fourth between the human world and the digital digimon world and it looks sooooo good. Only a 90 min demo and by the end i was DYING for more and more.. this could be the one this could be the digimon game we have all been waiting for never seen so much promise with a digimon game like this before.The collectors editions they are selling now for the game all the content and for the first time DLC and seasons for the game I cant wait! \n\nOCTOBER WILL BE DIGIMON MONTH!!! We get this amazing BEAUTIFUL GAME but also the new anime as well Digimon Databreak! Cant wait!

Though the only negative thing I can think of right now might be the price, because it is very steep for the full game. It's probably going to be worth it for sure, but it's expensive nonetheless even for modern game-pricing standards. Currently the price for the game is 70€ for the base game, a 100€ for the deluxe edition, and a 120€ for the ultimate edition, plus from what I understand it seems to be even more expensive in some regions with different currencies. Still, grab it on a sale if it ends up being too expensive for you, the game's really great!\n\nIn case you're just seeing this game for the first time, there's also a predecessor game.

This game looks really really promising, the amount of changes they made to the game play has already gone from skeptical to pure excitement. \n\nThings that changed from previous games that I noticed from playing and videos:\nFleshed out areas of both the human world and digital world with far more details and gameplay such as being able to climb ladders and crouch for certain parts\nNo more random encounters\nThe battle system has changed a bit as well. Maybe it will be by difficulty. But you're allowed to use an item and attack in the same turn, X-Arts, wasn't revealed in the game play but you're able to dna digivolve mid battle, \nGraphics, compared to the games that were released back in 2015 and 2017. This vastly improved! Cutscenes are much smoother and detailed. Digiattack to clear objects and either avoid battles all together or have the advantage, extra strikes, \nOptions for Eng dub and voice acting (I'm lazy sometimes so sue me) \nAble to move the Camera!!!!\nFor most conversations in the original game, the character would slide into frame and use the cutscene or frame from the game as the background. That is absent in this game, its like an episode of anime.\nBeing able to change your digimon's nature by talking to them \nBeing able to change Digimon party, de digi and digivolve from the menu, digivolution history, \nChange music for any instance\nSprint without have to use a hacker skill\nMultiple Digimon that can mounted\nAuto for dialogue/skip and gameplay and speed up and \n\nDislikes:\nPrice is a bit much for the game even with improvements to the game. \nGameplay can get stale and repetitive\nBefore using a signature move each Digimon does a pre attack animation, this was not present in the other story games. Just something I personally don't like.\nControls on Pc are a bit weird but can be changed\nIt runs with Denuvo. \n\nTLDR: \nVery good for digimon fans or people who played the orgnial two games, but will fall off compared to other games.

      "review": "First, I have to say that to me the vibe I get from the demo is not any different from when I first played Cybersleuth/ Hacker's Memory (that's a positive). Hopefully, this continues in the official release. I do like that the player can actually digivolve their digimon by digivice and not have to go to digilabs for the billionth time. The only saving grave for digilabs were the bundles of digiports everywhere. The game got more polished and so have the digimon's special moves; although, it is not like the previous title was a slouch in that department honestly. I do enjoy the ability to attack digimon first and you can get digimon to interact with things ( like destroying rubble blocking the path). It is nice to be able to talk with your digimon(s) outside of digichat.  The story is definitively interesting so far, it really is going to depend how well it gets explored. And that is pretty much all the positives I got from the demo. \n\nAs for the negatives, I do not care for the gun/ x-arts. It feels like a unneccessary gimmick that older digimon players would not really care for. Still not sure if I like the idea of starting out as an agent instead of becoming one. It feels out of place picking a starter digimon during the game if we are already supposed to be veteran agent ( Nothing ever states how long we have been an agent for, I am just assuming MC has been an agent for a while).  It would make narrative sense to have done it during the character select imo (in my opinion) instead of during the underground scene. Cybersleuth / Hacker's memory get the pass since both MCs were walking into a situation that just affected them and picking a digimon during that point of time made sense for the story progression. Do not like the fact of how easy it is to change the personality of digimon just by talking. I am hoping the personality change gets difficult or more challenging as the digimon reaches the next stage in the actual gameplay. The crest symbols from the adventure series to showcase what personality each sentences would turn their personalities into is a nice touch; but, feels like a parent holding your hand moment. Healing by standing should honestly be healing by data rest area/ data terminals. Do not get me wrong, healing by standing is not a bad idea on paper; but, honestly it makes the gameplay feels less of challenge for players that have chosen normal and hard difficulty settings. It honestly should be an thing for easy mode only. Not going to lie about how slightly disapppointed that the animations for the digimon during data conversion/  digivolution still feel lifeless to me. Like I was expecting atleast as they are about to be revealed, they do some kind of action from them as the light fades and then the reveal to what digimon looks. Then again, I probably was the only one hoping for that. \n\nAt the end of the day, I still think this game is worth getting for anyone interested. The gameplay is not that different from the previous title and offers both updates into things that did need updating like the menu and a story that seems pretty interesting in all honesty. Although, I am not paying 70 bucks for a shinier cybersleuth when I got both cybersleuth/ hacker's memory for atleast 60 bucks. Yeah, I am definitively waiting until it drops in price before buying it.",

But more like $40 good.\n\nFirst of all, i'm not a Digimon fan, i've never played a Digimon game nor watched much of the anime.\n\nThe overworld gameplay is very simple, you move your character around to pick up items and progress through the area, then engage in fights along the way. Talking to NPCs has not yielded anything other than information i already knew. So there doesn't seem to be much to this part of the game.\n\nThe fighting is simple enough to engage with, but definitely has at least a little depth behind the scenes. I believe customizing your party between battles to optimize their synergy and stat growth is what keeps the gameplay loop interesting.\n\nThe plot seems intriguing but i don't expect anything beyond basic JRPG stuff. Fight god with the power of friendship and all that. The characters in the story have overall been thoroughly forgettable, although the way they made a certain character pose and emote during cutscenes felt kinda off which was funny and therefore memorable.\n\nThere seems to be a lot of different, beautifully designed areas later in the game, so i'm giving the game the benefit of the doubt on that kind of thing, cuz the areas in the demo are definitely boring.\n\nI would say it's a good game.

There's tons of Digimons you can interact with, as well as manage, develop and upgrade their stats with additional equipment.

      "review": "It is pretty much a complete upgrade from Cyber Sleuth/Hacker's Memory in every regard.\n\n- Improved graphics that show all the Digimon in great detail.\n- Camera rotation is fluid, and actually, well, functions.\n- Movement speed via ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO RUN right from the get-go, and without needing a Digimon to do so. On top of that, even the ride-able Digimon Vary. They actually took the time to not only make it so certain Digimon run faster/slower then others when you're riding around on them [Riding GeoGreymon seems even slower then the default speed your character can sprint at for example, while riding Garurumon is fairly fast], but they even took into account Digimon \"sizes\" for things like doorways. Try it yourself by going into Central Town - Adventure Trial [beating the demo first], heading to the Spiral Waterway, and go to the tiny doorway that leads into a U-Shaped room with several of the different Ride Digimon you can get in this specific mode like Ogremon and Ikkakumon, and watch as some of them can go through the tiny doorway, but others cannot, either because they're \"too tall\" or \"too wide\" to get through it. They didn't NEED to do this, but they did, even if it's minor in the grand scheme of things.\n- You can now \"Skip\" battles either via sometimes auto-defeating a group with an out-of-battle attack on them, or by bumping up the battle speed to x2, x3, or x5 and just having auto-battle do it for you. HOWEVER: Auto Battles currently seem a bit wonky with how Digimon actions are dictated. Most likely it's Personality-dictated what they'll do [I enjoyed watching my Kotemon spam Guard Charge even though it could just insta-kill stuff with it's skills when Auto-Battle is on.]\n- YOU CAN ALSO SKIP DIALOGUE/CUTSCENES FINALLY BY HOLDING THE SKIP BUTTON, so no more needing to just mash through everything. There is also an auto button for when you just want to dialogue to go on automatically without needing to hit the button as well.\n- The Digi Lab isn't required for Digivolving/De-Digivolving anymore. Given a certain character is in this game though, along with the Digifarm, I'm sure it'll be needed, but in this specific instance: you can finally digivolve / dedigivolve without needing to run back to the lab everytime to do so.\n- You can play with either Controller OR Keyboard and mouse. \n- Framerate was actually good! Options are 30, 60, and 144. I ran it at the 144 setting in options and didn't have any issues with anything or even slowdown. Cannot speak for Steam Deck however, but it does look like they took the time to optimize this game it so it actually runs at a stable frame rate.\n- You can customize the music, like what you hear when walking around in the overworld, or when in your digivice. You can even set what music is played during battles. It's not SUPER extensive with what you can do, but the fact it is there is still nice.\n- The Digimon you use in battle are voiced. All of them. ALL OF THEM say their unique skill attack name when they use it. They say thank you when you give them an item, they sometimes say something when they get KO'd, and more. If you try out a bunch of them you'll probably quickly hear that a lot of them have the same VAs voicing several of the Digimon, but the fact all of them still talk and say things in battle just makes them feel more alive then just the generic noises and sounds we got in Cyber Sleuth/Hacker's Memory/Next Order.\n\nNot only are hardcore Digimon fans, like myself, looking forward to this game: but people who haven't touched anything Digimon related in almost 20+ years since they were kids, and even people who haven't touched anything Digimon related period, are also looking forward to this game. Yes, 70 bucks IS steep, but there is one silver lining if you want to hold off on purchasing Day 1: most of the Digimon games on Steam tend to go on sale somewhat frequently after about the first year it's released or so, so take with that what you will if you do want to hold off on it.\n\nIf you're on the fence about buying it, then give the demo an extensive shot to see if it's up your alley. If not, at least you gave it a shot. If it is, and are curious about how the old ones play compared to this one: then you can go check out Cyber Sleuth Complete Edition if you want to see/play BOTH the Digimon Story games that came before this one: Cyber Sleuth and Hacker's Memory.\n\nLink to Cyber Sleuth Complete Edition: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1042550/Digimon_Story_Cyber_Sleuth_Complete_Edition/ [I've seen the Complete Edition go on sale for up to 80%+ off regularly throughout the years! So just wait for one of those sales if you genuinely want to give the predecessor games a shot!]\n\nThe devs seem to have put A LOT of love and care into this Digimon Game, when compared to certain other modern games made by certain other companies these past few years anyway. Me, and no doubt so many others, have high hopes for this game.\n\nHere is to hoping the full-release version of Time Stranger finally shows everyone why Digimon really are the champions.",

I'm thrilled to report that this demo not only meets but arguably exceeds the high expectations set by its predecessors from Digimon Story franchise.\n\nFrom the moment you boot up the game, the familiar yet refreshed aesthetic immediately draws you in. The character models are detailed, and the environments, even in this limited capacity, showcase a vibrant world ripe for exploration. The user interface is intuitive, making navigation and Digimon management a breeze, which is crucial for players who love to tinker with their team compositions. Although the devs say using a controller should be better, I used mouse + keyborad and it was awesome. \n\nGameplay-wise, the turn-based combat is as engaging as ever. The strategic depth, a hallmark of the Digimon Story titles, is evident even in the early stages. Choosing the right Digimon for the right situation, considering their types, skills, and evolution paths, provides a satisfying challenge. The demo offers a good taste of the various mechanics, including the unique \"Time Stranger\" elements that promise to add an exciting new layer to the established formula. I particularly enjoyed the introduction of new Digimon and the familiar faces that have been beautifully rendered.\n\nWhat truly sets this demo apart is its ability to capture the \"dream\" feeling for fans. It masterfully blends nostalgia with innovation, hinting at a rich narrative and extensive post-game content that fans have been craving. The pacing feels just right, offering enough content to get a solid feel for the game without revealing too much. They used what was good from Cyber Sleuth and added some new utilites that make the game more friedly to new players.\n\nIn conclusion, the Digimon Story: Time Stranger demo is a resounding success. It's a polished, engaging, and deeply satisfying experience that perfectly sets the stage for the full release. If you're a fan of Digimon, monster-catching RPGs, or simply appreciate well-crafted turn-based combat, this demo is an absolute must-play.

I don't think I'll get it at launch, but definitely keeping my eye on it!\n\nPROS:\n- Battle system is fun, easy to learn, and seeing your party follow you is neat.\n- Digivolution system is pretty cool, it's not just a level requirement but stats as well, which gives you some decent choices.\n- The Digimon sprites, the MC, and the important side characters look nice and HD.\n- The cutscenes are quite well done.\n- The story was actually pretty interesting, which I wasn't really expecting.\n\nCONS:\n- The environments look fuzzy and low quality at times (they look a TON better in the second part of the demo).\n- The VA is hit or miss.\n- Silent protag for story moments, even though he/she make battle noises and talk during gameplay.\n- The game screams budget, sadly, but they're really trying.",

      "review": "The best Digimon game I've ever played, and that's a pretty intensive list. Tonally it's darker than the previous Digimon Story games, with what seems to be a more complex narrative (there are, at least from what I can tell, 3+ factions involved in whatever narrative conflict is ongoing) and the tone is decidedly darker and more mature. It's not quite accurate to say \"SMT with Digimon\", but that's not a bad way to sum up the vibe. From the little bit of writing and plot on display in the demo it feels more like season 3 of the original anime than anything else. \n\nThe biggest mechanical QOL for me is the changes to Digimon themselves. In the most recent Digimon Story games, Cybersleuth and Hacker's Memory, the mechanical uniqueness and niche of a Digimon largely comes down to their Support Skill and unique attack, though a Digimon's stats are still a component.  All affinities and elements have a single, universal weakness and all Weakness/Resistance scalings are the same. Elemental weaknesses are on a Digimon by Digimon basis in Time Stranger and there's now a fairly  robust personality mechanic that influences both Digivolution and universal passive. It rocks, it really makes every individual Digimon feel different and it means that there's far more potential tactical variety in which Digimon you choose for your party and how to use them. The fact that Tamer support (item use/switching Digimon) no longer consumes a turn is also a solid QOL change and one that I think will result in far more dynamic gameplay . Instead of striving to find a 3 Digimon party to suit your needs with a library of back-up Digis in the tank it feels more like you have 6 unique partners and are only seeing 3 of them at a time.\n\nIn short, I'm absolutely rabid for the full release and would recommend what I've seen in the demo to anyone with a love of Digimon and a hunger for a fairly deep and intense creature collector.",

      "review": "⭐ Digimon Story: Time Stranger – The Best Game Ever ⭐\n\nIf you think Pokémon has always been the king of monster-battling RPGs, it’s time to reconsider. Digimon Story: Time Stranger takes everything fans love about collecting, training, and battling creatures and elevates it into something bigger, deeper, and more emotionally impactful. This isn’t just another monster-tamer game — it’s the best one ever made.\n\n🌍 A Story Worth Caring About\n\nUnlike Pokémon’s mostly repetitive “beat the gyms, stop the evil team” formula, Time Stranger delivers a gripping narrative filled with mystery, high stakes, and time-bending twists. The story doesn’t just guide you from point A to B — it pulls you in, makes you care about the characters, and keeps you on the edge of your seat.\n\n🐉 Digimon with Personality\n\nIn Pokémon, creatures are often treated like silent companions. Here, Digimon feel alive — with unique personalities, evolving relationships, and choices that actually matter. Watching your partner grow through multiple digivolutions feels more rewarding than any level-up system Pokémon has ever offered.\n\n⚔️ Combat That Feels Epic\n\nThe battle system isn’t just turn-based numbers — it’s strategic, fast-paced, and cinematic. Digimon battles feel like true digital wars, with flashy animations, team synergies, and mechanics that demand clever thinking. It’s not about spamming the strongest move — it’s about planning, adapting, and commanding like a true tamer.\n\n🎵 Presentation That Wows\n\nFrom breathtaking art to the heart-pounding soundtrack, Time Stranger creates a world that feels alive. Whether you’re exploring futuristic cities or venturing through strange digital landscapes, the game constantly impresses with its style and atmosphere.\n\n⭐ Why It Beats Pokémon\n\nStronger story with real emotional weight.\n\nDeeper combat system that rewards strategy.\n\nMore meaningful evolution where your choices shape your partner’s destiny.\n\nA world that feels alive, not just a backdrop for battles.\n\nPokémon might have the brand recognition, but Digimon Story: Time Stranger proves it’s the superior game. If you’ve ever wished for a monster RPG that treats you with maturity, rewards your time, and gives you a story worth remembering, this is it.\n\n👉 Simply put: this is the best monster-battling RPG ever made — and yes, it’s even better than Pokémon.\n\nNote: I used AI to help organize and structure my thoughts while writing this review, but all opinions expressed are my own.",

For me it was awesome to see normal/regular digimons ranged from Digimon 1 to Digimon 3 tv series (so far what I saw) and not some weird new or \"bad\" design digimon.\nGameplay was ok, probably I could say that it should be more \"alive\" when you are touring around scenarios. Also fix the anti-aliasing artifacts that you see.\nOne very important thing to improve almost mandatory is the soundtrack.. it's awful... in all aspects (during touring, during, combat, during cutscenes, during menues, during summoning, digievolving... For the price asking as pre-purchase and what  will be asked once it comes out, soundtrack should have a top tier level.\nOverall it was a very fun and entertained game and I look forward to play another Digimon game. My last one was Digimon Word 3 (masterpiece in my opinion).",

One thing I really appreciated in Persona 5 was unlocking the ability to hit enemies with the mona car to instantly clear the encounter. That is a feature in this game almost immediately and it really speeds up the process of doing some light grind-work. It is very much appreciated. I dont really understand the game mechanics yet but I have a feeling if I put more time into the demo/end up picking up the game it will come to me eventually.\n\nHappy for fans of this series because they seem to be eating well with this one, thumbs up",

Despite the $70 price tag, I might actually just buy it because from what I've played, it's right up my alley and I doubt I would regret the purchase. As someone who has never played a Digimon game before, I think it is very beginner friendly.

(Also please give me more non-tamagochi Digimon, origin I know I know, but let me just bond without the loss).\n\nThe graphics put me off, not gonna lie. For 70 euros they are very very generic and bland and not even charming/stylized, just some sloppy 3d models without soul. The movement animation feels awkward, other human characters look rigid. Story starts off just as rigid and bland in dialogue as well, disappointing if you name your series \"Story\" and you forget to put in some sprinkles of love, but the combat loop works really well.\n\nSeason pass is really really worrysome. I despise that cashgrab. As such my suggestion near the end:\nPurchase if you (strongly) love turnbased teambuilding combat and you don't struggle paying your monthly costs. If you're at all worried about money right now, move on, come back on sale, ask Bandai why they add a season pass to a freaking singleplayer game and maybe download a Pokémon romhack (I bet there are Digimon crossovers, too) to live out your turnbased fantasy?",

Best of all, there are Digimon galore in the demo alone with several options to make the team you want. Overall, fans from any generation of Digimon will enjoy this game.

There's a lot of QoL updates from cyber sleuth like being able to access your digimon box at any time as well as being able to convert and digivolve. The personality system looks pretty in depth so I can't wait to mess with that in the full game.\n\nBattles are basically the same from cyber sleuth where you have type advantages/disadvantages but there's added features of Cross arts which gives a party wide stat boost and being able to change battle speed on the fly (which I ADORE). Using an item also doesn't skip that digimon's turn anymore so no worries about having to waste turns to use an item, though it's still only one item per digimon turn. Overall I'm happy with the battle system!\n\nThere's a couple of things that might drive people away, such as being able to fully heal once you stand still in the overworld. Personally I don't mind this because I'm not gonna shy away from mechanics that help you but I can see people not liking something that might make the game much easier. There's also an exp share for all of your digimon within your box so no more having to grind digimons one by one (though I haven't tested to see if digimon within your party gain more). This is also something that I've noticed but the music suddenly cutting out when entering the menu is a bit annoying and sometimes text boxes from other conversations overlay with one another if you go through the text too fast.\n\n\nOverall I'm happy with the demo and I can't wait for the full release!!",

The story is equally generic and boring but something that really annoyed me is the way you MC walks around. It's just a constant running animation that makes it look like you're gliding on ice every time you turn which further supports my criticism that this is a very mid 2010's game and therefore doesn't justify the $69.99 price tag.\n\nNOW, this games only redeeming quality is the evolution system where a single digimon have multiple evolution lines you can access depending on the stats of your current digimon. To me that was the most interesting aspect of the game and is the only reason i would buy the full game just not at the full price.

The battle mechanics are nothing to write home about, especially compared to many other contemporary turn based JRPGS. The collecting aspect is boring because there's no drama to it like in pokemon or demons in SMT games. There's no weakening, then deciding on a pokeball or demon negotiation. You just... get them from a menu when you've encountered them enough. It's super unengaging, and makes all of the digimon feel like commodities. The story is also just ok. Nothing really out of the ordinary or interesting, it just exists. But if you don't innovate on gameplay (which this game doesn't) then you NEED an engaging story to capture the attention of the player, and it just didn't meet the mark for me. There appeared to be a lot more interesting locales than just \"a city\" and I wish this demo would've covered that, since it looks far more interesting at the very least. All of this is only exacerbated by a $70 price tag (plus $30 season pass!!!!!). I would consider paying like $20 for this game at most. There are far better Turn Based JRPGs for the money, and this feels like it gets its reputation mostly from just \"sticking it\" to pokemon rather than on its own merits.",
