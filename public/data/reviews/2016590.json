      "review": "This game is improving. From my understanding, the dev team had an idea for what the game should be, and the experience didn't coincide with the experience that the players were getting. While I do enjoy this, there are definitely areas for improvement. at the moment, the combat feels quite lack-lustre at times. A dodging or parrying mechanic would be fun. I have played a mix of solo PVE and solo/group PVP at the moment, and both game modes have their positives and negatives. The PVP has a obvious issue with certain classes being stronger than others. I like to play as a barbarian, and because of this, I often found myself struggling to combat archers and mages. slow moving mechanics of the melee units mean that without throwables, you become a pincushion - unable to catch up with the high dex archers, and unable to escape as they can hound you down and engage at a distance (skill issue for sure, but not without balancing concerns). \r\n\r\nWhile I agree with this as an experience in theory, it ends up being a little un-fun, especially given that you can only have one character slot if you don't purchase the premium upgrade for your account.\r\n\r\nIn regards to PVE, while I enjoy the more casual experience of hacking my way through various creepy-crawlies, the lack of combat mechanics means that the fights become repetitive. I feel like with the addition of a parry mechanic for all weapon types, and potentially a dodge mechanic, the combat could become a little more skill based/fluid - just improving upon the experience in general.\r\n\r\nOverall, I feel like this game has a massive amount of potential, and if the dev team continues in the vein that they currently are, there could be some definite growth - especially once they complete the skill system. I'd love to see a DnD inspired skill tree that allows players to improve themselves in an RPG style of function. Fast shooting archers, near bullet proof knights, and devastating mages would be great fun for the game.\r\n\r\nI'd personally argue that the PVE experience has the greater potential overall, as it could become a genuinely amazing group based dungeon crawler. Hope to see the game grow and improve in time.",

There is a bit of a learning curve for new players cause of all the stuff that you can do that you can't do or is done differently then most other extraction games. the PVP is fun but definitely infuriating cause sometimes when you run into people and they take no damage while two shotting you, can really annoy you and you can just go to the PVE mode to cool off or focus on quests, I just wish their was more people playing the PVE on the other maps and not just the first map cause I am not gonna wait 10 minutes or more for a group but the PVE is also tougher than PVP so solo isn't always fun either. now for the PVE I do think they need to make more unlimited use exits on the other maps like the gates on the ruins map cause running around for 8 minutes trying to find an exit just to loose the good stuff you got cause time ran out but other than that it is a lot of fun and I think they should add a mode where you can go against AI teams to get used to the player combat plus you won't have to wait for how ever many teams there are to load in.",

      "review": "Unbiased review from someone that looked at the game, forgot it existed and decided to give it a try years later only to painfully enjoy what I had tried (with as much detail as I can provide for those curious on picking it up to play)\n\nTruthfully, I love the aesthetic. Dark and grimy, DnD feel to it. Overall I enjoy the way it plays out personally but there are some glaring issues that will result in the \"mixed\" reviews.\n\nOne of which being you get a shell of whats offered as a free to play variant, If you want the \"full game\" experience, with selling on the player market, more than 1 character (ect.)  you have to pay $30. I get the idea of the free to play model, but it almost feels like you should have charged it to begin with because it feels like im being \"Lured\" into paying the premium price anyways (which I did since Im curious to see where the game develops from here)\n\nNew player engagement: Just bang your head against a wall, youll learn not to hit your head cuz it hurts... this game is the same way. You get no info, no guides, and basically learn everything on your own unless you use YT guides or direct over to their discord for help... and lets be honest. For a free to play game, who is going to immediately jump to their discord for a \"knight\" (a real player designed to help guide people) when they are more inclined to just uninstall it since it didnt cost them money anyways.\n\nMerchants. There is a reputation system to gain \"favor\". I personally like this but it really just takes experimenting with to figure out the different tabs and what they do. Good amount of choices, but very overwhelming, ESPECIALLY when you dont have a tutorial to explain out the system at all... (refer back to their \"knight\" program again)\n\nAs for combat...? Its unique. I personally like it but it isnt for everyone. Its a little slower and for attacking it relies on the animation, not the reticle. You may think youll hit your target... that is until a wall torch you couldnt see on your screen stops you overhead swing and the enemy gets a free hit on you. Again, its not terrible imo... its just designed with a specific player base in mind.\n\nAs for the map for each campaign? If your not gonna give us a tutorial, at least let us have a legend on what symbols mean. Red stairs vs blue stairs. Ropes being only 1 person extract. Or even that damn elevator in the center of the goblin caves... I still cant figure hat one out aside from it just... appears?\n\nBasically, the whole structure revolves around just \"winging it and figuring it out\" which will drive away a lot of people from a free to play game if they dont have the persistence to learn... and with a game that SEEMS to have ever increasing nuances and things that \"just work that way\" its hard to understand unless you know the basics of DnD-esque games. \n\n2 health bar systems, light red, dark red, and empty... each one solved using a different healing item... of which... again... isnt guided to you almost at all.\n\nA prime example is you have to hit G at a campfire. It acts as a \"long rest\" to give back spell slots. Learned that after a few hours of pain staking failures with my crew only for my ranger to appreciate getting back his healing food ability when we found out about it.\n\nBasically if you want guidance, you wont find it here unless you go out of your way to get it... the community is nice in pve, but you have to ask to even have a chance of learning... if you dont like that, it isnt for you.... thanks for reading this though!",

Try it free, but if you stay, get the legendary for the cheap $30 price. It is worth it to get the full feeling of the game and to take advantage of selling your loot to other players.

The only class I ended up enjoying was Barbarian and Ranger and settling for Barbarian with their weird Squire Mode since they want you to buy the legendary was really annoying when trying to test out the game. Barbarian itself overall is just mindless fun as running several people down was great, it did feel like there was skill expression when I'd land headshots with my felling axe. But I can't say I enjoy the combat entirely as it feels far too slow in terms of swinging and movement that overall makes the game feel like you're a slug even as the most speed-driven classes running at a joggers pace. PvP is decent and it's probably fun for those that can tolerate the more stiff behavior to the game's combat and movement.\n\nI would not suggest this game to everyone, along with the fact their ques are still broken and I had two instances in solos where a player had a pocket Cleric.

Everything feels grounded — metal armor moves and sounds like metal, lighting is gritty, and every swing in combat actually matters.\r\n\r\nYou can lose or win a fight with a single mistake or a perfect strike, and that’s part of what makes it so tense and satisfying. The dungeon atmosphere is some of the best I’ve seen, and the visuals and sound design make every run feel dangerous.\r\n\r\nThat said, I think the game still lacks long-term depth. There’s little immersion or character individuality, and the seasonal wipes make it hard to stay attached to your progress. I’d love to see more customization, persistent world elements, and reasons to keep playing beyond gear resets.\r\n\r\nStill, for pure tension, skill-based combat, and atmosphere, Dark and Darker delivers something special. It’s one of the most unique extraction-style dungeon games out there, and if Ironmace builds more world and identity into it, it could become truly legendary.",

It mixes unforgiving PvE dungeon crawling with tense PvP encounters in a way that constantly keeps you on edge — every step could be your last, every sound could mean danger or treasure.\r\n\r\nWhat really sets it apart for me is the atmosphere. The dark medieval tone, the flickering torches, the sound of footsteps echoing through the halls — it all creates a sense of pressure and immersion that few games pull off this well. The fact that death actually matters makes every run exciting and meaningful.\r\n\r\nIt’s not a game for everyone; it can be brutal, frustrating, and sometimes unfair. But that’s part of what makes it so rewarding when things finally go your way. Dark and Darker thrives on risk and tension, and if you enjoy that constant push between fear and greed, you’ll love it.",

It is pretty much the perfect dungeon crawler I used to play it a long time ago when it was still relatively new, but then there was only pvp maps and you couldn’t even pick them You had to wait for the map rotation switch there was also a lot of of an unoptimized gameplay bugs and glitches now though? It has become one of my personal favorites dungeon crawlers so much of it is just so satisfying yet rewarding, you are not able to just walk into the dungeon and clear it by yourself with no prior experience you will die especially for your first few matches whether or not you pick PVP or the newly released PVE modes you better get used to dying over and over and over again because if you’re not paying attention, you’re dead but it’s doesn’t feel unfair The game has the classes that you would expect like fighter cleric wizard, but there’s also a few that people might not have considered like a bard, a barbarian, a warlock and sorcerer all the magic users have the unique way of casting and it’s just so cool to see so many cool spells and even if you’re not a spellcaster, there are abilities and perks that balance everything out so maybe be better than others of course but none of them feel broken overpowered or useless currently there are four maps all with their own unique enemies exit locations and bosses there so much I would say but can’t so try it for your self",

You don’t get a second chance.\r\nYou get **one run**, and then it’s either:\r\n\r\n* Escape with loot → god gamer\r\n* Die to a skeleton archer → “unlucky, bad spawn, lag, sun in my eyes, etc.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Pros\r\n\r\n* **Incredible tension.**\r\n  Every footstep behind you is either a goblin, another player…\r\n  or your own teammate breathing directly into their mic.\r\n\r\n* Sound design is cruel in the best way:\r\n\r\n  * Chainmail rattling\r\n  * Doors creaking\r\n  * Someone opening a chest in the next room and your whole team going full goblin mode: “PUSH THEM.”\r\n\r\n* The PvPvE mix is chef’s kiss:\r\n\r\n  * You’re mid-fight with three skeletons\r\n  * A rogue appears out of the shadows\r\n  * You die, he teabags, your friends mute their mics because they’re laughing too hard\r\n\r\n* When you actually **extract with loot**, it feels better than beating a final boss in most games.\r\n\r\n  * “We opened a door and left” somehow = peak victory.\r\n\r\n* The jank is part of the charm.\r\n  Your swings are slow, your spells are limited, your vision is trash… and yet you keep queueing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Cons\r\n\r\n* New player experience:\r\n\r\n  * Spawn in\r\n  * Open a door\r\n  * Get one-tapped by a trap, a skeleton, a player, or all three\r\n  * Inventory: empty\r\n  * Soul: broken\r\n\r\n* If your team dies and you’re last alive, it stops being a game and becomes an anxiety simulator:\r\n\r\n  * “Loot their bodies or run?”\r\n  * “Portal or greed?”\r\n  * You pick greed. You die.\r\n\r\n* Losing your gear hurts.\r\n  That blue sword you loved? Gone.\r\n  That armor set you farmed all night? Also gone.\r\n  But don’t worry, you still have sandals.\r\n\r\n* Solo queue is basically:\r\n\r\n  * 30% rat gameplay\r\n  * 30% running from 3-man parties\r\n  * 40% listening for footsteps and regretting having any valuables\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Peak Dark and Darker Moments\r\n\r\n* Barbarian teammate:\r\n\r\n  > “I hear someone, I’m pushing.”\r\n  > *5 seconds later he’s dead in a hallway full of traps and we’re all looting his pockets before reviving him.*\r\n\r\n* Rogue loots your body **before** trying to res you.\r\n\r\n  * “Just holding your stuff for you, bro.”\r\n  * You don’t get out. He keeps your stuff.\r\n\r\n* Opening a chest and getting smacked by a mimic so hard you physically lean back IRL.\r\n\r\n* Standing in a tiny room, portal ticking down, red zone closing in, everyone screaming:\r\n\r\n  * “YOU TAKE THAT ONE!”\r\n  * “NO, YOU GO!”\r\n  * *Wizard takes both, leaves party to die, says ‘my bad’ in Discord.*\r\n\r\n* Escaping with 2 HP, 1 potion, and a backpack full of trash loot that you will proudly overprice on the market.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Final Verdict\r\n\r\nDark and Darker is:\r\n\r\n* 30% medieval looter\r\n* 30% horror game\r\n* 40% voice chat panic\r\n\r\nIt’s brutal, clunky, janky, unfair… and unreasonably addictive.\r\n\r\n**9/10**\r\nWould once again spawn with starter gear, die to a skeleton two rooms in, blame “desync,” and queue immediately for another emotionally damaging run.",

Every room is pitch black except for a single lit torch that covers 2 inches, enemies no longer miss as they have absurd tracking, the corridors are too tight to strafe around (not that it matters because the tracking is fucked and strafing gets you hit anyways, if you don't have a shield you just take damage no matter what), and I genuinely see no reason for anybody to try picking this game up or re-picking it up if they thought about it again.\n\nI don't see how a game that was nearly perfect before, just needing a couple balance changes and a new map, got turned into this monstrosity that doesn't want you to play it.\n\nI'll paint you a picture of how this game worked when it first released. You woke up in a room with a closed door and a bit of loot in it. When you walked out you would be in a hallway with a single patrolling skeleton. It had either a bow, a sword and shield, or a greatsword. When it started it's attack animation, you could backup or strafe depending on what the animation was, and avoid the attack. The skeleton didn't turn or move forward in order to guarantee an attack. The corridor was also wide enough to allow you to strafe sideways.\n\nNow i'll paint you a picture of the current iteration of this. You wake up in a tight hallway that is only wide enough for 1 person to pass through. There's 18 skeletons in this hallway and 1 will immediately aggro onto you when you spawn in. You can't avoid it's attacks, you can't run away from it as you'll just aggro the next skeleton, and you can't kill it before it blows through 90% of your health. You can try to sit and rest up for the next fight, but the patrolling skeleton has already aggro'd onto you and you just die.\n\nIDK who the fuck thought this game needed a \"fuck you\" spawn for the basic solo player mode, but I went into 4 games and they were all the same. I was either completely surrounded, or I only had 1 direction I could go down and it was littered with skeletons  and the area was way too narrow to avoid any hits (not that you fucking can, even the bow skeleton I encountered never missed a shot, even if I had my weapon put away and was strafing around him).\n\nIt's extremely upsetting because this game was super unique to the genre, and was insanely fun and engaging. Now it just sucks. It's anti-fun. There's no rewarding feeling of getting through enemies, you're just sitting there thinking \"holy fucking shit how much more do I have to do?\"",

I have over 2000 hours logged between Steam, the old Blacksmith launcher, and everything in between. I have seen every stage of this so-called Early Access project, and after two years it is still the same broken mess it has always been.\r\n\r\nIronmace likes to act like the scrappy underdogs, but the truth is that SDF and the team rely on Unreal Marketplace assets and have shown very little actual creativity or direction. They have had years to build something meaningful, but instead we get seasonal shops, meaningless hotfixes, and threats to the community for finding bugs in new maps. That is literally what the community is supposed to do during an Early Access phase. Players try to help improve the game and they get treated like the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe gold farming problem is out of control and most of us would not be surprised if SDF had a hand in it considering how the economy always seems to break in ways that benefit them. The game already has a bad reputation after getting kicked off Steam for “borrowing” from Nexon, and yet here we are again with the same recycled systems, the same excuses, and barely 7000 players left online.\r\n\r\nEvery time they post “Hold the Line” I cannot help but laugh. Hold the line? More like Hand it over. Step away from development, let an actual development team take over, and maybe the game could return to what it once was back during Playtest 2.\r\n\r\nAt this point a couple of teenagers with basic coding knowledge could probably finish this game faster and better than Ironmace has managed in two years. This could have been something amazing, but now it is just a shell of what it used to be.",
