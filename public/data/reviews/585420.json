      "review": "I was a bit apprehensive at first as I was afraid the game would have a steep learning curve like many sandbox games do. But it doesn’t, really. It does a wonderful job at introducing you gradually to its features. Building something that does the job you need it to do is quite easy.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, the game’s very well optimized and polished. Performance and stability is not an issue (as much as you can expect of a sandbox game, mind you).\r\n\r\nThat’s a result of the game having a few years on it by this point, but make no mistake, this is NOT another dead game. It receives frequent updates that add new building blocks and features, refine the user interface, increase stability and performance. As such, you can always find servers to play with others.\r\n\r\nThe devs clearly listen to their community. They’ve added plenty of features that we’ve been asking for. In fact, they do community surveys. Everyone wanted tank tracks. Guess what’s coming in the next update?\r\nIt might not have the depth of Stormworks or the crazy versatility of Garry’s Mod. But Trailmakers doesn’t require days or weeks of work for a single vehicle. It’s far more refined than Garry’s Mod and won’t break your spirit while building complex stuff.\r\n\r\nAnd trust me, you can get as simple and as complex as you want. You can slap a seat, some wheels and an engine and you got yourself a vehicle. But there’s logic stuff so if you feel like programming a whole game cabinet to recreate Mario in-game, you can.\r\n\r\nI will forever remember this as one of the best games I’ve ever played. 10/10.",

I cant speak on making mods as I haven't done that yet, but I assume its decently simple to upload them.\n\nit gets updates somewhat frequently and each one comes with some form of DLC because the devs need paying and the group only has 2 games under them.\n\nrecent updates have felt less like building things with the parts you have and more like being given new pre-made things that you could already make just fine but all that really does is lower the bar for entry so its only really a minor nit-pick of mine",

There are so many parts and ways to build different vehicles and machines. It feels like a simple building game, but it also has really cool technical parts, especially with the logic blocks. Figuring out how to make things work is super satisfying. Plus, playing with friends in multiplayer is a lot of fun.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I really hope the developers add is a better way to manage complex builds. When you use a lot of logic blocks or technical blocks, it gets messy. It would be great to have a \"layer system\" where you could name groups of blocks and easily select them from a simple menu. Being able to re-select a certain group of hinges quickly, for example, would save a ton of time on big projects.\r\n\r\nOverall, it is a brilliant game that lets your imagination run wild! 11/10",

The devs dont really listen to the community and just keep dishing out half assed updates and dlc after dlc.\n\nGameplay- Very fun and creative with lots of potential for different types of builds and play. I prefer combat like dogfighting and I will admit the community can be very toxic about how you build. IE making something unrealistic or over powered will garner lots of toxicity. Theres also racing, logic systems, and just general role play with vehicles if you feel like.\n\nCommunity- Very half n half. Half are chill and dont care much while the other half is extremely toxic and acts like you cant do anything but how they play. Also same people who stan the devs and dont think they can do any wrong.\n\nThe root issue- The devs as I have stated dont really do much for the community and just push out pretty shitty updates that end up fucking up previous builds and never adding all that much content. Plenty of suggestions from their community just go ignored even though it should be obvious they should listen.\n\nSide rant- The physics of this game are completely shit but good enough I guess lol. Moving parts wig out like gmod and the slightest touch can send stuff flying if you place moving parts on each other. The aerodynamic calculation is some of the most retarded code I have ever experienced in my life. Its calculated in the build mode and when parts are updated (by moving thats it) which allows for zero drag glitch (actually pretty dope). But this shitty aerodynamics leads to some pretty wacky movement at high speeds.\n\nMy suggestions- I think the game could do with a 3D changing feature for blocks. Similar to a game called Avorion where you place a block type and change the shape via XYZ adjustments. It would add a lot more creativity to builds without spending all your comp on hinges for rounded builds.\nI have more suggestions but this one would do a lot of good for the game.\n\nConclusion- I love playing this game for the most part but devs dont care and community doesnt help the situation. Dying game with lots of potential so ill keep playing but dont waste your money. A similar much better designed game called Simple Planes 2 is coming next year so get that instead. Pretty much just the vehicle aspect of the game but way way better game play.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention the discord community is very hilarious. Full of pedophiles and trannies.

      "review": "As much as I enjoy the builder mostly, and playing in different ways, this game is pretty much a dying cow the devs are constantly milking. The devs dont really listen to the community and just keep dishing out half assed updates and dlc after dlc.\n\nGameplay- Very fun and creative with lots of potential for different types of builds and play. I prefer combat like dogfighting and I will admit the community can be very toxic about how you build. IE making something unrealistic or over powered will garner lots of toxicity. Theres also racing, logic systems, and just general role play with vehicles if you feel like.\n\nCommunity- Very half n half. Half are chill and dont care much while the other half is extremely toxic and acts like you cant do anything but how they play. Also same people who stan the devs and dont think they can do any wrong.\n\nThe root issue- The devs as I have stated dont really do much for the community and just push out pretty shitty updates that end up fucking up previous builds and never adding all that much content. Plenty of suggestions from their community just go ignored even though it should be obvious they should listen.\n\nSide rant- The physics of this game are completely shit but good enough I guess lol. Moving parts wig out like gmod and the slightest touch can send stuff flying if you place moving parts on each other. The aerodynamic calculation is some of the most retarded code I have ever experienced in my life. Its calculated in the build mode and when parts are updated (by moving thats it) which allows for zero drag glitch (actually pretty dope). But this shitty aerodynamics leads to some pretty wacky movement at high speeds.\n\nMy suggestions- I think the game could do with a 3D changing feature for blocks. Similar to a game called Avorion where you place a block type and change the shape via XYZ adjustments. It would add a lot more creativity to builds without spending all your comp on hinges for rounded builds.\nI have more suggestions but this one would do a lot of good for the game.\n\nConclusion- I love playing this game for the most part but devs dont care and community doesnt help the situation. Dying game with lots of potential so ill keep playing but dont waste your money. A similar much better designed game called Simple Planes 2 is coming next year so get that instead. Pretty much just the vehicle aspect of the game but way way better game play.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention the discord community is very hilarious. Full of pedophiles and trannies.
