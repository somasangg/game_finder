Nothing aligns, nothing loads right, and you get zero feedback when something breaks.\n\nThere’s no drag and drop, no proper asset management, just outdated menus from 20 years ago. Everything takes five extra steps for no reason.\n\nThe default tilesets look ancient and lazy, and the overpriced DLC packs feel like a scam.\nYou shouldn’t have to pay extra to make a broken tool barely usable.\n\nUpdate: The game keeps crashing on a MacBook Pro M4. Selling this level of instability in 2025 is ridiculous.\nThis software isn’t worth $1, not even on sale.",

There are default maps, characters, events, etc that you can use to help you learn.\r\n- You don't need to learn how to code at all - the built-in functions can be used to easily make a basic game.\r\n- If you do code manually, it uses Javascript, a well-understood language that's been around for ages.\r\n- Tons of resources online to do almost anything you want.\r\n\r\nThe bad:\r\n- If you do want to be a smarty-pants and manually code, the box where you enter your code is like 320x240 and can't be expanded, and is limited to 12 lines. It is basically a text box with no IDE functions. That is horrible.\r\n- In fact, none of the editor's windows can be resized, and they were designed around 720p screens. If you have a higher resolution than that, everything will be tiny and there's nothing you can do about it.\r\n- Almost all documentation of script calls for functions is in Japanese.\r\n- Want to write a method or an object? Too bad - on top of having no space to do it, these are stripped and discarded when the game is saved/loaded. This is one of the worst decisions I've seen from a game engine, ever. MZ has the same problem as far as I can tell.\r\n- There are no protections for your game. If someone wants to steal your code, assets, etc, it will take less than 5 minutes. You can \"\"\"\"encrypt\"\"\"\" your image/audio files when deploying, but there are tools online to decrypt them easily.\r\n\r\nTL;DR - if you're a normal user that knows nothing about code and doesn't want to do anything interesting, this is the way to go. If you want to level up your game, grow up and use Godot, Unity, Unreal, anything else. It's gonna be hard, but it'll take you much further.",

On the plus side the RTP is pretty generous and decent enough to not need anything else for a beginner, but previous iterations of the engine had better music, sprites and aesthetic imo.\n\nPeople say that there is much more plugin support and while that is true MZ has a good amount of them built into it. I'd pick up MZ over MV its just better supported and more stable which matters a lot more than you initially think.",
