You may enjoy this game for 30 minutes\n\n- My YouTube Channel: \nRock 'N' Roll Defense | Full Game Playthrough | No Commentary (100% Achievements)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4IQZIaPb-WY",

However, there are a few things about this 'game' that really rub me the wrong way\n\n1) The game itself is somewhat shoddily made. UI elements aren't rendered properly, with some being cut off by the top of the screen. The gameplay is so simplistic that it's essentially pointless. You can use the exact same strategy on every single level with no variation or thought required. The difficulty of each level never increases, and it actually gets significantly easier as you go on. Enemy variety is nonexistent; the more health they have, the slower they move, that's all there is to it.\n\n2) It's on sale about as often as it's not. Not a bad thing, but definitely somewhat suspicious, especially when you consider point 3...\n\n3) The game has hundreds of achievements that are handed out for everything you do. 4 achievements for placing and upgrading a tower. 3 achievements for finishing a level. Multiple achievements per level for killing various amounts of each enemy. Each achievement icon is also a letter, number or symbol, making it plainly obvious what the intent is.\n\n[b]Verdict: this is an achievement farmer attached to a barebones game to conceal/justify its existence. It gets thrown on a 50% off sale every few weeks in the hopes of someone buying it because they want to be able to spell out something on their profile with the achievement showcase feature.[/b]",
