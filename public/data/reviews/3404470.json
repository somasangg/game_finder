I hope the game developers can properly address this problem, instead of requiring players to manually find the game's launcher file in their folder and change the \"Compatibility\" option to \"Disable Full-Screen Optimization\" to solve the issue. \nI have these complaints because many similar desktop games on Steam that I've played don't have this problem, so I believe the developers can and should properly handle this black screen issue.\n\nRemarks : If there are any solutions or updates to this problem (besides telling players to manually adjust compatibility), I will change my comment to positive.\n\nUpdate: The developers have released an update that automatically resolves this issue, fantastic! This is a really good idle game, highly recommended !!!",

I absolutely love the joy on her face seeing the cute characters or her just decorating. It's usually not my type of game but it was the cutest thing seeing her watch and play with these characters; she even changed a character in the game and named it after me. Thank you for not just bringing my wife joy but Introducing me to this genre of games.",

There's lots of relaxing music, and you can decorate your onsen however you like. Don't worry about making mistakes because if you mess up your design, the price you paid will be returned, which is super forgiving.\n\nOnce you collect all the required mail from each location, you'll receive a key that let's you unlock another hot spring. It's a simulation game, so there's not much to do beyond decorating and enjoying the cozy vibe, but that's exactly what makes it relaxing.\n\nIt sits nicely at the bottom of your screen while you do other things, which I love! I haven't gotten the DLC yet, but definitely plan to because this game deserves the support. <3",

I hope the game developers can properly address this problem, instead of requiring players to manually find the game's launcher file in their folder and change the \"Compatibility\" option to \"Disable Full-Screen Optimization\" to solve the issue. \nI have these complaints because many similar desktop games on Steam that I've played don't have this problem, so I believe the developers can and should properly handle this black screen issue.\n\nRemarks : If there are any solutions or updates to this problem (besides telling players to manually adjust compatibility), I will change my comment to positive.\n\nUpdate: The developers have released an update that automatically resolves this issue, fantastic! This is a really good idle game, highly recommended !!!",

There's not much gameplay outside of decorating your onsen and waiting to collect your coins, but don't let that deter you from trying it out!! If you've played Ropuka's Idle Island or Tiny Pasture this is a similar concept. ♡\n\nThe fact that there are [b][i]more than 8 different destinations[/i][/b] you can open your onsen at are very impressive, the gameplay and customization potential are very open for whatever aesthetic you are going for. Full coin refund upon bath/accessories deletion is a huge plus, so you never feel like you're losing progress. \n\nThis is a soothing pixel bar that is wonderful to have in your background as you're studying/working!! 8/10",
