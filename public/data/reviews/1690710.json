      "review": "A strange case of a game being underrated at Mostly Positive on steam. I'm not sure why this isn't heralded as one of the best incrementals of current year. Long term game with graphics and animations, with lots of interlinking complex systems that take time for the player to process and understand. I find this game to be unique because a lot of graphically enhanced incrementals tend to be very simplistic/gimmicky, and the genre in general has way too many games where you just watch numbers go up or perform a very simple routine of tier 1 resets followed by a slow push to tier 2 and so on with little thought or reason to what you're doing. IEH2 is refreshing because while it still has those tropes, there's a ton of other mechanics to interact with and lots of little \"ah hah\" moments as you piece together the bonuses you can get from everything and how you can progress faster. It's genuinely engaging stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe there's a lot of misconception that leads to people leaving negative reviews? There's a lot of content in the game but some stuff is openly labeled as WIP as opposed to just not being there at all. I think the learning curve is steep and people see that there are microtransactions and just use that as a excuse to not bother learning the game. After a few days I was able to start getting thousands of premium currency from dailies in addition to what the game was giving me for quests and quickly bought some useful QoL upgrades from the premium shop. It's very inoffensive once you get into the swing of things. I've seen some reviews claim the developer is abandoning the project, but I checked the discord and it looked like the dev was spending time moving into a new place, reassessing the state of the game, and is still relatively active? In any case, If you like the genre and value complex decision trees in your incrementals, you should download this and give it a shot.",
