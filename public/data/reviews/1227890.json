      "review": "After thinking about it, this is basically Boku no Natsuyasumi but Boku wants to bang any woman in a 5 mile radius of him that'll give him the time of day. I'd say that's probably an inspiration since the main character's default name is \"Boku\" but that's also just a generic Japanese boy's name so it could be a coincidence. Regardless, it's a very interesting take for an H game.\r\n\r\nAs just a game, it's a bit mid but leaning towards the mildly interesting side. Fundamentally this is a time management sim where you need to balance tasks that raise your affection with various girls, minigames to finish your homework (which gates affection), and things that make you money to buy supplies that make your life easier. You have 30 days, but functionally more like 25 due to scripted events, to do various things to create your memories for the summer. You have AP which lets you do tasks in a given time chunk, and 4 times chunks in a day to do actions in. With your only goal seemingly to increase your relationships there isn't a ton of pressure to be efficient, though slacking will limit the amount of content you have access. Even that doesn't really matter by the end though, as if you do a simple task over the course of 20 days you just unlock all content anyway, so you can kind of do whatever your heart tells you.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, I just want to mention that it feels crazy that all of this takes place in an RPG maker engine, I didn't know that was capable of these kinds of things but it worked out well probably 99% of the time. The menus are a little clunky to use and I feel like the whole game was like, darkened for some reason? But the RPG maker shell did not hamper the experience at all.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the content comes from the H stuff though of course, and this is definitely a wide spread of content. For reference, I played with the uncensored patch on (Very easy to find) and with DLC, and I'd say just the scripted H scenes amount to something like 6-8 hours of stuff to watch, it's kind of crazy. The art was all pretty good, the voice acting was solid, and they rarely went on for too long which is also nice. \r\nThe main issue I have with the H stuff is that this is through and through a shota game, which going in I wasn't really expecting so I was caught off guard by it. As much as the dialog wants to try and convince you that this is an 18 year old man, by the later half of the game that really starts to fall apart and you see it for what it is. To go with that, most of the higher relationship content starts to get really degenerate, which on one hand is kind of nice to cater to some of these audiences, on the other hand it can be pretty nasty to get thrown into a pee scene that you didn't consent to just because you got one of your gauges high enough.\r\n\r\nI won't say much more than that, my overall thoughts are that this is pretty decent for an H game. It distracted me from the horrors of reality for like 6 hours so I count that as a win these days. But if you're really adverse to degenerate/shota stuff I would recommend hiding this game on the store page and forgetting it exists.",

Each major character has their own habits, interests, and concerns, which are uncovered as the player participates in daily activities. Their arcs emphasize familiarity, warmth, and subtle growth, giving the story a grounded tone despite its game-like structure.\n\nGameplay revolves around a schedule system where players choose how to spend each part of the day—resting, exploring, helping others, or developing personal skills. These decisions influence character relationships and unlock new scenes. The mechanics are simple but effective, reinforcing the sense of living through a summer that slowly evolves based on the player’s choices.\n\nExploration includes small but detailed environments such as residential areas, local shops, and outdoor spaces. While the world is compact, it offers enough variety to make each day feel slightly different. Item collection and resource management add light strategic layers, ensuring that time allocation carries meaningful consequences without becoming overwhelming.\n\nPresentation uses bright, soft colors and expressive character illustrations that capture the relaxed mood of the season. Backgrounds reinforce the rural charm, while ambient sound effects—cicadas, breeze, light footsteps—help establish a convincing sense of place. The soundtrack consists of calm, repetitive themes that support the game’s meditative rhythm.\n\nSummer Memories succeeds by offering a quiet, routine-driven experience built around small interactions and regional atmosphere. Its appeal lies in its gentle pacing, its attention to everyday moments, and its focus on character familiarity rather than plot twists. For players seeking a reflective, slice-of-life simulation framed around summertime routines, it provides a cohesive and approachable experience.",

      "review": "After thinking about it, this is basically Boku no Natsuyasumi but Boku wants to bang any woman in a 5 mile radius of him that'll give him the time of day. I'd say that's probably an inspiration since the main character's default name is \"Boku\" but that's also just a generic Japanese boy's name so it could be a coincidence. Regardless, it's a very interesting take for an H game.\r\n\r\nAs just a game, it's a bit mid but leaning towards the mildly interesting side. Fundamentally this is a time management sim where you need to balance tasks that raise your affection with various girls, minigames to finish your homework (which gates affection), and things that make you money to buy supplies that make your life easier. You have 30 days, but functionally more like 25 due to scripted events, to do various things to create your memories for the summer. You have AP which lets you do tasks in a given time chunk, and 4 times chunks in a day to do actions in. With your only goal seemingly to increase your relationships there isn't a ton of pressure to be efficient, though slacking will limit the amount of content you have access. Even that doesn't really matter by the end though, as if you do a simple task over the course of 20 days you just unlock all content anyway, so you can kind of do whatever your heart tells you.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, I just want to mention that it feels crazy that all of this takes place in an RPG maker engine, I didn't know that was capable of these kinds of things but it worked out well probably 99% of the time. The menus are a little clunky to use and I feel like the whole game was like, darkened for some reason? But the RPG maker shell did not hamper the experience at all.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the content comes from the H stuff though of course, and this is definitely a wide spread of content. For reference, I played with the uncensored patch on (Very easy to find) and with DLC, and I'd say just the scripted H scenes amount to something like 6-8 hours of stuff to watch, it's kind of crazy. The art was all pretty good, the voice acting was solid, and they rarely went on for too long which is also nice. \r\nThe main issue I have with the H stuff is that this is through and through a shota game, which going in I wasn't really expecting so I was caught off guard by it. As much as the dialog wants to try and convince you that this is an 18 year old man, by the later half of the game that really starts to fall apart and you see it for what it is. To go with that, most of the higher relationship content starts to get really degenerate, which on one hand is kind of nice to cater to some of these audiences, on the other hand it can be pretty nasty to get thrown into a pee scene that you didn't consent to just because you got one of your gauges high enough.\r\n\r\nI won't say much more than that, my overall thoughts are that this is pretty decent for an H game. It distracted me from the horrors of reality for like 6 hours so I count that as a win these days. But if you're really adverse to degenerate/shota stuff I would recommend hiding this game on the store page and forgetting it exists.",

      "review": "I'm surprised this game has such a positive rating. I played almost all of the content and I can say it doesn't meet my bar for a good H game across several dimensions\r\n\r\n1. Art: art is very low budget. I was excited for an isomorphic pixelated slice-of-life trainer H-game but the pixel graphics aren't great and, more importantly, the H and key scenes are really drawings compared essentially everything else I've played.\r\n\r\n2. Variety of girls: Every girl except one is essentially the same body with a different head. They all have gigantic tits and wide hips. Even their personalities don't really come through much.\r\n\r\n3. SFX: the thrust and cum sounds are absolutely horrible and unnatural and ear piercing.\r\n\r\n4. UX: navigating menus (needing to double confirm things such as selecting items from the items menu so I can scroll through the... items... jfc!), playing minigames, interacting with H scenes. All of it was consistently jarring and make you feel hesitant the entire time you play\r\n\r\n5. Music: minimal music and what's there is extremely vanilla.\r\n\r\n6. NG+: I was looking forward to going through again to finish all the side characters and things. I clicked the red button in the memories area and inadvertently unlocked all H content and all girls and everything... All my personal progress was lost in this. Now I either have to choose to start 100% for a given NG+ option or 0%. My personal progress is completely gone. :(\r\n\r\nThe few positives were: VO was decent, amount of content is solid even if the content is pretty bad, premise.\r\n\r\nIn summary, again, I'm not sure why this game gets the credit it does. Seems significantly worse than H games from a decade ago let alone the quality of games these days.",
