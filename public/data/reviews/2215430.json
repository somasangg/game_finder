      "review": "I didn't really have expectations going into GoT, and for the first few hours it didn't blow me away. When the story properly kicks off, it is very good from a few hours in to the end. They deal with open world quest objectives in a creative way where the direction the wind blows in is the direction you're meant to go in. It's not in your face, it's not a compass with a big yellow arrow on it that says \"GO HERE\". All direction you're given feels more like guidance than telling you what to do. \n\nIt does suffer from the common problem in action games where the combat can feel shallow in the beginning, but as you get a grip of the mechanics and unlock more \"abilities\" you can mix up each fight massively. You switch between stances in a way that's not clunky, you have batman-like gadgets as well as your sword and bow, everything feels so fluid and smooth to use. When you get the ability that lets you use slow-mo when aiming your bow it becomes even more fluid where you can headshot multiple people from a few feet away in under a second the instantly throw down a smoke bomb and assassinate another two - it's more thrilling than I'm giving it credit for and that's just one of many \"techniques\" you can use. Ghost of Tsushima is what assassins creed has been trying to be, but Ghost does a far better job since the AC quests are quests where you tick a box by gathering an item or clearing out this camp of bandits or deliver this thing to this person - Ghost has absolutely none of the tedium. There are bandit (mongol) camps to clear out in quests but you're not doing it to retrieve an item, there is always a story justification or a character you're helping with a longer quest so it feels like it has purpose. \n\nI loved the second 2/3 of the story, but the first 1/3 does feel slow as there's a lot of travelling around meeting new characters and learning their stories. They're all very cool but traversal in the first chapter I felt was more tedious than the second two. I still enjoyed it a lot but the first chapter is the weakest in my opinion. Each character has it's own set of story quests to follow where you help them avenge someone or hunt someone down or something like that. Without spoiling I found Masako's quests to be a slog after the first couple. While she's a good character her story is the most generic (not bad). \n\nThe main antagonist is the leader of the mongol invasion, and his soldiers. The music is a cool mix of Mongolian throat singing and the type of music you'd expect in a Samurai game. It's a cool blend of cultures since the Mongols have already taken over certain areas and you get to see their culture next to the Japanese. I liked the enemy variety as well, the way that you deal with each enemy type keeps encounters fresh. \n\nThe DLC has a very cool story where you confront something which is mentioned in the main game several times, it fits into the base game very seamlessly and there is a good amount of content on the new island. \n\nOverall it's a nice breath of fresh air in a world of open world RPGs - it has some RPG elements but you're not levelling up and distributing your points. It's first and foremost an action game, and I think it deserves it's reputation as one of the best.",

I also love the story and Jin's conflicted nature about the rogue element of his combat style.\n\nThe main villains' barbarity was portrayed well. In one of my favorite games, Medieval Total War 2, and during the Medieval era the Mongols were the most ruthless enemies you could battle. Historically, they were such an existential threat that warring provinces in Eastern Europe called a truce with each other and banded together to drive them back to Asia.\n\nPeople have complained about this game's repetitiveness. Yes, sometimes the combat is somewhat repetitive, but to me it's the GOOD kind of repetitive. I'm not annoyed by it.\n\nWhenever I want to complete every task in a game you know that it has attained legendary status. I posted a \"top twenty video games\" list on my blog last year with games that ranged from the '80s to today. Now I want to revise it to include Ghost on it.",

There is nothing superfluous in the game, and that is precisely why it is so good.\nKey advantages:\n- An incredibly beautiful world. Its style, color palette, and landscapes create the feeling of a living work of art, not a game. \n- Combat. Moderately challenging, but very beautiful and realistic. It allows you to relax and calmly enjoy what is happening on the screen. I highly recommend playing on DualSense for an unforgettable experience.\n\nAs for objective shortcomings, I would highlight the plot. Ghost of Tsushima is clearly not a project that will hook you with its story. It's just there. It's neither good nor bad. A classic story of revenge and “gray morality.” But the game itself is not too long. So I don't think this is a problem for this game. \n\nI highly recommend playing this game. This project has made gaming history. Perhaps this will be a good reason to buy a PS5 Pro and Ghost of Yotei or wait for its PC port.",

The combat is fantastic and extremley fun to try and master while being difficult at times with how quick some enemies can catch you off guard on higher difficulties. Collectibles and points of intrest are a dream on this thanks to The Guiding Wind, makes everything straight forward with zero need for a guide to obtain 100% which is rare for some games due to obscure locations or \"You didnt check that box over there\" 50hrs ago and now you dont know what you are missing, The wind will be your guide everywhere. \n\nThe story + DLC was beautiful and I have no shame in saying it made me shed a tear, In sadness and joy, however at times I felt like the writing had forgotten itself and not in a really bad way, just little nit picks I had with some parts of the dialogue, but for the most part its one of the most gorgeous & satisfying games I have ever played and I cant recommend it enough. I already wish I could wipe my memory of it and experience it all again. I have no doubt I will return to it and play it \"one last time\" before Ghost Of Yotei gets released on PC\n\nOn a side note the game feels like a perfect mix of Assassains Creed and Just Cause (Liberation side of things) with the combat fluidity of the likes of the Batman series with every fight against a large group feeling like The bride against The Crazy 88 from Kill Bill,\n\nits for certain worth the full price but if you see it on sale and you are into Samurai/Japanese culture its a no brainer. The Island Of Tsushima is one of the best locations ive ever explored in a game, hopefully someday I will get to see it with my own two eyes.\n\nArigatou",

      "review": "I rarely give perfect scores, but Ghost of Tsushima deserves it.\n\nIn a genre saturated with cluttered maps and repetitive checklists, Ghost of Tsushima stands apart not by reinventing the wheel, but by perfecting it. It is a game that understands the value of silence, atmosphere, and the weight of a sword swing. It is not just an open-world game; it is a cinematic experience that pays homage to classic samurai cinema while telling a deeply personal story of sacrifice.\n\nThe Narrative: Honor vs. Necessity, At its core, the story is a poignant tragedy. It isn't simply about defeating the Mongol invasion; it is about the internal deconstruction of Jin Sakai. The writing brilliantly explores the conflict between rigid tradition (The Samurai Code) and the harsh reality of war (The Ghost). Watching Jin’s relationship with his uncle, Lord Shimura, slowly fracture is heartbreaking and is easily one of the best narrative arcs in modern gaming.\n\nThe most revolutionary aspect of this game is the lack of a intrusive HUD. Replacing a mini-map with the \"Guiding Wind\" changes the entire feel of exploration. Instead of staring at a compass in the corner of the screen, you are looking at the world itself—watching the grass bend and the leaves swirl. This immersion makes the island of Tsushima feel like a living character rather than just a backdrop.\n\nCombat is visceral, grounded, and incredibly satisfying. It strikes a perfect balance between accessibility and depth. The \"Stance\" system encourages tactical thinking, while the parry mechanics reward patience and precision. Every strike feels lethal. Whether you choose to face enemies head-on with an Honorable Standoff or strike from the shadows as the Ghost, the gameplay loop never gets stale.\n\nFor PC players, this port is nothing short of a miracle. It is exceptionally optimized. The addition of ultrawide support, unlocked framerates, and upscale technologies (DLSS/FSR) makes an already beautiful game look generational. It runs buttery smooth, proving that good optimization is still possible in 2024.\n\nGhost of Tsushima is a triumph of aesthetic and design. It is a love letter to feudal Japan and Kurosawa films. It reminds us that sometimes, to save what we hold dear, we must become something else entirely.\n\nPros:\n\nBreathtaking art direction and visuals.\n\n\"Guiding Wind\" is an immersive masterpiece.\n\nDeep, emotional storytelling and character development.\n\nSatisfying, rhythmic combat system.\n\nFlawless PC optimization.\n\nCons:\n\nSome open-world activities can feel slightly repetitive by the 40-hour mark.\n\nCutscenes are unskippable (on the first playthrough).\n\nScore: 10/10 “You have no honor.” “And you are a slave to it.”",

From the very first moment you draw your katana, the game pulls you into a breathtaking world of honor, duty, and sacrifice. Every duel feels personal, every swing deliberate. It’s not just combat, it’s art.\r\n\r\nThe island of Tsushima is stunning. Golden fields sway in the wind, storms roll across the mountains, and foxes lead you to shrines hidden in the forest. It’s so immersive that sometimes I just stop on horseback, watching the sunset and listening to the distant call of birds. You don’t just play Jin Sakai, you become him, torn between the code of the samurai and the necessity of the Ghost.\r\n\r\nThe swordplay is incredibly satisfying, precise, weighty, and rewarding. When you line up a perfect standoff, unsheathing your blade as enemies fall in one clean motion, you truly feel like a samurai. The sound design, the clashing steel, and the calm before each duel amplify that experience beautifully.\r\n\r\nWhat makes Ghost of Tsushima truly special is its respect for the samurai spirit. It’s not just about fighting, it’s about honor, heritage, and the quiet strength of discipline. By the end, you don’t just admire Jin’s journey, you live it.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve ever dreamed of walking the path of the samurai, Ghost of Tsushima is the closest you’ll ever get.

If you’re familiar with Destiny, imagine that style of multiplayer gear progression and raid structure, but with a far more enjoyable and less punishing grind. There are 2-player co-op missions, while 4-player teams can take on survival modes and full raids. The gearing loop feels natural and rewarding; real grinding only kicks in when you’re chasing high-end builds for each character class.\n\nOne of the biggest highlights: every cosmetic is free to unlock. No microtransaction traps, no battle pass FOMO—just actual gameplay challenges that reward you with new looks. In today’s gaming landscape, it feels almost nostalgic to play something this complete without being asked for your credit card every ten minutes.\n\nThe single-player surprised me, too. I’m not usually a solo-campaign player, but the multiplayer hooked me so hard that I gave it a shot, and the story so far has been genuinely solid and enjoyable.\n\nThe only sad part of this game is that I downloaded this on my steam deck and SteamOS does not let me connect to PSN to play online, which is my favorite part of this game.\n\nIn short, if you're on the fence: jump.

The soundtrack adds so much emotion—sometimes calm, sometimes heavy—and it really pulls you into the story.\n\nJin’s journey is simple but powerful, and the ending hits hard no matter what choice you make. It’s one of those finales that stays in your head after the credits roll.\n\nSure, a few side quests repeat, but the overall vibe, music, and story easily make up for it.\nIf you want an emotional samurai adventure with great atmosphere, this is it",

      "review": "Ghost of Tsushima is totally worth playing. People hype up the visuals and the samurai vibes a lot, and they’re right, but realistically, you have to go into it knowing it doesn't really reinvent the wheel. It’s basically a really polished version of the Assassin's Creed formula, just done way better than usual.\n\nThe coolest thing about it is actually the UI, or the fact that there basically isn't one. Instead of staring at a mini-map in the corner, you just swipe up and the wind guides you to your objective. It sounds like a gimmick, but it actually changes how you play because you stop looking at icons and start looking at the actual world, which is gorgeous.\n\nThe combat is super satisfying, too. If you're coming from something super hard like Sekiro, you might find it a bit easy, but the flow is incredible. You feel like a master swordsman right away. The stance system is basically just rock-paper-scissors depending on who you're fighting, but the animations and sound are so crunchy that it never really gets old. Ending a fight with a perfect parry just feels good every time.\n\nThe story is surprisingly grounded, too. It’s not some crazy fantasy thing; it’s just a war drama about this guy Jin having to break his samurai code to save his home. The conflict between him and his uncle about honor versus survival actually hits pretty hard.\n\nI will say, it definitely has that \"checklist\" feel where you're clearing camps and following foxes to shrines over and over. But honestly? It works because the game respects your time. Fast travel is instant, the loop is fluid, and it's just \"comfort food\" gaming. It’s not revolutionary, but it’s beautiful and fun, which is really all it needs to be.",

Overall, loved the minimal UI, which helps you to focus on exploring the world; and, the story is really something. However, the POI's are kinda low effort (except the bamboo and mountain shrines). The combat that people rave about is kind of a boring cousin of assassin's creed, rather than the Sekiro/Nioh relation people proclaimed. The Legends dlc felt like the dev team was playing a lot of destiny 2 at the time and REALLY wanted to make a Tsushima variant. It's... fine? A lot of the problems were rectified with the Iki Island dlc, so I can see they're going in the right direction. Excited for Yotei to come to PC!

Upgrades and techniques feel meaningful, and resource gathering is effortless even while riding. Stealth has that *Assassin’s Creed* vibe with satisfying death-from-above kills and clean silent takedowns.  \n[b]Exploration:[/b] Vast open world with shrines, fox dens, bamboo strikes, and hidden paths.

Legends Mode adds supernatural solo and co-op play, while the DLC expands Jin’s past with a new island and fresh story depth.  \n[b]Overall:[/b] A stunning, heartfelt samurai adventure that blends story, gameplay, and beauty into something unforgettable.  \n[/quote]\n\n[h1]Ghost of Tsushima - A Journey Beyond the Sword[/h1]  \n\nWhen I started *Ghost of Tsushima*, I thought it would be a straightforward samurai story, but it became so much more. The world feels alive, the pacing is perfect, and almost everything you do feels rewarding.  \n\nFast travel is almost instant, making exploration effortless. The combat hits a great balance between swordplay and stealth, and once you get used to the guiding wind mechanic, it feels natural. Stealth kills and aerial assassinations give that *Assassin’s Creed* feel but with more precision and grace, very samurai in execution.  \n\nI love how easy resource gathering is. You can collect materials while riding your horse without stopping, which keeps the flow going. Even slightly distant items get auto-collected, a small but great quality-of-life touch.  \n\nShrines reminded me of *Tomb Raider*, small climbing challenges that never get frustrating, just fun. Each climb feels like a short, rewarding detour.  \n\nThe only thing that threw me off early was the fog-of-war map. I initially thought I had to uncover every inch manually, but once I realized liberating red areas clears big sections, it all made sense. It ended up feeling pretty smooth and natural by the end.  \n\nThe story hits the right notes emotionally. You really feel the weight of Jin’s choices and his gradual shift between tradition and survival. Performances are excellent and the voice acting sells every moment.  \n\n[b]Note:[/b] The English voice acting is highly recommended. The lip sync and tone feel more natural here.  \n\n[spoiler]Yuriko’s death hit me the hardest. I saw it coming during her missions; her fading memories and gentle voice made it clear she was dying. It gave me *Red Dead Redemption* vibes. You know it is coming, but you cannot do anything. At least she went peacefully with Jin beside her.[/spoiler]\n\n[h2]🎴 Legends Mode[/h2]  \nAfter finishing the main story, I took a short break and tried *Legends Mode*. I expected a basic multiplayer, but it is packed with content. You can play solo or co-op, and it is darker and more supernatural, almost like an apocalyptic samurai world. It is fast, intense, and genuinely fun, with missions and challenges that keep you hooked.  \n\n[h2]🏝️ Iki Island DLC[/h2]  \nAs for the DLC, play it after the main story. It expands on Jin’s backstory, adds a whole new island, and offers more exploration and emotional storytelling. It fits perfectly with the tone of the main game and adds more depth overall.  \n\n[h2]✅ Pros[/h2]  \n[list]  \n[*] Beautiful world design and visual direction.  \n[*] Smooth, satisfying combat and stealth mechanics.  \n[*] Instant fast travel and seamless exploration.  \n[*] Shrine climbs and hidden paths feel adventurous.  \n[*] Meaningful side missions and strong NPC writing.  \n[*] Legends Mode keeps the game fun even post-story.  \n[*] DLC expands the story with new challenges.  \n[*] Excellent soundtrack and ambient atmosphere.  \n[/list]\n\n[h2]❌ Cons[/h2]  \n[list]  \n[*] Enemy variety can feel limited later in the game.  \n[*] Some side missions reuse familiar patterns.  \n[/list]\n\n[h2]⭐ Final Thoughts[/h2]  \n*Ghost of Tsushima* is one of those rare games that gets almost everything right. It is beautiful, emotional, and full of moments that stay with you long after you stop playing. The world feels alive, the gameplay never gets tiring, and the attention to detail is just incredible.  \n\nEven after finishing the main story, I still find myself exploring Tsushima, completing side quests, and diving into *Legends Mode*. A must-play for anyone who loves immersive worlds and meaningful adventures.  \n\nIf you are here for story and atmosphere, this game will stay with you.  \nIf you are here for combat and freedom, it delivers that too, effortlessly.",

In terms of the story, the first 2 acts were really really solid with Jin having very solid goals and ambitions but by act 3 it felt more like \"well I guess i'm just the ghost now\" which didn't leave a good taste in my mouth \r\n\r\nSpeaking of Jin, as mentioned the first two acts he was a very solid character, he started as the noble samurai with honor and glory and eventually turned into an honorless ninja of sorts but it never felt like he really wanted to be the ghost, it was just the most convenient option to save the most people. \r\n\r\nAlso, having the Iki island DLC be unlocked in Act 2 when it is enirely intentional to be a post Act 3 story is a bit crazy, yes, it's obvious that Jin was going to eventually kill the Khan, however, finding out things like Taka being dead before it happened in the story was not something I expected the game to do, spoiling your own story is really really weird \r\n\r\nGameplay is fine, a bit stale and repetitive towards the end when you fall into a flow of what's most optimal but that is to be the case in games like these, so can't complain too harshly \r\n\r\nBugs and glitches were very few if non existant, at most, I got caught for a few seconds on a bit of terrain but quickly get out of it, in terms of PC optimization this was done amazingly, absolutely no issues running the game for extended periods of time \r\n\r\nOverall, as stated earlier, this felt like the \"okayest\" game of all time, it didn't do anything amazing but neither did it do anything horrendously bad, don't purchase it at full price instead wait for a 20% or higher discount",

Every mission does feel a bit like a side quest, with the end being gaining a new ally but some of the random encounters you stumble across really do feel like you are saving a villager.

      "review": "I’m finally getting around to this a good five years after release, and honestly, I definitely slept on it. Is it as good as everyone hyped it up to be? Not really. But it is close, and still a damn good game so far.\r\n\r\nAt its core, Ghost of Tsushima feels pretty similar to a typical \"Ubisoft-style\" open world game. Big map, loads of missions, side objectives everywhere, random encounters popping up as you travel around. The difference is that this one actually has style, atmosphere and polish, because Ubisoft didn’t make it.\r\n\r\nGameplay and progression\r\n\r\nYou get everything from small sword fights to big group battles, ranged combat with bows, kunai and black powder bombs, stealth kills, distraction items, crafting upgrades, duels and all sorts of little activities around the island. There is always something happening.\r\n\r\nYou unlock a steady stream of skills and weapon upgrades as you go. New stances, abilities, ghost tools, armour sets with perks, charms, all that stuff. It creates a really solid loop of explore, fight, upgrade, get stronger. Nothing mind blowing, but very well put together, satisfying and fun.\r\n\r\nEnemy variety gets better as the game goes on. You start off with basic sword guys, then you get shield users, spear guys, brutes, archers, dogs and elite versions of most things. At the same time you get more tools and stances to deal with them, so the fights stay interesting instead of turning into mindless button mashing.\r\n\r\nThe one big issue is the mouse and keyboard controls. They are awkward. Switching to a controller is honestly night and day better. Combat feels great on flat ground, but it gets clunky whenever the terrain gets uneven. I have died so many times because I happened to be standing on a tiny rock the game treated like a three foot ledge and it refused to let me dodge or roll off it. Really frustrating.\r\n\r\nVisuals\r\n\r\nEven five years later the game looks incredible. Lighting, weather, landscapes, particle effects, forests, fields, storms, sunsets, everything looks amazing. Easily one of the best looking open world games out there, and the art direction carries it even harder than the graphics.\r\n\r\nStory and samurai portrayal\r\n\r\nThe story is solid enough and kept me interested. It focuses on the Mongol expansion and takes place on a large Japanese island. But the portrayal of samurai is very romanticised. If you know anything about real samurai history, it is obvious how heavily idealised everything is. Samurai were not noble heroes of honour and virtue, and the game absolutely leans into that myth.\r\n\r\nIt even reaches the point where the main character has a whole moral dilemma over using stealth, as if real samurai would be against quietly killing enemies. In reality they did much, much worse things to their own people, never mind invading Mongols.\r\n\r\nIt is not a deal breaker though. As its own fictional take on the idea of samurai, it works fine. The characters are not cringey, the dialogue is decent, and it gets surprisingly brutal at times, which is refreshing considering how toned down a lot of modern games feel these days.\r\n\r\nFinal thoughts\r\n\r\nApart from the clunky mouse and keyboard controls, some annoying terrain issues and the overly romanticised samurai angle, Ghost of Tsushima is genuinely fantastic. I am not usually into open world games like this, but this one pulled me in fast.\r\n\r\nA solid 9 out of 10 from someone who does not usually enjoy the genre.",

The game captures an incredible contrast between duty and morality, exploring what it truly means to be a guardian who protects others from an overwhelming new force.\r\n\r\nJin’s character growth throughout the main story is powerful and believable, showing his transformation as he struggles between the code of the samurai and the necessity of change. The addition of the Iki Island DLC expands on this perfectly, addressing some of the main story’s earlier gaps by exploring Jin’s past in a more personal and meaningful way. It adds emotional weight and context that ties back to the opening events of the game.\r\n\r\nThe world itself is stunning. From vibrant rolling fields to misty coastlines, every environment feels alive and handcrafted. The visuals, combined with immersive sound design and responsive combat, create a cinematic flow that’s both challenging and rewarding. The side content is engaging and meaningful, often contributing to character development or expanding the lore rather than feeling like filler.\r\n\r\nIn short: a great game, beautiful visuals, a compelling narrative, tight and responsive combat, and well-crafted side content with satisfying customization.",

      "review": "Personally I did not like Ghost of Tsushima at all. During maybe 10–20% of my playtime, I had a decent time and was looking forward to seeing what more there was to offer, but I just found nothing. The open world feels exactly like a Ubisoft game, with an absurd amount of POIs that you don’t have to complete but will try to for maybe the first half of the game, before realizing it’s all pointless. Camps are littered everywhere and are somewhat fun to engage with purely for the bit of combat they offer, but there are so many of them that they all start blending together and just get dull. The open world is beautiful though, for the most part, so I did appreciate that aspect.\r\n\r\nThe mission design is too generic and repeats itself way too often. I got annoyed by this maybe three hours in and it never got any better. It basically boils down to: arrive at the mission area, find someone to talk to, usually search an area or follow a trail, fight, talk again, and that’s it. Sometimes it dares to deviate from this incredibly experimental structure, but never enough to matter. I wouldn’t have minded it as much if it were only the side missions, but the main missions use the same formula. And those side missions are so barebones and empty, with maybe 5% worth doing at all, that I genuinely don’t understand why they were included. It’s all quantity over quality.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue is horrible as well. Most games already suffer from conversations feeling like characters are taking turns waiting for their cue, one short line at a time. But here it feels so fucking artificial. Add to that that 99% of the dialogue sounds like it was written by a chatbot that’s never heard real people speak, and the fact that you can’t skip it, and it becomes a chore every time anyone opens their mouth.\r\n\r\nThe combat is the only somewhat enjoyable part of this game for me, but you can master it after just five hours or less, and that’s not enough to carry it until the end. It feels like a Sekiro-like with extra gadgets tacked on to make it easier, combined with a basic stealth system that trivializes everything. It got boring fast.\r\n\r\nI could go on about things I didn’t like, such as the cheap-looking cutscenes, especially the awkward transitions, or the main story that could have been interesting but never digs into anything or takes risks. But I think that gets the point across.",

How to put this in reasonable take will sound like: the painting without brush or the art without heart. \n\nWhile the artistic visuals are breathtaking to look at and landscapes are pleasing to eyes there should be reason for you to be in there. Explore, thrive and heal the land…thats what I thought first until I played the game. \nThe story is not really that engaging or interesting. You got invaded by parasites but now you have to lead yourself for salvation and free your people but for what cause? For uncle to shame you for what you did and broke the samurai code. Some of the dialogues are middle written and doesn’t provide better quality. There are some of the side characters that you meet in your journey to help fight your battle but only two of them were somewhat interesting the rest were just braindead spoofs. \n\nSide content and combat itself for me where everything dived into deeps. There are no good side content. Run to the location, speak with poor soul, track some baddies and kill them. Rinse and repeat almost in every case there. Couple of character tales might get you invested in them but they panned out to long and give very little substance until you reach climax or final act. Mythic tales were amazing but they are very little of them like only 7 I think. Clean out this outpost. Go back to previous outpost and reclaim your freed people and thats it. Oh whats also not give points for that so for the order to upgrade yourself you have to collect this massive amount of “trash” lying everywhere near the houses or inside the houses. Like after few camps you feel more like garbage cleaner just running around like fool in circles and collecting these little things over and over again. Reaching secrets shrines was nice exercise figuring out where how how to get to the tops of the mountain. \n\nThe combat was very pleasing at first until I experienced it all after few hours. It became stale and predictable very fast. No matter what kind of stance you use the outcome is basically the same. So I used water stance for every encounter and waited to dodge their move and thats how I won every fight. Easy even on hard difficulty. Sure I could have used other stances but for what reason when the water stance did all the work just fine. The enemy encounters also lacked of challenge: first search for two archers kill them first and then the rest of your choosing. Next fight find two archers and then deal with the rest of your choosing. \n\nThe game that didn’t win me over.",

The main story also drags on about 10–15 hours longer than it needed to; I actually caught myself thinking, “Is it over yet?” which is rare for me.\n\nThe combat, though fun at first, becomes pretty simple and repetitive.

Calling for your horse and getting on it feels like an exploit speedrunners would use, not a legitimate game mechanic, because of the horses total disregard for the rules of space an time. Every one of the Ubisoft-like mechanics has one superficial counter to it. For example there’s no arrows on the ground showing you where to go to go, but the wind clearly blowing in that direction, wow immersion… It’s like they went «sorry for making a ubisoft game, we know you’re tired of them, so we made it as little cumbersome and as little annoying as possible». Why even bother making it then? I generally play a game to have fun, not to finish it as effectively as possible. And if I do it's by choice. Here it's designed into the game, because the devs were aware of the games fundamental flaws. It's almost paradoxical, like this game shouldn't exist like this. Well apparently it paid off, everyone ate it up and they even made a second part.\n\nThe open world as such is almost pointless, there’s rarely any payoff for exploration and curiosity (unless you consider 1% more health ten times over rewarding). There’s exceptions tough: the mongol history/culture tidbits were always cool to find and the bamboo stands are fun and actually pretty impactful for gameplay long term.\n\nThe artstyle and sound design is certainly unique, but not my thing. At times it felt exhausting to me, too much contrast, and bright colours. Sometimes, like in forests, it's even hard to see whats going on, because of all the contrast.\n\nIt’s not all bad of course, I did finish the game after all. The combat is really fun and a good challenge (playing on the second hardest difficulty). The overall combat experience carries the game. The main story is one of the better ones in games I think and there are some memorable characters and cool moments. The main theme of the story is something I haven’t seen before.\n\nOverall it’s a decent game, but if I would’ve known what i was in for I wouldn’t have bothered. I got tricked into believing this game is something it’s not by the general discourse around the release of the japan Assassins Creed.\n\nI’m playing Cyberpunk right now and it’s great how it feels like i’m playing a game again and not busy work between combat scenarios.",

Sure, a computer could parse that and adapt but I am not retraining my human brain for this game.\r\n\r\nThe next PC complaint is keymapping. \"But you can remap it!\" - sure. But they have divorced or combined certain functions in such a bizarre way that you cannot solve this issue via remapping. For example, block, heavy attack, and bow aim are all divorced from one another. You are guaranteed to have at least one of those keys end up in some goofball spot. It's just the math.\r\n\r\nOn to my other opinions - take these with a grain of salt given the minimal playtime. \r\n\r\nThis game feels really aware of the existence of AC Odyssey, RDR2, and Witcher 3, and it feels like it's trying to draw from all of them and falling awfully short. There are some (sort of) novel mechanics that sound cool, like finding fox dens and following a fox to charms (a type of item), but that got old halfway through the first one I found. Skyrim did that by accident and it was cooler. Using gusts of wind to point you to whatever you have waypointed was pretty neat, but not nearly enough to save this game.\r\n\r\nLike most Sony games, it is heavy on cutscenes, but the cutscenes (for as far as I got) were awful. My Sony points of comparison here are God of War and the Horizon games, which I think were both good games. They also had really good cutscenes within, like, 5 minutes of the game launching and did not stop. Ghost of Tsushima never started having good cutscenes, at least not within 2-3 hours.\r\n\r\nI do not recommend this game, at least not on PC, but probably still not even on Playstation. I would certainly recommend you first try out those other 3 older games I mentioned - AC Odyssey, RDR2, Witcher 3 - but that would also make this game feel even worse than it already is.",

      "review": "This game is so frustrating. On one hand, there is an incredible amount of polish and refinement put into certain things, but on the other core mechanics are fundamentally broken and don't work. The game is beautiful, the story is fleshed out, its never boring. There are almost zero loading screens, but opening the menu tanks the frame rate. Enemies regularly see you through solid objects while you're in stealth mode, and the combat inputs bug out and just stop responding altogether during combat. Attacking the correct enemy with the correct move/stance is very important, but there is no lock-on, so you frequently attack the wrong enemy during big fights. Sometimes instead of firing an arrow, you just drop your bow. There's lots of armor customization options, but very few match or look good together. The game will happily give you quest objectives to perform moves that you haven't unlocked yet. It's a fun game, but I wouldn't got around recommending it to people, because its going to make you frustrated if you get into it and start to notice the flaws everywhere. I'm going to try to finish it, but I'm not sure how far I'll make it if these issues persist.\n\nEDIT: This game has the most horsesh!t combat controls of any AAA game I've played in recent memory. I cannot stress how bad the controls are, and they get worse the longer you play. They put so much effort into the story, the characters, and environment,  just to take a massive steaming pile dump on the floor in the middle of the room as the game's centerpiece by having a fundamentally broken control scheme.",

      "review": "Marker upon map\nTemper your expectation\nSeason of boredom\n\nGhost of Tsushima opens with the classic battle of red laser vs. blue laser, er... I mean armor. You control Jinei, a fictional samurai perhaps loosely based on Sukesada or somehow supposed to be the Kamikaze, as he engages in a fully fictional retelling of the First Mongol Invasion of Japan. Sure, video game. Expect liberties, lots of liberties. This game largely feels like another Far Cry or modern Assassin's Creed, just with a different paint job. I wouldn't quite compare it to Witcher 3 or Horizon and certainly not to Skyrim. \n\nOpen world games are about exploration. For the game to be good, that exploration must feed into the narrative or otherwise be exciting. Ghost of Tsushima's exploration largely does neither of these things. Instead, you are generally led to flat and extremely incremental buffs. There's just no sense of wonder while running around. To make things worse, the game actively hinders exploration by not making you aware of nearby landmarks unless you stop to open your map (and discover that you passed a handful so you have to turn around). Though, I will admit that finding an Inari Shrine that lets you pet a fox is great. So Cute! Come here and let me pet you. *ahem*\n\nWhile running around, you'll find that this game also cannot decide what season it is. You have trees in full bloom (spring) and others with gold, orange, and red leaves falling (autumn). You have fireflies (early to mid summer) and chrysanthemums blooming (late summer and early autumn). Yes, these are part of the Japanese aesthetic, but they are for different times of the year and, aside from ephemeral beauty, hold different cultural meanings. Maybe they were some programmer's secret message that if this game were shorter, it would have been beautiful.\n\nThe other half of these games is beating things with sticks. Combat in Ghost of Tsushima is straight up deadly, just as you would hope from a samurai themed game. The stance switching for different kinds of opponents is really cool. Unfortunately, few of the unlocks for said stances (or almost any other technique) add anything interesting to the mix. Stances also suffer from using RT to swap, the same button for interaction, which means you might loot a corpse or crawl under a building when you are trying to change stances. This problem stems from trying to cram too many options into the controller. Sadly, the keyboard controls are not any better, as only minimal thought was given to the port.\n\nCombat is not helped by the limited variety of enemies. Until midgame, there's essentially just four, and they vary by armor and speed; after that, they add ronin, who are simply faster, better versions than you. This means that what starts as an interesting combat system quickly becomes stale. I am unsure if its a bug or some hidden lock on feature, but while fighting I could often myself facing the opposite direction and running backwards as I tried to charge or swing at a particular foe. \n\nAs gameplay is essentially broken into three modes (exploration, combat + stealth, and duels), the gear you use varies between all three. There is no penalty or inability for changing armor and charms at any time, so why not just codify gear sets that you can change to? It was obnoxious to be constantly swapping my gear when I went from combat to exploration and vice versa.\n\nAmidst all of this are silly annoyances. For instance, when the game tells you that you are entering an area with an overwhelming number of foes, it will just kill you with arrows out of nowhere even after you've sniped the archers. In another instance, a quest tells you to search both paths for clues of which to take, only there are no clues and you don't get the instruction to trail a cart until you are right on top of it and cannot avoid being noticed. In fact, the searching for clues moments during investigations is the most frustrating thing in the game.\n\nWhere the open world it disenchanting and the combat quickly stale, the game is lifted up by moments. To say that Ghost of Tsushima is inspired by the Kurosawa films I love would be an understatement. Heck, there's a Kurosawa mode that gives it B&W film grain and voice static. But this is felt more so in particular moments that the game presents, like when you are about to engage in a duel or participate in a key story beat, like the retaking of Castle Kaneda. If the game just strung these moments together, it would have been amazing. Instead, these moments are too infrequent to be truly effective.\n\nCentral to the plot is the representation of honor. I had wanted to wait until I finished Ghost of Tsushima before I really dove in here, but the game is boring enough that I don't know when that will be, and I think I see the trajectory. Honor is originally presented in a childishly simple way that I hated. Killing from the front, with a bow, or with bees is honorable, as is stealing from peasants. Only backstabbing seems to be dishonorable. Fortunately, as the game progresses, the truth comes out: honor is a tool of the powerful to maintain their power. It provides the veneer of civility while consolidating power to prevent challenge. That which is dishonorable is often that which the less powerful could use against those in power. At the time of this writing, we see our character's uncle chastising him for dishonorable means, which have been successful and raised his acclaim among the peasants. This makes you a threat to the uncle and will likely lead to a confrontation. Ghost of Tsushima matures into this framework to in fact offer an excellent portrayal.\n\nOverall, as much as I want to like this game, I cannot recommend it. Outside of its great moments, fox pets, and solid writing, it is boring. It is a game that tried to do a bit too much. Its open world exploration is disinteresting and its combat is ultimately stale. Sadly, those two items are the majority of the game.",
