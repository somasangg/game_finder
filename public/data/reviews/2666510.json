Easy to learn and play and generally satisfactory gameplay.\n\nThere's no progression to keep between new farms and I guess that's intentional, but I'd at least let you keep chips since they don't feel very impactful and you'd get more use out of some cool early-crop chips.\n\nThe berry bush / bees thing feels undercooked since it's just another way to get biofuel and berry bushes are the same just taking longer for more fuel.",

This game is pure gold and I wish that there where more chill games like this one that were part of a series or franchise! I still remember only having one 4x4 square of fertile area and just waiting to unlock Haiku! I didn't want any upgrades or improvements until I had my favorite character! (and I didn't even know what he did, I just wanted to unlock him!) The aforementioned game takes place before this one, and it was fun to see most characters reappear in this entry as well. For the price it's at this is a steal, and I wouldn't mind having to pay it again even if it wasn't on sale! My only regret is not buying the DLC for the game. I know it's only a skin, but I'd still do it to support the developer! The Achievement can be a bit boring at times (like for example, click the rotating gear 1,000 times) but still offer a nice goal after you've gotten bored! Can't wait to see more from this franchise! 10/10 :)",

      "review": "I've long used small games as a focus tool -- I remember having an ASCII tamagotchi on my desktop at my first office job. The advent of the desktop idler as a dedicated genre has been wonderful, and while it remains niche, it's a thriving genre with some really fun and interesting games (one day I will write my paper about the implications of the differences between desktop and mobile idlers, but I should probably do my actual work first...). \n\nRusty's Retirement broke subgenre containment and became a mainstream hit, and for good reason -- it's possibly the most complete, deep, and good-looking idler I've played, with excellent desktop features and adjustability. \n\nThe developer, Mr Morris Games, previously put out a metroidvania, Haiku, the Robot, which was an extremely derivative but still well-made love letter to hollow knight. The best thing Haiku had going for it, in my opinion, was its unique and cohesive visual style, and that continues into Rusty's Retirement, which draws from the character roster of Haiku and uses its fun and unique robot designs to springboard a design for a robo-organic look and feel that's both really original and really appealling. The game is also really huge -- there is just so much to unlock and do, and I appreciate all the automation options which let you make sure exactly what you want to happen is happening while you're doing other things. It strikes a good balance, even in the lategame, of having things be achievably unlockable while still giving you time to be away.\n\nIt's just a really lovely little game, and probably the best thing in the genre at the moment, especially for people like me who rely on these games day to day. Check it out if you're curious about the genre!",

It's great for when you're working or studying to get things on your farm going, and then taking a 5 minute break later to check on how things are going or start on new tasks. It's very relaxing and fun and offers so much for the price tag. I would recommend it at full price.

      "review": "A very chill little game that serves the important function of reminding us that it's okay to slow down a bit, from time to time.\r\n\r\nYou start off with Rusty, a retired killbot who's laid down his arms for good (or maybe he was an accountant or something - who's to say?), as well as his house, a water source, and a 4x4-tile field - as well as a biofuel converter gizmo.\r\n\r\nBy planting and harvesting crops, you collect currency, called \"spare parts\" and represented by a coin icon. Then, by bringing sets of three different crop types to your biofuel converter, you collect some of that as well. Both currencies are used for most construction, and biofuel is used to fuel the basic but potentially numerous helper bots you can plonk down to... well, help out. You can also build houses for various fellow robots to unlock a lot more possibilities, including bees and berry bushes, helper upgrades, decorations and whatnot.\r\n\r\nNew crop types are unlocked by growing a certain number of the crops available to you. It's for you to decide whether to focus on those crops, or ones with other useful qualities; growth time and water needed tend to go up more and more with more advanced crops, but so does harvest value, biofuel value and number of regrowths before new seeds need to be planted.\r\n\r\nRusty himself is pretty slow-moving. He can rest on a bench (if there is one) which seems to give him a little speed boost, but overall, he - and indeed the helper bots, and his buddy Haiku - could not be described as \"fast-moving\". [i]And that's okay.[/i] Yes, you can eventually upgrade the helper bots to be faster and carry more with each trip, but the spirit of this game is not so much about constant activity, as it is about planting some seeds, pondering what you'd like to do next, leaning back and watching things unfold slowly but steadily.\r\n\r\nIt somehow finds a sweet spot of calm, zen-like space-out gameplay, where other games all too often fall into a trap of speed controls and obsessive goal-focused gameplay and always being on the way to something, while never remaining anywhere long enough to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nThis game may not be a foolproof antidote to the bizarre state of stressed-out impatience we gamers seem to keep falling into, but it might just be a step in the right direction. A reminder, if nothing else, that it's okay - healthy, in fact - to just lean back, stretch out, and watch, sometimes.\r\n\r\nRecommended as a chill, relaxing experience.",

      "review": "[b]Overall Verdict: Highly Recommended (A Must-Have Desktop Game!)[/b]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nI absolutely [b]love[/b] this game. [i]Rusty's Retirement[/i] is not just an idle farming simulator; it's a [b]uniquely brilliant piece of desktop software[/b] that enhances everything else you do on your PC.\n\n[h3]Why It's a Game-Changer:[/h3]\n[list]\n[*] [b]Uniquely Designed for Multitasking:[/b] The core feature—having the game sit seamlessly on the bottom of your monitor—is a [b]major selling point[/b]. I mainly played it while [b]studying for classes or watching YouTube/shows[/b], and it provided the perfect, low-effort distraction.\n[*] [b]Satisfying Automation:[/b] The progression loop is incredibly rewarding. You start with manual work but quickly unlock and automate your farm with cute robots, allowing you to gradually shift to a true idle experience where you only make occasional, meaningful changes.\n[*] [b]Fun and Achievable Goals:[/b] Hunting for the achievements was a blast and gave me a reason to keep expanding and optimizing my little farm. It’s an overall unique and interesting game that's easy to lose hours in.\n[/list]\n\nI was so impressed by this title and its unique approach that I happily purchased the [b]Support Pack[/b] to back the developers. It also led me to check out their other game, [i]Haiku the Robot[/i], which shows the versatility of the studio.\n\nIf you are looking for a cozy, automated experience that won't take up your full screen and will keep you company while you work or browse, look no further. I will definitely be looking for games similar to this in the future!",
