The story was shit, and felt nothing like call of duty. I mean fight big plants and huge people is just not something I want to be doing in call of duty. Its just lazy and not well thought out.  \n\nas for the rest of the game, feels like every other cod, movement is a little faster this year, just like last year it was faster than the year before, guns are new but also feel the same as any other year, maps are new and still feels the same as every other year, nothing new or exciting. It may as well just be yet another season of the same game. COD hasn't been able to come out with anything that actually excites players in a long time, and this year is no different.",

That being said, haven't discovered a thesis for any easter eggs or stories yet.\nI recommend Black Ops 7, if you have a good PC, and just want to enjoy Black Ops like the good old days.\nFuck 60-70-80 dollar games though I will never get over this garbage",

Ahora la campaña sola, es un desastre total. \r\nSi solo te interesa como a todos, los modos multiplayer, la jugabilidad esta muy refinada mejor que nunca diria, aunque son siempre los mismos mapas y modos. Tendrian que agregar mas cosas nuevas pero no creo que lo hagan.\r\nTe obligan a activar el \"Secure Boot\" cosa que es al pedo, porque los chiteros estan igual, aveces se nota mucho.

Multiplayer and zombies both hit the spot, and the constant BF6 trash talk feels more like fanboy noise than anything real. Funny thing is, I’ve never heard CoD players go after Battlefield the same way.\n\nI own both games and, objectively, CoD is the one I keep coming back to. It’s polished, runs smoothly, and I haven’t hit a single bug or cheater so far. The gameplay is quick and satisfying, and every gun I’ve tried is actually fun instead of a painful grind. BF6 makes early weapons feel like a punishment and unlocking anything takes forever. Here, progression is fast and enjoyable. New guns, attachments, toys to play with, all without dumping 500 hours into the grind.\n\nThe maps are great and the walljump surprised me in the best way. I thought I’d hate it, but it feels fantastic. Overall, the game is just pure joy to play.\n\nInstead of listening to the usual CoD hate train, just try it yourself.

      "review": "Call of Duty Black Ops 7....  \n\nThe campaign is a absolute dumpster Fire. \n\nThe BO7 campaign is so bad it feels like it was written during a power outage using crayons. The story makes no sense. Every mission feels like a random TikTok edit glued together. Characters talk like they’re reading scripts they saw for the first time that same morning.\n\nThe bosses? Bullet sponges from hell. You could empty 12 magazines into one guy and he’s still alive giving speeches like he’s running for president. And the plot… bro. The plot is so confusing I needed a therapist after Mission 3. It’s not bad in a funny way. It’s bad in a “did I just waste hours of my life?” way.\n\nMultiplayer is straight up unplayable comedy.\n\nMultiplayer feels like the devs had a bet to see who could make the worst experience. The guns are either kill in one accidental hipfire, or take 30 bullets and a blood sacrifice. The spawns are so awful you’ll respawn directly inside somebody’s crosshair, like the game wants you to suffer. The maps look like someone typed “generic FPS level” into an AI and pressed enter.\n\nThe time to kill? Horrible. The footsteps? oh boi. The UI? Looks like a mobile game from 2014. Every match feels like you’re fighting the game more than the players.\n\n\nZombies is… okay.\n\nNot amazing, not special, its zombies. It’s like a decent microwave meal you don’t love it, but you’ll eat it. The farm map. Too small but fun. Other maps... Hope we get some DLC maps to save it. The guns are usable. Got the ray gun!\n\nThe mode doesn’t actively try to ruin your life. It’s the only mode where the game feels like it remembered it’s supposed to be fun. Not great, not iconic just barely keeping BO7 from being a crime.\n\nWhat really stings is I was actually hyped. A BO2 sequel? I thought we were finally getting a real comeback. Instead BO7 slid in. Stabbed me in the leg. Then the shoulder. Then grabbed a gun and shot me. (If you get the reference. You a real one.)",

It’s a game, so it gets silly sometimes, and that’s perfectly fine. The boss fights were a bold move and surprisingly well executed. They reminded me of classic single player shooters from the 2010s.\r\nMultiplayer is the main reason people buy Call of Duty, and this one delivers. Matchmaking is fast, lobbies are active, and the maps are a big improvement over BO6. Zombies also brings back that nostalgic fun.

The campaign is not as bad as the online discourse makes it appear, but isn't good either. It's somehow both a weird fever dream and quite bland, leaving a mess struggling to find its identity. The inability to pause in solo and lack of AI allies doesn't help. The multiplayer is a nice improvement over Black Ops 6, but not enough to justify the high price on its own. The campaign is a 5.5/10 and multiplayer is a 7/10.\n\nZombies is, in my opinion, the best part of Black Ops 7. Treyarch has addressed most of the shortcomings of last year's zombies. This includes removing special/elite enemy spam, adding actual atmosphere, rebalancing some augments, buffing weapons, and bringing back the classic points system in cursed mode. Ashes of the Damned is a great launch map and I'm excited for what's next. That being said, zombies is pretty similar to last year and feels like what Black Ops 6 should have been. Zombies is an 8/10 and the overall game is a 7/10. I do recommend the game if you're a die hard COD/Black Ops fan, especially for zombies, but I'd recommend buying on sale.",

It is surprisingly really well done and for the first time in a long time, I am having fun in a Call of Duty title. It is definitely not BO2, but it does have the BO2 aesthetic and I honestly love that. \r\n\r\nThe omni-movement is cool with being able to sprint in any direction. I still think the tactical slide is too fast and do not like how fast people are able to zip around the map, but I personally am able to overlook it. The wall bounce isn't too crazy. Nothing bad to really say about it. \r\n\r\nWith SBMM being removed, I don't feel like I have to put a sweat band on and gear up for the COD Olympics every time I press \"Find Match\". I am actually dropping kills and having a great time. Some games I fry, some games I get fried. \r\n\r\nTTK feels good. I feel comfortable taking 1vX fights and winning them. With that being said, gunplay also feels good and feels smooth. \r\n\r\nAgain, I was very against purchasing another Call of Duty and had already planned on playing Battlefield 6 to get my fill of a competitive shooter, but I am actually glad I bought this game. Overall I give the multiplayer a 7.5 or 8 out of 10. I just hope the game will stay level and not go crazy with skins, tracers, and operators. Keep bringing COD back to a level ground and stay away from the Fortnite BS. \r\n\r\nAlso, classic BO2 guns and weapon skins are in the game. That's pretty sick. Well done on that front.",

Since I can't stand those animated, neon-bright skins or goofy tracer bullets, the shop has been irrelevant to me for years anyway.\n\nMultiplayer;\nThis game is a joke. Not even a funny one. A straight up scam level experience that pretends to be ''fair'' and ''Ping is King'' while manipulating everything behind the scenes. Fake lag, manipulated ping, SBMM on steroids. The game literally decides how well you are allowed to play. Your connection is not based on your region or server quality. It is based on what bracket the algorithm throws you into. Low MMR accounts get perfect lobbies with perfect ping. High MMR players get sent to garbage servers with unstable hitreg. This is not matchmaking, this is a controlled environment that pushes you up and down depending on what Activision wants your stats to look like. SBMM is worse than ever.\nIt feels like you are being punished for every good match. One decent game and the next three are sweat fests filled with reverse boosters, broken hitreg and delayed shots.

The guns are terrible, the maps are terrible, the movement is somehow more sluggish even with wall-running, and everyone you fight is guaranteed to be using a cronus. \n\nIf you're wanting to play the campaign - don't bother, it's slop\n\nIf you're wanting to play Zombies - don't bother, it's slop. And to add to that, why are there vehicles in Zombies? This is such a terrible idea and it feels awful to play. \n\nIf you're wanting to play Multiplayer - DO NOT BOTHER- IT IS SLOP - Even BO4 and 6 felt better to play than this. ALSO there is somehow major lag sutters from packetloss that freeze your game at least 3 times a match. I have 1BG/s internet speeds and felt like I was playing with 10Mb/s speeds on BO2. This is pathetic and a waste of time and money. \n\nMy score? 1/10, as a longtime COD fan since COD 3, this is a complete slap in the face.

I've never cheated in my life and got banned on November 13, a day before the launch of Black Ops 7. I'm incredibly frustrated and I won't ever support this franchise again.\n\nEdit: as of today, november 13, 2025, 6:33 PM local time, Steam \"removed the incorrectly applied In-Game Ban on Behalf of the Call of Duty team.\" I'm keeping this as a negative review until further notice, because I feel like this could happen again.

There are $2 indie games made by one person with more effort and heart put into them than this.\nIf you play solo be prepared to have zero AI companions but be forced to listen to their scripted dialogue for some reason.\n\"Help I'm pinned down!!\"\nNo mf you're not even present.\n\nBlood monsters, Blood plants, Zombies, 40 ft. tall machetes, 100 ft. tall bossfight, mechs and the same cutscene 3 times in a row showing prosthetic woman shooting Kagan with the rocket launcher.\nTo touch more on that...wtf even are these bossfights? Imagine someone making \"Baby's First Bossfight\" and this is what you get. There are so incredibly easy and are so scripted on how to complete them it's laughable. Don't bother shooting any of the bosses, just wait for the killstreak or box you can loot with the rocket launcher or airstrike, because that's how you're ACTUALLY supposed to kill the bosses. What's the point of this? You can spend 20 mins trying to p*ssyfoot with the bosses, or kill them all within 5 minutes just with the killstreaks?\nThe bosses have at most 2 things you need to watch out for, all of which are telegraphed to you. Oh no the guy is about to slam the ground guess i need to jump twice...oh no his mouth is open, guess he's gonna shoot bombs......bruh.\n\nThe way you kill the one boss with the machete is the same design for every other boss. They give you the item to accomplish it, and you never run out. It's on you how long you wanna d*ck around with the stupid bosses or not.\n\nThe MP is pretty decent, the maps are alright...some are kinda a little too big for the player count imo (leading to lots of dead time running) zombies is alright but probably more tedious than it really needs to be.\n\nI'm honestly glad to see CoD failing so badly now. Maybe it'll shock the \"too big to fail\" comfortable mentality of Activision.

      "review": "This franchise has already been going downhill for many years at this point, but what I didn’t expect was for them to reach a new level of low. An unreachable level of low that I thought wouldn’t be attainable by any game developers. I’ve honestly never seen a piece of media this bad. I’ve seen 42cent hentai games with more value and better gameplay than the recent Call of Duty titles. I don’t know what happened to COD. It looks like they saw the success of Fortnite and tried to copy it, but failed miserably. And if you still think COD is good… that’s a sign of denial.\nFirst, the COD launcher is miserable in every way. It takes a PhD to navigate the menus every time I want to play. The game restarts three times before putting me in a lobby. There are useless game modes. It “installs shaders” for 10 minutes every time I launch it. The optimization is terrible. It’s always online with no offline mode. There’s an 80 GB update every two weeks. Worst graphic every new release. Fake promises, 93 CAD$ for DLCs… and much more. I didn’t even know a new COD was released until I saw a video titled “Black Ops 7 is Embarrassing”, which it is. Actually, BO7 is more than embarrassing. Like I said, it’s the most utter piece of garbage I’ve seen. Let’s start with this: the game was made with AI. Let’s not sugarcoat it. We know for a fact that the entire art used in the game, especially in multiplayer, was made with AI. Pretty shameful for a game that supposedly took years to develop and had thousands of employees on the project. And I don’t think it’s just the art, it feels like the entire game. This includes multiplayer and definitely the campaign. And they want me to pay 93 CAD$ for that? Lmfao.\n\nConcerning the multiplayer: the franchise hasn’t had actual new content since Modern Warfare 2019 (the reboot), which was more than six years ago. In 2019 they added new movements, graphics, maps, mechanics, new modes, rebooted the MW series, and more. After 2019, they haven’t added a single new thing. They just take the same formula from 2019 and copy-paste it each year, changing absolutely nothing except reskinning old maps and weapons. Then they slap a new number on the box to pump out quick cash. Let’s not forget they promised the original MW2 maps in the 2022 reboot and didn’t deliver. If you want to play them, you have to pay 93 CAD$ for a DLC. Call of Duty was supposed to be a military arcade shooter. Nowadays you see Nicki Minaj slide cancelling across the map. Like what is this? Fortnite? By the way, I bought the Snoop Dogg bundle back in Warzone 1, and when they switched to Warzone 2 they deleted all the skins. Thanks, Infinity Scam! And that brings me to the elephant in the room: Warzone. Why does everything have to be tied to your trash battle royale? The campaign is related, the multiplayer is related, even zombies is related. Why? Oh, right. Money...\n\nAs for the campaign, it used to be about military operations, like Black Ops, which focused on missions with high levels of secrecy. Now we have Call of Dookie: Skibidi Toilet 7, where the protagonist is on the world’s biggest acid trip. How much acid did yall take? In the past we had black-ops missions; now we have openly taking acid, zombies fighting on your side, and giant hallucinations straight out of Skibidi Toilet. Jesus. Black Ops 7 is making COD Vanguard look like a saint. BO7 aside, MW2019, MW2022, and Black Ops Cold War were all solid campaigns.\n\nI just hope that one day this franchise comes back to its roots and stops trying to be a wannabe Fortnite.",

It doesn’t feel fair or skill-based, it just feels cheap.\r\n\r\nMatchmaking is a disaster. You either stomp or get stomped, with very little in between. It often feels like the game throws you into completely random lobbies instead of anything based on skill.\r\n\r\nHit detection / netcode is irritating. In some replays you can clearly see bullets going straight through enemies without doing any damage. I even had a rocket launcher shot pass through someone without taking any damage. That kind of thing completely kills the fun.\r\n\r\nTo be fair, performance is good, and Zombies is actually pretty fun. Those parts show that there is a good game hiding in here somewhere.\r\n\r\nBut my big question is: how can Call of Duty, after so many games, still release something with balancing this bad?

Please and thank you.\n\n-The game now at this state is solid 3/10\nWon't play again if endgame is fixed and I am a cod glazer so yeah, if I could I would refund.",

Been playing basically every year for many many years by now, but I think I need to take a step back and maybe leave CoD alone for a while.\n\nLearning of the heavily AI-generated content I'm being sold alongside the entirety of the Campaign (Honestly half the reason I ever buy a CoD, the other half is Multiplayer) had me saying words I've never uttered aloud while holding my head. \"What the fuck is this writing? What?\" The entire campaign is just, awful, and the Endgame game mode is stuck behind completing it. Cool in WAW more than a decade ago for something genuinely new, not nowadays with it being Black Ops DMZ; especially with such a shit campaign. I do not say that lightly; I know everyone's been dogging on it. It's warranted.\n\nThe Zombies? I'm not playing it; it's just BO6 Zombies and I didn't even play that. Of course I won't touch that shit. \n\nI know I dumped at least like 17 hours into BO7 by now alongside getting two guns to Shattered Gold, but I'm really just, regretting my purchase with it. Maybe if it went on an extreme sale, but it is far under my expectations for a at-the-end-of-the-day multi-trillion dollar company. I'm sure I'll get that itch for this game specifically after playing it here and there, but not an itch worth $70. I didn't think I'd spend $70 on a game in which I would play only 1 of the 3 whole experiences they give when I've played everything every year. I didn't wanna be a Battlefield man, but the fates call my name. \n\nIf I can't get a refund, I kinda understand, but at least you'd know I regret my purchase; oh and I'll likely be vocal and summarize what I said here in a review in it. Thank you Steam Reviewer #8008135.\"",

The FPS genre has become too big and AAA developers try to make a game for everyone which 95% of the time does not work. Instead of the focus being fun, we have shifted the focus to making money, which I understand, this is a business. But in the modern era of entertainment, we try to make art that isn't enjoyable but brings in the most social media clicks and money instead of bringing happiness. I have finally given up on Call of Duty ever being as great as it was.

Today, it feels like a factory product—rushed, uninspired, and stuck in a loop of repeating the same mistakes year after year.\r\n\r\nMultiplayer:\r\nThe multiplayer is a mess. The time-to-kill is absurdly low, movement feels stiff yet chaotic at the same time, and the map design ranges from painfully linear corridors to empty, oversized spaces with no real flow. Skill-Based Matchmaking turns every match into a sweaty tournament instead of something fun.\r\n\r\nWarzone:\r\nWarzone is drowning in bugs, lag spikes, broken hit detection and questionable balance decisions. Looting feels inconsistent, gunfights feel random, and cheaters still ruin entire matches despite years of promises.\r\n\r\nContent & Monetization:\r\nInstead of meaningful content, we get overpriced skins, crossover bundles that don’t fit the game at all, and recycled ideas disguised as “new seasons.” Features get removed, reintroduced, changed again, or simply forgotten. Nothing feels stable or coherent.\r\n\r\nTechnical Issues:\r\nCrashes, server instability, poor optimization—these problems appear every single year. For a AAA franchise, it’s unacceptable.\r\n\r\nAnd Black Ops 7? Just as bad.\r\n\r\nBlack Ops 7 was hyped as a “return to form,” but it delivers the same recycled gameplay, shallow design, and technical problems as the rest. It adds nothing new, fixes next to nothing, and feels like a copy-paste of previous titles with a fresh coat of paint.\r\nIt’s disappointing, predictable, and absolutely not worth the price tag.\r\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\r\n\r\nCall of Duty is no longer a passionate shooter experience—it’s a yearly product pumped out with minimal effort. If you’re looking for fun, creativity or quality, Black Ops 7 and the entire current CoD lineup will only leave you frustrated.",

Apparently even that was asking too much.\r\n\r\nThe campaign feels like it was written by three interns who weren’t allowed to talk to each other. One mission is super-serious “the world is ending,” and the next one has you riding a robot dog into a neon taco factory. I genuinely thought my game glitched, but no—turns out that’s just the “tone.”\r\n\r\nThe multiplayer? Oh boy. Imagine taking everything people enjoyed about Black Ops 2 and throwing it into a blender with a handful of broken glass and a Wi-Fi outage. The spawns are so bad I think I respawned behind myself at one point. The time-to-kill is so inconsistent that sometimes I unload a full mag and die instantly, and other times I sneeze in someone’s direction and they evaporate.\r\n\r\nAnd do NOT get me started on the microtransactions. I opened a $20 “Ultra-Epic-Premium-Quantum Bundle” and got… a charm. A charm shaped like a potato. Not even a cool potato. Just a potato-potato.\r\n\r\nThe graphics look great if you enjoy constant texture pop-in and characters whose faces load three seconds after their dialogue. It’s like watching a PS5 try to cos-play as a PS2.\r\n\r\nOverall, Black Ops 7 feels less like a game and more like a dare.\r\nA dare I regret accepting.",

      "review": "Call of Duty Black Ops 7 is probably the most disappointed I've been in a COD game. I'm going to split this review into sections so that it's easier to read.\n\nCampaign\n\nLet me keep this short. This is the worst campaign since BO3. The story focuses to much on the Cradle to create psychedelic experiences. This is the majority of the campaign. \n\nSPOLIER WARNING HERE! \n\nIt disrespects BOII, and de-canonizes parts of it. For those who may not remember, either Harper or Karma has to die. If you save Harper in BOII, Farid is killed, thus Karma is killed by Salazar. If you kill Harper, Karma is saved because Farid takes the hit for her. So what I want to know is, how are they both alive. There's missions referencing BOII, and there are constant call backs to it, but this plot hole is not ok. The only way I can make sense of it, is that the bullet that hits Karma didn't actually kill her, and she survived, that's all I got, and I feel like I'm grasping at straws.\n\nSPOLIER OVER!\n\nAnother issue with campaign is that it's co-op only, and if you try to play alone, your character will be there, but your squad mates will not. Your squad mates will still talk to you, but they're nowhere to be seen if you play alone. This goes for co-op too, if you don't have four people in a lobby, a character will be missing, but will appear in cutscenes, and speak as if they are actually there. This is extremely jarring to say the least. The only good thing to come out of the campaign this year is the cross weapon progression, that's really it. I didn't care for Endgame as it's just not for me. Overall, Campaign is a complete waste of time.\n\nMultiplayer\n\nMultiplayer is fun for the most part, but I can't help feeling some of the changes made negatively impact the experience. Auto Aim has been so nerfed it can be hard to line up shots a lot of the time (This is getting buffed in the season 1 update). Right now though I feel like controller is at a major disadvantage. I do agree that Aim Assist is the weakest it's been in the franchise, which means that as always, keyboard and mouse have a major advantage. Did it need a nerf last year, sure I can't argue that, but this was way to much. Another issue is the matchmaking. I get people are excited that it's open now, but for me this has really hurt my experience. As a person with low vision and CP, my reaction and reflexes are slower, SBMM helped in this area because I could play with those who were of similar skill level, allowing me to contribute to my team. Before anyone says it in the comments, yes there is a standard matchmaking option, but it's clear it's going to be secondary to open matchmaking. More specifically they just added the Nuketown playlist to open, but standard is still just core moshpit. This is an issue because while Nuketown will appear in the map rotation, it isn't a playlist we can select in standard matchmaking. This means that anyone who wants SBMM for a more even playing field won't get it. For me personally, that means I won't be able to help my team and that just hurts. I'm glad both playlists are there, but standard needs love too. Why can't Nuketown 24/7 be in both playlists? It just doesn't make sense to me. I also am not really enjoying the weapon camo grind. Getting to prestige master for me hasn't been the best experience, partly because of what I mentioned above. I know this could change with some updates, but right now I can't say I've enjoyed the multiplayer to it's fullest, physically because I can't.\n\nZombies\n\nI'm not much of a zombies player anymore, but I'm glad survival is back. I fell in love with zombies because it was about getting to as high of a round as you could. I don't enjoy the standard, or even directed mode. I miss the days where it was just kill zombies. What I will say though is the power situation in solo play is not great. If you play solo you have to shoot the skulls to destroy them, then you can turn on the power. I find this to not be very fun, and I feel it just adds needless filler to what your trying to do. It's fine in a group, but for solo it really has got to go. I do enjoy the map however as it does remind me of farm from BOII. That's all I really have to say on zombies. Like i said not much of a zombies player anymore.\n\nConclusion\n\nBO7 has a lot of fun ideas. It's great to see BO2 characters again like David and Harper. The campaign is completely not worth anything, I believe it shouldn't even be cannon, it makes no sense, and the forced co-op takes away from what a campaign is. It could be remedied by allowing us to play with bots, but who knows if that will happen. Not to mention needing to always be online is just not ok.\n\nMultiplayer is fun, but them not updating the standard playlist saddens me. I'm glad it's open for those who want it open, but I feel like people like me are going to struggle this year because of factors out of our control. I don't write about my disabilities for pity, but I want to stress the point that SBMM helped me play too. I know standard exists, but it's clear it won't be getting the new playlists like open will. (Hope I'm wrong on this in the future).\n\nZombies is fun, but I feel some changes need to be made for it to be more enjoyable across the board. (Zombies is also getting some changes in the season 1 update).\n\nThere's my thoughts on the game as a whole.\n\nI WILL UPDATE MY REVIEW IF THINGS CHANGE!\n\n**NOTE I AM STILL GOING TO BE PLAYING IT!
