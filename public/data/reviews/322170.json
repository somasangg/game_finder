Im nearing 3k hours and i just LOVE this game! all the old people wanting to connect with children is a trait i agree with in this games vast and overwhelmingly greasy player base! I play this game for 15 hours every day, its all i do! I wake up in my puddle of baby batter from last night and get on to play GEOMETRY DASH for the next 15 hours and yell at my family who want me to 'shower' and 'eat something that isnt canned'. But my life is super fulfilling because i have my miku body pillow with me all the time. She loves me for who i am with all the dried yogurt and babies included, and i love to play my GEOMETRY DASH with her EVERY DAY.",

I thought I was banned, but the Boomlings website itself works perfectly fine for me, and I haven't received any complaints about rule violations. I can even see that I'm on the global leaderboard, which proves I'm not banned.\n\nEither the saving feature itself works extremely poorly... Why not use Steam Cloud? Because saving my account, which, mind you, is only 5 megabytes, would be saved much faster than your current saving system, which has stopped saving my progress.\n\nThe level editor itself is also quite and extremely good, but there are moments that cause irritation rather than enjoyment of the creation process.\nI'm not talking about visual bugs that don't really change anything literally; we can keep quiet about them and happily ignore them. But I'm talking about bugs that are irritating and you don't understand what the problem is, only to find out the problem was the editor's lack of polish. And you don't get satisfaction from solving the problem, but rather irritation that the fault wasn't yours, but that the developer apparently doesn't want to fix this bug. At the very least, the last patch came out a year ago, so it seems the developer simply doesn't care about fixing those issues that irritate the user, which is very unpleasant, actually.\n\nLevel Ratings\nI would also complain about the developer rating levels poorly, but recently I realized that this might be partly the right decision.\n\nI am often annoyed that, for example, an Easy level in the game is essentially Auto, where you make a couple of jumps and that's it.\nOr that an Insane level feels more like a Hard, Harder level.\nI would like to say that it's strange how the level ratings are based on a very strange premise.\n\nThink about it - Hard literally means a \"difficult\" level, right? So why does it feel like I'm playing something on the level of Back on Track?\nAnd I'm saying this as a casual player, not a hardcore one, so I was interested in the reason for this strangeness.\n\nIn the end, I understood the reason for the strange ratings.\nSince the game is rated 3+, RobTop is ensuring safety for children who would see the game and try to play it. If a child is very impatient, they might break their computer or tablet out of frustration. If I were a parent and saw such a situation, I would be quite unhappy with the result that my child found some silly game and sacrificed a gadget. Therefore, RobTop decided to make the rating system safe and made it extremely casual, specifically for children aged 3+.\n\nThe true level rating system exists in the Map Packs, where you can indeed see many people dissatisfied that an \"Easy\" level is difficult for them. Or that a \"Hard\" level is truly Hard, not Easy.\nIt's a pity that Map Packs are an extremely underrated feature, because that's where you find genuine criticism of levels that were rated as excellent. But now the rating system is set to poor quality... a shame.\n\n\n6/10* I am essentially satisfied with the game, but these minuses are extremely disappointing to me :(",

I've verified that I have the correct email, username, etc, and I've reset the password multiple times, and gone through all of the other relevant troubleshooting steps, and all it ever gives me is \"login failed\".  I know the old account still exists because I've had my friends look it up and verify it.  I even joined the official discord and opened a support ticket on the matter.... two weeks ago...\nthe only response I got was a staff member replying \"I don't tackle account issues much\"\nI've seen multiple other similar tickets opened in the time since and ALL of them have been ignored.  This isn't just a \"me problem\", its an issue with the login system.\n\nI'd love to be able to submit a positive review, but I remember this system being problematic and broken last time I played it, too, over ten years ago.

Unfortunately, none of that matters when the game consistently fails at the most basic requirement of its genre: reading your inputs.\r\n\r\nI’m playing on a $200 keyboard, and yet Geometry Dash regularly acts like I’m using a bargain-bin controller from 2004. Simple, precise taps—especially on orbs—just don’t register. You hit the spacebar or click exactly when you’re supposed to, and the game just… ignores it. No jump, no feedback, nothing. In a game where success depends on frame-perfect timing, having inputs vanish into the void makes many levels feel less like a test of skill and more like an exercise in pure frustration.\r\n\r\nMiss a timing because you messed up? Fine, that’s on you.\r\nMiss a timing because the game decided your input wasn’t good enough for reasons unknown? Completely unacceptable.\r\n\r\nWhat’s worse is that these input issues aren’t rare. They happen regularly enough to ruin the experience—even on official levels. It’s hard to enjoy a rhythm-based platformer when the rhythm between your fingers and the game is constantly out of sync.\r\n\r\nGeometry Dash could be great, but until it stops ghosting my inputs like a bad relationship, it's staying firmly in the “unplayable” category for me.",
