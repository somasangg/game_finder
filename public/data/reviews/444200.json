      "review": "World of Tanks is a solid game to drop into when you have some time to kill, but it's not a must-play masterpiece.\r\n\r\nThe tank combat is genuinely engaging—it has enough tactical depth with its armor angling and spotting mechanics to make you feel smart when you pull off a good play, and the enormous variety of historical tanks means there's always something new to unlock. The thrill of grinding up a tech tree and finally earning that coveted Tier X is a great feeling.\r\n\r\nHowever, be warned that the experience is highly inconsistent. It's often frustrating due to seemingly random shot dispersion and shell non-penetrations, and the lengthy grind in the later tiers is clearly structured to encourage you to spend real money. If you can approach it casually, laugh off the losses, and just enjoy piloting those awesome tanks, you'll have fun. But if you're looking for the most competitive or best-balanced experience on Steam, this isn't it.",

As queueing with more than 3 friends would be terrific. I do have to mention, please be really careful what you buy here, it is a gacha game to an extent and its very easy to fall into a spending loophole. Only spend what you can afford to loose.",

Despite being designed for shorter matches, the game retains the strategic depth of the original PC version, offering a satisfying mix of positioning, teamwork, and decision-making.\n\nThe variety of tanks — from nimble light vehicles to heavy armored beasts — allows every player to find a style that suits them. Progression feels rewarding, and the constant updates, events, and new tech trees keep the game fresh and engaging.\n\nControls are smooth and responsive, matchmaking is generally fair, and the 7v7 battles are perfectly tuned for mobile play without sacrificing intensity.\n\nOverall, World of Tanks Blitz stands out as one of the best mobile action-strategy games, delivering both casual fun and competitive depth for players of all skill levels.",

      "review": "World of Tanks Blitz  справді захоплива й динамічна гра. У ній є та сама атмосфера напруги та драйву, через яку постійно хочеться зіграти «ще один бій», whether ти на перерві, у дорозі чи просто маєш кілька вільних хвилин. Але попри всі переваги, є речі, які вже давно дратують багатьох гравців.\n\nПо-перше, ціни на коробки в грі занадто високі. Чимало гравців скаржаться, що навіть після значних витрат отримують майже нічого корисного. Це неприємно  вкладати гроші й зрештою отримувати нагороду, яка практично нічого не варта. Сподіваєшся на чесний шанс, а виходить як лотерея без виграшу.\n\nПо-друге, є технічні проблеми. Іноді пінг різко стрибає без видимої причини, FPS падає в найвідповідальніший момент, і весь бій псується. Таке трапляється не завжди, але достатньо часто, щоб нервувати. Крім того, підбір команд інколи ставить разом гравців так, що команда розсипається менш ніж за хвилину, і в тебе фактично немає можливості вплинути на результат, навіть якщо ти граєш максимально добре.\n\nПопри все це, гра має великий потенціал. Щоб зробити її по-справжньому кращою, розробникам варто якнайшвидше звернути увагу на такі речі: стабільніший пінг, кращу оптимізацію FPS, чесні й прогнозовані нагороди, покращений матчмейкінг, менше елементів pay-to-win, збалансованіші команди, змістовні сезонні оновлення, менш виснажливий прогрес, кращу підтримку слабших пристроїв і, звісно, адекватніші ціни на коробки. Усе це суттєво підняло б якість гри.\n\nДякую, що прочитали цей відгук. Щиро сподіваюся, що 2026 рік стане роком, коли Blitz знову засяє  і що ціни нарешті стануть більш розумними. Бажаю всім миру, удачі та щасливого Нового року!\n\n\n\nWorld of Tanks Blitz is genuinely a fun and addictive game. It has that special something that makes you want to play “just one more match,” whether you’re killing time or looking for a quick dose of action. But even though the game is good, there are several things that have been bothering many of us for a long time.\n\nFirst, the prices of the in-game boxes are simply too high. A lot of players complain that they get almost nothing out of them, even after spending a serious amount of money. It feels terrible when you pay and the reward ends up being basically worthless. You go in hoping for a fair chance, but it ends up feeling like a lottery with no win.\n\nThen there are the technical issues. Sometimes the ping spikes for no reason, FPS drops right when you need it the most, and the whole match is ruined. Not every battle is like that, but it happens often enough to be frustrating. Matchmaking can also put together teams that fall apart in a minute, leaving you with zero chance to make an impact no matter how hard you try.\n\nStill, the game has huge potential. To make it better, I think the following things should be fixed as soon as possible: more stable ping, better FPS optimization, fairer and more predictable rewards, improved matchmaking, fewer pay-to-win elements, better team balance, more meaningful seasonal content, smoother progression without excessive grinding, better support for weaker devices, and of course more reasonable box prices. All of this would make a massive difference.\nThanks for reading. I hope 2026 turns out to be the year when Blitz shines again, and hopefully we’ll finally see more realistic prices. Wishing everyone a peaceful and happy New Year!\n\n\nWorld of Tanks Blitz 是一款确实好玩又容易上瘾的游戏。它有一种特别的吸引力，让人总想“再来一局”，不管你是在休息、在路上，还是只是想玩几分钟。但即使游戏本身不错，也有一些问题长期困扰着很多玩家。\n\n首先，游戏里的箱子价格太高了。很多玩家抱怨，即使花了不少钱，得到的奖励依然非常差。那种花了钱却得到毫无价值的东西的感觉真的很糟糕。你原本期待的是一个公平的机会，结果却更像是一场没有结果的抽奖。\n\n其次是技术问题。有时候 ping 会莫名其妙地飙升，FPS 会在最关键的时刻掉到很低，整场战斗就此毁掉。并不是每一局都会这样，但发生得足够频繁，让人很烦。匹配系统有时也会把队伍凑得很不平衡，一分钟就被打垮，让你怎么努力都没办法改变结果.\n\n不过游戏依然很有潜力。为了让它变得更好，我觉得应该尽快改善以下几点：更稳定的 ping、更好的 FPS 优化、更公平的奖励系统、更合理的匹配、更少的付费取胜元素、更平衡的队伍、更有意义的赛季内容、更轻松的进度、更好地支持低端设备，以及更合理的箱子价格。所有这些都会让游戏好很多。\n\n谢谢你读完这些想法。真心希望 2026 能成为 Blitz 再次发光的一年，也希望明年价格能终于变得更合理。祝大家新年快乐、平安顺利！\n\n\n\nWorld of Tanks Blitz  действительно увлекательная и затягивающая игра. В ней есть то самое ощущение динамики и азарта, из-за которого хочется сыграть «ещё один бой», будь то перерыв, дорога или просто несколько slobodnih minuta. Но при всей её привлекательности, есть вещи, которые давно раздражают многих игроков.\n\nВо-первых, цены на коробки в игре слишком высокие. Множество игроков жалуются, что даже после значительных затрат получают почти ничего полезного. Это неприятно  вкладывать деньги и в итоге получать награды, которые практически ничего не стоят. Идёшь с надеждой на честный шанс, а по факту всё напоминает лотерею без выигрыша.\n\nВо-вторых, существуют технические проблемы. Иногда пинг резко подскакивает без видимой причины, FPS падает в самый неподходящий момент, и весь бой оказывается испорчен. Такое бывает не всегда, но достаточно часто, чтобы раздражать. Кроме того, матчмейкинг порой собирает команды, которые рассыпаются меньше чем за минуту, и у тебя фактически нет возможности повлиять на исход боя, как бы ты ни старался.\n\nТем не менее у игры огромный потенциал. Чтобы сделать её лучше, разработчикам стоит как можно скорее обратить внимание на следующее: более стабильный пинг, лучшую оптимизацию FPS, честные и предсказуемые награды, улучшенный матчмейкинг, меньше pay-to-win элементов, более равномерное распределение игроков по командам, содержательные сезонные обновления, менее утомительный прогресс, лучшую поддержку слабых устройств и, конечно, более разумные цены на коробки. Всё это заметно улучшило бы игровой опыт.\n\nСпасибо, что нашли время прочитать этот отзыв. Очень надеюсь, что 2026 год станет годом, когда Blitz снова засияет, а цены наконец станут адекватнее. Желаю всем мира и счастья в новом году!",

Now, with that said...\nMatchmaking is broken, teammates are enemies in blue, game balancing at the highest levels is nonsensical and only gets worse with every major update, map design is between barely functional and awful, and the micro (mostly macro) transactions + gambling features makes the entire thing look like an overpriced storefront simulator with a tank minigame attached to it.\nIt's an arcade-style tank shooter that at least has an active development team and is sometimes fun.

But it is worht mentioning that this game lacks competitive balance and is often encouraging casual play more than skill-based or team based cooperation.\n\nBe aware that big part of the thanks in the game are paid or use premium currency, not only that, but the current meta goes around premium/exclusive tanks which are not normally obtainable by the average player. It is also worth mentioning that the game includes gambling in the form of spin wheels and crates/lockboxes.\n\nEven with all those cons, the game can be fun...\n\n*IF you can spend a lot of time on it\n*IF you're familiar with the core mechanics\n*IF you previously had an account\n*IF YOU DONT MIND LOSING CONSTANTLY\n*IF you don't believe in the illusion of team work\n\n(or if you have spare money I guess lol)",

And in all the history of human conflict, there have been no battles like Kursk. World of Tanks and World of Tanks Blitz focus on that particular man vs man by machine aspect and question the very idea of enhanced humans by machines. Tech trees improve, but something stays the same: the trail of self, the characteristic, the role of the tool shaped by sapiens.\n\nFormal Review: World of Tanks Blitz is a fast, tactical tank shooter that rewards positioning, map awareness, situational teamplay, and mechanical discipline. The game offers a wide variety of nations and vehicles, each with distinct handling and battlefield roles, creating meaningful strategic depth in every match. Although balance changes and occasional matchmaking inconsistencies can be frustrating at times, the core gameplay loop remains deeply engaging. With additional alternative-physics modes, players can also experience more experimental and dynamic interactions. For those who enjoy precise movement, calculated engagements, unexpected synergies with teammates, and short but intense battles, Blitz stands out as one of the strongest action-tactical-strategy games available.",

It happens in their \"garage casinos\" and during team balancing, where bots are allowed onto your team. There will be periods when you'll consistently have 2-3 bots with zero damage, leading to 8-10 losses in a row. The developers kindly call this \"randomness,\" although in reality, it's a common scam to level the playing field. If you even slightly stand out from the crowd, be prepared for an influx of bots onto your team, be prepared for a lack of balance across tank classes, and, of course, expect misses and ricochets at point-blank range, from any angle, even where ricochets are physically impossible.

In most of the battles your damage is more than your entire team. May be this game is dead thats why they let bots to join the battle so frequently. And they still selling tanks for insane prices and i don't know which stupd ppl spending money on this game. Anyway stay away from this game or all games like this type coz i have been playing games for two decades and have played all games of this genre. All games have same issue that there are bots in PVP and you keep losing games because of them. There is no fun at all playing this game anymore.

Server population also make it difficult to find matches often putting you in up tier matches where you are out gunned and often 1 shot killed by superior tanks. Out of 100 matches 76 were up tiered and 24 were either equal (15) or down tiered (9). Wargaming once concerned themselves with balanced play now it seem they are more interested in micro transactions that they offer as \"Buy now or miss out forever\" Sad to see a once good company fall victim to greed rather than enjoyment of their customers.\n\nSo if you are willing to wait for 30 minutes for a lower tier match just to get to play for target practice for a higher tier player this game is for you.",
