The multiple-world mechanic with \"simultaneous\" progression introduces a somewhat-fresh spin. Gameplay elements are easy to understand, but have an interesting depth, with many dimensions to them. Getting to 1000 floors is not [i]that[/i] hard, so \"finishing\" the game can be done reasonably. If you don't care about 100% achievements or Abyss, then this is a fine game to spend some time on.\n\nHowever, there are many things which led me to give this a thumbs-down.\n\n[h2]Why I don't recommend it[/h2]\n[i]Disclaimer:[/i] I'm not an avid fan of grindy games.\n\n[b]Abyss[/b]\nA new area that presents a fresh, new playstyle, with many unique features and rewards. The problem? It comes very late, while being ridiculously slow to progress, making it painful and [i]useless[/i]. Maybe it's intended for going really deep, but why bother? There is nothing there.\n(I have to mention this somewhere: \"increase initial floor\" stat makes it harder to prestige. I lamented the fact I bought it all.)\n\n[b]Miners[/b]\nThere are problems with both miners themselves and miners screen. Miners are not equal. That would be alright, but it is often unclear if a given one is good or not. There are prices, which help sometimes, but it's mostly upgrades's prices that show quality, and you need to buy miners first. Which you will do anyway for achievements. Oh, and overall power, which is hidden under the list of miners. And this leads me to the second point...\nThe miners screen sucks. Stats barely matter, because nothing shows attack patterns, except, sometimes, text descriptions. And patterns change from upgrades on some miners, but not all, and nothing tells you that! At the same time, attack patterns are included in intended strength of a miner, while in practice many of them underperform due to going for lone blocks. This is needlessly annoying. (Use Franky, don't bother with Mike, he is too slow.)\nOh, and special abilities to get more stuff? Yeah, forget about them, chance is too low to matter.\nAlso, skins. Prices for them are wild. Some of them are like, 10k iron, and some cost millions. Why does Anne's ghost skin cost [b]so[/b] much? It's cool, but it's just a skin. And many skins cost premium currency, making them needlessly hard to get.\n\n[b]Exponential grind[/b]\nWhile most of the game is fine, it goes not for exponential growth of numbers, but for exponential growth of grinding (sadly, the norm for the genre, I suppose), making tail-end of it very bad. If you value your time and sanity, use at least an autoclicker.\n\nBut what really made me write this review is premium currency. You need at least 2000 to buy miners for the \"20 bought miners\" achivement (Rick doesn't count). It's not like there isn't enough, but by the time you get there, you already spent it on other things, forcing you to do the stupid daily quests. Preferably by changing dates. Oh, and you can't get new quests for the same date, because for some reason game stores which exact quests for which dates you already did (or something like that). And you can't manipulate memory to get more currency, because it's obfuscated in some way (probably because it's [i]premium[/i]). Sitting there with 4 quests to tap birds is maddening.\n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\nPlay with an autoclicker. When grind gets bad, cheat, it's fine. Your time is more important than some misplaced sense of pride and accomplishment. And save the premium currency for at least two premium miners to get the achievement.\n\nAt the end, Idle Cave Miner left a bad aftertaste. I liked it at the start, though.",

If you value your time and sanity, use at least an autoclicker.\n\nBut what really made me write this review is premium currency. You need at least 2000 to buy miners for the \"20 bought miners\" achivement (Rick doesn't count). It's not like there isn't enough, but by the time you get there, you already spent it on other things, forcing you to do the stupid daily quests. Preferably by changing dates. Oh, and you can't get new quests for the same date, because for some reason game stores which exact quests for which dates you already did (or something like that). And you can't manipulate memory to get more currency, because it's obfuscated in some way (probably because it's [i]premium[/i]). Sitting there with 4 quests to tap birds is maddening.\n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\nPlay with an autoclicker. When grind gets bad, cheat, it's fine. Your time is more important than some misplaced sense of pride and accomplishment. And save the premium currency for at least two premium miners to get the achievement.\n\nAt the end, Idle Cave Miner left a bad aftertaste. I liked it at the start, though.",

The multiple-world mechanic with \"simultaneous\" progression introduces a somewhat-fresh spin. Gameplay elements are easy to understand, but have an interesting depth, with many dimensions to them. Getting to 1000 floors is not [i]that[/i] hard, so \"finishing\" the game can be done reasonably. If you don't care about 100% achievements or Abyss, then this is a fine game to spend some time on.\n\nHowever, there are many things which led me to give this a thumbs-down.\n\n[h2]Why I don't recommend it[/h2]\n[i]Disclaimer:[/i] I'm not an avid fan of grindy games.\n\n[b]Abyss[/b]\nA new area that presents a fresh, new playstyle, with many unique features and rewards. The problem? It comes very late, while being ridiculously slow to progress, making it painful and [i]useless[/i]. Maybe it's intended for going really deep, but why bother? There is nothing there.\n(I have to mention this somewhere: \"increase initial floor\" stat makes it harder to prestige. I lamented the fact I bought it all.)\n\n[b]Miners[/b]\nThere are problems with both miners themselves and miners screen. Miners are not equal. That would be alright, but it is often unclear if a given one is good or not. There are prices, which help sometimes, but it's mostly upgrades's prices that show quality, and you need to buy miners first. Which you will do anyway for achievements. Oh, and overall power, which is hidden under the list of miners. And this leads me to the second point...\nThe miners screen sucks. Stats barely matter, because nothing shows attack patterns, except, sometimes, text descriptions. And patterns change from upgrades on some miners, but not all, and nothing tells you that! At the same time, attack patterns are included in intended strength of a miner, while in practice many of them underperform due to going for lone blocks. This is needlessly annoying. (Use Franky, don't bother with Mike, he is too slow.)\nOh, and special abilities to get more stuff? Yeah, forget about them, chance is too low to matter.\nAlso, skins. Prices for them are wild. Some of them are like, 10k iron, and some cost millions. Why does Anne's ghost skin cost [b]so[/b] much? It's cool, but it's just a skin. And many skins cost premium currency, making them needlessly hard to get.\n\n[b]Exponential grind[/b]\nWhile most of the game is fine, it goes not for exponential growth of numbers, but for exponential growth of grinding (sadly, the norm for the genre, I suppose), making tail-end of it very bad. If you value your time and sanity, use at least an autoclicker.\n\nBut what really made me write this review is premium currency. You need at least 2000 to buy miners for the \"20 bought miners\" achivement (Rick doesn't count). It's not like there isn't enough, but by the time you get there, you already spent it on other things, forcing you to do the stupid daily quests. Preferably by changing dates. Oh, and you can't get new quests for the same date, because for some reason game stores which exact quests for which dates you already did (or something like that). And you can't manipulate memory to get more currency, because it's obfuscated in some way (probably because it's [i]premium[/i]). Sitting there with 4 quests to tap birds is maddening.\n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\nPlay with an autoclicker. When grind gets bad, cheat, it's fine. Your time is more important than some misplaced sense of pride and accomplishment. And save the premium currency for at least two premium miners to get the achievement.\n\nAt the end, Idle Cave Miner left a bad aftertaste. I liked it at the start, though.",
