Master Duel, because the card pool is constantly updating and the multiplayer is very active. It only takes a few seconds to find a match. \n\nYou'll get plenty of resources at the start to build a decent deck. Just make sure to do some research on which packs to pull and which cards to craft. However, if you want to build multiple decks, it will cost you either a long time or some money.",

It is lower than probably Pokemon TCG though.\n\nThe game has fun events with different legal cards monthly. They have a cool solo mode for lore. And it is easier to get cards than MtG. However, it is still way stingier with cards than say Pokemon TCG which is unfortunate. The cards for decks and cosmetics keep getting spread out in the year greedily. And new/good cards keep getting locked behind selection packs that don't come back for a while.\n\nThough they have recently released a pack that can catch new players up to speed.",

Of course, you can create custom games and play that way with your friends — which I do — but why should I only play with my friends when I could play against you?\n\nOverall, the game is good. I’ve made all the decks I own in real life, and it’s a great option to experiment with different strategies and to learn new decks much faster.",

      "review": "I decided to write this review since I see a lot of people have a rough time with the entry barrier into Master Duel. \n\nMaster Duel is described by Konami as the place where you will duel at the highest level and when they say highest level they are not downplaying it. First things you need to be aware of is that yes there is a barrier when you start playing that at first might seem overwhelming, but you need to remember you are jumping at the deep-end of the Yu-Gi-Oh! dueling experience. Some people criticize Master Duel for not being beginner friendly, and although I do agree there is a curve to adapt to in terms of dueling, specially for people who are returning to Yu-Gi-Oh after many years away or people who have only watched the anime or who are experiencing the brand for the first time, I also think the game gives you the tools so that you are able to build a strong deck very early into the game. \n\nChances are yes you are going to get whooped during your first couple of duels, but that is to be expected since you are at the first steps of your deck building but if you put your time to learn the ins and outs of the game, it is a great way to enjoy the franchise. \n\nSome useful things things for people willing to give it a shot:\n- Master Duel is very very F2P friendly, the game gives you so many easy ways to get gems (the currency used for opening packs) and occasionally even give you full structure-decks through things like friend code referral and such. If you manage your gems correctly you can easily make a viable competitive deck in just a few minutes and can probably average a new deck every month or so.\n\n- Do your tutorials (skip them if you have a basic understanding of the game) and after, when picking one of the 3 beginners decks, just pick the one that matches your latest understanding of Yu-Gi-Oh! \n\n- Before entering ranked matches, go to solo mode and there you will find many \"missions\" that reward you with cosmetics such as mates, duel fields, sleeves and even some actual card, but most importantly finishing the Duel Strategy missions reward you with a total of 2,400 gems. By doing solo mode not only can you unlock different rewards but you will also fulfill some of the challenges and missions that reward you with even more gems. \n\n- Now when it comes to currencies we have gems which are used to open card packs and just buy anything from the store and you also have crafting points (CP) ranging from Normal, Rare, Super Rare, and Ultra Rare points. These CP are used to craft cards individually which is helpful if the card you are looking for is not available on any dedicated pack or if you only need to craft 1 copy of that card. In principle crafting a card take 30 CP regardless of the rarity (and when crafting there is a random chance of it being one of three different types of foiling which basically just means how shiny the card will be). Then some cards you don't want can be dismantled into CP of the corresponding rarity of the card going from 10 - 30 CP depending on the foiling of the card dismantled. One thing to note with CP is that not all cards can be dismantled as some free cards you get wont be able to be dismantled, but every card from pack openings can be dismantled into CP (cards from structure decks can't be dismantled tho). Best tip is to spend your SR CP and UR CP wisely and only when you really want or need a card since they are the hardest points to gather at first.\n\n- Now before building a deck, opening packs and crafting cards you need to ask yourself the most important question when joining Master Duel for the first time - Which deck do you want to play with? - This is the most important decision you will have to make since the deck you chose will be your partner for the first month or so, so more than a meta deck just go for the one you will have the most fun with.\n\n- Once you know which deck you want to go with, the best thing to do is to just create a deck and add all the cards you will want in it, that way you will know which cards you have, which cards you are missing and their respective rarities. Then you have to best options, one of them is to take one SR or UR card from that archetype and craft it, in doing so you will unlock a secret pack from that archetype which then you can spend your gems opening packs to get cards from that archetype. You can also go into the store and look at the structure decks and see if the archetype you want is available there, that way by spending 500 gems you will get access to the core of the archetype and can be a shortcut to building your desired deck.\n\n- 2 PRO TIPS when it comes to gems are NEVER SPEND GEMS on the MASTER PACK since the amount of cards in it makes it impossible to get anything you actually want (you are better sticking to secret packs) and also ALWAYS BUY THE DUEL PASS since this battle pass not only returns your gem investment if completed but also rewards you with limited-time accessories and tons of CP from all the rarities.\n\n- If you really want to add a meta element to your deck you can also go to the shop special section and under bundle deals you will see bundles with 10 Master Packs and also a meta staple card. \n\n- With all of this said if you dismantle any and every card you dont need and if you claim your rewards and open more packs you will end up with a good deck to enter ranked as any cards you dont get can probably be crafted with the CP earned from the dismantle of cards. \n\nWhen it comes to dueling the game helps you flagging posible actions that can be taken or cards that can be played in case you are not fully experienced with your deck. As you climb through ranked you will earn more gems that can be used to make your deck stronger and such. \n\nAgain, as this is a competitive TCG it does take time to settle in but the more time you put and as long as you are playing cards that are fun to you I really think this game has a lot to offer for Yu-Gi-Oh! fans. Ranked might be a tough pill to swallow at first but by making mistakes and losing duels is how you will learn.",

      "review": "The most accessible way to play Yu-Gi-Oh! online. Cards trail behind the TCG/OCG by about 6 months. Gems for cards are earned at a decent rate. Perhaps the least gacha gacha game on the market. Unlike Duel Links, cards can be crafted/dismantled for dust, similar to Hearthstone at about a 3:1 ratio of dismantle to craft. This means even unplayable duds of the same rarity contribute towards cards you actually want. No need to scrape the bottom of the packs looking for must haves like Duel Links. Events are held roughly twice a month for some variety and include loaner decks to experience the latest decks, albeit not their meta versions. Ban list is wildly different to the TCG, for better and for worse.  While it doesn't make paper play obsolete, it is a fine alternative if you are just looking to play Yu-Gi-Oh!",

I've relatively new to the franchise, but it's had be drenched into its lore ever since I got into it. Master Duel is the coolest, but it does have it kinks for those with a bit of a short-temper and not enough time to strategize. But that's the whole point: To incentivize people into becoming more strategic with the game and understand how much goes into each duel and how special each win, loss or draw is like in the anime. That's my 2 cents, hope y'all dig it.",

Огромный ростер карт, постоянно обновляющийся и пополняющийся, позволяет создавать невероятно разнообразные колоды и стратегии. Одиночный режим, хоть и простоват, обучает основам и знакомит с различными архетипами.\n\nОнлайн-матчи - вот где раскрывается настоящий потенциал игры. Рейтинговая система мотивирует к развитию и совершенствованию своих навыков. Однако, гринд ресурсов для создания желаемых колод местами может показаться утомительным.\n\nВизуально игра выполнена на достойном уровне, карты анимированы, а интерфейс интуитивно понятен. Стоит отметить, что игра бесплатна, но агрессивная монетизация может подтолкнуть к донату. В целом, Master Duel - это качественная и увлекательная адаптация популярной карточной игры, которая затягивает на долгие часы. Рекомендую попробовать всем любителям жанра!",

Additionally it is easy to obtain free gems every month and while the game does use its own gacha gems currency the cost of a single pack of cards is cheaper than an IRL pack would be. From that perspective this game is accessible and even cheaper than most TCGs. \r\n\r\nSo why do I hesitate to recommend it? Because it is also behind the TCG in terms of cards that are available to the player. There isn't really a specific order that they add new cards either. Also, the banlist is not the same as in TCG or in OCG. It's a weird cross of both lists. This leads to some cards that we don't deal with in TCG (like Maxx C) being playable and it can feel like a party game at times because of it. Also, aside from monthly events, Konami is really missing out on giving us alternate ways to play such as draft or sealed. This client has so much potential, but it is currently being underutilized.",

Yes, modern archetypes tend to vomit out their entire extra decks on turn 1, but there are alternatives. Play anti-meta, play board-breaking strategies like Cyber Dragons. The \"meta\" folks bitch about stuff like floodgates, Droll & Lock Bird and of course Maxx C, shutting down their decks, as if spending 15 minutes on a single turn to NOT EVEN ALLOW the other player to play the game is fairer. Don't give them an inch, lava golem, Ra Sphere Mode, Kaijus, Dark ruler no more, two people play this game. If they believe they are allowed to prevent you from playing, you are allowed to prevent them from achieving it.\n\nNow the game CAN be P2W, but I have not spent a single euro on it since it launched and I've been able to craft most of the decks I play (I craft the entirety of my cyber dragons on the first day I played) and the gems can be farmed quite easily if you check the daily quests, do solo missions (200 gems per story + some cosmetics and cards). P2W is certainly not the norm in this game. I will recommend this game because I'm a firm believer that Duel Monsters (yes, this is how the game is called not yugioh, deal with it) CAN and SHOULD be FUN for every party involved. Master Duel desperately need BO3 matches and a casual matchmaking that gives awards for playing, not everyone wants to play ranked with try-hard no-lifers.",

Dare to attempt to play rogue and you are in for a brutal time. The current state is practically a going first simulator and there's 0 variety of game modes. Play solo challenges against terrible random deck archetypes from yester year. Maybe you actually like one of these decks and try to run the ladder haha good luck with that. I've attained Master 1 once before and it was more of a grind than skill based play due to all the unoriginal people who play the most broken decks. Can't say I blame them when unless you're spending money constantly it is dang near impossible to accumulate a notable number of gems. The pass is good until you realize if you play 8 hours a week you will be maxed out and still have a month and a half till next pass. 1/10 of their LTD events are worth the time to build a deck around and again they're for a limited time. Why would i spend 500 UR tokens on a new deck archetype for a specific event that is at most around for 2 weeks.

You could make a deck of whatever you enjoyed, add a couple infamous cards, and earn your share of currency. Even if you lost, you could still admire your opponents' \"petdeck\" (personal, original deck).\nBeginning with the inclusion of Swordsoul cards, the stagnant meta slowly came to be. Now petdecks must half-consist of meta cards to be playable in even the lowest ranks. This makes the grind cycle painful, and demotivated players will have less currency to pull packs despite events being run more frequently.\n\nKonami refuses to heed player feedback regarding this mess. On the contrary, they spur it on by banning critical cards of meta archetypes to encourage players to spend their currency on a new meta archetype instead. There are also game modes from the past Konami does not wish to spend the barest of efforts on, such as Tag Duels.\n\nThe real-to-virtual exchange is horrendous as well. For the price charged, you should instead buy individual cards you like so you can admire their artwork.\n\nOverall, if you want to play Yu-Gi-Oh! without attending local tournaments, then I recommend Master Duel solely for its Solo Mode. Otherwise, play an early game in the franchise such as Forbidden Memories or Duelist of Roses.",

You will not be able to break boards, let alone win if you do not win the coin-flip at the start of the match, except if you're lucky enough to not play against a strong meta deck and have a few hand traps in your starting hand. The tiers do not mean anything because you could be starting the game and be in rookie 3 (the lowest tier in the game) and still face off against people with fully built meta decks. If you do not win the coin-flip, expect to sit there doing nothing for a minimum of 5 minutes while your opponent does their full combo. Sometimes you aren't even able to reach your turn because of \"FTK\" decks (first-turn-kill). The company Konami with their greed doesn't do much to better the situation. If you're a new player to this game, you should probably pick another card game. This game only is fun if you already have a meta deck and spent 40~ hours in it. Even saying all that, there is a steady decline in the Master Duel playerbase because of poor optimization, greedy devs, and no love for the game besides the income it provides.",

      "review": "As a avid TCG player who has been heavily invested in the game since 2005, I have to say this is nearly unplayable.\n\nWhile naturally it shares every issue with normal gameplay of the real card game, it also goes much deeper then that. First point: The gatcha system (while theres certainly FAR worse ones out there) is terrible. Grinding gems takes forever and once you've cleared solo mode, say goodbye to ever getting anything new ever again, because the game will VERY slowly drip feed you a paultry sum of gems IF YOU WIN a ranked match and thats about it (GOOD LUCK winning without a tier 0 deck)\n\nSecond point: Cheaters. The game is FULL of them. Everything you can imagine. FTK bots, AFK bots, players who can see your hand at all times, people who manipulate the cards drawn on both sides, deck stacking, its awful and nearly unplayable.\n\nThird point: The TERRIBLE and WILDLY inconsistent banlist. So...you're telling me that the current tier 0 (which has been tier 0 for nearly 3 months now) doesn't have a single card even so much as semi-limited, but secret village, card of demise, POT OF PROSPERITY are banned? Maxx C is at 2. Pot of duality is at 1. What.\n\nFourth point: It is VERY begginer hostile. The game just expects you to casually pay over 100 REAL LIFE dollars to MAYBE get a CHANCE at getting specific cards that are essential and you litterally CAN NOT win even in rookie without. \n\nFifth point: Bugs. And lots of them. I get this is the most complex card game of all time so naturally, when in digital form, its not gurenteed to work properly every time, but this is absolutely ridiculous. Were getting nonsense like a card that does NOT have to be face-up to resolve somehow fizzeling after being MST'd, cards whos activation requirement is something like \"Target 1 card you control\" and somehow not being allowed to activate it despite the fact there is NOTHING preventing targeting anywhere, special summoning from the grave with necrovalley on the field, ect ect. FIX YOUR GAME KONAMI\n\nsixth point: The horrible meta: I get this is an issue in the TCG and OCG as well, but due to the wonky and weird banlist, i think its at its worst here. You better REALLY enjoy seeing the same 3 decks, because once you get past bronze its ALLLLL youre ever going to see for the rest of your life.\n\nSeventh point: While this is not 100% proven yet, there is evidence to suggest the game is bias for asian players. Letting asian players start every duel with 3 different handtraps plus 2 different 1 card starters every single game whilst giving the english players 3 same named HOPT cards and 2 extenders that can't play through 3 hand traps. Or for the first time in 20 duels you open maxx c but AWWW DIDNT MATTER because the asian player opened ash, 2 starters, and extender, TTT, and maxx c themselves. It happens SO often and is almost always exlusively from asian players, that I am convinced the game plays favorites.\n\neighth point: The community is ULTRA toxic. No one is helpful, everyone is hostile, and everyone thinks theyre king of games while everyone else is worthless peasents. Any time you complain about ANYTHING its always \"skill issue\" (despite 50% of the game being luck) No, its not \"skill issue\" that konami themselves wanted the opponent to win and gave them 4 hand traps and a starter whilst not giving me and handtraps or breakers, thats RNG, not skill.\n\n\nOverall, I simply can NOT recommend this horrible game to anyone who values their life or sanity. If you enjoy being screwed over by RNG while everyone who you simply ask for help or tips from mock you, go ahead, but no thanks. Im good.",

You will actively be punished for not keeping up with the power creep of the game and constantly integrating the newer strategies into your gameplay. \n\nOlder decks simply cannot keep up in terms of card economy, recursive ability, handtrap resilience, endboard strength or card quality. It's to the point where if you want to play higher level games at any given season, you are funnelled into playing one of about 3 decks (a generous estimation). It's sad that a digital client as beautiful and smooth to use as Master Duel does not provide a home for older decks or formats, nor does it provide alternative formats for newer, weaker decks that some of us may enjoy. \n\nFor my personal bias: the truth of it is that I'm tired of this never ending loop of being forced into newer archetypes - sometimes I just want to feel rewarded for being proficient or competent at a deck that I like. This game doesn't provide a place for me to do that. I like being rewarded for good sequencing, card knowledge, deck building choices, and in-game decision making. Playing the newest, strongest, best decks may provide that to an extent but what if I don't like the newer decks? I don't fancy the braindead extension capabilities of a Maliss or a Ryzeal; I don't fancy the unrestricted power and quality of a Mitsurugi. I think it's fine to be punished for poor plays and my opponent having proper knowledge of the game. Perhaps this is the unpopular opinion, though. \n\nAll I can hope is that the game eventually gets to a point where I can enjoy it again - for now I must just admit that after 2 years of Master Duel, I don't enjoy playing Yu-Gi-Oh anymore.

There is almost no advantage to going second, and despite being a turn-based card game, there is little room for genuine strategy or mind games. The outcome often depends on whether a player includes certain broken cards in their deck, as they are practically mandatory to win. Even among tier decks, the power gap remains substantial. \n\nRather than encouraging thoughtful play, the game has become dominated by meaningless floodgates and excessively long combo sequences. These prolonged and overly powerful combos make long combo decks significantly more stressful than midrange decks, floodgate trap decks, or even OTK decks.\n\nMidrange control decks, such as Mekk-Knights, feel notably underpowered, and most Pendulum decks also perform poorly in comparison. Just as Ritual Summoning has been refined through Mitsurugi, Pendulum and Midrange control archetypes should likewise be enhanced—regardless of their complexity. For example, a structure where spell-based decks can counter trap decks, trap decks can handle Combo decks, and Combo decks have an advantage over control decks seems to be the closest thing to minimum balance and variability that Yugioh could offer. \n\nAlso, who thought it was a good idea to let their cards banish, draw two cards, and special summon it? Tenpai Dragon was a way better shot for master duel's balance. Enough with broken cards like Malice and Tearlaments already. And cards like Fiendsmith and Snakeeyes are not fun either, as they destroy the diversity of decks too much. \n\nDecks like Thunder Dragon, Tribrigade, and Ancient Gear are more fun to face. They were more fun and fair, with some weaknesses that keep the game interesting. There could be plenty of fun and creative card designs—like the Pendulum hand trap or the spell-based Mind Crush for going second—so why did you stop making those interesting cards and keep making some endless broken combo cards instead?

So many ways they could make this a better Yugioh game, they really need to take some hints from other digital TCG clients. My biggest issues are:\n1: It feels like's like trying to be more like a gacha game than a typical TCG video game. They throw a ton of tiny, minuscule achievements at you at the start to give you gems, before it turns INCREDIBLY grindy, and aside from the very limited duel-pass, you can ONLY craft cards by dismantling cards of an equal rarity, which means if you get bad luck there is basically no way to get the many cards you need to make a non-structure deck.\n2: Worst ranked system I've ever seen for a game played competitively (There is no MMR system, and all players end up in Platinum eventually regardless of winrate/skill/playtime).\n3: They put in thousands of bad, terribly-aged cards with no format to play them in, basically adding in countless garbage cards into the gamefiles just to fill your randomized packs with bad cards so you have to buy more to get anything worthwhile.\n4: Lot's of terribly designed or redundant UI-choices, and an insane amount of unskippable animations that you will see thousands of times that makes duels take 2x as long as they need to.\n5: I already mentioned this in #3, but the lack of any additional format options, especially when Genesys is an official thing, is the worst part. Give us other formats to play the old cards they give us. Yugioh has over 300 archetypes but in standard you just see the same 3-6 over and over again.\n6: The \"story\" modes feel machine-translated and often just sounds nonsensical. Also pales in comparison to other Yugioh game story modes.\n7: When I read up what players say as to why things are the way they are in master duel, most of the time the answer is \"To make Konami money\" and I usually have to agree.",

      "review": "I recently got into the Yu-Gi-Oh for the first time and was overall pleasantly surprised, but Master Duel has some really bad stuff.\n\nFirst of all, if a game has this many \"must have\" generic staples, they should be easy to get, and not be f****** URs, are you kidding me? And UR drops are so rare that by the time I time I collect enough dust for the playset of all of the must-play handtraps I already lost interest. Unlike in Hearthstone, each rarity uses separate dust, which means you need to actually pull URs to craft URs.\n\nAround 25% of your deck is either generic handtraps everyone plays or counters to these handtraps, so it's not even like these expensive cards you're crafting are resulting in building cooler decks. They also don't give you more fun play experience either. It's like a nuclear race: both sides are forced to stockpile their decks with the most powerful weapons to keep up with the other side, even though the end result sucks for both of them.\n\nOn the plus side, the visuals and OST are fantastic. Solo mode is a good way to introduce archetypes, and the special tournaments are fun too - and often give rental decks, which bypasses the awful UR grind. If KONAMI uses experience from these they might improve ranked. Alternatively they could ban Maxx \"C\", that works too.",

(Do not play on any device before linking up your account. There is no simple log out button.) \n- Once event duels end, there is no meaningful way in game to engage with casual play. \n- Game locks packs of various archetypes, and you can only purchase these various types of packs by generating a card from that 'set' or using gems (earnable, but still a paid currency.) to hopefully pull an SR from the set. Which then allows you to spend gems on the set you are actually aiming for. \n\nIt's a Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG simulator.

THAT will be the game that konami graciously gives you to play, after 5 straight connectivity losses in the middle of your first turn while you have your perfect combo rolling. \n\nThat is the biggest issue by far.\n\nthe NEXT biggest issue is the other reviews being correct. this game is not just failing at being new/returning player friendly, but i would even say that it is down right HOSTILE to people trying to learn the game. \nthe solo mode will give you access to a few archetypes here and there, but for about 3 solo duels that  are easy as cake and then a bunch of nonsens story line and lore for the cards, cool i guess butyou cant even unlock all of the solo story modes to begin with, in fact playing the first half of a solo story will not even unlock the back half of a solo story, example six samurai. once you have beaten the first half of a story, you get a single free pull from the pack that those cards originate in... 1 single pull. the rest you have to buy with your gems you only get by playing ranked games. not to mention that you have 1 day to get all you need before the pack just dissapears, and you have to get lucky and pull a card from that pack as a random pull from ANOTHER pack you dont care about to see it again, for yet another 24 hrs before it goes away AGAIN. \n\nthen theres the structure decks. i got 3 of the blue eyes chaos max decks, because i play Blue eyes irl, and i figured that the irl structure deck is good fun so ill get it in game. except its not the same, its completely different, missing MANY if not MOST of the key cards that come with the real life structure deck, and once again you learn that its ANOTHER SECRET PACK you have to RANDOMLY roll into and then HOPE that you have the gems since after all you have 24HRS you get all you can before its GONE AGAIN. and that goes for all of the structure decks. they are not good, and have no real life equivalent. the game is HOSTILE to learn, if you even get the chance to play it. \n\nFree at the cost of your own sanity.",

Shit's cancer in general.\n\nSpecific to the YuGiOh Master Duel platform itself:\nEverything can be acquired for free and the amount of gems you can get well exceeds that needed for all campaign and limited items, but they've started ramping up on how many gems you should spend to acquire all limited time stuff, including the newly released collector files, which I just barely got the Dragonmaid one and now there's one for Sky Strikers.\n\nAside from that, bans and banlists aren't updated fast enough.  Any new, broken deck is allowed way too much of a grace period before it's nerfed and it gets stale too quickly.\n\nEvents last way too long to be any fun and the first or DC meta has gotten way too toxic to actively play new events well over half the time.  We need proper compensation if an opponent DCs on coin flip or before the field loads. At the very least, have it count as an active victory for the purposes of dailies, ideally with at least 1/2 the total for each daily also counting so that I only need to play against 2 DC'ers before I quit for the day.\n\nOverall gameplay issues are the same as YuGiOh, which goes as follows:\nMore cards need to be errata'd and more card effects need to get nerfed rulings.  The power scaling has gotten way too out of hand and we need a lot more cards that can deal with specific scenarios than what should be necessary in each deck, or at the very least cards that can fit in more decks that can deal with these scenario(s).\nImbalanced in favor of turn 1.\n  I feel like at least the following should be implemented at some point:\nPlayer(s) that have not initiated their first turn are unaffected by cards that started in the opponent's deck that include moving a card(s) that are currently in their main deck, extra deck, or hand.\nThis is the best way to phrase it that will still impact cards, but only minimally.\nWith that in place, this still allows most cards to function correctly in the \"going first vs going second\" game, while removing unfairness on the first turn.",

If you're a newer player, you will be facing opponents far beyond your skill level your first matches in ranked and probably far past that unless you pay for gems and roll endlessly.\n\n The game does feel and look better than Duel Links, but still leaves a lot to be desired. Most of it does come down to its poor matchmaking and lack of safety net for new players. Huge problem I see in almost every match is my opponent taking 10-15 minute turns with seemingly endless timers, while seemingly running out way faster for you. Easy fix for that would be to show the opponent's timer, but they'd rather just add more packs to pay for than make the experience any better. Pretty much only good for playing with your friends, but you'll have to suffer through the horrible Ranked matchmaking to scrape up enough gems for packs or open your wallet.

      "review": "Wait, I never left a review on this? Okay guess I get to absolutely rant.\n[h1]I love Yugioh, but it does have flaws.[/h1]\nMy problem with Yugioh is actually the problem that it's basically the card game version of a fighting game. In my previous group, I was in the middle. The person above me would basically always win easily and I felt bad. The person below me would always lose to me even when I'm running the absolute funniest Amazement Traptrix deck you've ever seen, and like next level it'd be too easy to beat and they'd feel EXTREMELY bad. Is the solution just to play worse? I accidentally bullied my friends out of playing the game with me by playing the game it's very sad.\n\n[u]This game has that problem to the extreme.[/u]\n\nWhat's something you know about Yugioh?\nIt's that it's a best of 3 format, right? You see who goes first and then after the win people get a chance to use the side deck and pick for themselves if they go first or not. That means even if your deck does a flash in the pan instant win on game one, there's a chance you just straight up lose in the next two rounds because your opponent outplayed you with their backup cards or now that they know what you're actually doing, hand-trapping the correct cards. Or, your opponent doesn't draw any hand traps and only gets their starters and bricks and you win for free anyway [i]let's save that for another time...[/i]\nBut Master Duel is not that. Master Duel is a best of one. You go on the latter, you lose the coin flip, give up honestly it's over requeue to make it faster. Maybe if you had hand traps? Oh no sorry the best decks now resist hand traps anyway so like yeah just stop trying. There's one hand trap they can't resist but uh, we'll get to that at the very end.\n\nYou might wonder why I had so little playtime. I basically ruined the game for myself.\nIf you somehow didn't notice despite the fact you reading this are probably someone who actually spent a lot more time in the game, anything you want to play is all URs. Everything is URs. In the past you would have most of your main combo be SRs, some URs are the one-off boss monsters in the extra or something like that, and then MOST of your URs are the hand traps you run in every deck. That's nice, you only need to get the [i]really expensive[/i] high rarity cards that you'll just put into every profile to make them at the bare level playable in this landscape.\n[u]I played ghostricks and doll monsters. I spent all of my currency on those two decks and I only got the full deck for one of them, but not even the hand traps since I didn't know they existed because when I played it was my first time with Yugioh ever.[/u]\nYou HAVE to know in advance the good cards in Yugioh normally, kinda sucks but whatever I guess. Uh so I did permanent account damage to myself for pulling fully on a pack that I thought was cool and then never got the really really really good auto-include cards because nothing and nobody ever told me they were even a thing. The tutorial certainly didn't explain to me, \"Make sure to craft some hand traps before heading out!\"\nGhostrick also isn't a good deck. So what would it take if I, today, for some reason wanted to get right back into the game and play the new meta?\n\n34 URs.\n\n[h1]Excuse me, what?[/h1]\nIn order to keep the sun in the sky shining or something, Konami has decided now that every single new archetype that comes out now is all URs. All of them, every single one, with the SRs being leftover cards from the past still relevant today, like idk 3 rares? If even? And then the only common card, one copy, in the entire profile is the archetypal trap card. I don't think I need to explain why that's extremely bad. I'll give my personal example of how bad that is in a second but let me sideline with something about balance here since I did say the whole \"every match is a coinflip\" and you might be wondering why.\n\n[h2]So yes, the current meta is Maliss[/h2]\nThey are extremely expensive and blah blah. What really upsets me is the fact they are the strongest. Master Duel most often gets their content drops last, after TCG and OCG. OCG gets pack reveals and their cards first, meaning there's room for issues and stuff with the random cards and stuff people get excited for yeah that's fine. TCG usually gets the same cards with some TCG exclusives months later, with content from the OCG redefining what happens in these packs allowing it to be more fair and fun for everyone. Sometimes, let's not forget the Bonfire incident. But in general that's multiple months to prepare for the next release basically using OCG as a testing ground.\n\nMaster Duel had so long to wait for Maliss. They had all the time in the world to see the deck was outperforming the competition and making people sad or mad and such. With all this extra time, they could prepare for the release by maybe like straight up holding off some of the cards from the deck until later? Like straight up not even print Dormouse (not a real suggestion but an example) so that the deck can exist but is in such an underpowered state that it will not ruin everything that exists here. It's a digital game, they control all fictional copies of cards and their availability. They could even have cards limited or semi-limited on release if they really wanted to. People would feel weird about it but they could've done anything.\nSo then can someone please explain to me why they still decided to release Maliss, full power, and it has dominated the meta of this game for I believe over four months now???? Are you actually kidding me? Is it so hard to just not have done that? Does releasing it in full power actually print that much money? It probably does because as I explained, decks are way too expensive to make now. Speaking of:\n\nIf I burn my entire collection, I most likely won't even get halfway there. Okay how about a less powerful deck like Diabellestar? Mix it with White Forest and Azamina, the full lore strategy, sounds pretty fun!\nIf I was crazy enough to not wanna do the default good cards you always include, I just wanted the playable cards for the actual deck of Diabell, it would STILL BE [b]28[/b] ULTRA RARE CARDS.\nLike, if I destroyed literally every single card I've ever pulled from packs, I wouldn't even have enough just to make the bare essentials like Ash Blossom, Crossout, Called By, Fuwalos or\n\n[h1]Maxx 'C'[/h1]\nBig shock, I hate the card. I think it makes the game objectively worse.\n\"OCG has it and they're fine!\" Best of 3 format. Do not. They don't even like the card themselves either! If you've ever bothered asking them, most OCG players actually despise it probably MORE than us because unlike TCG players, they actually do have to deal with it!\nThey at the very least have a chance to survive it, with a best of 3 format that makes it sometimes possible [i]not[/i] to draw it. They really have so much going against them already but they can at least play the game over there.\nNot over here! If you get Maxx 'C'ed, you have only the one round of this one game match to beat your opponent. Better pack it up, this isn't a coin flip on just who goes first anymore, it's an additional coin flip on who resolved Maxx 'C'. You finally got to go first, but your opponent baited your Called By with Fuwalos and now gets to Maxx 'C' you? Tough shit, game is over. You can probably play like 3 cards and realize your opponent got better pot of greed into ash + imperm + nibiru + called by for their turn and you auto lose. Congrats. Oh so your opponent got to do basically full combo even through your hand traps and now its your turn, but they Maxx 'C' you off the top? It's over. Break their board and let them pick up their entire deck, sure.\n9/10 times Maxx 'C' resolves, the game is already decided.\n\n[h1][u][b]I love Yugioh. This ain't my Yugioh.[/b][/u][/h1]",

I just dont have the patience to sit around waiting with 10 mins of boredom of not being able to do anything and if i dont look at the screen in a short time when they are finally done with their turn then i time out and lose.",

It’s easy if you’re not a meta slave you can’t hit master, and if you dear think you can have fun in quickplay, lmao, same think there,full of meta slave who don’t undersant how the deck work, but well, the shiny lil light help them a lot. The ban list is a joke it’s only made to force you to pay for gem. The only good thing on this game is some event can be really funny. Also this game is full of chinese bot using otk deck",

      "review": "Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel seems like a good idea until you actually play it and realize it’s more frustration than fun. The balance is nonexistent — the meta is a complete mess, and most duels boil down to your opponent playing a five-minute, brainless combo while you just sit there and watch your Life Points disappear without ever getting a real turn. “Skill” means nothing when the game rewards decks that practically play themselves.\r\nProgression is a joke too. The grind is massive, the rewards are tiny, and the crafting system forces you to burn a ridiculous amount of resources just to build one single deck that probably won’t even be meta a month later. If you’re not paying or no-lifing the game every day, you fall behind instantly.\r\nEvents and modes? Recycled, boring, and clearly designed just to waste your time. The servers lag, and the UI feels outdated and clunky. Overall, Master Duel is unbalanced, exhausting, and often straight-up unplayable.\r\nIf you’re looking for a fair, competitive TCG experience — this is not it.",

Nothing is enough to make up for the fact that 90% of new formats are just unfun to play. If it ever gets better Ill be back but I wouldn't bet on it, it wont as long as Konami can drain an infinite amount of cash from the people that are still playing.",

      "review": "Hi.\nI'm just a normie who used to watch the OG season (never watched the rest), I kinda liked Yugi-oh, but I never got into the physical card game. But I started to get some memes in my recommended so I decided to give this game a try.\n\nMy first attempt was witchcraft, then I realised I'm not gonna finish this deck anytime soon, is it meta? No? I guess i just make something else, I saw the Labyrinth boss monster I thought she looks nice so I tried to make that deck, worst mistake of my life. So F boring deck, I get it it's a build up deck but I legit had 2 games both going over 25 minutes, I don't want to play a match for half an hour, so I moved on (new account, this one) .\n\nWhen I saw the \"Kaiba vs Joey but Modern yugioh\" I thought it was really funny, the girls in the archtype were really cute. I tried the deck, it was far from done, it was already nerfed to the ground (Tearlaments) but man was it so much fun. Finally I could play the game, even if it was not my turn, I didn't have to sit thorugh 15 minutes turns, and the cards I was using were actually cute, it was great. I sticked around for 5 weeks, starting to some light like a way to keep meta relevant and get a new deck every few month, but things started to break apart fast and I decided to quit the game.\n\nI prefer modern Yuigi-oh, unlike the NPCs in the other reviews I think the game is a lot more fun now than it was when i was 13. I like the combos, but too many things are lacking in general in both the real game and this virtual one.\n\nIssues:\n- Lack of PvE modes: I really am just a normie, I just wanted to play cute girls, most of them are either not cute or done in a cartoonish or a dif artstyle I do not prefer, I think tearlaments is perfect for look. I know it's hated but it is in fact fun for me. You really need a PvE game mode where people can just ignore the bannlist and play whatever they want.\n- Bannlist: I would much prefer if the bannlist would only extend to PvP/Ranked. I know this in general is considered a good thing, but it's like people lining up in front of a horse branding hot rod and asking to be Fd in the $$ willingly. Sure you can balance the PvP aspect with it, but this is just a tool to push the new broken trash on you so you keep spending your money on it, maybe not in this game but in real life tournaments etc. I think it's bad, keep it to PvP because I hate it that I get a deck filled with cute girls than the bannlist suddenly says \"Oh their shelf life is over, they are banned/unplayable now so go get the new cards that are 10x uglier\" like bro I just want to play tearlaments in PvE why do you have to keep trashing that archtype? At this point you don't even play tear when you play tear, I watched a \"New best way to play tearlaments\" video, the guy didn't play a single tearlaments card...\n- Slow progress: If you are f2p getting a new deck is slower than getting a new character in a chinese gatcha game, not good\n-Starting resources: You can not make a full meta deck when you start out, and won't be able to finish it for weeks to come either. Just let people start out and give them enough to build a viable deck when they start the game, why force me to play with trash for 4 weeks before I can play the real game? Lol.\n- Starter decks: They are all trash.\n- Events: The event decks are an insult, they often are just the vanilla archtype not even close to viable/meta, most of your normal cards are banned, you can't mix the event deck with your own cards so unless you play for 1-2+ years you will not be able to make a deck for an event you will be stuck with the weak event dekcs. Just make the event deck good! Or let people combine the event dekc with their own cards, I played for around 6 weeks not once I was able to use my own deck nor did I have the resources to build a deck for an event, and often the event deck is so bad it's a pain to play it, like I didn't want to play the event at all. That's very bad.\n\n\nCould be a good game but so many simple things drag it down, most of it will never change because you can't take those corporate Ls, in corpo world you never make mistakes, delusional.",
