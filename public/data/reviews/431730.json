Other more general art/illustration apps like Photoshop, Krita, GIMP, Clip Studio Paint, etc can do similar pixel art things, but it's nice to have an editor SPECIFICALLY designed for pixel art rather than pixel art abilities being tacked on to an otherwise large suite. Basically, there's just less feature-creep in dedicated software such as this, which is nice for people who just want a plug-and-play solution for pixel art.\n\nAll the tools you are used to in other general image manipulation software is here, along with cool things like a timeline. Performance wise it's pretty good! It also works on Linux (I'm using Linux Mint 21.3 cinnamon) which is awesome too.",

I’ve tried other pixel art editors before, but Aseprite is the first one where I didn’t feel like I was fighting the software just to draw a line.\n\nAnimation is where it really shines. The timeline is simple but powerful, onion skinning works exactly how you expect, and making small adjustments frame-by-frame feels surprisingly smooth instead of tedious. You can tell the people who made this actually use it themselves.\n\nIt also runs great. No random lag, no weird crashes—just reliable, consistent performance. And little things like the color palette tools, custom brushes, and the overall workflow make a big difference once you start using it regularly.\n\nIf you’re into pixel art, whether you’re working on a game or just messing around, Aseprite is absolutely worth it. It’s one of those rare tools that makes creating fun instead of frustrating. Honestly, I wish more software was built this cleanly.\n\n5/5, no complaints.",
