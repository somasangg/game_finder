      "review": "Tekken 7 gets a lot of hate but I enjoy it a lot. It was a little bare on release but has quite a lot more content now, even Tekken Bowling makes a return. The story picks up from where 6 left off but ends with an amazing showdown between Heihachi and Kazuya and eventually Akuma from Street Fighter. That probably sounds stupid but they actually make it work lol.\n\nThis is the first Tekken game to not introduce any cool new characters aside from Kazumi. I for one have always wanted to see Kazuya’s mother and her appearance here is very epic as is her devil form and boss fight. Using a tiger in her move set is just beyond awesome. Beyond that though the new characters are all flops. Super uninteresting, nothing characters. Especially Noctis, waste of a guest slot.\n\nWe’re never going to get another game as good as Tekken Tag Tournament 2 or Tekken 5 but what’s here is still enjoyable and I’m just glad that Tekken still exists in today’s world even if it has succumbed to the fate of being FGC slop. I’m also glad Harada is still a working man in the industry, he’s one of the last great game designers of old. And yes, there are super moves in this one that function as a comeback mechanic. Makes me miss the days of rage mode in Tekken 6.\n\nI played the Xbone version at launch but played the Steam port much later. Had a lot of fun with both and they run great. Online modes never gave me much trouble either.\n\nAlso bonus points for any Tekken game that brings back Anna. Best character in the series, thank you Namco.",

The story mode is decent too, especially if you’ve followed the Mishima family drama.\n\nOverall, I’ve enjoyed my time with it a lot. Whether you’re new to fighting games or already familiar with Tekken, this one is definitely worth playing.",

      "review": "6/10 - Recommended but only on sale.  Tekken 3 is still better.\n\nNAMCO, I waited 8 years until your $110 game went on sale before I bought it.  You ask too much and offer too little to the player.  I will see you for Tekken 8 in 2032. \n\nI am 45 years old and I grew up in the days when teh arcade mode was the #1 attraction. I do not want to play online. The arcade mode is 5 matches long. It's disgusting. These games are not made for people who only want to play single player. Us old guys will always regard Tekken 3 as the best ever for good reason. Graphics don't matter. There was so much extra the NAMCO put in that game for ONE price that it was playable for a long time without online.\n\nThese days, every fighting game puts bare minimum into the single player game that it's not worth buying, especially when all in you're generally looking at well over $100. Street Fighter and Dead or Alive want like $300 for the full game. Tekken doesn't even bother to give you an ending (outside of credits) in the arcade mode anymore. \n\nTekken 7 is decent. The graphics look nice and they haven't yet added annoying moves that trigger a cut scene in the middle of a match like Tekken 8.  The treasure mode is \"meh.\"  You fight random fights and wins silly cosmetic things. I'd rather have a full-fledged arcade mode or a stiry mode where you can fight with your selected fighter and play through and get an unique ending with that character. \n\nOnline is the worth thing to happen to fighting games.  Honestly, you could sell me the full game for $70 with all the characters and stages and sell the online portion for another $30-40 and I'd be happy as hell. If you're going to piece meal the game, let the players decide what features they want to keep the price reasonable and not buy the junk they don't want.\n\nNAMCO, I will gladly pay $100 for your fighting game but don't confuse me with all your piece meal editions and put a proper arcade mode back in with unlockable characters earned through playing the game.  I don't mind it you want to keep characters that require a licensing deal behind a pay wall but not standard Tekken characters, please.",

      "review": "Tekken 7 is a 3D fighting game that concludes the long-running clash between Heihachi Mishima and his son Kazuya, framing its battles within a story of power, betrayal, and generational conflict. The narrative is presented through cinematic cutscenes and character vignettes, combining dramatic escalation with a grounded perspective from an investigative journalist. While the story is concise, it provides clear context for the series’ central feud.\n\nCombat builds on Tekken’s established foundation of precise movement, whiff punishment, and character-specific stances. The game introduces two key mechanics—Rage Art and Rage Drive—that give players powerful options when their health is low. These tools add comeback potential without overshadowing traditional fundamentals, allowing both new and experienced players to engage with the system effectively.\n\nThe roster includes a wide selection of returning characters alongside newcomers who bring distinct styles. Fighters such as Shaheen, Claudio, and Katarina introduce accessible entry points, while returning veterans retain the depth and complexity expected by long-time fans. Each character features a large movelist, enabling diverse playstyles and long-term mastery.\n\nStages are designed with interactive elements such as breakable floors, walls, and balcony transitions. These features allow players to extend combos or shift the momentum of a match, adding strategic layers to positioning. Visual themes range from industrial arenas to mystical temples, contributing to the atmosphere without compromising clarity during fights.\n\nOnline play uses rollback-inspired delay-based netcode, providing generally stable matches but with noticeable variation depending on connection quality. Ranked, player match, and tournament modes give structure to online engagement. Offline options—including arcade battles, treasure hunts, and customizable practice tools—offer consistent ways to refine skills and unlock cosmetic items.\n\nCustomization is extensive. Players can modify character outfits, accessories, and effects, giving the roster significant visual variety. While purely aesthetic, this system adds long-term goals outside of competitive progression and allows players to personalize their fighters within the game’s style framework.\n\nTekken 7 succeeds through its precise mechanics, broad roster, and balanced introduction of new systems. Its mix of accessibility and depth supports both casual play and high-level competition. For players seeking a polished, technical 3D fighter with strong character identity and refined gameplay, it remains one of the defining entries in the Tekken series.",

The roster is huge, so there’s always a new character to learn (or get destroyed by). Online can be hit or miss depending on who you match with, but when you get a good connection, the fights feel great.\n\nOn my RTX 4050 + Ryzen 7 HP Victus, it runs perfectly — 160+ FPS on high settings without any dips. This game is not very demanding, so it stays smooth no matter what’s happening on screen.\n\nPros\n\n✔ Fast, satisfying and intense combat\n✔ Massive roster with lots of variety\n✔ Great for both casuals and grinders\n\nCons\n\n✘ Online experience depends heavily on connection quality\n✘ Learning advanced combos can be tough\n✘ Story mode is decent but not amazing\n\nOverall: Tekken 7 is still one of the best fighting games out there. Super fun, easy to get into, hard to master — and it runs like butter on my laptop.",

Devs have no plans to counteract this issue even though it's been going on for years, from both tekken 7 now in 8. Terrible character balancing as well causes unfair gameplay at times. Stay away from this game to save yourself of money and stress.",

Full of cheaters, trash player quality , they just learn 3 moves and spam those over and over, you only ever see 3 characters in ranked, you can play for hours and only get matched with the same 2 cheaters you did the previous day. Tekken was once one of my favorite games in the world, i have been playing it since tekken 2, but now, the ranked experience is so bad, i can't even dare to recommend this to anyone. It's still fun to play with friends, but otherwise it's just not fun. You'll be wasting your time with lag hackers wishing for the match to end faster so you can log out.",
