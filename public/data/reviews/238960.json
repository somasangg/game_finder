      "review": "After spending 162 hours in Path of Exile, I can confidently say it is the best action RPG I have ever played. The depth and complexity of the game are remarkable, and the amount of endgame content is simply staggering. Just when I think I have seen everything, I discover something new, whether it is a fresh mechanic, a clever build idea, or another layer of progression that changes how I approach the game. The Atlas tree stands out as one of the most impressive systems in any ARPG. It gives you complete control over your endgame experience, allowing you to tailor your mapping and content to your preferred playstyle. Whether you enjoy delving into the mines, hunting bosses, or farming for loot, the Atlas tree makes every choice feel meaningful and rewarding. The gameplay itself is incredibly visceral and satisfying. Every build feels unique, every skill feels powerful once you invest in it, and combat always demands your attention. There is a real sense of weight and impact in every fight, and the satisfaction of seeing your build come together never gets old. Even after more than 160 hours, I still feel like I have only scratched the surface of what the game offers. Path of Exile rewards experimentation, planning, and a willingness to learn. It is a game that challenges you but also gives back tenfold in depth and enjoyment. If you are a fan of action RPGs and have not tried Path of Exile yet, you are missing out on something special. Be warned though, once you start, it is easy to lose track of time. This game pulls you in and does not let go.",

This game is tied as my favourite ARPG next to Van Helsing Final Cut and Grim Dawn. Titan Quest wasn't bad, but that was basically potion simulator 101.\n\nThis game took a different approach to how you gain skills and how you level those skills. I love this concept so much. You pick up gems and the gems grant the skills. If I recall correctly, I think Sacred 2 had the same system, but nonetheless, it works beautifully. Picking up armour and weapons now forces you to think a bit more about the skills and supporting skills you've got in order to min/max your character.\n\nLove the details in the game, looks absolutely gorgeous to this day still. Can't believe this game came out in 2013. If you are looking for an ARPG that holds up great against the giants by being one, I can highly recommend this gem.",

But back in 2015, 2018 and 2022 I played for many hours but couldn't get past the campaign. \r\nThen in december 2024 I opted into the early access of Path of Exile 2 and the game was (and still is) a great experience. So around christmas '24 I tried PoE again, but again I couldn't get past the campaign. The lack of the quality of life improvements and gameplay feel of PoE2 made it unenjoyable for me.\r\n\r\nNear the end of Mercenary league I made the plan to \"force\" myself into the endgame of PoE at least once. So I played Righteous Fire Chieftain, had good fun in the campaign and could explore some of the endgame. I enjoyed the time so I opted into the new league - Keepers of the Flame - and followed a build guide for Siege Ballista Hierophant. I had a blast during the campaign (even though it is very long) and now I'm in red maps, explored the Atlas 85/115 and I am thoroughly hooked. Overcoming the lack of gameplay polish that is present in PoE2 I acknowledge that PoE bit by bit is getting more QoL improvements.\r\n\r\nI think now it finally clicked with me. I found my jam with PoE and PoE2, no need for any other game anymore. Every two months I get to experience something new and improved in both games.",

I dislike the egregiously tedious itemization and crafting system. \n\nImagine a world where 80% of loot drops are trash. 15% are crafting fodder, which will have you running back and forth to vendors. And the remaining %5 are items of interest. That's POE. \n\nI feel like the developers of this game forgot they were making an ARPG and instead made a nut collecting simulator for squirrels, except the nuts are various crafting materials and the squirrels are US. \n\nAlso, all currency is interchangeable via the currency exchange. Therefore, loot variety is an illusion. I would much prefer \"gold\" or some singular progression currency be dropped instead of hundreds of different objects that have to be collected, sorted, managed in your inventory, etc. \n\nIn the end game, you can even have NPC's play the game for you by running maps in Path of Exile Ville. I felt excited when those NPC bros reported back with loot. \"A Chaos Orb!\" I exclaimed. That's when I realized how bad the grindyness of this game is. What a relief it was that an NPC was able to do the crafting materials chores for me! \n\nAlso, build variety and freedom is... kind of a myth? I seems like the balance of the game corrals you into narrower sets of choices than the immense passive skill tree would have you believe. Many builds won't work at all. Many skills are garbage. In the earlier parts of the game, you can get away with a lot more. However, when the game gets difficult at the end, you'll find yourself squeezing out every inefficiency from your build, and that will lead you to the realization that the vast majority of builds are doomed to not scale to the end game.  \n\nI love ARPG's. I think POE has advanced the genre, but it's not the pinnacle of the category. I think there was a lot of genius behind this game, but they got lost along the way. We ARPG players want to develop our characters, explore cool places, collect cool gear, and kick ass. We don't want to play Path of Exile Ville; we don't want to play inventory manager 900.",

It’s an action RPG that throws you into a continent of murder, misery, and morally questionable NPCs, and says:\n [b]“Good luck, exile. Try not to explode.”[/b]\n[h2][b]The Tutorial Is a Lie[/b][/h2]\nThe game starts off beautifully: you wake up on a beach, beat up some zombies, walk into town, and think, “Hey, this isn’t so bad.”\n Then you open the [b]Skill Tree[/b], which looks less like a progression system and more like the [b]Hadron Collider sneezed onto graph paper[/b].\nYou want to build a fire mage? Cool, here’s 400 nodes. One of them is good. The others give you things like +10 to Intelligence, +12% to Fire Damage, or the ability to accidentally brick your entire build without realizing it for 30 hours.\nAnd yet… I keep returning.\n[h2][b]Loot: A Never-Ending Rain of Questionable Decisions[/b][/h2]\nNo other game produces quite the same emotional rollercoaster as seeing 500 items explode out of a monster like it just swallowed a garage sale. Ninety-nine percent of the loot is garbage, but you pick it up anyway because:\n[list]\n\t[*]It [i]might[/i] be good.\n\t[*]It [i]might[/i] sell for currency.\n\t[*]It [i]might[/i] be vendor trash but you’re too emotionally weak to leave it behind.\n[/list]\nEvery time I open my stash, it looks like a dragon hoarded random garbage instead of gold.\nI don’t even know how half of it works. “Fractured Influenced Synthesized Eldritch Rare” sounds like a medical condition, not an item type.\n[h2][b]Monsters: Highly Trained Assassins[/b][/h2]\nPoE monsters, especially in endgame, are like Olympic athletes of violence. They don’t approach you slowly. They don’t threaten you dramatically. They just appear, blink twice, and your character folds like a lawn chair in a hurricane.\nI’ve been one-shot so many times I’m convinced the mobs are unionized and receive bonuses for creative death animations.\n[b]Off-screen goat leaps[/b] are the true final boss of this game.\n Sirus? Shaper? Elder? Nah.\n A goat on a cliff somewhere in Act 2 is the real menace.\n[h2][b]Mapping: The Endgame Where You Pretend You Know What You’re Doing[/b][/h2]\nOnce you finish the campaign (or skip it because you’ve already done it more times than you've showered this week), you arrive at the [b]Atlas[/b], where PoE hands you 500 combinations of mechanics and says, “Pick your poison.”\nYou can:\n[list]\n\t[*]Farm currency like a responsible adult\n\t[*]Run Heists with NPCs who all sound like they belong in a D&D tavern\n\t[*]Go Delving, aka “torchlit cave sprinting while everything screams at you”\n\t[*]Fight bosses who politely inform you that “resistance is futile, exile”\n\t[*]Or spend 40 minutes rolling a map just to die in the first pack anyway\n[/list]\nIt’s like a theme park run entirely by caffeinated mad scientists.\n[h2][b]NPCs: Questionable People with Great Voice Acting[/b][/h2]\nEvery NPC looks like they haven't slept since Act 1, and they all deliver their lines as if they’re auditioning for a grimdark Shakespeare production. Meanwhile, I'm standing there with a helmet that looks like a cosmic basketball court on fire, nodding like I understand lore I definitely do not.\n[h2][b]The Real Endgame: Your Hideout[/b][/h2]\nSome players decorate their hideout with beauty, elegance, symmetry.\nMine looks like a garage where several wizards died fighting over interior design choices.\n[h2][b]In Conclusion: Chaos, Pain, Joy[/b][/h2]\nPath of Exile is a game where:\n[list]\n\t[*][b]Your build will fail.[/b]\n\t[*][b]Your first 30 hours will be confusion.[/b]\n\t[*][b]Your next 300 hours will be slightly more informed confusion.[/b]\n\t[*][b]You will die. Constantly.[/b]\n\t[*][b]And you will keep coming back.[/b]\n[/list]\nPoE isn’t a game.\n It’s a lifestyle.\n A hobby.\n A second job you pay for in brain cells.\n A place where math, violence, and fashion collide in perfect harmony.",

In a game that is all about builds and build-crafting, you get punished extremely heavily for attempting to step outside of meta builds. The other issue with endgame is 95% of deaths are to insane 1-shots. Most of the time it's very hard to know what you died to. This leads to deaths being even more frustrating due to not being able to improve your character in a more concrete way. Most upgrades to my character after a few deaths tend to be more broad defensive upgrades based on stats. Mostly feels like meaningless gameplay that only leads to frustration.",

Like Im SORRY BUT GRINDING GEAR GAMES SHOULD STAND FOR GANGBANG GRAPE AND GREPEAT. now that that is out of my system\n\nSO if you dont have this full skill tree wipe how can you undo your mistaken or wrong choices on the tree, well i will tell you that Unless you have been grinding every single map killing every thing for 10 hours a day the likelyhood aside from buying gold from a website selling it is squat. It costs about 4-5k gold to gain a skill removal token, at endgame your looking at around 100 skills you have spent. if your thinking to yourself that thats not too bad sure if you didnt get gold at a rate of 20-50% drop chance for each monster you kill granting you less than 20 per drop in act 1, less than 30 in act 2 and up to 50 in act 3. so looking at the math each point you need to undo is gonna be ground out at 80-300 drops of gold at the 50% or less drop chance while in act 3.

PoE when I first played it was a crappy but interesting ARPG you could put a week or two into every few years and zone out on some maps and areas. Now, there are 15 different events that pop up on every single area. Yeah, you can ignore these 'pop ups', but now you are missing out on currency and possibly upgrades. \n\nThese 'pop ups' basically ruin the game for anyone who is an adult and not some Twitch chair gremlin micropener. The game loses any atmosphere it had and just feels clunky, cheap, and FOMO'ey. But we live with this new generation of buffoons who can't go 1.2 seconds without a dopamine hit, so there needs to be special chests and events popping up literally every 5 seconds of speedfarming. It's horrible. \n\nEven Diablo 4 trashes this game. Stick to older ARPGs that aren't super bloated with boring currency mechanics designed to keep the user enslaved to the game.",

      "review": "Path of Exile 1 is a great game trapped inside a technical framework that feels like it was built without long-term thinking or real engineering discipline.\n\nThe developers keep stacking new systems, new calculations, and massive on-screen load without ever proving they can handle the fundamentals. If you can’t design scalable systems or maintain server stability, you shouldn’t keep piling more complexity on top — it only exposes the weaknesses even more.\n\nThe result is the same: lag spikes, server stutter, desync, and performance issues that follow you no matter your hardware. Once high pack size, multiple league mechanics, or heavy monster density appear, the game stops feeling like an ARPG and starts feeling like a stress test for bad infrastructure.\n\nWhat’s most painful is that it feels like the team doesn’t understand their own engine anymore. The systems don’t work together, the servers can’t keep up, and the technical debt is so obvious that players can predict exactly when the game will break. That kind of failure doesn’t come from lack of resources — it comes from lack of direction.\n\nAnd to make it worse, there’s the long-standing issue that regular players constantly struggle with lag while certain streamers seem to enjoy perfectly smooth performance. Whether it’s priority servers, special queue placement, or some form of backend favoritism, the outcome is the same: one group gets flawless gameplay while everyone else suffers. That disparity alone speaks volumes about where the attention goes — and where it doesn’t.\n\nIf the people responsible for these core systems truly believe this level of performance is acceptable, then that alone says everything. Sometimes the hardest truth is this: when a team refuses to improve the basics, it’s a sign they’ve reached the limits of what they can do.\n\nThe game is brilliant at its core, but the technical foundation is so poorly handled it overshadows everything good about it.",

I am unable to find any gems that will work in the armor or shield slots. (All the gems I have found or seen from vendors are for weapons only and the descriptions are lacking in how the gems will interact with each other. Everything is guess work and I am unable to tell certain gems even do anything).\r\n\r\nYou get an arm that you need to graft to your body ... but how to do that? Fortunately the steam community told me how to equip it (it was hidden box on the left side of the inventory screen). Updating this arm is also confusing and complicated. \r\n\r\nItems tale up way to much space in the inventory which is very limited and you can't increase the size of you backpack. I read that this is due to the designers wanting players to carefully choose what items to pick up. Problem with this ... you need to be able to sell items in your inventory to gain trade currency so you can buy stuff. You also need to sell stuff from inventory so you can get wisdom scrolls so you can identify items.\r\n\r\nThere is no way reliable way to return to towns/camps to sell inventory. Portal scrolls are few and far between. Way points are also few and far between. If you run back to town, then everything resets and you have to start exploring the area(s) again.\r\n\r\nThe game doesn't save area progress and if you leave an area you have completed the area resets and you have to do the whole area again.\r\n\r\nIf you fail a quest, that is it. You can't get the quest back, restart it, and if it is a quest that you need to progress the story ... well, the only option I found is to delete the character and start all over again.\r\n\r\nItems that you need to use (scroll of wisdom to identify items, town portals, and other items to improve gear) is also currency to buy/upgrade gear. The gold you find is basically useless because you can only gamble it for unknown items.\r\n\r\nI bought the map board. (Spent real money on this). After I bought it, I found out that it was worthless because you can only use it after you finish the campaign.

If you are recording the game with OBS and you change the game resolution, the game will crash. Shortly before crashing it will show an message box mentioning \"swapchains\", recording with OBS and suggesting the use of the Window capture mode. Reality check: the game is not capturable in Window Capture (read: enjoy the black screen) with OBS. Reality Check 2: no other game has issues with OBS recording, not even the cheapest indie games. Clearly the developers do not know the basics.\n\n2. Changing the sound channel amount requires a restart.\n\n3. Changing the Direct X mode requires a restart. What is this - Windows 95 era software design of restarting after every minor change. Also, most other games let you select the DX mode BEFORE you start the 50-gigabyte software.\n\n4. DX 12 mode (default) takes up about 4.0 gigabytes in the menu. What is this - designed by Ubisoft?\n\n5. DX 11 mode takes about 2.0 gigabytes of RAM in the menu. WTF does the difference of a DX version double the memory requirements and why is the more demanding one default and why cannot you select it before booting the software.\n\n6. POE utilizes the same anti-pattern design as the criticized The Crew games with the centralized server for no reason. That means when the service is terminated, your purchases are rendered worthless. Everything - including the menus - has the loading swirly as if I was accessing a website in 1996 with a dial-up connection.\n\nOh that centralized server issue became apparent instantly. \"Connection disconnected unexpedtedly.\"\n\n7. Why is the game still stuck with the mouse-click-based controls when you have a keyboard with directional inputs. Why make a 50 gig game with such a mobile game control scheme. It is not 1997 anymore - it is almost 30 years already. A single-unit  control scheme should not be the same as an RTS game.\n\n8. The massive skill tree makes locating the skills you want as difficult as possible. Sure you can use the \"search\", though all it does is highlight the matching skill names a little. It is barely noticeably. Why not instead do the basic CTRL+F function even a Windows f-ing Notepad can do and take you to the first entry. It does not even tell you how many matches you got. It is completely useless.\n\n9. The classes are poorly explained. At the beginning you are given a choice between half a dozen obscure class titles such as 'duelist', 'ranger' and 'marauder.' What you are not told is that the class choice affects what ultimate second classes you can pick because apparently they are tied to those specific classes. All builds are based on the unexplained second-tier classes and you are not told what class you should pick to access a specific Tier 2 one. Why hide the essential information. This is such a lose-lose design that helps no one.\n\n10. The game runs like garbage especially in villages and where other people are located at. It quickly becomes a low-performance diorama. If you just want to play the game and not get frame-rate-nerfed by the mere vicinity of other players, you are going to feel the lack of a genuine single-player mode.\n\nThe real reason for why the single player mode is not there is because they cannot sell you ultimately worthless microtransactions if you are not connected to their server. That is right: 1. the game calls it a \"microtransaction shop\" and 2. you are not connecting to the game - you are connecting to the store front. The gameplay areas are simply a sideshow for the worthless bit dealing to take away lonely players cope money.\n\n11. The game lacks direction. Much like in MOBAs such as League of Legends, you are expected to simply know what you must do and the game will give you nothing while expecting you to already know everything or to look up guides to make sense out of the vapid nothingness the game is. There really is no plot - the enemies are there mostly to be target practice for the skills and to drop something (useless).\n\n12. The obsession with hordes from Diablo 3 is here. Even in the beginning are you are really met with enemy groups smaller that four. In the end game footage people are blasting entire screens full of mobs with one move. When you make the mass monster nuking into a recurring occurrence, it gets old fast and stops being fun. It is as if the game is telling you: \"look at how much you murdered, now like this game and go to the microtransaction shop and like every item there by buying everything there - IN TRIPLICATES!!\"\n\nI get the feeling the developers are not the best. Especially not at game design. They managed to rip off also the bad parts from Diablo III. Like they say:  some people cannot grasp and create their own things, so all they end up doing is mindlessly stealing things in hopes of replicating the success.\n\nPOE feels so bad I would rather try Diablo III instead and that game is a snorefest.\n\nThis game might appeal to you if you have lots and lots of money and an itty-bitty tiny ego.\n\n\"What were they thinking?\" -AVGN",

But now, years later when I want to play it again with a MUCH better computer, all it does is stutter and crash, taking me back to the home screen. Guess they updated it so that you got to have a top tier gaming rig, or maybe it's that their servers just suck. Either way - all I know is that I can longer play it.
