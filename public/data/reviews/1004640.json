      "review": "When I was a kid, this was one of my favorite games on the PS1. Top 20 for that console. This \"enhanced\" version isn't really enhanced other than the voice overs, texture upscaling, model cleaning \"updated models for level geometry with less seamlines, better UV maps\". Everything else has already been done via mods and the like. The \"enhanced\" version actually has less content than the PS1 and PSP versions but that isn't for this part of the review. I also didn't fully play the classic version yet that was stated it would be an untouched true equivalent to the PS1 version. If you were unable to get the game originally and currently having trouble with playing it or simply don't want to use emulation, then this is probably the way to go. It isn't bad. I have minor issues with it that are for \"personal\" tastes such as the new user interface but again that is a personal issue and doesn't take away from the game at all. I can't really say anything too negative  about it other than us being blatantly scammed out and lied to about the additional content that was in the PSP version that is actually in the game files for the enhanced version. The following is a rant that that has nothing to do with the review. I still love the game and even this version.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This is the soap box standing rant because I am mad about all the unused or clipped out content\"\r\nThey lied about the content from the PSP version not being originally added or worked on because the characters from the PSP version \"their sprites, mechanics, job classes, etc\" are all in the game files. This pisses me off greatly. With time I can make a mod for the game that enables or adds everything and probably will even be able to put the original scenarios and more back into the game since almost everything is already in the game files as is or some cut outs of said data.  Balthier is in the game and is 100% functional. The only thing he is missing is text dialogue and voice acting. The voice acting being abscent is obvious why. They were already \"upscaling\" and cleaning up the PSP characters/classes along with multi player mode.... They lied to everyone. If I had to guess, it was money, time frame, voice acting, or even some odd in house licensing issue. The classes such as Dark Knight, Onion Knight, the PSP exclusive missions for multi player mode, story scenarious... it is all there in the files. Luso works fine. I tested him. All of it works fine. They had it about 80% complete. When I say ALL the PSP content is there, I mean it.. Is all there. To avoid spoilers, I will say the return of a dead character as a dark knight and the \"Dark/black\" dragon boss are in the game files. Even some exclusive multi player enemies such as a specific witch that only uses daggers, has her full kit usable though buggy and has the enemy A.I for the fight set. Why do all that if you had no intention of putting it all in the game? They lied in the interviews..... Lied a lot. We probably will never get the real answer.",

Playing as Ramza Beoulve, the youngest sibling of the Beoulve brothers, a noble house, you strike to solve the conflicts of the region caused after losing the Fifty Years War against the neighbor nation Ordallia and the sudden death of the current king, leaving a mere boy to ascend the throne, and with the spot for a regent that started a dispute between two candidates: dukes Goltanna and Larg, what it will be known as the War of the Lions. Will Ramza being able to overcome it? Will his noble blood turns against the commoners?\n\n「[i]This vile charade has gone on long enough. It ends now![/i]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3604481216\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3604481216[/url] \n[hr][/hr]\n[h2]                  ✧ Positive aspects ⇁[/h2]\n[hr][/hr]\nThis release made me so excitet, since Final Fantasy Tactics A2 was my first contact to a TRPG genre as a kid, and even if it wasn't the OG clicked on me so hard, playing Advance a year later and playing the PSP version 'War of the Lions' few years later as a teenager, becoming one of my favorite series as a Final Fantasy lover, and this title the one with the most written stories. The enhanced edition is just amazing, specially for the voice acting, I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end and it was a nostalgia since last time I played it was a decade ago.I'm happy Square enix finally took the decision to make a remaster of this, and I hope we can see more older titles to have remasters, as a sign of gaming preservation.\n\n\n➢ [i]Improved quality graphics[/i]. It is hard to improve significally a game that was produced in 1997, so I think I should be flexible with it. The comparision between both of them is decently enough to see an upgrade, and I think it does very well, and even if it doesn't stand out for modern TRPG games, it's hard to be harsh with a game produced more than 20 years ago that it makes the effort to be respectful with the original source.\n\n\n➢ [i]Outstanding narrative[/i]. One of my favorite narrative in the Final Fantasy franchise with the best script from WoL with some new adjustments, althought I gotta admit I did not play all of their games ([i]yet[/i]), but and without a doubt, one of the top ones. With a heavily political story telling about corrpution, loyalty, betrayal and a war of classes between the commoners and the wealthy ones. A light woke up to bright up the darkness and set up justice, but the path won't be easy and fair. Peace will be done with rivers of blood.\n\n\n➢ [i]Incredible voice acting[/i]. Without a doubt, one of the best additions and my favorite one, I freaking loved the voice acting. They not only did a great decision in the casting, but the actors itself made a spectacularr work, putting emphasize and soul on the characters they were choosen to interpret. Just pure chefkiss.\n\n\n➢ [i]Tons of QoL improvements[/i]. Fast-forward button, job balancing, hard mode (called Tactician), skippeable random battles, easier way to poach thanks to the retry option, impoved UI and menus, stuff we needed to enjoy a classic with modern features. \n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h2]                  ✧ Negative aspects ⇁[/h2]\n[hr][/hr]\nEven though I love they made a remaster, I am not enterily happy with this exact version,  and even if I would love to say only positive stuff, this is a review and I pursue to make them fair, as much as I can, and some decisions they made ended up turning it into a disappointment. \n\n➢ [i]Content from WoL not added[/i]. Even if they used the translation for it, they did not add anything more, something that piss me off. I don't understand why make a non-full release content even if it was made by a different team, and doesn't do justice for the amount of people who enjoyed that version when it came out. I hope this is just a strategy to release it as a DLC (that could be a horrible decision), but It made me be not happy at all with it.\n\n➢ [i]A bit expensive[/i]. I usually refrain to add price as something enterily negative, and more just as a final suggestion of what I think it could be a better purchase with the amount of content/quality provides at the end, and it doesn't justifice it with the known quality of it, it doesn't reach the quality of the Dragon Quest remakes imo. I think 35-40€/$ would be a better pricing for it.\n\n\n➢ [i]Underwhelming Tactician mode[/i]. It was suppose to be 'hard', but It ended up being just a increase of enemies stats. That in some ways it makes it \"harder\", but I expect on a strategy game that the battles will be harder due to the different strategy the enemies will have. I would never be a fan of hard modes where the resource to make it hard is just play with the stats.\n\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3604481392\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3604481392[/url] \n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h2]                🏆Achievement hunting ⇁[/h2]\n[hr][/hr]\nI like so much when achievements are not tied up to difficulties, so for any that doesn't want to suffer, specially newcomers to the game, you can complete the game on easy, and in terms of how hard it is to complete, not really. There are few messy achievements but they are not extremely hard, and luckily not misseable at all. \n\nI would point out that there is a bug for 'Master of All Trades', that if you have a character with all the abilities learned except the unlocked ones 'Zodiark' and 'Ultima' (for Ramza), and it is the last you unlock, the achievement won't pop up, in order to acomplish it you need to masterize it after learning an extra ability after those ones. This is by far the best guide btw:\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3577722448\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h2]                ▫ ◨ ▪ FINAL THOUGHTS ▪ ◧ ▫[/h2]\n[hr][/hr]\nI can say without a doubt, this is one of the best TRPGs ever made, as a huge fan of this genre and this franchise, and I heavily recommend it to anyone. Although, this version disappointed me, upon being hyped for this release I was expecting something better and that same hype punched me in the face when the results didn't came as expected. I think that's what pushed down some of the veteran fans, not enterily liking it. I agree with it, but I think it is still an amazing version that can be easily improved in the future, and with the WoL content added in the future, if Square Enix wants (please!).\n\nI would love to give it a round 10/10, and the game deserve it, but this exact version can't hold that score sadly, so sorry if some people doesn't like it but I need to be fair in order to being able to receive a better product. \n\n[table]\n               [tr]\n                             [th] ◈ Overall Score ◈ [/th]\n                             [th] /ᐠ - ˕ -マ [/th]\n               [/tr]\n              [tr]\n                             [td]8/10[/td]\n                             [td] One of the best TRPGs ever created, sadly not the full content version and some bad production decisions I can't support[/td]                           \n              [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[table] [tr] [th] If you liked this review, a follow on my [url= https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45740937/] curator [/url] will help me a lot!

I wasn't sure if I'd drop everything to play a game i've played a bunch but the changes really made this feel like I was playing it for the first time again. I'm gonna try to avoid spoilers and break down what I think is good, what I think is a miss, and what I think is just ok and what makes this version worth playing over the others.\r\n\r\nGeneral thoughts before I get into the pros/cons:\r\nThis is a beautiful game about the corruption of those in power and of privilege. An important game with an important reminder that kindness does prevail in the face of evil, even if it takes a long time.\r\n\r\nLets start with the big improvements,  the UI and controls are huge quality of life improvements, just makes the game more fun and easier for new players to understand.  Just a flat improvement there.\r\n\r\nThe biggest improvement for me though? The voice acting. I'll be honest I kinda slept on it, I didn't think too much of it despite the VO for Tactice Ogre: Reborn also making that game great but the performances in this game KILL it, I have felt feelings I have never felt before in my other playthroughs, I'm a bit astounded by how much it truly adds to the experience even as someone who doesn't really have a preference in the text vs VO debate. \r\n\r\nAnother small new thing is that many characters now have additional dialog, some of which is *extremely* good, adding a lot of character, I just really don't understand the decision to not put the WotL stuff in this, it makes the package feel incomplete and I miss the expanded sections with Delita and a few other sidequests the lack of the wotl content is the only major thing that keeps me from calling this a nearly perfect release.\r\n\r\nA lot of characters, namely Cloud, have gotten buffed or adjusted significantly it makes everyone feel more fun to use and therefore more variety in playthroughs!  \r\n\r\nOne other thing that I kinda wish was different: this game has the beautiful cutscenes from WotL with the new awesome dub, thats great, but they are tucked in the chronicle menu, I wish they either played automatically or had an option for the player to decide which version of scenes they'd rather see, perhaps a mod will come along that will auto-play the cutscenes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinished 100% all achievements, honestly the jp gain could probably still be increased further especially as this game has no endgame the grind to max out all jobs is kinda taxing.",

TIC, though a remake rather than a simple remaster, introduces a large number of quality of life improvements without losing sight of the source material. Better graphics, greatly improved audio quality, a more user-friendly UI, and even a number of combat improvements set this game apart from prior iterations of Final Fantasy Tactics.\r\n\r\nThe voice acting, which I must admit to having had low expectations of coming in, turned out to be surprisingly good. I'm not going to say it's flawless, but it is most definitely a cut above what we've come to expect of older games brought up to today's standards. I really can't knock it.\r\n\r\nIf I had one complaint, it would be the developers choosing to omit all the extra characters and content added to the War of the Lions version of FFT. While TIC doesn't really /need/ it, I do feel its inclusion would've made for a greatly improved overall experience.

      "review": "Final Fantasy Tactics is truly one of the most unique entries in the entire franchise. The characters are rich and memorable, the narrative is deeply layered and emotionally gripping, and the music is nothing short of sublime. The difficulty isn’t just there for challenge—it enhances the gravity of the plot. When a mercenary you’ve trained and leveled up dies, they’re gone—permanently. It adds real stakes to every battle.\n\nI remember losing my level 35 Ninja during a boss fight. I was furious… but it was also epic. He died for a cause, and his sacrifice made the story feel that much more intense. Now I have to level up another sellsword? So what? That’s part of the experience, and I’m loving every second of it.\n\nThe art style is stunning—stylized yet timeless—and the pixel graphics still hold up beautifully. The music is iconic; I can still hear the battle preparation theme playing in my head. It’s unforgettable. The bosses are no joke, the side quests are meaningful, and the way the game expands the lore of Ivalice is genius. When characters mention things like flying ships and magic, my eyes light up: “Ooh! They’re talking about the Final Fantasy XII era!”\n\nThis game completely drew me in. I’d look at the clock and hate how much time had passed because I never wanted to stop playing. It’s absolutely worth every minute.\n\nIn my opinion, Final Fantasy Tactics might be the best Final Fantasy game in terms of world-building, characters, and writing. I genuinely hope we see more games set in the Ivalice universe. There's still so much potential in this world.",

I'm delighted to say that this has not disappointed at all. In addition to being a wonderful nostalgia trip for me, this is just solidly a really great game and a great remaster of it. The story, the characters, the atmosphere, and the music all come together to make this game a really special experience. I loved it when I was younger, and revisiting it now and being able to appreciate more of the nuance in the story is really rewarding. It's a story that still has an alarming amount of relevance today. And the soundtrack is probably one of my personal favourites of any game.\r\n\r\nAs remasters go, it's lovely - it doesn't overdo anything, just sharpens and gives some quality of life improvements to the graphics and interface, but not so much that it feels like a different game or like it's been overly tampered with. If you grew up with the PS1 version, there's the option to play it in 'classic mode' but even playing in the new remastered mode will still feel perfectly familiar. The biggest functional change is that it's now fully voice-acted (which again, you can avoid through 'classic mode' if you wish), and personally I think they've done a superb job of it. The acting feels natural yet passionate. The entire game is a beautiful journey that manages to be a classic Final Fantasy sword and sorcery adventure, while venturing through political intrigue, class warfare, and philosophy. For all these heavy topics it takes itself appropriately seriously to be a hard-hitting high fantasy, but without taking it to a 'Game of Thrones' style excess. It makes you care, but keeps it fun.\r\n\r\nI love this game. I think they've done a great job in bringing it back, and I'm so glad they finally have. I hope you'll love it too.",

The music is as brilliant as I remember and I'm much more appreciative of the writing now than when I played the original (at the wee age of ten, mind you). Not quite done playing through TIC yet but I don't anticipate being disappointed by the later chapters based on what I've seen so far. Highly, [b]highly[/b] recommend!\n\n[b]Should old fans pick this one up? Yes! Here's why:[/b]\n+ The English voice acting is pretty good! Especially Delita imo, and Argath's VA knows exactly how to make you hate him. My 10yo self didn't read the original game text in British but my adult self finds their use of posh accents for the nobility and rougher accents for commoners to be a rather nice touch.\n+ The roster menu has a built-in job unlock tree that shows you all the requirements for each class, which is a very welcome QoL update. (I don't recall the original PS1 game having it but forgive me if I'm mistaken.)\n+ The speed button, by the gods the [b]speed button[/b]—an amazing QoL update. As someone that played the original on a PS1 with an ever-diminishing attention span, it's all I'd ever ask for in a remaster.\n\n[b]Should you become a new fan? Yes! Here's why:[/b]\n+ The writing is brilliant! The story is compelling and timeless, and the tonal consistency really does wonders for pulling you into its vibrant world. Also enhancing it is the prominent use of leitmotif, allowing this story to be a feast for eyes and ears both, which leads me to...\n+ The music! The soundtrack does an excellent job of framing the story and setting the mood—so much so that I still remember many of the tunes 20+ years later. The woodwinds are beautifully calming, the strings are haunting, the French horns are bold, and the chiming of the bells is otherworldly. I'd describe this orchestral masterpiece of a soundtrack as simply [i]transcendent[/i].\n+ The gameplay is unlike any other turn-based tactical RPG I've played. Each character can change to any job (or class), which drives the primary combat abilities available to that character. After learning abilities from other jobs, you can mix and match combat abilities as well as reaction/support/movement abilities from other classes. A mage that's mastered both black and white magicks? Sure! A bulkily armoured knight given thiefly movement and abilities? Why not? A samurai that can nag your enemies until they join you? Hell yeah. What results is that each of your roster feels like they have their own unique identity that you're building them toward, which gives life to even the generic (non-unique/non-story) characters that still chose to dedicate their lives to your cause.\n\nDidn't intend to make this too long but good gods do I love this game ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ",

I've heard some horror stories from friends about the old version.  But this one has been a joy to play.  Sure some fights will totally destroy you the first time and you have to go back and reevaluate your party, classes, gear, and strategy.

This game is a faithful recreation of the former with modernized visuals, localization, and the ancillary benefits that simply being newer brings.\r\n\r\nFor those who haven't played the game, the story follows an unsung hero who was deliberately omitted from history during one of the greatest conflicts the continent had ever seen. Why was he omitted? Well, you'll have to go find out. Or search online, but I recommend experiencing it for yourself.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay itself features a party of hero characters with selectable class and subclass combinations where you tailor your characters to play and fulfill any role of your choosing. Whether you win or lose battles is up to your strategy and tenacity more than any other factor. Do you have what it takes to shape history?",

I am completely fine with it.\n\nThis is the one of my favourite games since I was little, and this is the definitive version.",

Having finally had a chance to play it with this modernised vision of the game it is clear to see why, and it continues to stand among the best games made even after all these years and with thousands of other games to compete with.\n\nWith a clear inspiration of the War of the Roses as a backdrop, the game tells a strong story with numerous twists. This is improved from the original version with the help of voice acting, which helps bring the story to life like never before. A fresh lick of paint helps keep the graphics fresh and modernises them, which keeping the original graphics and options available for those who wish to take a trip down the nostalgia road. There is plenty of gameplay for your money and I was hooked from the start.\n\nThe only real complaint that seems valid for the game is the lack of additional content which was included in the Game Boy Advance Release. However, mods featuring this content is available to be added to the game, and even without it I never found myself lacking things to do.\n\nA great game which is fully deserving of its reputation.",

Honestly, I think it deserves to become a staple feature in future Final Fantasy games.\n\nIt’s just a bit of a shame because the game clearly has room for further improvements and additions across many elements, especially with Yasumi Matsuno being involved again in its development. From what I can see, The Ivalice Chronicle is really meant as a preservation effort. And as someone who has finished the original FFT on PS1 and War of the Lions on PSP, you won’t find any truly new experiences here, just nostalgia presented in a smoother, more enjoyable way to play.\n\nBut for anyone who’s never played FFT before, this might be the best version to experience, your chance to see one of the most mature entries in the entire Final Fantasy series.",

Also there are no filters like scanlines / CRT\n* Denuvo\nAnd knowing square, they probably won't ever change this, but all these things are very minor and you should still play this game.\n\nTo the people that are saying the voice acting is bad--  wtf??",

There are numberless permutations of classes & abilities to tinker with here and planning and iterating on a squad over the course of a campaign is a joy. I also love all the little esoteric 1997 game design choices -- this game has a stat named Bravery that has some useful functions, such as dictating the chance that your passive abilities will trigger on reaction, but also, if it descends below a certain threshold your unit will become a chicken and desert the party forever. Likewise, if a unit becomes too Faithful, they'll also leave the party, having grown too pious for the battlefield. The early game tends to descend into a party of squires throwing rocks at each other for incidental XP and there's a set of formulas dictating which units are most compatible w/ one another based on their zodiac sign. This is all weird, tasty stuff in my book. I hadn't played this one before and in acquainting myself with the body of FFT academia on GameFAQs, Reddit, etc. it became so tangibly clear to me how people have eschewed so many other video games to just replay this bad boy ad nauseam. \n\nIt's not just the mechanics either, this game's got a Narrative, man. They wrote this in 1997 and it's more relevant to society than ever. It's maybe a little one-note with its wordy highborn medieval turns of phrase but the script is fantastically written and its themes have aged tremendously well. Maybe it also gets lost slightly when the party is fighting arcane demons brought forth from ancient magic stones, but its explorations of class, society, royalty, religion, family, etc. are all pretty well articulated. I still need to check a few of them off the list, but I think it's fair to claim that not many other Final Fantasy games have this much to say. \n\nThis version is also the cleanest that this game's ever been presented. Its diorama-esque maps look great, it's been rebalanced slightly (but not to the extent that the flavorful 1997 jank has been tuned out), and it's got voice acting this time. And it's good! Everyone really does the Old English justice. And there's an encyclopedia in there! It's got lore, maps, character biographies, and every game mechanic meticulously explained. For everything else, consult GameFAQs, those guys have been playing this game for 28 years and many of their online dissertations apply just as readily to this version as well.

This game is a ton of fun to play. There's so many different strategies you can come up with because of the cool job system and the nice abilities the different jobs get. Musically, the game has a fantastic soundtrack. The story could be said to be a top 10 of all times. This game's story explores deep themes of morality, societal issues and classism and Delita could be said to be one of the best written characters in any RPG game. Flaws of the game are that new characters you create at the pub only come at level 1 even towards the end of the game so you'll have to level generic units up if you want to make a generic unit character at the end of the game and some of the boss fights have very weird gimmicks like instant death attacks or status effect moves that if you're not ready for can make the boss fights super annoying.

In fact, experiencing it again today (both in Ivalice and in the real world) only highlights just how far ahead of its time this narrative truly was. Some stories fade when you revisit them, but Tactics has only grown stronger. \n\nThe Ivalice Chronicles updates polish every edge of the experience without compromising what made the original so special. Smoother menus, smarter shortcuts, and modern refinements like the on-screen turn order make playing feel effortless while still preserving the soul of the game. The voice acting brings a level of immersion that I didn't quite realize how much I wanted. \n\nFor anyone wondering about Steam Deck performance: it runs flawlessly. The controls feel natural and the pacing of the tactical battles is perfect for handheld play. I’ve been bouncing between my PC and Deck seamlessly, and both feel like a definitive way to experience this classic.\n\nIf you’ve never played Final Fantasy Tactics, this is the moment. If you have?

The first version to come out with no significant bugs since the original psx release, and the first version to come out in the US with the Sound Novels intact. These may just be light novel CYOA side-stories, but they are significant pieces of world-building which enrich Ivalice far more than the minor changes to dialogue here and there.\r\n\r\nThe changes to poaching make it a far more satisfying system. Tactician mode, while it doesn't sound like a big change to the game on paper, makes it feel significantly more satisfying to play.\r\n\r\nSome people loved the War of the Lions content. They like to have more things. Fair enough. But the new characters, the new fights, and the new classes significantly cheapened the world building. They were like the comic book version of The Prisoner -- superfluous, thoughtless fluff tacked on to a complete and well-realized piece of art to make a quick buck at the expense of the artist.\r\n\r\nWhen you look at preserving one of the only games ever made that could be considered art, you want to respect the holistic experience of new people coming in and enjoying it for the first time. You cut it to the bone, and you sharpen what's left -- that's the way of art.\r\n\r\nThe way of games may be to Katamari everything you have into a gacha-ready sphere, but by NOT doing that, Matsuno and Square have made a statement about how much they respect you as an audience. \r\n\r\nThey respect that you wouldn't just see Luso appear in Ivalice and think \"cool character me get\". but that questions would occur to you about who this child is, where he comes from, and why he would sacrifice his life to war. They respect that if you saw Algus brought back to life you wouldn't be pleased to kill him again, but terrified at the prospect that all of the battles Heroes fight will come to naught against the vain art of the necromancer.\r\n\r\nThey respect that you can look at Gaffgarion and know for a fact that he did not take 8 levels in black mage.\r\n\r\nLike finding a copy of 100 years of solitude or T.S. Eliot's poems in the 50 cent bin at a used book store, buying this is an absolute no-brainer if you don't already own a copy.",

Novice to the series as a whole or not, this game is extremely modernized and streamlined in a way that old ff fans and new would enjoy this game regardless of their familiarity with the series. This game has an extremely beautiful style in their remaster, from the UI overhaul, sprite changes, and overall more textured and beautiful art this game does great in its visual departments. Audio wise this version is so unbelievably king its unreal, the soundtrack remaster + enhanced versions are amazing as all FF soundtracks tend to be, and on the other side the major seller here is the fully voice acted characters and additional more intelligently written script. Holy crap I saw some comparisons to the original and even some of the WOTL content and this game gaps them by a mile for storytelling of this story specifically. Speaking of WOTL content, after delving deeper into what truly differs, this game actually does have most of what WOTL had to offer besides the two jobs and 2-3 extra missions. Much of the content that made it more appealing then the original ps1 game has actually been added such as the cell shaded cutscenes, theyre all fully available in game, HD remaster and are voice acted by the new cast who do a fantastic job. Gameplay wise this game feels great to play, I did not truly have a difficult moment with this game in hindsight the two things i got stuck on for a little bit I just had to reposition or grind a little more, the many jobs, skills, and mixing/matching you can do with all of them give this game massive replayability and you can even give yourself some self inflicted rules for the game to have an even more fun time like ranged only or solo ramza anything that might tickle your fancy in that regard. The story is understandably also quite captivating in conjunction with the rest of the additions, i enjoy the dialogue they use a lot in this game it reminds me of Elizabethean english texts in a sense where they aren’t using much modern dialogue to really immerse yourself which is often overlooked in this type of environment, I can’t really review the story without major spoilers but it really is good and on par if not better than many of the really good main hits from the FF series. This game really is a banger year for games. I don't have much negative to say about this, it’d be cool if they added Dark Knight and Onion Knight later. I'd even buy it as a small DLC if needed but honestly the game is so great without that stuff its completely small and un-needed. If you are interested in tactics I cannot recommend this game and version more, certainly the definitive edition if you hail story and immersion over all, its quite a faithful upgrade to a beloved entry in the final fantasy franchise.",

But all they did was slap on a coat of paint and add VA. The VA is good, but represents a very small part of the experience. They didn't even update the map textures. This isn't the remake it was billed as and that breaks my heart.\n\nWhy not 'remake' Dark Knight/Onion Knight to fit the game better? Why not 'remake' the rendezvous system so it's playable offline like modders did? Why not 'remake' jank systems like monster breeding or beastmaster skills? Why not 'remake' the cutscenes from WotL? Why not 'remake' pointless equipment like the Dragon Rod to create more build diversity? Why not 'remake' my hopes and dreams so I don't believe in Square and thus won't be disappointed by them in the future? Wait, they actually did that one.\n\nThis 'remake' is a joke. It did considerably less to change the game than Tactics Ogre: Reborn. It has less content than WotL did. Let me remind you that this is the same studio that did FF7R. It's not moddable for ages thanks to Denuvo and will probably never have the kind of modding scene the PSX version does. Square wants you, dedicated SRPG lover, to know  that they'll give you a remaster at best every 10 years to monetize your nostalgia but they'll never actually give you a sequel to Matsuno's classics.

I don't mind grinding either when it's fun but keeping a mob alive to smack him around for 30 minutes to power level a job is not my idea of fun.\n\nThe story is really good though, but even that falters in comparison to tactics ogre because you don't have multiple paths throughout the story.

But honestly  disappointed that I spent money on this as many others did purely on nostalgia because as I started playing it I realized it's seriously just the old game but with somehow a worse UI.\n\nThe Good:\n\nThe voice acting is superb and everyone involved with that should be proud.\nAlso the option to skip or force an encounter at already visited locations is a HUGE QOL update that makes grinding for xp/jp way WAY less frustrating.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe UI to get around in the party management screen is somehow worse and involves a lot more button clicks than before as you're trying to see what a character has learned, how many jp they have in a certain class, learning those skill and equipping them.  I don't understand how they could have somehow made that process LESS streamlined, but they did.\n\nMy biggest letdown was that for all these years later and paying what I paid for it how little new there was.  I was hyped for a remastered version not only to play a classic, but to see how they made it fresh and new again...and there was nothing.  In fact there was LESS for this than what they put in the mobile version War of the Lions.  That version had fully animated cut scenes (which aren't in this game) a new job class (not in this) and even a new named special character (nadda).\n\nThey polished it up and made it less pixelated, but still left the same tired spell effects and moves without updating anything.  Same still-life non-animated summons and ear jarring spell effects when a spell hits that sound nothing like what it's trying to depict.  Meanwhile, games like Disgaea that came out over 20 years ago have amazing animated moves and spell effects in the same genre that put this game to shame.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm glad a lot of people are getting to play this for the first time, but I personally feel cheated that I paid full price for a game that somehow feels like less effort was put in it than the same game someone could get on their phone for $14 bucks.

The game has a really good story, but there are so many absolutely horrible mechanics and systems in the game that detract from the fun more than the positives and narrative adds to it. \n\n-It uses a similar leveling/XP system to FF2 (Which is notoriously the worst final fantasy BECAUSE of its leveling/XP system). \n-The game does not allow you to pause/restart a fight unless it is your turn, so sometimes I end up sitting and waiting for 30seconds for every enemy/ally npc/dialogue to go before I can restart a fight that I know is lost. \n-The loot system ends up being you running around in circles for 3 turns waiting for bodies to disappear so you can get the loot. \n-There is a lot of imbalance between the classes, some felt completely useless except a few specific niche uses, while some like the Monk and Black Mage seem much stronger than the majority of other classes.\n-JP boost feels almost mandatory as it about doubles JP gained, means the passive slot is always JP boost.

      "review": "TLDR\n------\n(Try WoTL first. If you already have and are looking for more then don't bother with this. The Voice acting is decent, but not worth the price. Overall grade imo is D)\n\nReasoning\n-----------\n\nA very decent remaster of the PSX version of FFT. The voice acting excellent - If that intrigues you then this game may be for you despite the high price tag.\n\nThe long and short of it is that I am very unsatisfied at the high price while being mostly inferior to War of The Lions in every way. It would be very easy for the developer and dev-team to add a third version featuring War of The Lions and even unlock certain balanced aspects of that game into the new Enhanced PC port. The version selection menu on startup missing that is a slap in the face to us.\n\nThe fact that the additional classes are totally omitted is pretty bad. The fact that the additional characters are omitted is really bad. The straw breaking the camel's back is that all content related to existing characters that appeared in WoTL & PS1 OG is also entirely omitted, not to mention there being zero whisper of indication of competition via PVP connection and rewards for online victories. \n\nIf you enjoyed the online aspect of WoTL you can also be sure there is no sign of that either NOR will you be enjoying this version on your Android and Apple devices (nor SteamDeck b/c of aggressive/invasive DRM from what I hear); in my opinion this is the most egregious of the arrogant errors that SQEnix made while producing this remake of a beloved classic. This is connected already on Steam on PC and XBoX Live and PSN, so IMO omitting any PVP and online play yet still charging the premium price is absolutely absurd, not to mention greedy.\n\nGet yourself a copy of the WoTL version. It's just better (assuming you patch out the animation/spells slowdowns).\n\nIn conclusion, if you want to get some excellent voice acting version of the classic PS1 game you loved or you perhaps never before played FFT then this will mostly be a B- or better experience for you despite the price. If you were expecting anything other than a very vanilla remake you will also be upset you ended up paying so much.\n\nD grade overall for taking advantage of the hype over a beloved classic getting remade but delivering a generic inferior version that is unnecessarily Single Player Only. This is me being charitable.",

      "review": "A well made, voice acted, remaster of an excellent story. Personally, and I can say unfortunately, this game pisses me off, and I have stopped playing a few chapters in.\n\nI loved Tactics Advance as a kid, and appreciate the customizability compared to a game like Fire Emblem. However three specific things make me kind of hate Tactics. The zodiac system, the magic system, and the overall design of class progression.\n\nThe zodiac system adds random percentage to hit or miss baked into every character. The details of this system are buried under menus, are not clearly explained to the character, and overall have too much effect. 50% reduced accuracy for a bad zodiac, something you can't change, and is just inherent, is terrible design in my opinion. There is a reason you don't see it in future games.\n\nThe magic system fires after a delay of several turns, and white magic can miss your own characters. The delay of magic makes them unreliable, as enemies can move out of a targeted area, or if directly targeted, move next to a friendly unit, maybe hitting them as well. White magic is subject to accuracy. With the previously mentioned zodiac system, you can have sub 50% accuracy for healing or revival spells. Both these mechanics are frustrating, and there is a reason you don't see them in future games.\n\nAll xp in this game is tied to actions taken during turns. All abilities for classes are available from the start of the game, and cost xp. This is a plus for some people, It is a deep negative for me. This system encourages minmax behavior which is efficient but inherently unfun. Behaviors like farming single maps for hours with repeatable healing spells or buffs to farm xp until a class is maxed. Future games award job xp for completing maps, and individual abilities are tied to equipment, the introduction of which paces out class progression throughout the game. There is a reason this was changed in future games.\n\nCreating new teammates to resolve the above issues is also very punishing, as all new characters start at level one with no catchup mechanics. New characters will always be however many hours of progression behind your other characters. They change this in future games.\n\nAs someone new to this game; Who did not know about zodiac until 15 hours into the game. Who chose several magic users. Who spent several hours grinding abilities, just to have essentially bricked characters because of their poor zodiac alignments; This game pisses me off. \n\nStory seemed amazing, wish the mechanics of the game didn't make me angry every time I tried to boot it up.",

      "review": "A remake for the old guard who have nostalgia for the game, for new players, like me, be forewarned. \n\nThis is a game about builds and grinding, as often times you will be thrown into progression gates that require you to grind out jobs and classes in a way that you're not going to know, or be able to deal with in your first blind playthrough. There is no real room for clever tactics, player experimentation or fast thinking - if you do not grind enough or know the exact solution to the combat puzzle, you are as good as dead. Off to the world map to fight generic mooks in a slow, repetitive grind, and off to Google to find a build guide. \n\nI think this is where player opinions will split, I know a ton of people who enjoy power grinding and build crafting but for me the rigidness and poor encounter balance really took the wind out the sails of the game. It is, to be fair, a game from the 90s, the era of the Prima strategy guide, but even the 'new version' featured in the remake still holds this design philosophy... and as a personal note, I really don't like having to resort to a guide during my first playthrough of anything. Where's the fun to be had if I'm just reading gaming's equivalent of flatpack furniture instructions? \n\nDespite my experience, I can see why people hold the game as a classic, it looks great, the music and sound design is fantastic and the much beloved story was enjoyable from what I had experienced of it. The new voice acting has a very... radio drama, quality to it which adds overall to the experience, characters will go on flowery speeches and offer up some swashbuckling barbs at one another which is all enhanced by the acting.\n\nTo me, this game reminds me of Majora's Mask and Banjo Tooie. Great, but flawed nostalgic experiences that for new players are perhaps more fun to read about than to actually play, and sink hours and hours into.\n\nTLDR; you do actually need throw stones at your friends to progress.",

      "review": "Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles takes place chronologically after the events of Final Fantasy XII, with a war ravaged Ivalice in the midst of rising political unrest. The protagonist, Ramza Beoulve, is a squire to one of the main military families which rules over the region, and largely naive to the abuse the common folk have endured. Accompanied by his friend Delita, the two set off on a quest to save Ramza's sister, who is kidnapped as part of a political move by a rival faction. Unfortunately, these events end in tragedy, which lead to Ramza abandoning his house, and becoming entangled in The War of the Lions, a battle for power over the throne.\n\nClearly inspired by The War of the Roses, much of the story involves Ramza's experiences with oppressed common folk, who resent nobility for their over taxation, and cruel treatment. The story begins to pivot towards a more Final Fantasy direction when it becomes known that twelve mysterious \"Zodiac Crystals\" contain immense power, which could turn the war in the favor of whomever possesses them. Ramza, having witnessed the inhumane danger these crystals possess, thus rallies a band of allies to his cause to stop them from being used for evil. \n\nThe dialogue presents a nice backdrop of political intrigue along with interpersonal conflicts between Ramza's idealism and the oppressed citizens. While I enjoyed the writing for the first two chapters, I felt it became significantly less interesting after Chapter III, particularly as the cast grew ever larger in size, and it became difficult to keep track of characters who appear for all of one or two scenes only to be assassinated less than an hour later. The seiyuu do a good job with their roles, though many feel type cast at this point for work they've done in anime. Nevertheless, if one does have a chance to play, I'd suggest the JP language. For those who speak Japanese, they'll also pick up on some subtle differences in the way the scripts were written in Japanese, compared to how they were translated into English. Yet again another confusing instance of Square Enix inconsistently translating their scripts.\n\n\nRamza commands a crew of mercenaries who start as standard Final Fantasy based job archetypes. Each job performs differently in battle, with Knights having large health pools and greater physical damage, whereas Black Mages specialize in magical attacks from afar. As characters gain \"job experience\" they can unlock additional abilities from their job skill tree. Characters can have an active job and a passive job, meaning they can mix skills from multiple job trees to create a spell slinging Monk, or a heavy armor wearing Ninja. \n\nCombat takes place in mission format combat encounters across a relatively small field of combat, heavily relying upon verticality to create diverse combat encounters atop roof tops, or within swamps. Nearly all the RPG knowledge one has from other Final Fantasy games translate to tactics, with spells like Reflect preventing magic from being cast on a character, and all the common status effects being present. Frustratingly the missions in Final Fantasy Tactics feel incredibly one note, with very little variety on the objectives, other than just \"kill this person\" or \"kill all these people,\" which limits the utility of a number of the Jobs.\n\nUnfortunately, I found there to be many issues with Final Fantasy Tactics. The game did not feel like it was paced correctly for its story relative to the job and level experiences expected of the player. Leveling up feels meaningless because players can do it by literally just standing on a map and talking to themselves for an hour. Basically, characters gain experience for their level and job experience for their job by \"doing things\" during a mission. While this could mean attacking enemies or healing allies, it can also be accomplished by tasks which have no resource limit component, such as the Squire ability Focus. A player could start a random encounter and end it instantly, or they could sit there and just gain free levels until level 99. There are many other tactical RPGs I've played where this is addressed by carefully balancing main story encounters with optional missions, making the whole RPG growth aspect feel rather lazy.\n\nLeveling up characters feels even more useless when Act IV comes around, and suddenly everyone and their grandmother decides they want to join your party, and all are unique characters. Final Fantasy Tactics has a bizarre method of recruiting allies, which seems to pin their level to the highest party member on your team at the time of recruitment. In practice, this meant that everyone who joined my party towards the end of the game were not only wildly stronger than my original party, but also came with absurd unique skills making them hard to pass up on a team. \n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics does not feel tactical, as building a good party is basically pointless, and the \"solution\" to every combat encounter seemed to just be to use a character with Arithmeticks. It was such a frustratingly hollow experience when I reached the final boss, and realized there was no point bringing any of my initial companions who I'd spend dozens of hours training, when this dragon I recruited on a whim on the last mission did 999 guaranteed damage, and using a companion ability, I could double that before the boss even got a turn. It just felt... bad, like nothing I'd done in the game mattered by the end.\n\nWhile Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles is praiseworthy for its production value as a tactical RPG, there are many aspects which I did not mesh well with. For me, this would not necessarily be something I'd be quick to recommend to others, even fans of the tactical RPG genre. However, I did still enjoy my time with it, even though I find it silly that a mission involving chocobos was harder than the final boss for me.",

This remaster is worth it at $20-30. Full price is not worth it. I really wish steam would let us do a \"meh\" or neutral review. In the future, for my random play through I will most likely go back to a modded previous version. This is probably the best way for someone to get the story and back ground information. For everything else, it is worse.\n\nThe Good:\nFinally on PC\nScript is probably the best FFT translation we have ever had\nAdditional story stuff is great\nSpeed up is good to have (Should be a toggle)\nSome of the VAs do amazing work and it really adds to the game\nCan ignore random battles\nThe poaching office just functions better\nTurn order on side of the battle is great. Wish it was more navigatable while selecting skills.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe controls are a down grade. Both in and out of battle. Makes navigating and looking at everything significantly harder. Original game looking at the battlefield and enemy stats is a button press. Here you jump through menus. Does not let you change or modify them.\nSpeed up is not toggle-able, spent most of the game holding down R1.\nRemoved all the end-game stuff added in WotL/Mobile version, effectively removing any point of grinding or continuing past the story. The mobile showed they could do single player additional content, but chose to remove it here.\n\"Tactician mode\" is just a damage modifier. It doesnt make it harder, it makes glass cannon builds less viable. Immortal/Tank builds just dominate more.\nEnemy/Guest AI feels like it has changed for the worse? While it was neat seeing enemies doing different things, outside of  very specific situations they seemed to make worse decisions. The Summoners in particular didnt summon in my play through, they focused on doing everything but, despite the fact I was doing a high-faith magic build this run through and they would have done a ton of damage. The final battle was the only fight I felt was harder, but at that point it really doesnt matter.\nThe tutorials are beyond excessive. It went from whatever to aggravating extremely quickly. Literally everything has a tutorial. Most notable going to inventory and getting \"This is your inventory,\"\n\n\nThe Ugly:\nThe sprites are a down grade from the mobile version. Just straight up worse. No details, weird smoothing. the best complement you can give a remaster is \"this looks just like I remember.\" This does not hit that. \nA lot of the scenery lighting does nothing to help show off the work that was done and makes a lot of the scenes a lot less memorable. Instead of having a room people are acting in you have a small section that is highlighted and rest faded away. It makes a lot of the scenes seem smaller and gives the impression they are trying to hide the scenery.\nYou can turn this off, but the \"focus\" setting that is turned on by default is horrible. It takes the already low detail sprites and makes them worse. Its especially bad in cut scenes as the camera and focus jumps around forcing any lingering gaze to be stuck on unfocused blurry sprites.\nA lot of things do look better. The treasures, the locations you can find, everything in the \"chronicles\" Everything in engine looks underwhelming, and not what I would expect. \nThe content the DID add is paid for items. The only notable ones are Sprite changes for Ramza only, and a ring that gives you Gained JP Up. Making the only changes to the game locked behind spending more money is distasteful.",

For a $50 price tag, it just doesn’t compare to what you’d get from other titles in terms of content. I mean, even the deluxe edition gives you… skins? C’mon man...\n\nI completely understand not wanting to take too much away from the original, but there were so many opportunities for side content to be added naturally without detracting from the main story. And the extra side content that was added was just… lacking (the book quests, for example). It would’ve been cool to see some areas unlocked in the errands — at least a nod to FFXII, — anything!\n\nThere’s an entire subplot in the game hinted at through errands, talking about how the world used to be this technological wonder that fell apart.

Probably if you've played before you'll fast forward through it and not miss it.  No doubt they'll sell those missing pieces as DLC down the line.  The game shows its console roots both graphically and in a woefully incomplete control port which is missing view tilt that was included in previous versions.  If you played this before, you can imagine how annoying that is already.  If you're just joining us now, you'll get it the first time a unit is obscured by terrain and you think \"if only I could tilt the view 45 degrees, I could see the whole board\".  The new tactical view only mitigates this lack a little since after all these years the game still has trouble distinguishing which cell was clicked, even on PC where you really ought to be able to use your mouse to make it very clear, even without the ability to tilt the view.  Among the most galling parts is how little of the content is new here.  Like Bethesda and Blizzard, they're taking a game that was good and porting it to modern formats while doing the bare minimum to make the game compatible.  So, they can just sell you the same game over and over and float on the nostalgia instead of making something new or even doing so much as a good mod group to add to the game.  It's lazy and the price you pay ought to reflect that.  If you played this before, buy it on sale after they put back all the content they've held back to get the nostalgia fix you crave.  If you never played it before, you'll get more if you wait to buy this until it is on sale with all content in a year or two.\r\n\r\nUntil then, you'll find a version with more content available on mobile devices.",

I LOVE FFT, but around 8 hours in I'm just not seeing nearly enough to call this anything other than a shiny port. \r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, if you have never played FFT then BUY THIS NOW. Or on another platform. It is one of the greatest turn-based RPGs ever made, with a powerful political storyline that was making betrayal and intrigue cool long before Game of Thrones. The job based progression is almost flawless and rewards experimentation and grinding with the ability to cobble together skillsets and passive abilities from across jobs/classes.\r\n\r\nThe voice acting is pretty good so far. I do like it, and it adds some emotional resonance to the story sequences. I do not like the talking heads in the chat boxes while they are speaking; these look cheap and unexpressive. \r\n\r\nThe QoL is far less than I expected and outside of the ability to change difficulties anytime I don't know that I've seen anything impressive in that area.\r\n\r\nThe sprites look far better in screenshots than in 1440p. They aren't bad, but the psuedo-retro, partially polished, just feels like someone put a screening layer over them as opposed to really improving them. After seeing the work in the 2.5 HD games I really expected these to be better looking and they aren't. They aren't bad as far as retro games go, but paying a full premium for the game I expected some real investment into the graphics and this falls flat to me. \r\n\r\nHopefully the modding community can come up with some really cool injections of functionality and sprites. In the meantime, I'm going to play through and enjoy the game, but want people to come into it eyes wide open.",

(YMMV.) \r\n\r\nAs a diehard fan, I was most excited by the upgraded difficulty, but sadly it's the laziest implementation possible. Enemies just deal (and take) less damage. There's no AI improvement, no altered abilities or cool special boss modes. It's just a flat +40% damage done, -40% damage taken. The frustrating part about it is that it doesn't even really make the game harder. After a handful of \"challenging\" fights, you just outlevel the content. Almost like making enemies take 5 hits to kill instead of 2 in a game where the number of hits you deal out is how you level up was a bad idea. \r\n\r\nTL;dr : Wait for a sale unless you're just dying to hear what over-dramatized Ramza sounds like.",

You have less units available in battle so there's seemingly no point in curating your army like in Tactics Ogre. I really enjoyed the little Airship story, the little side systems are cool like poaching and the creature breeding but the actual core of the game is heavily flawed. Boss fights are just bad game design relying on prior knowledge or retrying long 3 stage back to back battles because you only realize at the end that you're not strong enough or don't have the right items/abilities to clear it. I don't mind grinding either when it's fun but keeping a mob alive to smack him around for 30 minutes to power level a job is not my idea of fun.\n\nThe story is really good though, but even that falters in comparison to tactics ogre because you don't have multiple paths throughout the story. (Stopping playing at chapter 4 maybe that changes after but i'm at 40+ hours that's more time than some of my favorite games.)

The OG game is quite possibly my favorite TSRPG and the ogre battle guy at the top of his game during the Square golden age in the late 90s (you had to be alive then, it was actually insane the streak Square had).\n\nPros:\n\n+ It has the original version playable with it.\n- But they just did a lazy non-integer upscale on it, so it is really rough.\n\n+ Configurable difficulty. The original was pretty steep and unforgiving - it is a nice option for those who aren't veterans of the genre.\n\nNeutral:\n\n= English voices aren't bad but aren't great either. If you have to have voices this is a plus, but if you played the OG like me and like the text the VA isn't good enough to add anything.\n\n= It has some minor censorship where they removed Male/Female... but other than that it isn't really present (not that there was much to censor in the first place).\n\n= The upscaling in the new version is..... OK. The sprites look decent (with a few minor exceptions) but some of the original aesthetic is lost as some of the shadowing and overcast is not present. So, it is a net neutral here for me.\n\n= You can't name the hero in the new version. Not a big deal for me but for roleplayers that's a big deal.\n\nCons:\n\n- Muffled audio. Supposedly a result of losing the source code, but they could've put in a little bit of effort to fix it; this is $50 after all!\n\n- 2-3 second delay on every enemy attack (in between showing the skill name and the attack start; where it shows the possible damage of the attack). You can skip this by mashing A/confirm but it wasn't in the original and is really annoying. There should REALLY, and I mean REALLY be an option to turn this off, and that's another issue with this is a distinct lack of configurability.\n\n- REALLY lazy standard fonts that if you played the original really detract from the experience. This is one of the first things you will notice and is a huge sign that they didn't even put in the minimum effort to have it look in line with the original's aesthetics.\n\n- New translation removes a lot the \"old english\" language flair that helped make it distinct. \n+ The OG version included has the old english language in it, which is nice. \n\n- Its got that \"Electron UI\" look for the new UI parts (infamous javascript UI library) that, again, detracts a bit.\n\n- Microstutter in some FMVs. Not a result of framerate it seems to be in the video file itself (lol?).\n\n- You can configure the keyboard... but only 11 keys. Some keys have multiple uses and it is unclear what exactly you are configuring sometimes.\n- Also you can't seem to configure keys until AFTER the first battle.\n\n- If you order the Deluxe edition (or preordered) you can change Ramza's suit color. They somehow messed this up by making you SLOWLY cycle through each color and waiting about 3 seconds each time for a flickering light. Also in the suit preview it has some weird shadowing on it.\n\n- OG version only: For some BIZARRE reason they decided to add subtitles to some FMVs. Why is this bizarre? Because they added subtitles to ALL TEXT FMVs. It's subtitles to text. Make it make sense!\n\n- New translation has some odd translation errors. K for C in some places et al",

You shouldn't have to press a button to skip the obnoxious UI popup before every enemy attack, or hold down a button for a game speed up.\n\nThere's just a whole bunch of little UI things that bother me, enough to bring up.  I appreciate them doing this sort of ground-up rebuild/recode of the entire game engine, but so much of it defies standard UI and option practices.  \n\n- Targeting & accuracy pop-up before every enemy action, with no toggle to turn it off, and need to press confirm to skip through it rather than waiting.  It isn't some quick thing, it adds two seconds to each AI attack.\n- Fast forward only when holding down a button, with no toggle, or setting for what multiplier it should be.\n- Resets auto-advance on every cutscene, including simple scene transitions.\n- Dithering filter is fine as a default, but what people want will differ greatly on screen size and circumstance.  I really notice it on my OLED monitor, but on LED TV I think it is fine and think it contributes to the CRT feel they went with for the sprite upscaling.\n- No camera speed option, or settings for when it rotates.  It just leads to extra pauses as the camera rotates before an action plays out.\n- No ability to move when in the overhead tactical view.  Why?  A lot of the camera stuff are solved problems.\n- No scene skip option, instead the player has to just hold down R1 to speed things along.\n\nThe good news is that since this isn't just some assembly code port, these are all fixable. The bad news is that I have no idea on whether the developers genuinely care about any of these things.  Still, there's not really any argument to be made for people to play the older versions of FFT.  The lack of move cancel, lack of auto save, and absolutely bullshit random encounters will probably get 80% of people to give up on the game, and then the point of no return brick points would finish off a decent chunk of the rest.   They really did fix a ton of critical problems in this recreation of the game, but there's still some obvious work that should be done before I can recommend it to a 2025 audience.",

But honestly  disappointed that I spent money on this as many others did purely on nostalgia because as I started playing it I realized it's seriously just the old game but with somehow a worse UI.\n\nThe Good:\n\nThe voice acting is superb and everyone involved with that should be proud.\nAlso the option to skip or force an encounter at already visited locations is a HUGE QOL update that makes grinding for xp/jp way WAY less frustrating.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe UI to get around in the party management screen is somehow worse and involves a lot more button clicks than before as you're trying to see what a character has learned, how many jp they have in a certain class, learning those skill and equipping them.  I don't understand how they could have somehow made that process LESS streamlined, but they did.\n\nMy biggest letdown was that for all these years later and paying what I paid for it how little new there was.  I was hyped for a remastered version not only to play a classic, but to see how they made it fresh and new again...and there was nothing.  In fact there was LESS for this than what they put in the mobile version War of the Lions.  That version had fully animated cut scenes (which aren't in this game) a new job class (not in this) and even a new named special character (nadda).\n\nThey polished it up and made it less pixelated, but still left the same tired spell effects and moves without updating anything.  Same still-life non-animated summons and ear jarring spell effects when a spell hits that sound nothing like what it's trying to depict.  Meanwhile, games like Disgaea that came out over 20 years ago have amazing animated moves and spell effects in the same genre that put this game to shame.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm glad a lot of people are getting to play this for the first time, but I personally feel cheated that I paid full price for a game that somehow feels like less effort was put in it than the same game someone could get on their phone for $14 bucks.

The game has a really good story, but there are so many absolutely horrible mechanics and systems in the game that detract from the fun more than the positives and narrative adds to it. \n\n-It uses a similar leveling/XP system to FF2 (Which is notoriously the worst final fantasy BECAUSE of its leveling/XP system). \n-The game does not allow you to pause/restart a fight unless it is your turn, so sometimes I end up sitting and waiting for 30seconds for every enemy/ally npc/dialogue to go before I can restart a fight that I know is lost. \n-The loot system ends up being you running around in circles for 3 turns waiting for bodies to disappear so you can get the loot. \n-There is a lot of imbalance between the classes, some felt completely useless except a few specific niche uses, while some like the Monk and Black Mage seem much stronger than the majority of other classes.\n-JP boost feels almost mandatory as it about doubles JP gained, means the passive slot is always JP boost.

Overall grade imo is D)\n\nReasoning\n-----------\n\nA very decent remaster of the PSX version of FFT. The voice acting excellent - If that intrigues you then this game may be for you despite the high price tag.\n\nThe long and short of it is that I am very unsatisfied at the high price while being mostly inferior to War of The Lions in every way. It would be very easy for the developer and dev-team to add a third version featuring War of The Lions and even unlock certain balanced aspects of that game into the new Enhanced PC port. The version selection menu on startup missing that is a slap in the face to us.\n\nThe fact that the additional classes are totally omitted is pretty bad. The fact that the additional characters are omitted is really bad. The straw breaking the camel's back is that all content related to existing characters that appeared in WoTL & PS1 OG is also entirely omitted, not to mention there being zero whisper of indication of competition via PVP connection and rewards for online victories. \n\nIf you enjoyed the online aspect of WoTL you can also be sure there is no sign of that either NOR will you be enjoying this version on your Android and Apple devices (nor SteamDeck b/c of aggressive/invasive DRM from what I hear); in my opinion this is the most egregious of the arrogant errors that SQEnix made while producing this remake of a beloved classic. This is connected already on Steam on PC and XBoX Live and PSN, so IMO omitting any PVP and online play yet still charging the premium price is absolutely absurd, not to mention greedy.\n\nGet yourself a copy of the WoTL version. It's just better (assuming you patch out the animation/spells slowdowns).\n\nIn conclusion, if you want to get some excellent voice acting version of the classic PS1 game you loved or you perhaps never before played FFT then this will mostly be a B- or better experience for you despite the price. If you were expecting anything other than a very vanilla remake you will also be upset you ended up paying so much.\n\nD grade overall for taking advantage of the hype over a beloved classic getting remade but delivering a generic inferior version that is unnecessarily Single Player Only.

Personally, and I can say unfortunately, this game pisses me off, and I have stopped playing a few chapters in.\n\nI loved Tactics Advance as a kid, and appreciate the customizability compared to a game like Fire Emblem. However three specific things make me kind of hate Tactics. The zodiac system, the magic system, and the overall design of class progression.\n\nThe zodiac system adds random percentage to hit or miss baked into every character. The details of this system are buried under menus, are not clearly explained to the character, and overall have too much effect. 50% reduced accuracy for a bad zodiac, something you can't change, and is just inherent, is terrible design in my opinion. There is a reason you don't see it in future games.\n\nThe magic system fires after a delay of several turns, and white magic can miss your own characters. The delay of magic makes them unreliable, as enemies can move out of a targeted area, or if directly targeted, move next to a friendly unit, maybe hitting them as well. White magic is subject to accuracy. With the previously mentioned zodiac system, you can have sub 50% accuracy for healing or revival spells. Both these mechanics are frustrating, and there is a reason you don't see them in future games.\n\nAll xp in this game is tied to actions taken during turns. All abilities for classes are available from the start of the game, and cost xp. This is a plus for some people, It is a deep negative for me. This system encourages minmax behavior which is efficient but inherently unfun. Behaviors like farming single maps for hours with repeatable healing spells or buffs to farm xp until a class is maxed. Future games award job xp for completing maps, and individual abilities are tied to equipment, the introduction of which paces out class progression throughout the game. There is a reason this was changed in future games.\n\nCreating new teammates to resolve the above issues is also very punishing, as all new characters start at level one with no catchup mechanics. New characters will always be however many hours of progression behind your other characters. They change this in future games.\n\nAs someone new to this game; Who did not know about zodiac until 15 hours into the game. Who chose several magic users. Who spent several hours grinding abilities, just to have essentially bricked characters because of their poor zodiac alignments; This game pisses me off. \n\nStory seemed amazing, wish the mechanics of the game didn't make me angry every time I tried to boot it up.",

There is no real room for clever tactics, player experimentation or fast thinking - if you do not grind enough or know the exact solution to the combat puzzle, you are as good as dead. Off to the world map to fight generic mooks in a slow, repetitive grind, and off to Google to find a build guide. \n\nI think this is where player opinions will split, I know a ton of people who enjoy power grinding and build crafting but for me the rigidness and poor encounter balance really took the wind out the sails of the game. It is, to be fair, a game from the 90s, the era of the Prima strategy guide, but even the 'new version' featured in the remake still holds this design philosophy... and as a personal note, I really don't like having to resort to a guide during my first playthrough of anything. Where's the fun to be had if I'm just reading gaming's equivalent of flatpack furniture instructions? \n\nDespite my experience, I can see why people hold the game as a classic, it looks great, the music and sound design is fantastic and the much beloved story was enjoyable from what I had experienced of it. The new voice acting has a very... radio drama, quality to it which adds overall to the experience, characters will go on flowery speeches and offer up some swashbuckling barbs at one another which is all enhanced by the acting.\n\nTo me, this game reminds me of Majora's Mask and Banjo Tooie.

The protagonist, Ramza Beoulve, is a squire to one of the main military families which rules over the region, and largely naive to the abuse the common folk have endured. Accompanied by his friend Delita, the two set off on a quest to save Ramza's sister, who is kidnapped as part of a political move by a rival faction. Unfortunately, these events end in tragedy, which lead to Ramza abandoning his house, and becoming entangled in The War of the Lions, a battle for power over the throne.\n\nClearly inspired by The War of the Roses, much of the story involves Ramza's experiences with oppressed common folk, who resent nobility for their over taxation, and cruel treatment. The story begins to pivot towards a more Final Fantasy direction when it becomes known that twelve mysterious \"Zodiac Crystals\" contain immense power, which could turn the war in the favor of whomever possesses them. Ramza, having witnessed the inhumane danger these crystals possess, thus rallies a band of allies to his cause to stop them from being used for evil. \n\nThe dialogue presents a nice backdrop of political intrigue along with interpersonal conflicts between Ramza's idealism and the oppressed citizens. While I enjoyed the writing for the first two chapters, I felt it became significantly less interesting after Chapter III, particularly as the cast grew ever larger in size, and it became difficult to keep track of characters who appear for all of one or two scenes only to be assassinated less than an hour later. The seiyuu do a good job with their roles, though many feel type cast at this point for work they've done in anime. Nevertheless, if one does have a chance to play, I'd suggest the JP language. For those who speak Japanese, they'll also pick up on some subtle differences in the way the scripts were written in Japanese, compared to how they were translated into English. Yet again another confusing instance of Square Enix inconsistently translating their scripts.\n\n\nRamza commands a crew of mercenaries who start as standard Final Fantasy based job archetypes. Each job performs differently in battle, with Knights having large health pools and greater physical damage, whereas Black Mages specialize in magical attacks from afar. As characters gain \"job experience\" they can unlock additional abilities from their job skill tree. Characters can have an active job and a passive job, meaning they can mix skills from multiple job trees to create a spell slinging Monk, or a heavy armor wearing Ninja. \n\nCombat takes place in mission format combat encounters across a relatively small field of combat, heavily relying upon verticality to create diverse combat encounters atop roof tops, or within swamps. Nearly all the RPG knowledge one has from other Final Fantasy games translate to tactics, with spells like Reflect preventing magic from being cast on a character, and all the common status effects being present. Frustratingly the missions in Final Fantasy Tactics feel incredibly one note, with very little variety on the objectives, other than just \"kill this person\" or \"kill all these people,\" which limits the utility of a number of the Jobs.\n\nUnfortunately, I found there to be many issues with Final Fantasy Tactics. The game did not feel like it was paced correctly for its story relative to the job and level experiences expected of the player. Leveling up feels meaningless because players can do it by literally just standing on a map and talking to themselves for an hour. Basically, characters gain experience for their level and job experience for their job by \"doing things\" during a mission. While this could mean attacking enemies or healing allies, it can also be accomplished by tasks which have no resource limit component, such as the Squire ability Focus. A player could start a random encounter and end it instantly, or they could sit there and just gain free levels until level 99. There are many other tactical RPGs I've played where this is addressed by carefully balancing main story encounters with optional missions, making the whole RPG growth aspect feel rather lazy.\n\nLeveling up characters feels even more useless when Act IV comes around, and suddenly everyone and their grandmother decides they want to join your party, and all are unique characters. Final Fantasy Tactics has a bizarre method of recruiting allies, which seems to pin their level to the highest party member on your team at the time of recruitment. In practice, this meant that everyone who joined my party towards the end of the game were not only wildly stronger than my original party, but also came with absurd unique skills making them hard to pass up on a team. \n\nFinal Fantasy Tactics does not feel tactical, as building a good party is basically pointless, and the \"solution\" to every combat encounter seemed to just be to use a character with Arithmeticks. It was such a frustratingly hollow experience when I reached the final boss, and realized there was no point bringing any of my initial companions who I'd spend dozens of hours training, when this dragon I recruited on a whim on the last mission did 999 guaranteed damage, and using a companion ability, I could double that before the boss even got a turn. It just felt... bad, like nothing I'd done in the game mattered by the end.\n\nWhile Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles is praiseworthy for its production value as a tactical RPG, there are many aspects which I did not mesh well with. For me, this would not necessarily be something I'd be quick to recommend to others, even fans of the tactical RPG genre. However, I did still enjoy my time with it, even though I find it silly that a mission involving chocobos was harder than the final boss for me.",

      "review": "FFT is my favorite game of all time. I have put an uncountable amount of hours into this game, and have bought it for every system it has been on. This remaster is worth it at $20-30. Full price is not worth it. I really wish steam would let us do a \"meh\" or neutral review. In the future, for my random play through I will most likely go back to a modded previous version. This is probably the best way for someone to get the story and back ground information. For everything else, it is worse.\n\nThe Good:\nFinally on PC\nScript is probably the best FFT translation we have ever had\nAdditional story stuff is great\nSpeed up is good to have (Should be a toggle)\nSome of the VAs do amazing work and it really adds to the game\nCan ignore random battles\nThe poaching office just functions better\nTurn order on side of the battle is great. Wish it was more navigatable while selecting skills.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe controls are a down grade. Both in and out of battle. Makes navigating and looking at everything significantly harder. Original game looking at the battlefield and enemy stats is a button press. Here you jump through menus. Does not let you change or modify them.\nSpeed up is not toggle-able, spent most of the game holding down R1.\nRemoved all the end-game stuff added in WotL/Mobile version, effectively removing any point of grinding or continuing past the story. The mobile showed they could do single player additional content, but chose to remove it here.\n\"Tactician mode\" is just a damage modifier. It doesnt make it harder, it makes glass cannon builds less viable. Immortal/Tank builds just dominate more.\nEnemy/Guest AI feels like it has changed for the worse? While it was neat seeing enemies doing different things, outside of  very specific situations they seemed to make worse decisions. The Summoners in particular didnt summon in my play through, they focused on doing everything but, despite the fact I was doing a high-faith magic build this run through and they would have done a ton of damage. The final battle was the only fight I felt was harder, but at that point it really doesnt matter.\nThe tutorials are beyond excessive. It went from whatever to aggravating extremely quickly. Literally everything has a tutorial. Most notable going to inventory and getting \"This is your inventory,\"\n\n\nThe Ugly:\nThe sprites are a down grade from the mobile version. Just straight up worse. No details, weird smoothing. the best complement you can give a remaster is \"this looks just like I remember.\" This does not hit that. \nA lot of the scenery lighting does nothing to help show off the work that was done and makes a lot of the scenes a lot less memorable. Instead of having a room people are acting in you have a small section that is highlighted and rest faded away. It makes a lot of the scenes seem smaller and gives the impression they are trying to hide the scenery.\nYou can turn this off, but the \"focus\" setting that is turned on by default is horrible. It takes the already low detail sprites and makes them worse. Its especially bad in cut scenes as the camera and focus jumps around forcing any lingering gaze to be stuck on unfocused blurry sprites.\nA lot of things do look better. The treasures, the locations you can find, everything in the \"chronicles\" Everything in engine looks underwhelming, and not what I would expect. \nThe content the DID add is paid for items. The only notable ones are Sprite changes for Ramza only, and a ring that gives you Gained JP Up. Making the only changes to the game locked behind spending more money is distasteful.",

Final Fantasy Tactics is an amazing game, but save yourself some money and play the WOTL version until this one gets cheaper. For a $50 price tag, it just doesn’t compare to what you’d get from other titles in terms of content. I mean, even the deluxe edition gives you… skins? C’mon man...\n\nI completely understand not wanting to take too much away from the original, but there were so many opportunities for side content to be added naturally without detracting from the main story. And the extra side content that was added was just… lacking (the book quests, for example). It would’ve been cool to see some areas unlocked in the errands — at least a nod to FFXII, — anything!\n\nThere’s an entire subplot in the game hinted at through errands, talking about how the world used to be this technological wonder that fell apart. They show amazing artifacts, books, and places that could’ve been explored more deeply as side content. They even added a whole new “side quest” system shown with blue markers that feels EXTREMELY underused.\n\nHuge missed opportunity here — it felt more like a cash grab riding the wave of remakes instead of an honest effort to truly flesh out this game to its fullest extent. $25 dollars feels like what the price should have been.",

But all they did was slap on a coat of paint and add VA. The VA is good, but represents a very small part of the experience. They didn't even update the map textures. This isn't the remake it was billed as and that breaks my heart.\n\nWhy not 'remake' Dark Knight/Onion Knight to fit the game better? Why not 'remake' the rendezvous system so it's playable offline like modders did? Why not 'remake' jank systems like monster breeding or beastmaster skills? Why not 'remake' the cutscenes from WotL?

Why not 'remake' my hopes and dreams so I don't believe in Square and thus won't be disappointed by them in the future? Wait, they actually did that one.\n\nThis 'remake' is a joke. It did considerably less to change the game than Tactics Ogre: Reborn. It has less content than WotL did. Let me remind you that this is the same studio that did FF7R. It's not moddable for ages thanks to Denuvo and will probably never have the kind of modding scene the PSX version does. Square wants you, dedicated SRPG lover, to know  that they'll give you a remaster at best every 10 years to monetize your nostalgia but they'll never actually give you a sequel to Matsuno's classics.

The full voiced script is okay.  Just okay.  Sure, the graphics are updated from 1997, but only by about a decade.  Like the video, some of you will like it and some won't.  Probably if you've played before you'll fast forward through it and not miss it.  No doubt they'll sell those missing pieces as DLC down the line.  The game shows its console roots both graphically and in a woefully incomplete control port which is missing view tilt that was included in previous versions.  If you played this before, you can imagine how annoying that is already.  If you're just joining us now, you'll get it the first time a unit is obscured by terrain and you think \"if only I could tilt the view 45 degrees, I could see the whole board\".  The new tactical view only mitigates this lack a little since after all these years the game still has trouble distinguishing which cell was clicked, even on PC where you really ought to be able to use your mouse to make it very clear, even without the ability to tilt the view.  Among the most galling parts is how little of the content is new here.  Like Bethesda and Blizzard, they're taking a game that was good and porting it to modern formats while doing the bare minimum to make the game compatible.  So, they can just sell you the same game over and over and float on the nostalgia instead of making something new or even doing so much as a good mod group to add to the game.  It's lazy and the price you pay ought to reflect that.  If you played this before, buy it on sale after they put back all the content they've held back to get the nostalgia fix you crave.  If you never played it before, you'll get more if you wait to buy this until it is on sale with all content in a year or two.\r\n\r\nUntil then, you'll find a version with more content available on mobile devices.",

Supposedly a result of losing the source code, but they could've put in a little bit of effort to fix it; this is $50 after all!\n\n- 2-3 second delay on every enemy attack (in between showing the skill name and the attack start; where it shows the possible damage of the attack). You can skip this by mashing A/confirm but it wasn't in the original and is really annoying. There should REALLY, and I mean REALLY be an option to turn this off, and that's another issue with this is a distinct lack of configurability.\n\n- REALLY lazy standard fonts that if you played the original really detract from the experience. This is one of the first things you will notice and is a huge sign that they didn't even put in the minimum effort to have it look in line with the original's aesthetics.\n\n- New translation removes a lot the \"old english\" language flair that helped make it distinct. \n+ The OG version included has the old english language in it, which is nice. \n\n- Its got that \"Electron UI\" look for the new UI parts (infamous javascript UI library) that, again, detracts a bit.\n\n- Microstutter in some FMVs. Not a result of framerate it seems to be in the video file itself (lol?).\n\n- You can configure the keyboard... but only 11 keys. Some keys have multiple uses and it is unclear what exactly you are configuring sometimes.\n- Also you can't seem to configure keys until AFTER the first battle.\n\n- If you order the Deluxe edition (or preordered) you can change Ramza's suit color. They somehow messed this up by making you SLOWLY cycle through each color and waiting about 3 seconds each time for a flickering light. Also in the suit preview it has some weird shadowing on it.\n\n- OG version only: For some BIZARRE reason they decided to add subtitles to some FMVs. Why is this bizarre? Because they added subtitles to ALL TEXT FMVs. It's subtitles to text. Make it make sense!\n\n- New translation has some odd translation errors. K for C in some places et al",

      "review": "The best version of a great game, but still needs a UI overhaul and a bunch of options that are typically in the UIs of newly created RPGs.  You shouldn't have to press a button to skip the obnoxious UI popup before every enemy attack, or hold down a button for a game speed up.\n\nThere's just a whole bunch of little UI things that bother me, enough to bring up.  I appreciate them doing this sort of ground-up rebuild/recode of the entire game engine, but so much of it defies standard UI and option practices.  \n\n- Targeting & accuracy pop-up before every enemy action, with no toggle to turn it off, and need to press confirm to skip through it rather than waiting.  It isn't some quick thing, it adds two seconds to each AI attack.\n- Fast forward only when holding down a button, with no toggle, or setting for what multiplier it should be.\n- Resets auto-advance on every cutscene, including simple scene transitions.\n- Dithering filter is fine as a default, but what people want will differ greatly on screen size and circumstance.  I really notice it on my OLED monitor, but on LED TV I think it is fine and think it contributes to the CRT feel they went with for the sprite upscaling.\n- No camera speed option, or settings for when it rotates.  It just leads to extra pauses as the camera rotates before an action plays out.\n- No ability to move when in the overhead tactical view.  Why?  A lot of the camera stuff are solved problems.\n- No scene skip option, instead the player has to just hold down R1 to speed things along.\n\nThe good news is that since this isn't just some assembly code port, these are all fixable. The bad news is that I have no idea on whether the developers genuinely care about any of these things.  Still, there's not really any argument to be made for people to play the older versions of FFT.  The lack of move cancel, lack of auto save, and absolutely bullshit random encounters will probably get 80% of people to give up on the game, and then the point of no return brick points would finish off a decent chunk of the rest.   They really did fix a ton of critical problems in this recreation of the game, but there's still some obvious work that should be done before I can recommend it to a 2025 audience.",
