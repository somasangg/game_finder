These range from units to buildings, enchantments to one-time-use spells. As I said above, each of the playable kings comes with their own suite of cards but as the different kings come to lay siege to your kingdom, you will gain access to their options and be able to diversify, if you so choose. The builds that will really take you far are definitely mixed bags but the game also has a lot of room for finding your favourite monarch and really finding amazing synergies.\r\n\r\nIf you like games that are small in concept but come with a lot of depth, definitely give this game a whirl!",

Phasing into higher difficulties could be drastically improved. While improving balance, the game should encourage a wider variety of strategies to be able to adapt into higher difficulties which have increased modifiers. Early access development seems to be thriving as new modes are being added, but striking good balance between card types is paramount to scaling variety into higher difficulties.\n\nWhile I do need to experiment further, the game offers a lot of choices such as with the Kings, Perks, Difficulties. Players can spend hours optimizing Perk arrangements, experimenting different builds and changing the feel of the game by using different Kings and picking other difficulties.\n\nWell worth a shot at its price, as it continues to grow and evolve into something better :)",

The regular run mode can be relaxing if you use the lower difficulties, but somewhere in the middle/upper middle is where I found the challenge to be fun.  When you play on the lower difficulties you can experiment with all the available units and combinations available, and that's super cool to see sometimes - placing the boars next to something hilarious that can hitch a ride, for example. :)  The diversity of the units and themes can be a lot of fun.\r\n\r\nI really like the idea of the new Quest Mode, but I would appreciate being able to adjust the difficulty just a bit.  I ended up struggling more than I wanted with this mode, so it's back to the regular run mode for me.\r\n\r\nAll in all I recommend - Although I'm a bit disappointed that I can't get through the Quest Mode, I still really enjoy the base game mechanics that keep me coming back.",

But the fact that it actually works as a roguelite kingdom builder, and ends up being genuinely fun, is what really makes it special and something I can't recommend enough.\n\nWhat I love most is how quickly things can spiral into these absolutely bonkers builds and chaos can in sue. It’s not quite a deck builder, but the card based system is super satisfying. Here is how it works in a nutshell, each round you grab a new card and drop it onto your grid; units, buildings, enchantments, one off spells, all of it. Every king has their own set of cards, but as enemy monarchs roll up to siege your kingdom, you get access to their stuff too after beating them. Mixing and matching is where the magic happens.

His cards simply take too long to get scale.\nUnfortunately, the recent update has felt like this pretty severely. If you don't get to go against specific kings to get their cards, you're almost guaranteed to lose. I feel myself begging to get the king of nothing or nomads to get some damage scaling cards. Most kings simply do not have any sort of viable scaling to keep up with the enemies on King+\nThere used to be much more variety in potential playstyles even in King+\nNew patch unfortunately took out the soul.

      "review": "Strategies are many, but viable strategies are few. One of the core design elements is that each playable king has 9 cards available. But of course, some cards will be better than others. Without using these best cards, winning is nigh impossible on anything above the lowest difficulties: the math just doesn't math. Once you understand which cards are good and which ones aren't, the game becomes an exercise in frustration. \n\nMany cards don't interact with each other at all, so if the random cards offered don't mesh with the extremely focused build necessary to proceed, you will feel disappointed. Even if a card is otherwise good or fun, but not the best, you will feel disappointed. The limited experimentation available is quickly discouraged; you can't rely on the interesting cards to show up, and once you've tried something and it fails, it becomes clear that the experiment you just tried will never work.\n\nSome cards are incredibly interesting, like the slime unit that clones itself to adjacent spaces, or the spell card that levels up spaces arranged in an X-pattern. But these cards are kept intentionally rare and/or weak by the developers. On the other hand, many of the most useful cards are either boring or are based heavily on RNG, such as cards that provide flat stat bonuses or cards that level up multiple random spaces.\n\nBetween the cards offered or rerolled, which cards you play and where, and which random midgame perks you choose, you are allowed to make roughly 150 decisions in a run of 30 levels. But since the depth is so shallow, you aren't really making decisions so much as hoping for the clearly optimal options to show up when you need them. \n\nThe combat animations are extremely basic to allow for the countless calculations under the hood, but they can be satisfying to watch. Sometimes it can be fun to see Number Go Up. But if that's what you're looking for, there are many better options on Steam; I recommend sticking to the greats like Vampire Survivors (for swarms of little enemies) or Balatro (for math and numbers).",

      "review": "Quick summary: After a very long mindless grind I absolutely hate this game. This is just gambling and grinding with some very simple strategic parts. I enjoyed roughly 5 hours of my more than 40 hours with 9 Kings. Rest was just fighting for the achievements during which my resentment toward it grew stronger and stronger.\r\n\r\nHere is the game loop: You unlock kings and difficulty levels by beating the lower levels. The first 3 difficulties are the relaxed, fun ones. Basically if you can place a tower or a unit in every round, you can win the scenario without any luck or strategy. Between 4 and 6 you find the challenging ones, where enemies will rapidly increase their power, however you still have the leniency to have 1 or 2 bad rounds of cards, you can still come out as a winner in the end. You can experiment with different combinations, and on these levels you can do subpar mix and matches too. Above level 6 you’ll find the harsh reality of this game: Each and every king has only 1 or 2 viable strategies for which they need only 2-3 cards (everything else is most of the time pure trash), they need exactly the 2-3 kings as enemies to make it work and the same time there are almost always kings, which can’t be enemies, because they’ll break these fragile ideas. Keep in mind, this is just the setup. You have to re-roll just the beginning at least 100 times to have ideal starting conditions. Does it sound fun? Why do you need to do that? Because above level 6 the enemy will have an insane amount of increase in everything after every round, so there isn’t any space for even 1 round of suboptimal cards. If you don’t believe me, then you can check the “strategy” guides. The absolutely mind boggling thing is that the winning strategies are so simple. Just spam rats or amass gold with mercenaries or start the mob engine.\r\n\r\nYou’re fighting an invisible army. You’ll learn that each and every king will field all their troops. All their numbers, all their stats will increase based on the difficulty level. The enemy doesn’t have to play cards or use bad hands, they steadily level up all the time. There isn’t any AI involved, because the computer only has to calculate the incremental values, then field the units, which will fight mindlessly. All the kings all the time will have the same “strategy”, which takes away the option to counter the enemy and play the same king differently based on their opponents. The enemy doesn’t play the same game as you.\r\n\r\nI believe the developers have good ideas and intentions, but the focus of the development is way off. I don’t really see the point of difficulties above level 6, but there are 27 (!!!) at the moment. To be honest, it could be even a million too, because difficulty in this game means how much will the AI army be upgraded between rounds without any effort. Most of the 9 cards of the kings are useless. Many of the kings can’t really survive by his own cards, so the balance between cards and also between kings isn’t existing. The majority of the winning strategies for the round 99 achievement will break the game engine. I had to resign after round 68, because my computer broke from my 25k+ army. This technical limitation further limits the number of winning strategies. Most of the units are as stupid and simple as they come. They will target the closest enemy unit, and will move towards them until somebody falls. This means with King Of Time your units will go back to the very end of the battle field, if their targets are teleported back there, while moving through other units and taking hits during the whole trip. The units are extremely simple, so your best chance is to beat the AI with numbers.\r\n\r\nI believe many of the game tags are misleading or straight out false. Here is the list:\r\n\r\n- Strategy: There is just a hint of strategy. You can select the perks to use, afterwards you either re-roll everything until you get the setup for the one and only viable strategy or you roll with reality, which is tactical at best. Almost everything is just random. You’ll have a good run just by luck, and even the masterminds can fail with bad hands. You don’t control the armies, they just mindlessly clash with each other. No formations or placement, just raw head-to-head. For me the best example is the Prophet event, where after many rounds of placements there will be some free improvements on one or more free tiles. By placing the castle you already have your layout for your plan. You can’t move buildings or towers, and you can randomly move troops with one king. So at that point you can only re-roll for such improvement, which can benefit most of the free tiles. This whole event can be strategic, if it happened at the start of the game, where you can bend your idea around the free boon or if you had any direct control over the blessing and/or its placement. It’s also insane not to have control at least of the beginning of the game, because re-rolling for at least okay starting conditions isn’t fun. Your choice could be strategic, with the current design it’s just luck.\r\n\r\n- I don’t know what the RPG part is. I don’t think you can roll-play into anything. The perk system shouldn’t count as “character” progression.\r\n\r\n- Roguelike/roguelite/replay value/procedural generation is truly a false marketing. Yes, in theory you can replay the game many times, but I don’t think your experience will be that new, just random. The starting grid is always 3*3 squares with maximum area as 5*5, you’ll always have the same 9 cards for your king. In lower level you roll with the given elements, but beyond a difficulty you have to follow a really narrow path to succeed. You won’t really learn from your past mistakes, because after a very short period you’ll hit the end of the learning path, and you’ll fail just because you weren’t lucky, not because you didn’t know any better.\r\n\r\n- I believe you shouldn’t call this game deckbuilding, because most of the time the cards are usable once, they won’t come back. You can’t select the starting cards. You can select one card from the offered three after each round. You can change the options by re-rolling them if you can afford it. Sometimes there is the merchant event where you can buy cards, but it’s only a really minor part of the game.\r\n\r\n- Card battler means cards are fighting against each other with known face values. Here cards turn into units or buildings, so zero cards are involved in the battles. You don’t see any stats of the enemy. This is also an auto battler, so you aren’t controlling the matchups on the battlefield, using your strengths against their weaknesses.\r\n\r\n- There is a gambling tag on Steam, so it would be appropriate to include it.\r\n\r\nI truly don’t know to whom I could recommend this game. You have to be masochistic to enjoy the grinding and gambling. Also the pricing is way off. At the moment it costs 20 €, and I would say you shouldn’t pay more than 5 € for it. Yes, you can put decent hours into the game if you’re resilient, but I think the fun will run out pretty fast and there isn’t actually much content in the game.",

I've 100%'d the game in both Patches at time of writing, so I feel this is a fair time to criticise.\n\nThe King of Time Patch unfortunately seems like a pivot in a negative direction after what was a fun (but lovably janky) initial offering in the King of Nomads Patch.\n\nIn cranking up the \"difficulty\" of the higher levels, the strategic floor has been raised tremendously by virtue of gutting unorthodox strategies into nonviability. Ironically, by limiting the diversity of viable interactions, the game might as well now present the player with a binary choice: \"Do you want to Win or Lose?\". Deep strategic approaches have vanished on all Kings but those for which were already powerful prior to the latest Patch. The Devs have taken a sandbox game and are now holding the player's hand, whispering \"Nooo, play this way.\".\n\nPart of the fun of tactics and builder games is embracing Bob Ross: nosediving into an imperfect, unorthodox strategy and still pulling out a win - limit testing your knowledge of what the game presents you with to see if you can come out ahead with your happy accidents. That fun evaporates when half of your high-level games end in the Menu, with the player selecting \"Reset Run\" because even playing against half of the enemy Kings renders you mathematically unable to reach Year 10. While playing as weaker Kings, you can be given the perfect set of starting cards and edict for your strategy and still wipe out because you're facing King of Stone. The game as it currently exists is more Paint-By-Numbers, and the canvas is ripped away from you if you dare use the wrong colour.\n\nI think the game can turn itself back around, and that's why I'm disappointed to give a negative review and committed to coming back for the next Patch. This, however, isn't the first Early Access strategy game I've seen choke out its build diversity in the name of \"difficulty\", effectively pushing away the active, buildcrafting playerbase.",

It is, at most, a cute distraction and a fun way to viscerally understand how compounding interest works and why rich people have more money than you.\n\nI beat the game on every difficulty up to the \"progressive difficulty\" levels (read: infinite procedural scaling) without losing once. The only times I lost were when I was trying to force myself to use bad strategies with weird cards, and even then I could ususally get it to work by highrolling.\n\nI wouldn't pay more than $10 for the game.",

But of course, some cards will be better than others. Without using these best cards, winning is nigh impossible on anything above the lowest difficulties: the math just doesn't math. Once you understand which cards are good and which ones aren't, the game becomes an exercise in frustration. \n\nMany cards don't interact with each other at all, so if the random cards offered don't mesh with the extremely focused build necessary to proceed, you will feel disappointed. Even if a card is otherwise good or fun, but not the best, you will feel disappointed. The limited experimentation available is quickly discouraged; you can't rely on the interesting cards to show up, and once you've tried something and it fails, it becomes clear that the experiment you just tried will never work.\n\nSome cards are incredibly interesting, like the slime unit that clones itself to adjacent spaces, or the spell card that levels up spaces arranged in an X-pattern. But these cards are kept intentionally rare and/or weak by the developers. On the other hand, many of the most useful cards are either boring or are based heavily on RNG, such as cards that provide flat stat bonuses or cards that level up multiple random spaces.\n\nBetween the cards offered or rerolled, which cards you play and where, and which random midgame perks you choose, you are allowed to make roughly 150 decisions in a run of 30 levels. But since the depth is so shallow, you aren't really making decisions so much as hoping for the clearly optimal options to show up when you need them. \n\nThe combat animations are extremely basic to allow for the countless calculations under the hood, but they can be satisfying to watch. Sometimes it can be fun to see Number Go Up. But if that's what you're looking for, there are many better options on Steam; I recommend sticking to the greats like Vampire Survivors (for swarms of little enemies) or Balatro (for math and numbers).",

      "review": "”9 Kings” was a game I started with high expectations because it combined my two favorite concepts: “castle defense” and “deck building.” However, to be honest, I have to say that in its current state, the game feels a bit too empty and, unfortunately, boring. The game has a brilliant idea, but there are serious shortcomings in the core mechanics.\n\nTutorial Section\n\nFirst off, I think the game's tutorial section is very superficial. I started playing without learning almost any details about the gameplay and couldn't understand most of the basic mechanics. For example, I accidentally learned that I was drawing cards from the king's deck I was fighting against by watching a streamer's video. Everything in-game happens so quickly that I struggled to grasp what I should pay attention to or what my strategy should be.\n\nUser Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)\n\nUnfortunately, the game's interface and interaction with the player feel poor. To give the simplest example, the moment you add a card to the field, combat begins instantly, with no preparation time or confirmation. This eliminates any chance to strategize and makes the gameplay feel rushed.\n\nLackluster and Simplistic Combat\n\nBattles are another weak point of the game. They are overly “lifeless” and simplistic. By “simplistic,” I mean superficial. For example, there is no basic visual feedback, such as health bars for enemy units. This makes it impossible to read the flow of the battle and understand which units are effective.\n\nGameplay, Balance, and Card Variety\n\nIn terms of gameplay, I think the game is “overly raw.” The cards are both unbalanced and lack variety.\n\n    Deck Building: There's a strange requirement that the unit you plan to power up must be the same as the king you're currently fighting. This is because cards from other kings hardly ever appear in your deck.\n\n    Unbalanced Units: There are almost no powerful cards that can “carry” or be played effectively. I tried grinding units like Wizards and Elves, but their attack speed is so slow that the battle is over by the time they get their second hit in.\n\n    Archer Power: Archers, on the other hand, are overly powerful. With archers being this strong and other cards being this weak, I didn't feel the need to try different strategies.\n\n    Castle Mechanics: The Castle card is also stronger than almost all other units. Furthermore, I find the requirement to place this “core” unit on the field annoying. No matter where you place the castle on the already limited 9-unit field, it disrupts the layout and restricts strategy.\n\nMaybe I need to play more to make this review, I don't know. But unfortunately, that's been my experience so far, and I couldn't find the motivation to continue playing. “9 Kings” has great potential, but the development team urgently needs to address these fundamental gameplay and balance issues. If these issues are resolved with updates, I'll happily come back.",

Due to this, the game didn't feel fun after first couple of hours.\r\n\r\nIf I may, I would suggest more cards, towers and troops that are be able to clear plots, rotate entities on plots, produce cards, rotate cards in hand, switch or upgrade cards, or bring cards back from the \"discard\" well.

Its just too little and does not do justice to the characters they are trying to represent.\nOk I suppose for others, those little blocks put together, jumping around the screen is cutesy or whatever, but no, not for me.\nPixel art is a very fine line to walk..... but this one does not fly the banner high.\n(PS, dont worry, i have the same feelings for \"Songs of Conquest\".  That beautiful world and rich characters, blocked to death....... :-(  I hope if you read this, that you get where I am coming from)",

      "review": "It's almost a good game but the current set of mechanics is kind of meh, so I do not recommend it.\n\nThere can be any number of units on a single pixel -> area of effect attacks are infinitely better than single target (both for you and for the enemy)\nFix: make max number of targets into a stat, then rebalance\n\nAlmost all stat buffs are exponential (2% more, 10% more, multiplicative with the previous increases) -> not many interesting tradeoffs when picking/placing buildings, on-hit effects don't scale, any end game tile looks like 1e7 damage with 99.99 hits per second\nFix: add more flat buffs, rebalance for shorter runs (?), switch some % buffs from \"more\" to \"increased\", add better ways to scale on-hit effects\n\nTiny unit movespeed, support buildings are animated one by one -> game is slow, even on x3, even if you win fights instantly (unless you sell your whole base which is not fun as a concept)\nFix: add option to animate all base buildings simultaneously\n\nMost of the time you play one card per turn, unless you go Gambling which randomizes drafts but gives you 2x card income, or perform an occasional wombo combo -> you kinda feel like a passenger, with not enough things to do\nFix: add more ways to generate more cards to play\n\nEarly access balance -> some NPC kings hit like a truck and the others don't; rainbow cards are supposed to be great but most of them are not; plus all of the above\nFix: it is what it is, we're here for it",

I see a basic framework of how the game should work and I love it. \n\nWhat i dont quite love though is that the game atm is just a barebones game. There isnt much in progression and combos that you can pull off, and the quest itself is super hard at mid stages. \n\nAfter you done 3-4 runs, you are kinda done. Which is a shame, as the early access feels more like a demo rather than what the game is supposed to be. \n\nGranted, the game is early access, but it does feel like the game is maybe 30% done. I would wait for the full release to properly see what this game is capable of.",
