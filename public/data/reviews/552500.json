It's a lot of fun with friends, and a decent bit of fun playing solo with bots, but a hit&miss when playing with strangers online. Voice chat works great. What I don't like in single player, is that at some point you need to re-play previous levels as every character, so that your bots had good enough gear and level / talents in order to beat more difficult missions. Versus mode is quite interesting, with two teams interchangably playing as heroes or vermin, but people get annoyed when you're just a beginner, so I recommend getting comfortable with legend difficulty in adventure mode first. A solid title.

      "review": "If you're a fan of games like Left of Dead, then Vermintide 2 is a great co-op experience if you got at least a couple of other friends to play it with. The gameplay is simple enough; you run around, swing your weapons, use your bows and magics, kill skaven (ratmen) and other horrors and monsters, have a simple goal to achieve at the end of each stage and just generally have a fun time being over-the-top badasses taking on literal armies on your own.\n\nYou get five classes to choose from. They themselves have subclasses, some of which change how you play the character by quite a bit. They complement each others strengths and weaknesses, though admittedly some subclasses in particular feel flat out stronger than other classes. And that's even after they've rolled out several nerfs. In co-op mode it's not an issue though, if anything it can be kinda fun just running overpowered characters and mowing down armies. There's several difficulty options, and on the highest difficulties things get pretty tough anyway even with the stronger characters, so there's a lot of challenge to be had if you desire. \n\nThere's not all that much story to find other than loose dialogue inbetween and during missions, but the game doesn't really need that much story; the lands are being invaded by skaven and other forces, and it's your job to stop them. That's your story. It ties into a larger story within the Warhammer Fantasy universe, but it's not all that important to the game itself. Gameplay is king here, and the gameplay is fun as hell, if perhaps a bit repetetive if you don't enjoy swinging weapons around 24/7.\n\nIt's a good fun all around if you enjoy more straight forward action games that still have some depth to them if you get into it. If you enjoy co-op action games it's basically a must play. \n\nAnd it's from a developer that just keeps on giving. It's been out for seven years, eight years in march next year, and Fatshark has no obligation to keep supporting the game, release new content nor release patches and balance fixes. And yet they do. The game is still quite popular too, which I think says a lot about how fun it is. \n\nIf you haven't already, you should get into it. You can usually get it, including all dlc, for cheap during holidays and Steam events. So there's not much reason not to give it a shot. \n\nIf you have friends to play with, that is. It's not that fun on it's own as the AI isn't always the brightest. And playing with random players online can be a mixed bag of experiences to say the least.",

You always think you're safe between waves, dodging everything and keeping your health intact just for you to have one of those furry little guys stab you in the back with a special hit. \n\nA ragebaiting game, with you getting bugged sometimes (at least it's good when it's the bosses), random players of low level hoping to be carried on Legend (very entertaining, though, always happy to help) but the whole team dying just at the end of the map. Also thinking you managed to block a hit only to get on the ground anyway, and occasionally getting kicked out of the matches for no reason.\n\nStill, very enjoyable and with a very nice community. Before the game being free for that certain period of time, we were the same 30 rat lovers just switching lobbies, so I'm glad more people is playing it now. \nIt has nice mechanics, different characters that adapt different types of players, and good enough optimization to run smoothly. \n\nYou can always learn combos, builds, how to block, dodge and move through the map strategically, or just turn your brain off and be a Slayer. Being a maniac dwarf that jumps around and smashes rats after a long stressful day always helps. \n\nSo yes, I do recommend this game. The routine is nice, the maps are entertaining, and in my own personal experience, some very, very special people that I've met through it has made it even more worth it than it was already.

      "review": "Gameplay: 23/25 - Excellent fluid and dynamic gameplay, which, despite its horde-survival aggressive and brutal nature, requires strategy and patience at all levels. The 5 proposed characters, each tied to 4 specialization branches, are sufficiently diversified to provide gameplay interest and satisfaction. The banner of weapon choices, skill-tree, and possible combinations are nuanced enough to allow relevant and effective builds. Cooperative mechanics, like in most games of the genre, are respected through special units and bosses that bring difficulty and the necessary contrast to the monotony of the massacre, even if some of them can bring frustration due to their (too) discreet characteristics, notably the Life-Stealers who can summon tornadoes at long distances while hidden at the back of the group, or by their (too) dazzling characteristics (intentional or not), like the Rat-Gunner and the Warpfire Thrower. In conclusion, the ragdoll-type physics engine of the game is an integral and non-negligible variable of the final quality, which makes everything extremely enjoyable and unique, allowing to play for hours.\n\nImmersion: 25/25 - A Warhammer universe faithful to what it is, thanks to lore characteristic of other games in the license but which does not fail to be developed and very deep. The immersion and details attributed to this universe are stunning, notably the VERY numerous dialogues between characters, all unique from each other, which tell the story of the universe, but also the dozens of proposed maps which do not fail to be exceptional and concretize the numerous fantastic images described in novels of the fictional genre, played by their color palettes and their epic gigantisms.\n\nDesign: 15/25 - Despite solid gameplay, immersion, and graphics, one cannot overlook the repetitiveness of objectives despite nice but small attempts on certain maps in normal mode (I think of Reikland where we fight on boats, mechanisms like the Screaming Bell chains or the line alignment at Athel Yenlui). The Power system of equipment, similar to gachas, is not clearly explained and creates frustration due to its completely random nature, making the acquisition of Exotique/Veteran equipment (the maximum ranks) not as jubilant as it should be. However, several concepts of the game's design are very interesting:\n\nThe tomes and grimoires (which cause -33% HP loss to the group per grimoire possessed) are mechanics that allow pushing map exploration with a risk management variable (in addition to the grimoire effect, tomes do not allow possessing a medkit or healing potion simultaneously).\n\nThe quality of chests that improves based on the level's difficulty, further improved post-game based on tomes and grimoires recovered and whether Quick Play was activated or not, is a remarkable way to encourage players (especially those who do not know each other) to immediately create team cohesion for the common interest of better equipment.\n\nAll side game modes (Chaos Wastes, Versus, and, to a lesser extent, Winds of Magic) are thought to heal the lacks and defects of the game, and it works quite well, particularly for Chaos Wastes with its curse mechanics by the Chaos Gods, the exclusive maps it offers, and the unique attributes to the mode.\n\nCrafting is very simple, clear, and accessible to all level ranges. It allows quickly getting a handle on equipment traits and attributes and naturally provides flexibility on different builds.\n\nAchievement: 12/25 - Achievements allow exploring the entirety of Campaign mode, from Act I to IV, but it is unfortunate that they do not involve all other maps, which are nevertheless interesting. Some challenges involve using Crafting and acquiring high-level equipment, which happens quite naturally with all other achievements and allows discovering the game's mechanics. Unfortunately, the big black spot of these achievements is the part where we must reach Lvl. 30 on all game characters, five characters in total. Except that this leveling is long, extremely long. To give you an idea: according to SteamHunters, the median completion time for 100% is about.. 160 hours. This is a considerable time that far exceeds the time needed to go through the entire game. Some techniques remain however, including the one I benefited from, notably the special events offered by the studio to obtain a x2 XP bonus to double progression, or even x3 on unique days, combined with intensive practice of a quick map (like Screaming Bell) to accumulate experience points quickly, but this task remains unpleasant. To conclude, the most difficult achievement is completing the \"Skittergate\" mission (Act IV, in reality) on \"Legend\" difficulty (the second-to-last most complicated, behind Cataclysmic), which will also get you all similar post-difficulty achievements. This last achievement is an excellent way to finish the game in style, with its landscapes and epic final battle.\n\nFinal Score: 75/100 - Warhammer: Vermintide 2 is a very good game in its horde-survival genre that deserved a bit more spotlight because it has huge potential and above all allows an introduction to the Warhammer license, so I highly recommend this game.",

I mainly play singleplayer and the bots are more than competent enough to get you through normal and hard difficulties.  Anything above that and you'll likely need some human players.  The warhammer fantasy universe is so vast and interesting, so much lore, all the factions and stories.. I can't get enough of it.  All the characters feel unique from one another with different strengths, weaknesses, unlockable skill builds, and weapon options.  \n\nThe grind for better loot has gotten harder since they updated the game, I'm not a fan of that.  Basically it's like impossible to get decent quality weapons and trinkets unless you play on super hard difficulties.  You used to unlock them based on your overall level, to where you'd slowly accumulate better and better gear that was within a certain range of your current power level.  Now the max possible gear power level you obtain is limited by whatever difficulty you play on.  If you enjoy playing on normal you're stuck unlocking nothing useful at all after like power level 200, which is basically nothing.  I found myself coming back to this game less after this update mainly because I never feel like getting all sweaty and playing with real people where you worry about screwing up their session.  I just prefer normal difficulty and hard here and there, so I've basically reached the ceiling for unlocking gear.  For all the cool stuff you have to play on the very hard difficulties just to even get like a 1% chance of unlocking red gear (the best).  I get it, the super high tier gear shouldnt just be handed out like candy.. but I thought the old system worked better.\n\n Still a fun game even after all these years.  Graphics look good, gameplay is fun, probably some of the best first person melee combat I've felt in a game.  You can get this dirt cheap nowadays so I'd definitely give it a shot.

Even if you play alone you'll have a good experience most of the times (they even made this game free on steam)\n\nThis game got a whole new wave of players and it's an amazing thing for casual gameplay or finding lower difficulty lobbies.\n\nIf you are an old player of this game like i am, it's \"decent\" (meaning a good thing that they did) but kind of \"bad\" for whoever wants to play/farm legendary or cataclysm difficulty missions/events.\nBecause i'm sorry to say that a lot of new people on this game don't understand how to play a \"team-based\" game (like the left4dead saga/back4blood and other team-like games).\n\nI see a lot of new players rush into legendary/cataclysm difficulty with level 25 or under classes, with incomplete builds using mostly low heath classes.. Then quitting the game after 5min or less because they die too fast or get obliterated.\nIt's fine, they'll learn the game when the time will come, but it's just funny to me, seeing someone either not playing with the team at all (dying alone then complaining with the others) and others playing legend or above with underleved classes with random builds that don't have synergy, or even elves putting themselves in front of an entire colony of rats/enemies, when her job should be elites or specials (yes on legend and above classes have their roles, sorry)\n\nI could go on and on, but in the end of the day the game is still super fun, just remember that legend and above diff are more role based and more for \"tryhards\" or \"completionists\" that want skins or borders.",

Imma nab ya all at the same time\" heh. \n\nSecond, with each character having 4 \"classes\" or whatever they call them, it would be nice if y'all could play the same character, but a different class. Like in my group, two of us want to play victor and two of us Wana play Markus, but we Wana play different classes of that charscter. - I get it, it would mess with the banter (maybe balance?) or story a bit. Buuuuut, is that really a reason? Like, does it really matter? There are 5 characters but only 4 players, so any given time, you are down one character for banter anyhow... So if you have one duplicate character, just play a lil less voice lines? Like if you have two Markus, one Siena, and one victor, you just do voice lines that mix with those three characters and ignore the double Markus. Simple. Heck, it could even be a perk, as after you hear a voice line once, it just becomes more background noise. And after you play the campaign once, you are just here to bash monsters and power creep (I ain't end game, but that's the very obvious feel after 20 hours or so).\n\nGames \"old\" now (still looks and plays great) so I am sure these changes ain't gonna get made. But they are my major gripes. \n\nIs good fun with some buds with an evening free.",

It's whatever.) If you're playing on the deck like me, switch to the experimental branch that bypasses the launcher, and select dx11 bypass launcher. The game will \"load\", then you need to quit the game, and restart it. Then it works perfectly. CONSISTENT 50-60 frames, even when you see the massive waves of Papa Nurgie cultists and Skaven in the background gunning for your ass. \n\nHIGHLY recommend playing with friends and having vc over discord or something.\nPLUS the dlc is half off and all you really need of those are the career packs.\nAll in all?

Some would chalk that up to the onslaught of rats and roaches that I am at constant war with in my 80ft² bedroom. \r\n\r\nThose people would be wrong though and actually my Grandma told me that it's my neighbours fault that we even have an infestation because she's also old and always leaving food out so it's actually not my fault at all and also the fist-shaped holes in my drywall were because I \"dropped something\" and no I didn't \"punch them in a fit of rage\" so stop asking.

If you liked Vermintide, Darktide is also worth trying since it is more polished and has a stronger endgame.\n\nIt builds well on what the first game offered. Each character has multiple careers with different playstyles, giving you several ways to approach the same fights. The game also includes a good number of missions with varied layouts, which helps keep the experience fresh.\n\nThe game really opens up at max level and on the tougher difficulties. That is where your builds, weapons, and team coordination show their value, and the runs feel more strategic. Vermintide 2 can be played solo, but it works much better with friends since communication and teamwork make the missions smoother.\n\nIf you enjoyed the first Vermintide, you should also consider trying Darktide, which follows the same formula, is more polished, and offers more structured endgame content.

DLCs in my opinion are too expensive if not on sale and it is a big part of the game, it does have a rogue-like \"\"\"dungeon\"\"\" mode with modifiers that for me was pretty enjoyable.\n\nI do have respect for the game in general, but it just doesn't cut it on its own for the 'single player' parts at all, (yes, it WAS not a game made to be played alone, many changes were made to change that but not good enough, which is part that lead me to this review) after all this time i thought and heared that this improved, but in reality it didn't. I set this on negative because the player base of games like this are bound to eventually die or at least the great mayority of it, and if not safeguarded by a decent set of bots, all the great work that was done by this company goes to waste, and also seems like an insult to their players. You still cannot control a bot when you die, not that hard, highly requested for what i have been reading... big thing for me that also led me here.\n\nDepending on... my patience and luck with a few friendos, i will likely play the game more, try to complete the stories of the DLCs and maybe get the Steam achievements, but... who knows!\n\nI suggest that you [b]TRY THE GAME[/b], specially if you already have it, even more if you have someone to play with, and see it for yourself, except the LvL 15 traits of every class being an absolute joke, most of the game was and in a way, still is pretty decent. Oh yes, the dodge system is kind of a joke too, i guess they broke it somewhere along the way or i remembered it way better xD\n\nIt does support mods, in a dedicated manner, so that is definately to be highlighted!\n\n! To anyone that has been told that bots in Vermin2 in general, specifically the their AI when compared to Darktide's AI was better... i can confirm that they have not even the slightest clue of what they are saying, and honestly iwon't go in depth with that since it would involve me in a longer relationship with this review than it already has been xD\nThe Bots behaviour in this game when it comes to fighting and defending the player/s is absolutely criminal, so are their reactions to hostile actions towards them or the player/s, either you stay still or almost in place or buddy you are gonna get your 4$$ stabbed at every turn, and in high levels it means a big chunk of your greeny life. When it comes to saving your hide from a very typical random oneshot, it can easily cost you the match if even just a few specials, or elite or just with 1 boss, they can ruin everything in a very veeery dumb looking moment x')",

Even getting this slop for free is too expensive. \n\nThe game had the potential to be an awesome co-op action game, but instead it feels like an exercise in frustration. The core issue is the wildly inconsistent difficulty. Far too often the game throws you into situations where you simply don’t have the tools, positioning, or resources to handle what it demands. Deaths frequently feel cheap rather than deserved, and losses rarely teach you anything except that the difficulty spikes can be completely arbitrary.\n\nThe combat system and progression loop are supposed to be the game’s draw, but when encounters swing from trivial to overwhelming without warning, the experience becomes more punishing than fun. Instead of feeling challenged, you feel blindsided.\n\nOn the visual side, character design is also oddly lackluster. Several of the female characters in particular suffer from inconsistent or unappealing design choices that don’t match the tone or quality the game aspires to. Not a very big surprise though considering it´s made by wester developers. \n\nOverall, Vermintide 2 struggles to deliver a satisfying gameplay experience.

While Darktide has been undergoing significant quality-of-life improvements and has added some paid DLCs, Vermintide 2 has received more free content in recent years, making its update pace arguably faster in 2025, especially in terms of major new content additions like the new map and the Axe of the Wolf Father event.'' \n- PC Gamer article\n\nVermintide 2 also got the Return to the Reik update for free in 2025, the DLCs of this game are not being sold, they barely reach a few hundred reviews, class DLCs are cheaper than in Darktide because nobody buys them and no one throws money for premium currency because you get the chance at some events or daily drops to get ''premium'' cosmetics and also the premium currency for free, while in Darktide you can only get premium currency with money.\n\nFatshark is using the profit from Darktide to continue the development of Vermintide 2. Darktide has more active players than Vermintide 2, this is the reason why this game it's free once every few years, because it's more dead than Darktide. They do not give a f*ck about Darktide and they are using it only to make money from selling skins, while this game gets more free updates with new maps, enemies, game modes etc., Darktide only gets more skins in shop ( a cosmetic set is around 20 euros in game currency ) and events in the current maps with charms and frames as rewards, the only free update we got in 2025 for Darktide was Bound By Duty which is basically arena mode, now we get class DLCs which are overpriced, sadly there are people wasting money on them too, Darktide is nothing else but the bank of Vermintide 2.\n\nUpdate:\nWe got the No Man’s Land update in Darktide a few days after this review, it has the first event with free premium currency in rewards, I'm glad these devs are checking the reviews. I hope they continue working on Darktide without half of year breaks and this review to be wrong in the future.",

I can't get more than one match per year out of this game because I get back in for a few minutes and suddenly realize that all the DLC I haven't paid for is being rubbed in my face and HEAVILY limiting play to the point where you pretty much have no choice but to buy DLC to have fun. You can't play the same 'class' as someone else because they are all unique characters so if your character is taken, you have to choose another, if you don't have he DLC to choose another, YOU DO NOT GET TO PLAY WHAT YOU WANT AND DO NOT HAVE FUN. This game is too old for this, the DLC should be free by now or there should be more ways to unlock rather than just paying money. While Darktide is starting a accrue DLC, I can easily give that game a positive review because it does not suffer from any of the problems Vermintide 2 does, in Dark tide, you get to play what you want. Make Vermintide 2 playable instead of always making it free, getting the game for free only to be paywalled by DLC is one of the worst feelings in gaming.",
