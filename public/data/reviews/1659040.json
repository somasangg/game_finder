It's my comfort game.\n\nHitman isn't a game you just play through once. Each of more than 20 missions gives you a huge sandbox filled with different assassination opportunities, side stories, and challenges. You can easily spend tens of hours in every single map if you take your time to experiment and explore everything, and you will never stop discovering new things. And that's just the campaign. Additional game modes such as arcade contracts, user-created contracts, and the rogue-lite Freelancer mode put your skill, creativity and map knowledge to the test and give you pretty much infinite replayability. And it's moddable.\n\nThis being said, buying the game is apparently just as complex as the game itself, which is what most of the negative reviews are about. IOI still haven't figured out in nearly a decade how to market their game. People keep getting confused by the purchase options and buy the wrong version, and every purchase guide written by players is unnecessarily convoluted and makes the process even more confusing. So here's all you need to know:\n- Free Starter Pack: You get the tutorial to see if you like the gameplay\n- Part One: You get Hitman 1 plus DLC, and you can upgrade it to Standard in the in-game store\n- Standard: You get Part One plus Hitman 2 and 3 without their DLC\n- Deluxe: You get Standard plus the Hitman 2 and 3 DLC\n- The additional DLC on the store page are not included in Deluxe, but they are not worth it\n- There is no way to buy only Hitman 3. Hitman 1-3 don't exist as separate games anymore.\n\nMy personal recommendation: Play the Free Starter Pack a few times to explore all the possibilities in the two tutorial levels, watch the gameplay trailers on YouTube, and if you are intrigued, grab the Deluxe Edition on sale.",

Get bored of freelancer? Play the elusive targets. It is so hard to describe the feeling of finishing a level while trying to complete a certain challenge. You can create a new assasination method that has probably never been done before by chucking a couple items on the floor, its that open minded. If i were to vote a labor of love for the steam awards, it would be Hitman: WoA . Updating the game with people like Bruce Lee, and soon Eminem. That is insane. Although, the only bad thing about Hitman: WoA isnt even in the game itself, its in the store page. It is very confusing on how to buy these games, but when you figure it out you can finally experience Hitman: WoA",

      "review": "HITMAN World of Assassination consolidates HITMAN 1, 2, and 3 into a single platform. The structure merges all missions, progression, and systems into one cohesive experience. This format delivers a complete stealth sandbox with consistent mechanics across its entire catalog.\n\nThe core design revolves around social stealth. You blend into crowds, study patrols, observe routines, and exploit openings. Each level is a dense simulation where NPCs react believably to sound, sight, and suspicious behavior. Success depends on patience and environmental understanding, not raw reflex.\n\nMaps are the franchise’s standout feature. Locations like Dubai, Dartmoor, Sapienza, and Berlin provide layered spaces with multiple infiltration routes. Verticality, disguise ecosystems, and interlocking systems create replay value. Every map supports dozens of strategies, and the game does not force one optimal path.\n\nTools and disguises shape each run. You can manipulate accidents, trigger chain reactions, or use silent takedowns. Disguises alter access and suspicion levels. The equipment roster is broad but balanced, allowing improvisation instead of rigid builds.\n\nThe World of Assassination format standardizes progression. Mastery levels unlock new starting points, stash locations, and gear. The Freelancer mode adds a roguelite structure, where you plan multi-mission campaigns with risk-based decision-making. This expands long-term engagement beyond single-mission mastery.\n\nPresentation remains sharp. IOI’s Glacier engine delivers detailed crowds, readable lighting, and stable performance across large environments. Voice acting mixes dry humor with grounded delivery, and sound cues provide clear feedback during stealth sequences.\n\nHITMAN World of Assassination succeeds as the definitive version of the modern HITMAN trilogy. It offers unmatched sandbox stealth, deep replayability, and a unified framework that encourages experimentation. The result is one of the most flexible and robust stealth experiences available.",

      "review": "i mean this game has endless potential, it also takes the market by storm and it has somehow managed to become one of those AAA titles that is as big as AC and others yet it doesn't get dragged all over the place like those titles, and it maintains a high steady playercount, and has millions playing year in and  year out. Besides IOI has stated on several occasians that hitman will be a long-term series and not a said and done, besides IOI wouldn't throw away a very loyal fanbase and all of the AI advancements and interactions they have implemented into this game. I mean I'd go as far as to say hitman is up there with GTA, sure socially it doesn't have massive hype, but that's not to say that AGAIN this game pulls in tons of people day in and day out, plus with it's really good replay ability, making it so that there's not a designated method to performing each Assassination is exactly what keeps people coming back, and the fact that IOI doesn't lean in any political direction with their game, the game just is, like Agent 47 isn't some loud obnoxious militant yelling some hardcore masculine sh*t but he's also not a overly feminized bald man yelling about non-sensical western ideologies. When you really take a look into 47's life especially if you follow both the game and the movies and even the comic books from when you were a kid, this dude is honestly far more badass and kickass than other character like Max Payne, which is a bold statement but I'll die on that hill. \n\nAnyway, in the future like 9-10 years when they releases many more hitman's, the one thing I really wanna see is a return to co-op but instead of that 'silent assassin' mode from 5-6 years ago, they add a co-op where there are 2 agents performing different elaborate ways of executing their target, plus the advancments in ai as of recently will make this even more emmersive, AND  THENNNNN imagine all of this in VR!!!! And trust me guys, hitman vr will continue to get better and better and better as time goes on, and the best part is that hitman won't be a one and done, it will be a long long long term franchise, and it's end is far out of site for the time being and for time to come, and I'm honestly really  excited for the ride.",

      "review": "Before putting my experience with the game down, I will clarify that if you want the WHOLE Hitman World of Assassination game with all the missions, you are going to want to purchase either the Standard Edition or the Deluxe Edition. Getting the Starter Pack will allow you to play only the tutorial missions, and buying WoA Part One will only allow you to play and access the first six missions in the game. There's a tab labelled as \"Compare Editions\" on the Steam page listing for the game that shows what all content you get with the edition that you purchase on here that helps explain it so if there's confusion with my explanation for which one to get, then I suggest referring to it. It's the same gripe that I hold with the Elusive Target DLC packs as well, where the only real value from it is getting some new cosmetics and access to certain Elusive Target missions.\n\nWorld of Assassination is one of my favorite games in the whole Hitman franchise. With how well the levels are designed along with a well written storyline that ropes you into playing, it's a very addicting game that makes you want to come back to replay it frequently. Whether it's getting satisfying sniper kills from afar or just eliminating your target in the most comedic, slap stick method possible, the amount of fun that comes from this game is pretty much limitless. Even after beating the story several times, I still find myself coming back to either see if I can beat a mission on Silent Assassin or just to see if there's a new way to take down a target.\n\nOne thing I will complain about though is some of the DLC missions like The Sarajevo Six and Seven Deadly Sins aren't ones that bring a lot of value to the game though. They're more just filler missions that reuse some of the levels in the game as a way to add more content in. Sure, it works as a way to add more into the game, but it would've made more sense to have them come included with the game already, instead of as their own separate DLC content packs you had to purchase.\n\nBut despite that, the game is really solid and enjoyable. If you're looking into getting this game, I recommend getting it when it's on discount, along with purchasing either the Standard or Deluxe edition so you can experience it in it's full entirety.",

      "review": "I will say this first - definitely a great game overall!\nBUT it's missing the dark, chilling atmosphere that originally drew me into the series.\n\nThe classic Hitman titles (C47 to BM) nailed that cold, eerie tone (felt best in Hitman Contracts). That unsettling and weird, surreal ambience is what I really liked about Hitman (Beldingford Manor, Rotterdam, Shogun Showdown from SA). This formula was reinvented and beautifully refined in Blood Money. Agent 47 from those games felt like Grim Reaper - cold, silent, inevitable. The targets were also darker as you explore the map and realize how truly despicable they are. Music/Sound Design is awesome and unique too (Ave Maria from BM just rocks)\n\nNow things shifted a little with Hitman Absolution - don't know why the game gets so much hate, it's defintely an awesome game that added a lot of things and new perspective to hitman. Devs are different for Absolution and a change in tone felt like a nice \"one-off\" arc, where the \"good guy\" 47 protects the little girl out of loyalt to his old handler, so you can understand that it is more character-driven rather classic hitman experience.\n\nIn this series, WoA trilogy. We have an amazing story here, but something feels lighter and it's not that dark and unsettling anymore. There is less tension, the game is less menacing, it doesn't really bring out the terrible side in humans that made 47 look like the good guy. This one is just a super spy Agent 47 saving the world. That being said, if you play this game without this expectation that I had, you're gonna love it! The team worked really hard on this and you can tell.\n\nClosing Note: Agent 47 in C47 to BM era was a ghost in the shadows, he was basically inevitable like Death. In Absolution, Agent 47 is basically stylish Max Payne from MP3 and finally in WoA, Agent 47 is a Spy like James Bond. \n\nHaving grown up playing these games, kudos to the creators!",

It's probably holding back so many players–such as myself–from experiencing the game.\nThe game itself is super fun as well. But I CANNOT recommend purchasing the game from steam due to the store page's current state.\n\nlovely update: THEY'VE DONE IT AGAIN! The current 80% off on the \"part one\" edition includes literally only the first part of the game, in SPITE of it making it look like the FULL game is on sale. They're ACTIVELY worsening their storefront at this point.\n\nAdditional edit: Some of us argue that the customer needs to thoroughly look through a Steam page before purchasing something, and that's 100% agreeable and something that I do now. \n\nExcept, it's the fact that ~$8,00 is the price that shows up when you search \"Hitman World of Assassination\" on Steam. It's deliberately set up that way to trick people, which is what I find incredibly scummy.\n\nIt's tricking people who initially wouldn't buy an $80 game into purchasing a heavily nerfed version. Said customer will THEN need to purchase Hitman AGAIN.\n\nI won't deny that my purchase was incredibly stupid. But that does NOT justify the storefront being absolute garbage. And, from the games I have purchased on and off of steam, it's NOT a common or acceptable practice for established publishers to try to deliberately trick their customers.\n\nAnd, realistically speaking, the \"Part One\" edition has pretty much no reason to exist in the same store page, especially not when it was paired alongside the \"Sapienza Edition\" of the game, which I was foolish enough to purchase.\n\nAnd you have to remember that World of Assassination was supposed to merge the versions, eliminating all confusion when it comes to purchasing the game.

      "review": "Excellent game, all but for...\r\n\r\nFreelancer mode. HItman is pretty much the best installment in the entire franchise, leaning more on Blood Money in mroe ways than one to make it classic. However the end of life late-game hard mode, called freelancer is, without mincing words incredibly stupid.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest beef I have ever had with a game is purposefully sabotaging you and punishing failure. Freelancer doubles down on the latter. I have no problem with acquiring the necessary equipment for 47, or that you have to pack you stuff for missions and have to be frugal about it. However I cannot understand, condone, let alone forgive losing stuff you have already collected but not in use (thankfully not weapons you leave at home. Worse, they are the utility items). All gadgets disappear the moment you fail a mission once you progress past the early sequence of missions in the campaign. Each sequence ends with an incredibly tough mission where you need to profile the target from 4-6 people, most of the with armed covert escorts (not a problem), however the game can randomly trigger the enemy to flee, or arouse suspicion by otherwise inoccuous stuff you do that would not register in the normal game. The game had established rules and trained you to behave according to them. \r\n\r\n So basically aside from rewriting the rules of engagement and piling on difficulty (the argument of hard mode cannot apply here, this mode is deliberately left there as another method and highly advertised for completion, which you would do, because that is basic human behaviouristic completionism. AKA it is there to complete, therefore you should do, as advertised).... the game also hamstrings you in your approaches. Missions drop you off in the middle of hostile bases, hot spots for which you may not have the optimal or anz equipment possible (and you have no idea where it starts you off either), and leaves you with no reachable exit points either... so you are left with exiting, which automatically counts as a total loss.\r\n\r\nThe game is too preoccupied with its difficulty to notice that it is not fun at all. And no, that is objectively more than applicable, because the missions themselves are glofiried survival mode missions from the arcade gameplay, with the possibility of not necessarily offing the targets by using a single method. But the anemic pay of a single mission makes it necessary to go for the extra objectives, most of which again, require equipment out of your ability to acquire.\r\n\r\nGetting good is not an option here, because the game literally makes you afraid to risk the already gathered stuff you have. If that is the case, the risks outweigh the gains. Add to this the fact that you can sinply abandon a campaign, and for some reason suffer a monetary penalty for it. Remember the part about customizing your approach and picking what you want to do? Apparently that can only ever apply if you are willing to commit to perfect runs with unreasonable circumstances, random impossible loadouts that require to grind. \r\n\r\nGrinding does not make your games better devs. It is a overglorified method of robbing us of our time. Games need not, should not last for too long. And they really cannot, do not, especially with anti-user difficulty. Freelancer does not teach. It just punishes.",

Or it could be a shard of a reason I had 10 years ago.\r\n\r\nConfused? \r\n\r\nSo am I. \r\n\r\nThis review doubles as a warning. This game is posted in a bunch of different pieces, some similarly named and all of them way more difficult than they should be to find out which does what. I had this wishlisted after playing it on console and loving it. What a great game. I would like to own it forever.\r\n\r\nSo it turns out I've got the wrong edition. This one is missing 2/3rds of the game. Silly me for expecting when I wishlisted the whole game it was more than just a placeholder for the scam version. Why are they allowed to post it this way? Who knows. They just are and they absolutely shouldn't be. \r\n\r\nAnother funny little quirk is that they've labelled the full version and a cosmetic pack very similarly. So if you want the full version, please be careful to triple check what you're getting lest an educated scammer creep up behind for a little excitement with a space probe.\r\n\r\nAnnual rectal check-ups aside, you should also be aware that there are a whole lotta levels that aren't even included in the super special platinum version that comes with ALL the parts of the game. Those ones, you pay for separately. While that is more according to expectations when it comes to DLC than a game chopped into thirds and hidden in different corners of the world along with a box to bury yourself in when your arthritic old bones find all the levels, some of these extra levels are from the games it says it includes. Tiffany needs to get through college so those levels are separate. \r\n\r\nOther than that, this is an excellent game. One of my favourites. I can recommend you play it. But not buy it. Buying it is an inferior experience to playing it. It could be a punishment from the gods but even they gave Sisyphus a whole rock.",

I don't think there has ever been as convoluted as a game to navigate on the Steam store just to do what the game promises to be able to do. It also turns out that around 2023 you could just connect your IOI account with Hitman 1,2,3 and then just play all 3 in WOA, but not ANYMORE they decided that it was obsolete.\n\nHonestly I love IOI games, but fuck this game, and fuck this company I hope they go bankrupt.",

It's probably holding back so many players–such as myself–from experiencing the game.\nThe game itself is super fun as well. But I CANNOT recommend purchasing the game from steam due to the store page's current state.\n\nlovely update: THEY'VE DONE IT AGAIN! The current 80% off on the \"part one\" edition includes literally only the first part of the game, in SPITE of it making it look like the FULL game is on sale. They're ACTIVELY worsening their storefront at this point.\n\nAdditional edit: Some of us argue that the customer needs to thoroughly look through a Steam page before purchasing something, and that's 100% agreeable and something that I do now. \n\nExcept, it's the fact that ~$8,00 is the price that shows up when you search \"Hitman World of Assassination\" on Steam. It's deliberately set up that way to trick people, which is what I find incredibly scummy.\n\nIt's tricking people who initially wouldn't buy an $80 game into purchasing a heavily nerfed version. Said customer will THEN need to purchase Hitman AGAIN.\n\nI won't deny that my purchase was incredibly stupid. But that does NOT justify the storefront being absolute garbage. And, from the games I have purchased on and off of steam, it's NOT a common or acceptable practice for established publishers to try to deliberately trick their customers.\n\nAnd, realistically speaking, the \"Part One\" edition has pretty much no reason to exist in the same store page, especially not when it was paired alongside the \"Sapienza Edition\" of the game, which I was foolish enough to purchase.\n\nAnd you have to remember that World of Assassination was supposed to merge the versions, eliminating all confusion when it comes to purchasing the game. The confusion was most certainly not eliminated, rather shifted in the way that makes the most money.",
