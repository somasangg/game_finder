Even after completing it I was happy to start a new one with a different character. There's choices of how you want your character to start out with bonus stats. I like that. \n\nNow the bad. Online is a complete joke and I don't even bother with it. Cheaters abound and ruin it. There is a seperate Society option available and if your lucky enough you might find a good one that is ran by someone with moral code. Good luck though. I'm in one and it's the only one I found. \n\nSo I recommend it for singleplayer but do not for multiplayer. Still giving it a positive review because I love the singleplayer aspect of the game. Those who complain about the monitary aspect are only out to get everything fast. You can get stuff by just playing though it might take awhile to max things which I don't care about.",

Has an absolutely amazing course designer packed with powerful architecture tools, and a vibrant community of designers and players revolving around it over on TGCTours. Has a rather weak career mode with lots of bloat, and some annoying bugs, but the courses and events that come with the game are strong, immersive and very replayable. However, DO NOT be bullied into ANY of the microtransactions or the clubhouse pass stuff, ignore them and arguably the worst thing about the game becomes a non-issue.",

Never thought I would write a good review for a 2k game, but 2k25 is the best online golf game there is to offer. 2k has continued to improve with each one of their games being released.\n\nI have 500 hours in this game and have not spent a single dollar on battle passes or store items. I enjoy leveling up all of the different golfer archetypes and completing challenges. This game has a ton of content and continues to give us updates!\n\nI mostly play online matchmaking, and the servers and matches have been good enough to keep me coming back. They have done a better job at switching up the courses and servers, but how about we add some online doubles 18 hole matches for higher stakes, give us some sort of online lobby so people can find each other to golf with, I know this is a long shot XD.\n\nBut overall, get this game if you like to golf. It honestly is the most sim type golf experience out there with a decent skill gap. If you play a lot, you will start to get lower scores! (just like real golf).",

I like the interview options at the end of a tournament and the rivalries are also nicely done. I also love the option to see your opponents shots during a tournament.\nReal game changer for me was the skilltree, different categories and different skills you can learn for each archetype.\nIt only get's 9/10 because of the loading times while in a menu and there were a few occasions where the game kind of lagged while I was preparing a shot, which resulted in completly missing that shot.\n\nWould definitely buy again!",

There are some really immersive features like several levels of club progression, a skill tree for player progression, and lots of online features.  Of course, there is a huge problem with obvious cheating online so be aware of that if you like online play.  It's absolutely absurd that 2K hasn't done anything about the guys that shoot 24-26 under and are at the top of every single Ranked Tours leaderboard.  Personally, I also enjoy the wagers play/skins for VC (virtual currency, the in-game currency).  It's not overly difficult to earn but it's also not so easy to get that you can buy everything quickly.  I think they have struck a nice balance in this area.  The items I dislike are the inconsistency of the ball starting right or left off the putter face when you are on a side slope...it's almost impossible to guess what it's going to do.  The cheating online, of course as I mentioned, is also horrible.  Lastly, there are a few items/skills locked behind a pay wall which is SUPER frustrating and is almost a deal breaker for me.  For in-game skills, EVERY player should ALWAYS have the opportunity to get EVERY skill through playing!!! Come on 2K...do better!  That's ridiculous to give online players that pay your premium pass that ability to make shots that others don't have.  They're not super meaningful types of shots...but man, this stuff needs to stop!!  Great game overall though...I love it and will continue to play it as long as I don't run into any meaningful pay walls.",

However - and this is a HUUUGE HOWEVER - during the main career mode the menus and overlays are terribly laggin. Stuttering, freezing, making me click 10 times, because even though the graphic for the button loaded 45 seconds ago, the button is still not clickable. \n\nThis often carries over to the first shot or sometimes even first putt in the first hole. At that point it basically makes you miss a shot.\n\nI really wanted to write about how awesome the game is and how after 200+ hours, I just feel I'm starting to get into it... but man these lags. \n\nI have a hint: maybe take some notes from the team that works on the in game store. Because those menus purr like a cat. They are smooth and seemless. Screens load up in split seconds. Make MyCareer mode work like the store and I will happily change this review to all superlatives.

This game is a really good simulation to the real thing. wind direction, elevation changes, the lie of the ball, above or below your feet, all require compensation in the shot, just like the real thing. Down slop, up slope, also need to be factored in when adjusting your shoot. Getting it all right, and getting that \"money\" shot is really very satisfying.\r\n\r\nAll very good things from a gamer perspective. But here's the problem. The menu systems are really laggy and take time to load in... and then it becomes stable. It can be frustration when all you want to do is get on with the game and click the next thing. In game it is stable, albeit the occasional hickup mid swing.... yeah, you can guess the result. Granted, my computer is from 2020, and my system meets the minimum requirements. However, not much more beyond that.\r\n\r\nIt's not pay to win, but it speeds up the process.\r\n\r\nIN THE END IT IS YOU THAT MAKES THOSE \"MONEY\" SHOTS TO MAKE THE BIRDS SING.",

      "review": "After owning both 2K19 & 2K21 I was forced to get this version after on-line support was withdrawn from 2K21. An expensive and annoying measure.  However the two things I enjoyed perhaps the most on 2K21 was the ability to play and compete on hundreds of home-made courses including my own, sometimes with on-line friends and many times with ghost players. This was seriously missing after withdrawal of the on-line servers.\n2K25: Well I hated the fact that I had to go through all the 2K franchise sign-ups again that took ages. The gameplay itself: an easy start as it had put my skill levels back to basics but somewhat annoying to see that things got more difficult as my clubs and skills got better (counter-intuitively). I do not intend to spend extra on gimmicks like the Clubhouse Passes and VC cheat points! I did not think I would like this new Evo swing method but in practice it seems hardly different form the old system (maybe it gets more interesting on Pro levels) - The graphics, which at first seemed a real step up after 21 now seem to be only a very slight improvement –hardly worth all the fuss. I was relieved to be able to upload my home-made 2K19 courses again after finding my PC backups. After all said and done, I am enjoying this version and it has put new life into the old dog. \nI still think that £60 is a lot of money for a golf game, so glad that I got if at 40% discount in the sale. As said elsewhere there is no rival at present in the PC game market. If you still have the earlier versions and enjoy what you have then there is not much point in upgrading unless you want a new challenge.  If you don’t have those versions but like golf – then you have no choice –go for it!",

I do like the swing physics a little bit more and they seem to be a little more challenging which I don't mind. The biggest negative here is how ridiculously slow it is to unlock anything or gain VC. I have 20 hours played and have unlocked like 4 pieces of clothing and 2 clubs. You could spend the equivalent of pennies in VC that you get to buy things but you use the same currency to upgrade your character so you really sacrifice one for the other. It's pretty insane that you get basically nothing without pumping additional money into a game you already paid for.",

Even after completing it I was happy to start a new one with a different character. There's choices of how you want your character to start out with bonus stats. I like that. \n\nNow the bad. Online is a complete joke and I don't even bother with it. Cheaters abound and ruin it. There is a seperate Society option available and if your lucky enough you might find a good one that is ran by someone with moral code. Good luck though. I'm in one and it's the only one I found. \n\nSo I recommend it for singleplayer but do not for multiplayer. Still giving it a positive review because I love the singleplayer aspect of the game. Those who complain about the monitary aspect are only out to get everything fast. You can get stuff by just playing though it might take awhile to max things which I don't care about.",

      "review": "PGA Tour 2K25: the only game where your worst enemy is wind speed and your own terrible putting.\nHas the game remained unchanged from its two-year-old version? Quite the opposite – almost everything that was annoying back then has now been fixed. Let’s start with a little recap, though.\n\nThe hallmark of a good sports game is that if you start over, practice and play, you feel like you’re doing well, you feel like you’re improving and you feel like you can challenge even one of the world’s most famous golfers. That’s still true. 2K25’s difficulty settings are excellent, whether you want to relax at the end of a long day or challenge yourself with a marathon of “should I throw the controller out the window or not”, this is the right setting. I realized I had set the game a little too easy when I was leading my fellow competitors by 14 strokes at the end of a tournament, but I still enjoyed playing it night after night.\n\n“The controls are easy to understand for those who have played golf, and once you learn to factor in the wind, the slope of the course, and the flick of your thumb (or joystick) in one direction, the balls will start to find the green after a very short practice.” That’s still true and has been true throughout 2K’s PGA Tour series, but I still have to reiterate how great the game’s control system is. You only have yourself to blame for your mistakes, and that little breath-holding moment when a long putt curves towards the hole is still a dopamine spike for the brain.\n\nI have mentioned about the audiovisual implementation in the previous game. Then the narrators’ speeches convinced me despite the repetition, but this time I would have liked to have made more progress on this. The shortcuts “this player”, “featured player” have been used too much and there is no joy for the player when the commentators comment on the putt, when according to the screen readings a 10-foot putt causes the commentator to comment in the style of “what do you think of this putt? Well, I would say it is about a 12-foot putt”.\n\nI have complained about the game’s graphics on previous releases, but I don’t have to anymore. At its best, the game is truly beautiful, the HDR problems have been solved, the audience is no longer a cloned dollhouse and there are small details everywhere that make you smile when you watch them. I take my hat off to the game developers who polished the physics of waves hitting rocks or textured the game characters’ smartwatches. Many times I was also left wondering how the clouds floating above the golf courses were technically implemented. The game’s music is suitable for a golf TV broadcast, although it is not exactly humming, and the animations and sound effects are convincing in their realism.\n\nThe character progression in the game is also quite sensible, although I'm a little annoyed by how much social media followers are used as a progress indicator in so many games' career modes. There are enough game modes and challenges to play as many times as you can swing a club, and almost everything that can be licensed in the world of golf is licensed for the game. I don't know what's missing, but at least the U.S. Open, The Open, and PGA Championship tournaments are included, as well as a lot of professional players - although apparently not quite as many as in EA's equivalent golf game. And if the official courses aren't enough, you can use the Course Designer to test other players' creations or even create your own.\n\n👍Pros.\n- Three majors included is a huge step forward\n- Much-improved career mode on and off the course\n- Decent roster of PGA and LPGA players \n- The swing technology is the best yet\n\n👎Cons.\n- Commentary team still grates\n- More should have been made of the majors\n- Can be a bit fidgety working out the right settings\n- So many transition screens\n\n📊Overall.\nWhile it felt like you had to press the controller button a little too hard to get to the next tee from all the screens, loading times were reasonably short, and the game itself can be fast-forwarded.\n\nI haven't played 2K's most hardcore holeball competitor, EA Sports' PGA TOUR, but competition is always a good thing to keep games from getting bogged down in the sand. I don't know if it's a strong enough compliment to say that PGA Tour 2K25 is an all-around enjoyable virtual golf experience. Last time was such a disappointment that it has to be reflected in the star rating.\n🎯8/10\nAnd remember: it’s all fun and games until you triple bogey a par 3 and throw your controller into the water hazard.",

The game play is ok, I prefer triple click control and I am left handed. Playing as a lefty everything is backwards, when the swing meter says you pulled your shot and you club face was closed the ball should tail towards you or draw but instead it fades away from you. Triple click doesn't allow you to see wind direction or strength so you have to kinda eyeball the flag and trees to take a guess. While there are a few of today's stars in the game there are several of the top players missing. All in all it was a fun season to play through and win the fed ex cup but starting your second career season its just a repeat of season 1 with the exception of replacing the week 1 q school tourney with a different one.",

      "review": "PGA2k25 is a very good golf simulator. The difficulties from Perfect Swing to Legendary scale up pretty evenly and add more challenges and adapatations each time you go up, giving you a learning curve as you improve in the game. There are many clubs, clothes and evolution tools (for your clubs) to earn in the game and to purchase in the store. You can get along fine without spending any money, just make sure that you really want to play a substantial amount of golf before you plan on doing that.\r\n\r\nThe only real issue is with MyCareer. 2K uses a server to handshake your progress the entire time you play the MyCareer mode, and the servers they are using are not the best, so you get alot of lag in the menus and other times. During the actual round of golf, there is no lag. So that is a plus, but still it wouldnt be much work for 2K to improve their MyCareer menus.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the game is an 8/10 for me.",

      "review": "💬This is PGA 2K25 — where I go from ‘pro’ to ‘what was that?’ in one swing.\n\nEleven years ago, when EA Sports released Tiger Woods PGA Tour 15, an unknown developer, HB Studios, suddenly released a rather hardcore golf game called The Golf Club. The Golf Club was a golf simulator, and you really had to find patience and master the best golf game to succeed. Since then, HB Studios has refined their games, and as of 2020, they are the team behind the official PGA Tour golf games, along with 2K.\n\nPGA Tour 2K25 builds on the excellent PGA Tour 2K23 (these golf games are released every two years), which never quite got off the ground. PGA Tour 2K25 is a significant improvement over the previous game, this time featuring three major official golf tournaments, namely The U.S. The 2025 Open at Oakmont Country Club, the 153rd edition of The Open at Royal Portrush Golf Club, and the equally important PGA Championship at Quail Hollow Club. In addition to the courses and tournaments mentioned above, PGA Tour 2K25 features numerous other tournaments and over 20 official golf courses.\n\nWhen you start the game, you begin by creating your golfer in a highly detailed character editor. Throughout the game, you gain access to apparel, shoes, equipment, and accessories from 30 manufacturers, including Nike, Puma, Adidas, Ecco, TaylorMade, Skechers, Under Armour, and Tiger Woods' own new sports brand, Sun Day Red. Your character can be upgraded throughout the game with various attributes and skills, and your character's progression, as well as your equipment and Clubhouse Pass, evolves, whether you're playing the career section, playing the minigame, practicing your shots, or building a course in the in-game course editor.\n\nThe heart of PGA Tour 2K25 is MyCareer, a very comprehensive career section that encompasses numerous events, often spread over several rounds on the PGA Tour. In this section, in addition to performing well on courses around the world, you must build your own career and manage all your off-course commitments. It's important to have a strong social media profile to gain as many followers as possible, you should participate in interviews to please the press and fans, and you can also write articles for golf magazines to demonstrate your professionalism. Of course, you also need to nurture sponsors and participate in their events. As mentioned, you must constantly work to become the best player on the PGA Tour and win the coveted trophy.\n\nPGA Tour 2K25 offers hours of fun, as in addition to the extensive MyCareer feature, you can participate in daily and weekly online events, play various types of golf with up to three friends, from Stroke Play and Skins to Four-Ball, and enjoy the fun 2-on-2 Scramble mode. Both online and locally, you can play Topgolf, a mini-game against others where precision is key. You can participate in detailed practice sessions to improve parts of your game, and, as mentioned earlier, you can create your own courses, which can be modeled in minute detail, right down to the placement of every tree or bench.\n\nVisually, PGA Tour 2K25 is quite nice, but nothing special. The courses are attractive, and the menus you spend a lot of time on are easy to use and quite intuitive, but there's a bit of an \"uncanny valley\" in the faces of some players. The visuals are certainly passable, but not impressive. The soundtrack is okay, as you'd expect from a golf game, and I actually think the commentators do a decent job. However, you sometimes notice that what they're saying doesn't quite align with what's happening on the course, and sometimes they contradict each other a bit.\n\n✅Pros.\n- Perfect Swing and EvoSwing make the game very accessible.\n- MyCareer is a truly comprehensive career section.\n- Many hours of fun are available here.\n- It's a well-functioning golf game.\n\n❌Cons.\n- The commentators sometimes don't quite follow what's happening on the track.\n- The graphics are a bit simple.\n\n🧾Summary.\nPGA Tour 2K25 is a truly solid golf game, with hours of gameplay, tons of content, and, last but not least, a customizable difficulty level that allows almost anyone—beginners and hardcore golf enthusiasts alike—to join in. The massive MyCareer feature, which is the centerpiece of the game, will consume many hours of your time—but again, the game is so customizable that you can customize this entire section to \"respect your time.\"\n\nPGA Tour 2K25 is a major evolution of PGA Tour 2K23 and is arguably the best golf game you've played in a long time. If, like me, you're not afraid to wear ugly golf clothes and maintain your best manners, you should definitely check out PGA Tour 2K25.\n🔚8/10\nIf missing fairways was a stat, I’d be in the Hall of Fame.",

Two players on the same difficulty had equal chances to win.\nIn PGA 2k25, the main nominator seems to be virtual currency and premium season pass ownership.\nYou have to level your character. Each skill point costs VC. If you don't want to spend extra money additional to buying the full-price game, you have to play a lot before being set up for competition. \nYou have to level and upgrade your gear. Upgrading a club requires an \"evo tool\". After grinding the career for 30h, all of my clubs are ready to upgrade for a long time. But: I only earned 2 evo tools. If I want to upgrade all of my clubs, I can go and buy more evo tools with real money (in a 70€ game). The only purpose of this feature seems to be pushing players to invest more money to be able to progress, just like in a filthy F2P game.\nYou have to progress in the season passes to unlock shot types (no premium required, but it takes much longer without). There are upgrades for these shot types that are locked behind premium season passes. 2K you lost your mind.\n\nUnfortunately there is no competition for this game.

Yes there is even another avenue for them to lock away content and try to wring more money from your wallet.\n\nThis is the first time I’ve experienced this in a game and it feels like a bait and switch.\n\nWhat’s even more frustrating is that buried beneath this dung pile of micro transactions paywalls is a really nice golf game,\n\nThe swing mechanic is difficult to master but once you do it feels fluid. I like the RPG aspects of choosing an archetype for your character that affects their abilities and the choices you can make with your persona in career mode. \n\nThe graphics are nice and you have plenty of courses to choose from. For the most part the game physics are accurate and depending on your difficulty settings it emulates golf in the real world accurately. \n\nIt’s a good golf game ruined by micro transactions and anti consumer behavior.\n\nFor those wondering how it compares to the other golf game currently available, EA Sports PGA Tour, the career mode is better in 2K25 as are the customization options but EA Sports PGA Tour has a better overall presentation and doesn’t feel like you’re getting ripped off by micro transactions. \n\nI’ll continue to play 2K25 because the framework for a solid golf game is here but it feels like a rip off and the grinding required to get the most out of the game is exhausting.",

Stopped after tw08 cause the industry died due to all the cheating.   When pga 2k came out with golf I never bought it because it had no 3 click.  Found out they finally added it and bought the 2k23 version and had a blast.   Got a new pc finally to upgrade to windows 11,  excited to buy the new 2k25,  and I find out 3 click is not allowed in ranked matches.   What snub to the pc gaming community.   They didn't even bother to offer a separate qeue,  and instead they showed their disdain for the pc community.  I will be boycotting 2ksports.   Guess all we have left to buy a gaming pc for is first person shooters.  RIP pc gaming.  Just when I thought it was gonna pick back up.  I come from the golden years of 2004 with counterstrike.  and 2014 with LoL,  but these woke communists are really ruining society.  wow.  Someone needs to be fired imo.

Swinging feels a bit better than 23 and the putting took some time to get used to, but for the first half of the career playthrough my game would freeze and crash randomly right after completing a round. Throughout the entirety of the career, the game would consistently lag so much and sometimes mid swing. Completing a round was laggy, checking swing path was laggy, to the point that the lag was inescapable. For a game mode that's offline, why is it so choppy? I shouldn't have to worry that my game will freeze after finishing every single round. The menus were slow in '23, and they're even worse in '25. This can't be a PC hardware issue because I'm running an X3D CPU and a 4090 GPU so what gives?\n\nThen there's the VC issues. I saw the reviews complaining about the slow accumulation of VC before buying the game, and thought it couldn't be that bad. I was wrong. It takes forever to build up enough VC to actually bring your OVR to a high level. As an example, I finished the very last round of the entire career mode and earned 17 VC.

Since initially installing the game we'be been hit with messages saying that that game was being unlisted by October.  I though OK, well we can just exchange these games & get this version 2k25, until I saw the reviews about the bait & switch tactics & all the micro transactions.  Decided we would hold onto the version we had and wait to see what comes of this game as time went by.  Then this weekend it was on Steam for a free play weekend.  I decided I would download & give it a go just to see if we should bother getting it once they turn off the servers for 2K21.  I downloaded it and tried to play.\r\n\r\nUpon stating the game I went through all the BS privacy/user TOS crap.  Then I got to a screen where it wantes you to create a 2K account, offering you 500 of their virtual currency.  I didn't want to do this but it gives no option to just play.  I watched as the countdown time clicked down 30 minutes.  I had hoped that I could wait it out but in the end it said I had to refresh to get a new code & sign up.  So here we go, taks mgr then quit the game (you can't quit from that screen).  Now I'm leaving this supposed review hoping to keep people from wasting their time & disk space/ ssd wear on this complete POS.  I hate EA but I'm hoping that they release some golf game soon that might be decent - really not going to hold my breath though.  But I can tell you, once the 2k21 version I have stops working on xbox, I won't be buying/considering another 2k related game.  Piss on them.  There's so much content out here I'll never miss their offerings.\r\n\r\nTL/DR.  Save your time, money & disk space.  Not worth even thinking about.

The main one being the ability to choose 3 click for competitive mode. 3 click is there for you to enjoy if your just playing the game by yourself.  The time you spend developing your avatar.  That being said, When you are finally ready to take on other people, your told you must use swing stick mode, either with keyboard and mouse or with a controller.  This so dumb.  To remove a play style that has existed in golf games for as long as golf games have been around is moronic. Why would someone spend money on a update , when it does not offer the same elements from the previous versions?  Competitive mode is my most played mode from 2k23. Once I had hit lvl 50 , it is pretty much all I play.  My clubs are all max level also. So competitive is the only way to enjoy the game. Reminds me of the old days of consoles and playing Tiger Woods with my friends at my house. \nWhen 2K sports brings back 3 click to competitive, I will then look at purchasing.  Until then, I wait to see if EA will finally decide it wants to make a great golf game again.  They have not since the last Tiger Woods PGA game on PC back in the early 2000s.",

Over years of time, the Dev's have worked to create a very accurate physics framework for a wide range of clubs, conditions, and shot types.

Either you enter an endless grind or open a fat wallet to the equipment you want and the clothes you desire for your look. Unlike previous versions, you can't use any set of clubs you want, even if the company is your sponsor. Rediculous. It will cost nearly $100 US to get the clubs you desire for your player. This is a steep price to pay compared to other games' cosmetic purchases.\n\nSecondly, although the game has a high skill requirement in shot mechanics, your shots can be deliberately nerfed by the game randomly. There's nothing more frustrating than having an important shot ahead of you, only to have it flubbed through no fault of your own.\n\nI've been with this series from the beginning, buying each version when if first comes out at full price. What started as a sleeper upstart challenging EA Sports PGA Tour and winning with an innovative golf game being constantly honed and perfected over the years has been tainted and polluted by greedy corporations.

You’d think that paying $70 would at least get you a fair progression system and a decent amount of content, but apparently 2K disagrees.\n\nEverything — and I mean everything — costs VC. Want to upgrade your attributes? VC. Want to buy clubs? VC. Want shoes, gloves, hats, sunglasses? Yep, more VC. And since they recently nerfed VC gains, be prepared to grind roughly 363 full 18-hole rounds just to get your MyPlayer to level 99. You earn about 25–50 VC per round, while one single attribute point costs around 250 VC. And there are half a dozen of those attributes, each with tied stats that drop if you raise the opposite one. It’s literally designed to make you cave and pay real money.\n\nThis is the kind of system you'd expect from a free-to-play mobile title — not from a AAA sports sim. I actually requested a refund on Steam because I refuse to support this level of shameless cash grabbing. Never again, 2K.\n\nWhat makes it worse is how barren the customization is compared to older entries. You only get three sets of clubs per category, most of which are outdated. You can’t even customize individual shafts or grips like in 2K23 — everything is locked into a single uniform style. It’s painfully obvious they’re holding back cosmetics for some future “season pass” or drip-fed paid content update. If I pay $70, I expect the game to come with fully featured equipment and proper progression, not to be nickel-and-dimed at every turn.\n\nYou should be able to max out a MyPlayer in offline career mode within two or three seasons. At this rate, it’ll take ten — and not because the game is balanced, but because they intentionally slow you down just so they can sell you the “shortcut”.\n\nAnd just to really seal the deal on how absurd this all is:\n\nI tried to name my character Tucker, but the game told me “this name violates our profanity filter.”\nSo I used Tucken, and it worked.\nFirst round in, I’m playing against an NPC named Tucker.\n\n10/10 game design.",

I mean the golfing seems okay, but you earn action points (AP) to upgrade your character as you go along, and you have to spend real money to apply those to you character. No thanks.\n\nI mean I read somewhere you earn enough VC to apply your AP but that simply isn't true. I had earned about 550 VC and 56 AP, but 550 VC is enough to apply 3 AP. Now that's bullcrap. I would not recommend a 2K Sports game to anyone based on this alone.\n\nI actually did the math it would cost around forty bucks to apply all the AP I had earned. That's laughable.",

Also, there are some major performance issues that need to be taken care of, sometimes the game locks at 35 frames when im running 120+ consistently, and will even drop to 5-10 frames sometimes when playing at tpc san antonio. just buy 2k23 and save your money",
