      "review": "This review is hot off Sniper Elite 3 and oh man, the improvements are obvious and very welcome!\r\n\r\nIt's similar to Sniper Elite 3 in gameplay style, that is the sniper-shooter-stealth combination in a sandbox with various objectives, but there are changes.  The setting has evolved from 1942 Afrika to 1943 Italia.  Replacing the arid deserts are coastal villages, lush forests, mountainous regions.  With those mountains comes new climbing mechanics which gives each map a lot of vertical play, high ground is a much greater advantage in 4 than it was in 3.\r\n\r\nLarger levels with a lot of different ways to approach combat.  Some truly excellent sniper spots, great close-combat / stealth opportunities.  Those 500-meter shots where you visibly see the effect of the wind is fantastic!\r\n\r\nMassive graphic improvement to the terrain, character models, and kill-cam.\r\n\r\nEach rifle, secondary weapon (i.e., submachine gun, shotgun), and pistol also come with their own challenges to unlock new skins and perks.\r\n\r\nI'm only about half-way through the campaign so far, but immediate thoughts are WOW!",

      "review": "Honestly, this game surprised me. I picked it up just for the sniping, but I ended up really enjoying the whole thing. Landing a long-range shot is insanely satisfying, and the slow-motion kill cams never stop being cool. Every time you pull the trigger, you feel it.\n\nWhat I like most is that you can play how you want. You can sneak around and take everyone out quietly, or set traps and watch enemies walk right into them. The maps are big enough that you can try different approaches every time — it doesn’t feel like a hallway shooter.\n\nThe story is alright, nothing crazy, but the gameplay completely makes up for it. Co-op is super fun too if you have a friend; clearing a base together is a blast.\n\nNot perfect — sometimes the AI goes full genius mode and other times acts clueless — but overall it’s still a great time.\n\nIf you like sniping, stealth, or tactical shooters, this game is absolutely worth playing.\nI’d recommend it for sure.",

      "review": "I’ve spent some time with this game and honestly, it surprised me in a way I didn’t fully expect. I don’t want to sound dramatic, but there’s something oddly satisfying about how everything fits together — not in some perfect, polished “advertisement” way, but more like a game that knows exactly what it wants to be and just… goes for it.\n\nThe first thing I noticed is the atmosphere. Every part of the game — the visuals, the sound, the pacing — kind of blends into this feeling that you’re actually inside its world, even if you’re just casually playing. I know that sounds a bit cliché, but it’s true. Sometimes it’s chaotic, sometimes slow, sometimes you’re just wandering around thinking “ok, what now?” but that’s honestly part of the charm. The game doesn’t try to rush you unless it actually needs to.\n\nGameplay-wise, it has this mix of familiar elements and small twists that keep things from feeling stale. Nothing groundbreaking, maybe, but it all works together in a way that feels natural. There were moments when I thought “yeah, I’ve seen this in other games,” but then the game throws in tiny details or unexpected interactions that make it stand out just enough. It’s the kind of thing you only notice after a few hours, when you start connecting the dots.\n\nPerformance has been mostly fine. A little rough spot here and there, but honestly, show me a game these days that doesn’t have something weird happening once in a while. Nothing game-breaking on my end, at least. You can clearly tell the developers put effort into this, even if a few edges are still a bit sharp. Again — part of the charm.\n\nWhat I really appreciate is that the game gives you space to play the way you want. Some people will rush through every objective, others will take their time exploring or messing around, and both approaches actually feel valid. I like games that don’t punish you for not following some “correct” path.\n\nOverall, I’d say this is one of those titles that grows on you the longer you play. It doesn’t try too hard to impress in the first five minutes — instead it slowly builds its identity, layer by layer, until you suddenly realize you’ve been playing way longer than you planned. If you’re looking for something that balances comfort with challenge, familiar mechanics with fresh touches, and a world that’s just fun to be in, then I genuinely think this one is worth giving a shot.\n\nWould I recommend it?\nYeah, I would — maybe not to everyone, because no game is for everyone, but definitely to anyone who likes getting lost in a game for a bit and discovering things at their own pace.",

(it's the real Hitler this time)\n- As usual, the killcam shows in beautiful gory detail how your bullets kills fascists.\n- Levels are way bigger than they were in SE3 and you have much more freedom.\n- There's a little skill system which allows you to pick between two skills for six slots.\n- There's silent ammo for rifles and pistols, making sniping much less reliant on environmental sounds and allowing you to pick non-Welrod pistols.\n- Grenades and mines have two different modes now (usually a delay).\n- TNT can self-explode now.\n- More variety in enemies.\n- You can shoot almost all lamps now.\n- Nice locations.\n- You can create a detailed custom difficulty.\n- Challenges, ribbons, etc. are nice additions.\n- Weapon unlock system encourages playing differently.\n\n[b]The Bad[/b]\n\n- Weapon unlock system includes some really annoying and grindy challenges.\n- Pointless unlock system for some weapons and consumables.\n- Some weapons seem useless.\n\n[b]The Ugly[/b]\n\nBoth a mission of the DLC campaign and the \"kill Hitler\" mission have super-annoying alarms that cannot be turned off.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nThis is a vast improvement over SE3, just like it was a huge leap from SE2. It basically feels like the shackles have come off and the player is finally truly free to take out the enemy like they want to. Recommended to anyone who loves sneaky murder man games.",

Not ultra-realistic, but darn good.\n- Fun and interesting ways to dispose of enemies. (Plus an \"x-ray cam\" of the injury.)\n- Maps are structured well. You probably won't get lost in them. \n\nA few minor criticisms:\n- Leveling seems to take longer than it should. \n- Occasionally, when I would sniper a guy and hit a \"non lethal\" area of his body (leg, arm, some portions of the torso), it wouldn't kill him or even knock him down. He'd just look around like \"What was that?!?\", and go back to whatever he was doing before. It seems like the devs could have put in a wounded status for enemies. For example, they could give them a limp or disable them somehow.\n- Hiding bodies can be a problem unless you're near a convenient cliff, a patch of tall grass, or  a pile of stuff. In addition, sometimes I'd try to chuck a body off of a cliff, it would get caught on something, and the game wouldn't let me re-pick up the body to try to throw it again. \n\nStill very much worth it. :)",

The setting has evolved from 1942 Afrika to 1943 Italia.  Replacing the arid deserts are coastal villages, lush forests, mountainous regions.  With those mountains comes new climbing mechanics which gives each map a lot of vertical play, high ground is a much greater advantage in 4 than it was in 3.\r\n\r\nLarger levels with a lot of different ways to approach combat.  Some truly excellent sniper spots, great close-combat / stealth opportunities.  Those 500-meter shots where you visibly see the effect of the wind is fantastic!\r\n\r\nMassive graphic improvement to the terrain, character models, and kill-cam.\r\n\r\nEach rifle, secondary weapon (i.e., submachine gun, shotgun), and pistol also come with their own challenges to unlock new skins and perks.\r\n\r\nI'm only about half-way through the campaign so far, but immediate thoughts are WOW!",

Landing a long-range shot is insanely satisfying, and the slow-motion kill cams never stop being cool. Every time you pull the trigger, you feel it.\n\nWhat I like most is that you can play how you want. You can sneak around and take everyone out quietly, or set traps and watch enemies walk right into them. The maps are big enough that you can try different approaches every time — it doesn’t feel like a hallway shooter.\n\nThe story is alright, nothing crazy, but the gameplay completely makes up for it. Co-op is super fun too if you have a friend; clearing a base together is a blast.\n\nNot perfect — sometimes the AI goes full genius mode and other times acts clueless — but overall it’s still a great time.\n\nIf you like sniping, stealth, or tactical shooters, this game is absolutely worth playing.\nI’d recommend it for sure.",

      "review": "First playthrough review time.\r\n\r\nSniper Elite 4 keeps the same base as the earlier game but brings a few useful changes. Now, movement is more flexible with the ability to crouch-run, climb, and take cover in bushes. These help during stealth, which works better than before. There are also more options to stay quiet during missions. The shooting system is mostly the same, but the kill cam has better visuals and now appears during melee attacks and trap kills too. Even with that, enemy bodies often look untouched after being hit, which reduces some of the impact.\r\n\r\nThe maps in this game are larger and offer more space to move around. Missions can still be completed quickly if you go directly to the main targets, but there is more to do if you decide to explore. Some weapon upgrades are unlocked by reaching certain numbers in kills or shots, which gives small goals to aim for. The game has several difficulty levels and the highest one gives very little help to the player and makes early attempts hard unless the map is already known. While the online multiplayer part is nearly empty on some systems, the co-op mode is still usable.\r\n\r\nOverall, this game is a better version of the one before it. It does not bring big changes but improves many small things. The story remains simple and the campaign is short, but the bigger maps and better stealth systems give the player more ways to move through missions. It stands as the strongest title in the series so far and gives a solid experience for those who prefer slow and methodical approach to gameplay.",

Not fantastic but certainly very good (I completed the campaign which held my interest throughout which is saying something).  Very good gunplay, and certainly playable again after a year or so of \"forgetting\" given the exceptional open world design which leads to multiple ways to complete the level.  Eight well-thought out and expansive missions.  Go in guns blazing and probably 2 hours per mission-- but if you play the \"Sniper\" (and why wouldn't you given the title?), expect 25-40 hours of solid game play.    Voice acting is \"meh\" but the protagonist is very good.  Story is fine but nothing to write home about.   Not a huge fan of the \"boss-like puzzle\" ending which required a half-dozen reloads, but the outcome was particularly satisfying when solved.  Very happy with the on-sale purchase and I'd wait for when it is 50%+ off....",

      "review": "I’ve spent some time with this game and honestly, it surprised me in a way I didn’t fully expect. I don’t want to sound dramatic, but there’s something oddly satisfying about how everything fits together — not in some perfect, polished “advertisement” way, but more like a game that knows exactly what it wants to be and just… goes for it.\n\nThe first thing I noticed is the atmosphere. Every part of the game — the visuals, the sound, the pacing — kind of blends into this feeling that you’re actually inside its world, even if you’re just casually playing. I know that sounds a bit cliché, but it’s true. Sometimes it’s chaotic, sometimes slow, sometimes you’re just wandering around thinking “ok, what now?” but that’s honestly part of the charm. The game doesn’t try to rush you unless it actually needs to.\n\nGameplay-wise, it has this mix of familiar elements and small twists that keep things from feeling stale. Nothing groundbreaking, maybe, but it all works together in a way that feels natural. There were moments when I thought “yeah, I’ve seen this in other games,” but then the game throws in tiny details or unexpected interactions that make it stand out just enough. It’s the kind of thing you only notice after a few hours, when you start connecting the dots.\n\nPerformance has been mostly fine. A little rough spot here and there, but honestly, show me a game these days that doesn’t have something weird happening once in a while. Nothing game-breaking on my end, at least. You can clearly tell the developers put effort into this, even if a few edges are still a bit sharp. Again — part of the charm.\n\nWhat I really appreciate is that the game gives you space to play the way you want. Some people will rush through every objective, others will take their time exploring or messing around, and both approaches actually feel valid. I like games that don’t punish you for not following some “correct” path.\n\nOverall, I’d say this is one of those titles that grows on you the longer you play. It doesn’t try too hard to impress in the first five minutes — instead it slowly builds its identity, layer by layer, until you suddenly realize you’ve been playing way longer than you planned. If you’re looking for something that balances comfort with challenge, familiar mechanics with fresh touches, and a world that’s just fun to be in, then I genuinely think this one is worth giving a shot.\n\nWould I recommend it?\nYeah, I would — maybe not to everyone, because no game is for everyone, but definitely to anyone who likes getting lost in a game for a bit and discovering things at their own pace.",

Pretty schematic and repetetive - bait, kill, hide, repeat.\nOld games were Sniper Elite, indeed (my favourite is the first one), this one forces you to be melee/pistol madman ( [i] Hello mr. 47 [/i] ) instead of sniping.
