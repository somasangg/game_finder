You log in, grab your rewards, level up a few wizards, and feel like a tactical genius for clicking literally nothing.\nNo sweaty leaderboards, no 400-button combos, no twelve currencies to track. Just progress, sparkles, and that sweet dopamine drip of idle upgrades. The art’s colorful, the vibe’s chill, and the game somehow makes you feel productive while doing absolutely nothing.\nBasically: Firestone plays itself, but still makes you feel like the hero.\n10/10, my coffee got cold, but my heroes got stronger.",

The game felt a bit overwhelming. There were a lot of systems thrown at me right away, and I wasn’t really sure what I was supposed to be focusing on. Progress felt slow, and I couldn’t tell if I was doing things “right.” I actually considered dropping it a few times early on.\r\n\r\nBut I stuck with it, and I’m glad I did. Over time, things started to make more sense. The mechanics, while a bit confusing at first, gradually became clear. Once you understand how the different systems interact things like team synergy, gear upgrades, talents, and the value of idle rewards, the game really opens up. There’s a surprising amount of depth here for an idle RPG.\r\n\r\nWhat I enjoy most is that it respects your time. You can check in a few times a day, make your upgrades, tweak your lineup, and feel like you’ve made meaningful progress. There’s also enough content to keep you engaged for the long haul — events, guilds, multiple progression paths, and a steady drip of new features from the developers. It always feels like there’s something to work toward.\r\n\r\nIt’s not perfect, of course. The early game could use a bit more onboarding or guidance, and I imagine some players bounce off before they really get to see what the game has to offer. But if you’re patient, and you enjoy idle games that reward long-term planning and incremental improvement, Firestone is definitely worth your time.\r\n\r\nI came in unsure and confused, but now it’s part of my daily routine. It’s become one of those games I keep coming back to, and after 150+ hours, I’m still not done.\r\n\r\nHighly recommended, just give it a little time to click.",

I just think their are some other games out there that I'd rather play kinda goes for every game lol.\n\nIf I had to be as honest as I could be, I try to leave out as many good reviews as I can, just wanted to see what my dad was up to, and it just feels like I have to grind everyday to seem maybe cool, or good at the game. He doesn't play anymore and I'm happy he spends more time with me, and kinda everyone in our house. \n\nIf I had to speak out for my dad I guess its an \"OK\" game I recommend it, but please don't no life the game <3",

That’s when Firestone swoops in like a cozy blanket made of loot and dragons. 🐉\nIt’s the perfect “I’m technically gaming” experience — your heroes do all the work while you take all the credit. You log in, grab your rewards, level up a few wizards, and feel like a tactical genius for clicking literally nothing.\nNo sweaty leaderboards, no 400-button combos, no twelve currencies to track. Just progress, sparkles, and that sweet dopamine drip of idle upgrades. The art’s colorful, the vibe’s chill, and the game somehow makes you feel productive while doing absolutely nothing.\nBasically: Firestone plays itself, but still makes you feel like the hero.\n10/10, my coffee got cold, but my heroes got stronger.",

The game felt a bit overwhelming. There were a lot of systems thrown at me right away, and I wasn’t really sure what I was supposed to be focusing on. Progress felt slow, and I couldn’t tell if I was doing things “right.” I actually considered dropping it a few times early on.\r\n\r\nBut I stuck with it, and I’m glad I did. Over time, things started to make more sense. The mechanics, while a bit confusing at first, gradually became clear. Once you understand how the different systems interact things like team synergy, gear upgrades, talents, and the value of idle rewards, the game really opens up. There’s a surprising amount of depth here for an idle RPG.\r\n\r\nWhat I enjoy most is that it respects your time. You can check in a few times a day, make your upgrades, tweak your lineup, and feel like you’ve made meaningful progress. There’s also enough content to keep you engaged for the long haul — events, guilds, multiple progression paths, and a steady drip of new features from the developers. It always feels like there’s something to work toward.\r\n\r\nIt’s not perfect, of course. The early game could use a bit more onboarding or guidance, and I imagine some players bounce off before they really get to see what the game has to offer. But if you’re patient, and you enjoy idle games that reward long-term planning and incremental improvement, Firestone is definitely worth your time.\r\n\r\nI came in unsure and confused, but now it’s part of my daily routine. It’s become one of those games I keep coming back to, and after 150+ hours, I’m still not done.\r\n\r\nHighly recommended, just give it a little time to click.",

      "review": "Mechanically, this is an interesting idle/clicker (heavy on the idle) game that can be a decent little comfort game (number go up, yay). It has a decent pavlovian reward scheme and can supply dopamine reliably. There is enough to do when active, and progress is made even when not playing the game. The mechanics and optimization paths are poorly documented, and the wiki is less than useful, but there are some guides (shout out to Aurora's complete guide). The art is mediocre mobile-game / greasy casino slots style poo, the sounds and music are pretty mediocre (and if you mute them all, it sometimes \"forgets\" when milestone notifications happen...), but it's easy to run, doesn't crash, and just works. \r\n\r\nThat said, it has an extremely predatory pay to win (P2W) model and severely punishes free to play (F2P) players. The difference in progress between someone spending zero dollars and someone spending even 10 dollars is *weeks* of progress (which due to the exponential nature of this game, just gets worse and worse over time). The friction is bad enough, and the reward so massive, that you pretty much have to spend 10 dollars minimum (two of the starter bundles are massive, permanent progress boosters). \r\n\r\nIf you have good self-control and can limit your P2W impulses, it's a decent relaxation dopamine drip for around 10 bucks. If you don't have good self-control, and are at all influenced by P2W tactics - this one is *extremely good at roping you in*, avoid it at all costs.",

      "review": "Firestone starts out promising with polished visuals and easy idle mechanics. The early game feels smooth, but once you get deeper in, the cracks start to show.\r\n\r\nProgress can be lost when servers or systems change, and there’s no guarantee that what you’ve built will carry forward. The monetization ramps up sharply, and staying competitive often means spending heavily. Servers also cycle or merge, which resets leaderboards and forces players to start fresh with no lasting benefits. On top of that, while some players are helpful, the overall community can feel unfriendly at times and moderation doesn’t always provide the best support.\r\n\r\nOn the positive side, if you just want a casual idle experience and don’t mind ignoring competition or long-term investment, the early and mid-game can be enjoyable. But for players who care about stability, fairness, and a healthy environment, this game is difficult to recommend.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Firestone looks good at first but becomes a pay-to-win grind with resets, lost progress, and a less-than-welcoming community. Not recommended unless you only want short-term casual play.",
