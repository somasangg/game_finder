      "review": "Good concept and could be fun. I like the idea of having a mobile base.\n\nBut for f sake, the inventory management is abysmal.\n- you start getting a ton of random items right from the start\n- there is no sorting in inventory\n- controls in inventory are confusing\n- there is no pulling from chests when crafting. Like, WHAT? You already have the island thing that is your ship. So every block is connected anyway. There is no excuse to not have crafting from chests in a setup like this unless you just like torturing players with constantly having to takie things out of the chests. And of course chests are not that big! SO you have to have several of them very fast\n\nThe second problem is combat. Maybe it gets better later but at the beginning it felt really bad. I realized quickly that the best way to fight is just to whack the enemy as fast as possible and hope he dies before me. \nThere is blocking, fine, but the enemies attack so fast you rarely have a window to attack after the block, because you will get hit anyway. And the block delay is weirdly high, like it takes 0.5-1s for the block to actually start blocking after the input.\nI hear there is parrying but whatever I did, I couldn't trigger the parry lol. Not sure if the window for it is stupidly small or just at a weird time that it never actually happened for me.\n\nAlso starter weapons break stupidly fast, very annoying at the beginning when you are still figuring out what to do.\n\nAnyway, I'm leaving a recommendation since I'm planning to check the game out after release. But if the problems mentioned above are not alleviated in some way I don't think I'll enjoy it.",

It should be unplayable, but it runs just fine. \nThe premise: its fun, and it makes me want to know more.\nThe ship building (mobile island building): simple, intuitive, fun. You can be very creative, or you can min-max efficiency, or both. The island controls are very fun, its like flying a boat. You need to fuel engines, and turn some on and off to not waste fuel. Scavenging new parts is fun. You can completely  strip the ship down to its skeleton, which gives you a lot to work with.\n-Exploration: This is great, it's a demo, so I don't expect a huge variance at this time. Iterating on what exists and adding more variance without changing the core elements would be suggested.\n-Crafting: It's really great, the amount of blocks, recipes and gear is amazing for a demo. Hampered by poor inventory management\n-Graphics: Good, I like the look, I like that the enemies blend in a bit to their surroundings. It keeps you from running around willy-nilly, and it makes them feel like they belong. Traps are nicely hidden, without being impossible to see.\n-Progression: It's great. I don't mind that it take a long time to find a better weapon. I am happy that I found the bronze daggers recipe late, and completely changed my build at the 10 hour mark. I wasn't punished as weapons share perks. And I changed up my play style, which refreshed the gameplay.\n\n-The AI this gets a honorary mention, as the AI has a lot of potential.\n\nThe meh-\nThe combat: It's fine, it needs work. Bronze Daggers with doom rune, and the game is a piece of cake. Combat is like oblivion, and you spam attacks. Parrying and interrupting attacks doesn't seem to work, so trying to get good (like kingdom come, deliverance) is not really feasible. I'm fine if it stays the way it is, but it's not great. The system to make it better is already in the game, it just needs to be fully realised.\n\nThe bad-\nInventory management is terrible. Play Necesse to see it done well. This has no crafting from chests, no stackable crafting without spam clicking one at a time. no lockable inventory items, no sorting.\n\nArchery: it doesn't get damage bonuses from perks. Head shot to stun perk should be a one and done, not a percentage increase that doesn't really benefit the player as it maxes below 50. A wood bow is useless unless unless you cheese it with barriers.\n\nThe AI- It gets stuck or spawns in walls frequently. AI cant destroy blocks (just barriers, or player placed blocks would be nice) to try and get to you. You can cheese AI easily. AI doesn't work together, which is fine for low level skeletons, but advanced skeletons should change the behaviour of other skeletons, making advanced enemies priority targets.\nYou can kite enemies into the water or off islands and kill them. Kind of cool, as they are skeletons, and dumb. However it seems broken.\n\nOther things are bad, but they are works in progress (eg. changing keybindings is not possible) so I wont mention them.\n\nAbsolutely play this demo, You will have fun.",

      "review": "The game is fun, open world, has a lot of adventure to it, but it has a LOT of issues and the demo felt more like I was given a product to QA not a fully developed game with limited content. The game is either taking advantage of the Hytale cancellation, or just very conveniently released.\nNow onto the issues they need to fix/address.\n\n[h2]Menu Shenanigans:[/h2]\n- Can't shift click back into your hotbar like you can into your inventory FROM the hotbar\n- Pressing 1-9 while looking at items in inventory/storage does not swap places or assign them to your hotbar\n- Crafting Recipes/Benches don't take materials from nearby chests (extremely popular in survival RPGs like Nightingale)\n- No shift clicking recipes/adjustable slider to make multiple crafts, had to manually click Roasted Beef 80 times\n\n[h2]Combat/Movement Shenanigans:[/h2]\n- Sprint speed is almost imperceptibly faster. Needs to be noticeably faster\n- Combat feels too much like a slap fight. You can't mitigate damage and are forced to rely on armor + healing items (details below on what I mean)\n- Parry mechanic is awful and contributes to ^ because you must parry with exact timing [b]AND IT'S DELAYED!!![/b] Cannot instant parry the way you can in BOTW, and you cannot let it linger either. The animation leading up to the actual parry leaves you vulnerable to getting hit.\n- Skeleton attack speed is too fast, can't parry light hits on reaction since the parry is so delayed, contributing to ^ and making the attrition-feeling combat feel like an inevitable chore, not a skillful challenge.\n- Healing sucks and doesn't scale with max health. Going through each skeleton battle ends with you eating 5 steaks and waiting 30 seconds for each one to finish, making each fight a chore after the fact because you KNOW you're going to get hit a lot, and you KNOW you're going to have to spend 4 minutes after every scuffle to heal back to full. \n- Let us stack healing effects from foods or potions!\n- Arrow velocity is too slow and not realistic. A fletched arrow flies slower than an IRL rock from a slingshot\n- Cannot retrieve arrows shot into terrain in ANY capacity\n- Weapon durability is hot garbage. They deplete way too fast.\n- Crouching does not always prevent falling off a ledge\n- Can't crouch midair/maintain crouching. Going down stairs messes with this.\n- Holding jump keeps jumping (good thing) but stops if you, at any point in time, bump your head (bad)\n\n[h2]Cooking/Recipe Shenanigans:[/h2]\n- Limited cooking recipes, can't just grill mushrooms or make berry jam even though they are clearly safe to eat\n- Can't collect rainwater in barrels for crops \n- Crops don't automatically get watered when it's raining\n- No tooltips on what is wrong with your crops (altitude or soil)\n- No buckets to collect ground water either\n- No way to tell if you know a recipe or not, have to remember or manually check each one when you come across them\n\n[h2]Building Shenanigans:[/h2]\n- The half slabs, 3/4 slabs, and 1/4 slabs all have weird placement logic. Placing them feels less consistent and intuitive than in Minecraft.\n- Tiny window of opportunity for placing blocks under you if you're jumping in place. Wish you could hold RMB and hold spacebar and it would just place blocks as soon as possible.\n- Annoying that ALL blocks even the ones you craft revert back to stones/planks when you break them, custom or not. Because of this you cannot harvest pretty blocks from dungeons, and redoing builds or changing your ship is an absolute CHORE. This game actively deincentivizes me to build anything personal because of how much of a headache it will be.\n- Crafted building blocks cannot be changed from one form to another. Allow me to change my mind from chiseled, to blocky, to smooth variants back and forth!\n- No ladders or rope ladders to climb. I don't want to jump 50 feet onto an island and take fall damage every time\n\n[h2]Settings/Accessibility/Miscellaneous Shenanigans:[/h2]\n- Not being able to rebind any keys\n- No toggle sprint or toggle crouch in settings\n- The \"I\" button on Keyboard opens and closes inventory, but not in storages. Every time you open a dresser or chest you have to press ESC to exit the inventory\n- No quick stack option or ability to sort to nearby chests\n- Weird FPS drops in certain locations, or while holding certain items\n- Islands are tiny, there's no incentive to make a \"home base\" anywhere and lay down roots. You are doomed to be a murder hobo forever\n\n[h3]Final thoughts[/h3]\nGame has a great foundation and seems like it would be really fun, but there's so much missing polish. Needs a LOT of changes and fixes before I would consider buying it.",

I love being able to set the ship to sail and be able to leave the cockpit without it stopping. Controlling the ship took some getting used to but is very well designed.\n\nThere are a few QOL changes I would love to see.\n\n• Inventory/chest sorting\n\n• Have a hot key that deposits items into chests that are already in a chest. Similar to Palworld where say you have wood, stone, sticks, and ammunition in a chest. Open the chest and hit a hotkey, if you have any of those 4 it will move what you have into the chest. Makes organizing insanely faster and more satisfying.\n\n• Make it so everything in the chests on your ship can be accessed via crafting without needing to be in your inventory (when you go outside the radius of your ship this becomes inaccessible)\n\n• Crafting multiples of the same thing instead of one at a time via holding down CTRL, Shift, alt, etc.",

Not hard to follow along at all and get into the mode of learning what you need to do to craft, survive, and explore. It's good, but I can see where it could be better and expect that it will be soon™.\n\nWhat I don't care for so far is....\n\n1a.Combat as many have stated so far is awkward. Enemies definitely have way too rapid a hit speed versus player's much slower reaction time as limited by certain game animations or slight delays. \n\nb. Enemies can often be cheesed by making them glitch into weird or stuck positions; I've also seen then in weird aerial loops or blip from one spot to the other several times (mostly happened when hunting/fighting boar).\n\n2. I would like to hit a button to start cooking and make the amount of meals I want based on the amount of ingredients I input + amount of fuel I inserted. I don't like having to re-click after every 1 meal is done cooking - just keep making it automatically until the fuel timer runs out or something.\n\n3. Oh, now I remember - using the \"take all\" prompt when looting automatically fills up the hot bar instead of dumping into the main personal inventory, which is not ideal. I really hope that is changed.\n\nI've only played solo so far so will probably update with more opinions after I play multiplayer.",

      "review": "Everwind's Demo shows a lot of promise in different areas.\n\nThe premise seems really solid. Voxel sandbox RPG where you fly around on an airship that you constantly are building and expanding to your liking to find more loot, upgrades for yourself, resources, what have you. \nThe QOL of the Compass is also something I feel is very fitting for the game and something I enjoyed greatly. Being able to teleport to the ship at any moment, especially in Multiplayer, really saves hassle and time to leave places. I like the spyglass as well to see islands you've already explored and which ones are worth checking out or not in the first place.\n\nThere are things that very obviously need work, like the Combat feeling fairly one-dimensional and almost like Oblivion / Skyrim, but a bit lacking. The foundation of regular swings, charged swing to break guards, and guarding for Melee combat would be fine if it were not for the speed at which enemies swing or how slow they react to your tactics. It seems at the moment the best solution is to just swing wildly with your stamina to kill anything before it can meaningfully damaage you.\nMagic and Ranged are similarly simple, since it's mostly a point and click ranged projectile from what I could tell of what I messed around with.\n\nBugs are to be expected, especially for a demo, and extra so for a demo of a voxel-based sandbox with moving structures that have collision. But they were definitely all around the place. I'm sure a lot of them will be hammered out, especially since I was playing in Multiiplayer with 3 other friends. \n\nI think a major thing for me right now is the feel of interacting with certain systems. To name a few:\n-Inventory Management and Usage\n-Not being able to use a crafting station or chest if a friend is already doing so, this requires you to wait or make multiple if you want to get around the inconvenience of this\n-The sea level is persistant through blocks, meaning that if you dig down on the surface of an island (say, to look for ore for Copper) you'll hit water. You can't dive, as the game sends you straight to the top of water, and it just generally feels confusing why its persistent everywhere through blocks. \n\nWith time I'm sure there will be clarity, but for now on the first thing I'd like to suggest just a few small things that might make inventory stuff feel nicer:\n- Pressing 1-0 on your keyboard while mousing over an item in your inventory places it in that hotbar slot. This is common in a lot of games like this, and feels really good for fast management of getting things where you can immediately use them.\n- Shift Clicking things in your hotbar into the upper inventory, and vice versa. \n- A way to craft an item multiple times instead of clicking the craft button each time. A selectable amount (min-max, number to craft in general) would be nice.",

      "review": "At its core it's a Minecraft clone that goes in its own direction. The main premise is that the world itself is a series of islands, some at sea level and others floating in the sky, which the player can explore using a flyable ship they can build, discovering dungeons to delve into as well as gathering much needed resources such as copper ore found in veins scattered about the various islands. \n\nThe ship mechanic I found fantastic as the player is able, block by block, to construct their very own ship to their personal design, limited only by the upgradeable engines they've crafted which determine how large and heavy the ship can be. Currently the ships contain a special block called 'Ancient Metal' which I couldn't figure out how to destroy, but these blocks basically act as the skeleton of the ship allowing you to construct the body. \n\nIf you're going to try this game out for yourself, do not forget to use your compass! You can use it to instantly teleport back to your ship and should you ever lose said ship, the compass will direct you to its location. Also, pick up sticks and stones lying around to craft a stone axe then chop down plenty of trees, you can use the logs as fuel for the ships engines. \n\nMy only two major qualms with the game as it is right now is combat and building. Placing blocks is a little clunky and doesn't feel smooth, specially compared to other similar titles such as Enshrouded. I found myself having to move around a lot more and get into a specific position at times to place blocks, something that I rarely have to do in other sandbox titles. \n\nFinally the combat is very basic and somewhat arcadeish. I think it would be much better to improve the combat animations via choreographed attacks and maybe a timed blocking system wherein you need to block at a specific moment in order to avoid damage. Currently the best combat method is to spam click to kill something and this isn't really fun compared to what I know the developers could cook up.\n\nUltimately in two hours I managed to upgrade the engines enough to reach the main island featured in the demo and kill the skeleton boss, after which there wasn't  really anything else to do. What was available was incredibly fun and I can't wait for the full release, Minecraft and dungeon delving... What isn't to love?",

(it's just a detail, but i can't understand why they didn't think of it earlier in the developpement)\n\nNow, the fights. It's GOOD, ennemies IA is good and random enough to make you hardly decide between attack, block or dodge. You can light attack, heavy attack, block or stun, which is already really varried and satisfying but by making the ennemies dangerous, you've got to think all this through and not just rush in the melee, because i can promise you it won't work. Dungeons are cool to explore and done randomly enough to surprise you each time.\n\nThe building. There's a good variety of blocks and they are nicely detailled, but i found them quite hard to gather (i didn't really look a lot into it).\n\nThen you explore a bit, build your flycraft and notice that there isn't any objective at all, which is... predictable for a demo, but still a bit disappointing.",

The only few aspects that I think are a little negative is for example fighting, because if you spam your mouse and then stop, there are one or two hits that are still dealt after releasing the mouse button. Also, crafting stacks would be great instead of having to click each item one by one.\nThe performance overall is great. Multiplayer is a little laggy, but keep in mind it's a DEMO. Overall, this game has huge potential, and the small flaws I mentioned should be easy to fix — and as I said, it's a DEMO, not even Early Access.",

Also a quest log with locations.\n\nOnce you've found a recipe the chances of finding the same one should lessen. I have a recipe for a steel sword and just found my first iron deposit. I dont have any stone or copper recipes yet though so the loot tables need adjusted.\n\nIn my first world I hopped islands a lot and never really found much worthwhile. 2nd was better. 3rd has been best but Ive only fought 8 different skeletons and a rats. No clue about this skeleton king. No other people. Some traders would be nice. Goblins are mentioned in the compendium. Never seen them.\n\nId make the leveling by skill. Mining skill, etc. The point system as is seems slow. More like 7 Days would be ideal.\n\nI started building a flying castle in my 1st world. 2nd and 3rd I stuck with ships. Designing from the ground up seems difficult with the ancient metal frame because you can't break it. As far as I am anyway. What if I want a castle, dragon, turtle? Upgrading its should be block dependent not area. My dragon air ship will need large wings that stick out to the sides a ways. Square castle is doable though.\n\nHow about a block grinder? That way I can take my chest of blocks Ive found and turn them into raw material. Bigger stacks in chests please. I have a 1000 stone in one chest just in case I need it because Im an organizer hoarder.\n\nOtherwise this demo has been a blast and I highly anticipate its full release. Sky diving and warping back has become a thing to do when bored lol",

      "review": "First this is Minecraft, if it adopted mods into the vanilla game (Valkyrie sky, better combat, more creatures just to name a few) which is a good thing. As someone who have played Minecraft (far to much of it) this bring me back to a sense of home and peace. \n\nNow to the review.\nWhat feedback do you have? \nYou could play this damn thing on a potato, graphics wont look nice, but who gives a damn when you are flying around in a ship, and plundering the islands for it booties.\n\nHostile enemies feel like a threat, but also they tend to get stuck a bit, so a bit of path finding work is needed. Also if they can move like the player can, allow them to jump to the player, or sprint at them.\n\nDurability on the tools feel a bit low, making repair kits seem a bit enforced. raising the durability on the tools might be a good idea.\n\nDiving needs to be added, I want to swim with the fishes.\n\nWater needs to be changed as digging at the water level islands, you cant dig very far which kind of hurts the idea of sandbox, to do what you want. I want to dig to the void, not be stopped by water.\n\nNeed a bit more life, like civilization, new enemies, new creatures, now location to explore. I don't expect it to be done in a day, or even a year, but add those would be great.\n\nThe breaking of tools sound, make that only happen once, not every time you swing a broken tool. \n\nAdd wiring system. What i mean is like Redstone from minecraft, or Wires cables from Terreria. Allow the players to engineer with pistons, with generators to turn them on or off with a single click, or create their own giant contraptions. \n\nThe world feels a bit empty, and no i do not mean missing villagers that i can... 'Trade' for their money in their pockets, What i mean is the Skies just feel empty. We live on a ship, with no threat in sight, nothing to stare at but an empty sky... Also Fix that skybox. That large planet feels just out of place, like it Too close.\n\nThe ship core, just allow us to move it around or change how it claims blocks for the ship. I know it a demo, but I don't want to try and hide the core in the middle of the ship, i want it in the back, but i also do not want to lose half of my build space either because it in the back.\n\nAlso if we accidentally hit a block, don't take tool durability away.\n\nHow to support the game?\n\nShort term, build the community, become the next big thing. Keep it affordable, Keep it reasonable. Make it fun.\n\nLong term, Financial independent from all the big names. So how to achieve that? don't lock core content behind dlc (like new enemies, new items, new areas, new what ever) but instead, cosmetic only, like a different skin for the swords, armor, axes, and so on. no special properties, no special features, just simple and straight of a cool looking skin. vanilla items look cool, and each is quite special in their own right. Or public server hosting.\n\nAllow the community to Mod the hell out of it. Don't pull the rug under modders, but do limit what is allowed on a public stage, and what is allowed on a private stage. (looking at you Skyrim). Modders are the Key to a sandbox game success, but if the game is not baked well enough, or not tended to like a fine garden, they will stop coming. Take again, Minecraft Java Edition. That game would have failed twice now, if it was not for Modders not just keeping that game alive, but thriving. (till someone try to change the Eula because they want to enforce their views on people) So make it easy for modders to get access to the game, not stupid easy, but easy enough. \n\nYou have, without a dought, the next Minecraft. What you do with it from here, will make it a big name, or crumble to dust. Heed the warning of the community, and all the games that had such great potential who are long been buried, Greed is the enemy of any game, ambitions can be a downfall. It's your game, you made it, but its the player's story. Let them play how they want, let them intact with everything on their term. Let their imagination run wild and free. \n\nFinal Grade of this game.\nCurrently overall- 7.5/10\nIf the potential of the game is notice. Fuck hand me that pickax and tnt, I am getting those ores/10.\n\nEnemies - 7/10, they need work, but are fun to fight when they are not stuck.\nif fixed and new are added - 9/10 Reason for 9 is because enemies fights are hard to get right, so a bit hesitant on that, but hey, if there a Flint lock at all, well the High Sky Seas is a calling, and Land Lobbers are ripe for a plundering.\n\nFreedom - 8/10, Still a bit missing from player freedom, but it's there.\nIf player have more freedom - Complex machine, auto harvesting, chest sorting, and auto fuel/smelting. Ya we are doing just fine/10",

It would be cool if your ship and what you crashed into broke blocks. It would be kinda fun if when your higher lvl with stronger blocks on your ship just crash your ship part of the way into the island. Then you could introduce npc ships with cannons. 2 making npcs be able to brake blocks I killed the king in the first big island I landed on in like 1 hour just using blocks to stop there movement. 3. Not a real suggestion because I know how hard this would be to implement and not break your whole game. Gravity without the ballons on you dont fall, and when you break all the things holding up a tower it just floats there.

Minecraft is lighter and easier to play in general, and while it lacks some features that this game offers, with mods it actually feels better.\n\nAfter three hours of playing, my inventory and chests are already a mess, and I don’t really know which items are useful.

      "review": "Good concept and could be fun. I like the idea of having a mobile base.\n\nBut for f sake, the inventory management is abysmal.\n- you start getting a ton of random items right from the start\n- there is no sorting in inventory\n- controls in inventory are confusing\n- there is no pulling from chests when crafting. Like, WHAT? You already have the island thing that is your ship. So every block is connected anyway. There is no excuse to not have crafting from chests in a setup like this unless you just like torturing players with constantly having to takie things out of the chests. And of course chests are not that big! SO you have to have several of them very fast\n\nThe second problem is combat. Maybe it gets better later but at the beginning it felt really bad. I realized quickly that the best way to fight is just to whack the enemy as fast as possible and hope he dies before me. \nThere is blocking, fine, but the enemies attack so fast you rarely have a window to attack after the block, because you will get hit anyway. And the block delay is weirdly high, like it takes 0.5-1s for the block to actually start blocking after the input.\nI hear there is parrying but whatever I did, I couldn't trigger the parry lol. Not sure if the window for it is stupidly small or just at a weird time that it never actually happened for me.\n\nAlso starter weapons break stupidly fast, very annoying at the beginning when you are still figuring out what to do.\n\nAnyway, I'm leaving a recommendation since I'm planning to check the game out after release. But if the problems mentioned above are not alleviated in some way I don't think I'll enjoy it.",

      "review": "I've played 14.7 hours, and defeated the Skeleton King.\n\nPros- \nWorks fine on my ancient PC: running an A8 processor and a R9 380 graphics card. It should be unplayable, but it runs just fine. \nThe premise: its fun, and it makes me want to know more.\nThe ship building (mobile island building): simple, intuitive, fun. You can be very creative, or you can min-max efficiency, or both. The island controls are very fun, its like flying a boat. You need to fuel engines, and turn some on and off to not waste fuel. Scavenging new parts is fun. You can completely  strip the ship down to its skeleton, which gives you a lot to work with.\n-Exploration: This is great, it's a demo, so I don't expect a huge variance at this time. Iterating on what exists and adding more variance without changing the core elements would be suggested.\n-Crafting: It's really great, the amount of blocks, recipes and gear is amazing for a demo. Hampered by poor inventory management\n-Graphics: Good, I like the look, I like that the enemies blend in a bit to their surroundings. It keeps you from running around willy-nilly, and it makes them feel like they belong. Traps are nicely hidden, without being impossible to see.\n-Progression: It's great. I don't mind that it take a long time to find a better weapon. I am happy that I found the bronze daggers recipe late, and completely changed my build at the 10 hour mark. I wasn't punished as weapons share perks. And I changed up my play style, which refreshed the gameplay.\n\n-The AI this gets a honorary mention, as the AI has a lot of potential.\n\nThe meh-\nThe combat: It's fine, it needs work. Bronze Daggers with doom rune, and the game is a piece of cake. Combat is like oblivion, and you spam attacks. Parrying and interrupting attacks doesn't seem to work, so trying to get good (like kingdom come, deliverance) is not really feasible. I'm fine if it stays the way it is, but it's not great. The system to make it better is already in the game, it just needs to be fully realised.\n\nThe bad-\nInventory management is terrible. Play Necesse to see it done well. This has no crafting from chests, no stackable crafting without spam clicking one at a time. no lockable inventory items, no sorting.\n\nArchery: it doesn't get damage bonuses from perks. Head shot to stun perk should be a one and done, not a percentage increase that doesn't really benefit the player as it maxes below 50. A wood bow is useless unless unless you cheese it with barriers.\n\nThe AI- It gets stuck or spawns in walls frequently. AI cant destroy blocks (just barriers, or player placed blocks would be nice) to try and get to you. You can cheese AI easily. AI doesn't work together, which is fine for low level skeletons, but advanced skeletons should change the behaviour of other skeletons, making advanced enemies priority targets.\nYou can kite enemies into the water or off islands and kill them. Kind of cool, as they are skeletons, and dumb. However it seems broken.\n\nOther things are bad, but they are works in progress (eg. changing keybindings is not possible) so I wont mention them.\n\nAbsolutely play this demo, You will have fun.",

The game is either taking advantage of the Hytale cancellation, or just very conveniently released.\nNow onto the issues they need to fix/address.\n\n[h2]Menu Shenanigans:[/h2]\n- Can't shift click back into your hotbar like you can into your inventory FROM the hotbar\n- Pressing 1-9 while looking at items in inventory/storage does not swap places or assign them to your hotbar\n- Crafting Recipes/Benches don't take materials from nearby chests (extremely popular in survival RPGs like Nightingale)\n- No shift clicking recipes/adjustable slider to make multiple crafts, had to manually click Roasted Beef 80 times\n\n[h2]Combat/Movement Shenanigans:[/h2]\n- Sprint speed is almost imperceptibly faster. Needs to be noticeably faster\n- Combat feels too much like a slap fight. You can't mitigate damage and are forced to rely on armor + healing items (details below on what I mean)\n- Parry mechanic is awful and contributes to ^ because you must parry with exact timing [b]AND IT'S DELAYED!!![/b] Cannot instant parry the way you can in BOTW, and you cannot let it linger either. The animation leading up to the actual parry leaves you vulnerable to getting hit.\n- Skeleton attack speed is too fast, can't parry light hits on reaction since the parry is so delayed, contributing to ^ and making the attrition-feeling combat feel like an inevitable chore, not a skillful challenge.\n- Healing sucks and doesn't scale with max health. Going through each skeleton battle ends with you eating 5 steaks and waiting 30 seconds for each one to finish, making each fight a chore after the fact because you KNOW you're going to get hit a lot, and you KNOW you're going to have to spend 4 minutes after every scuffle to heal back to full. \n- Let us stack healing effects from foods or potions!\n- Arrow velocity is too slow and not realistic. A fletched arrow flies slower than an IRL rock from a slingshot\n- Cannot retrieve arrows shot into terrain in ANY capacity\n- Weapon durability is hot garbage. They deplete way too fast.\n- Crouching does not always prevent falling off a ledge\n- Can't crouch midair/maintain crouching. Going down stairs messes with this.\n- Holding jump keeps jumping (good thing) but stops if you, at any point in time, bump your head (bad)\n\n[h2]Cooking/Recipe Shenanigans:[/h2]\n- Limited cooking recipes, can't just grill mushrooms or make berry jam even though they are clearly safe to eat\n- Can't collect rainwater in barrels for crops \n- Crops don't automatically get watered when it's raining\n- No tooltips on what is wrong with your crops (altitude or soil)\n- No buckets to collect ground water either\n- No way to tell if you know a recipe or not, have to remember or manually check each one when you come across them\n\n[h2]Building Shenanigans:[/h2]\n- The half slabs, 3/4 slabs, and 1/4 slabs all have weird placement logic. Placing them feels less consistent and intuitive than in Minecraft.\n- Tiny window of opportunity for placing blocks under you if you're jumping in place. Wish you could hold RMB and hold spacebar and it would just place blocks as soon as possible.\n- Annoying that ALL blocks even the ones you craft revert back to stones/planks when you break them, custom or not. Because of this you cannot harvest pretty blocks from dungeons, and redoing builds or changing your ship is an absolute CHORE. This game actively deincentivizes me to build anything personal because of how much of a headache it will be.\n- Crafted building blocks cannot be changed from one form to another. Allow me to change my mind from chiseled, to blocky, to smooth variants back and forth!\n- No ladders or rope ladders to climb. I don't want to jump 50 feet onto an island and take fall damage every time\n\n[h2]Settings/Accessibility/Miscellaneous Shenanigans:[/h2]\n- Not being able to rebind any keys\n- No toggle sprint or toggle crouch in settings\n- The \"I\" button on Keyboard opens and closes inventory, but not in storages. Every time you open a dresser or chest you have to press ESC to exit the inventory\n- No quick stack option or ability to sort to nearby chests\n- Weird FPS drops in certain locations, or while holding certain items\n- Islands are tiny, there's no incentive to make a \"home base\" anywhere and lay down roots. You are doomed to be a murder hobo forever\n\n[h3]Final thoughts[/h3]\nGame has a great foundation and seems like it would be really fun, but there's so much missing polish. Needs a LOT of changes and fixes before I would consider buying it.",

I love being able to set the ship to sail and be able to leave the cockpit without it stopping. Controlling the ship took some getting used to but is very well designed.\n\nThere are a few QOL changes I would love to see.\n\n• Inventory/chest sorting\n\n• Have a hot key that deposits items into chests that are already in a chest. Similar to Palworld where say you have wood, stone, sticks, and ammunition in a chest. Open the chest and hit a hotkey, if you have any of those 4 it will move what you have into the chest. Makes organizing insanely faster and more satisfying.\n\n• Make it so everything in the chests on your ship can be accessed via crafting without needing to be in your inventory (when you go outside the radius of your ship this becomes inaccessible)\n\n• Crafting multiples of the same thing instead of one at a time via holding down CTRL, Shift, alt, etc.",

Not hard to follow along at all and get into the mode of learning what you need to do to craft, survive, and explore. It's good, but I can see where it could be better and expect that it will be soon™.\n\nWhat I don't care for so far is....\n\n1a.Combat as many have stated so far is awkward. Enemies definitely have way too rapid a hit speed versus player's much slower reaction time as limited by certain game animations or slight delays. \n\nb. Enemies can often be cheesed by making them glitch into weird or stuck positions; I've also seen then in weird aerial loops or blip from one spot to the other several times (mostly happened when hunting/fighting boar).\n\n2. I would like to hit a button to start cooking and make the amount of meals I want based on the amount of ingredients I input + amount of fuel I inserted. I don't like having to re-click after every 1 meal is done cooking - just keep making it automatically until the fuel timer runs out or something.\n\n3. Oh, now I remember - using the \"take all\" prompt when looting automatically fills up the hot bar instead of dumping into the main personal inventory, which is not ideal. I really hope that is changed.\n\nI've only played solo so far so will probably update with more opinions after I play multiplayer.",

Voxel sandbox RPG where you fly around on an airship that you constantly are building and expanding to your liking to find more loot, upgrades for yourself, resources, what have you. \nThe QOL of the Compass is also something I feel is very fitting for the game and something I enjoyed greatly. Being able to teleport to the ship at any moment, especially in Multiplayer, really saves hassle and time to leave places. I like the spyglass as well to see islands you've already explored and which ones are worth checking out or not in the first place.\n\nThere are things that very obviously need work, like the Combat feeling fairly one-dimensional and almost like Oblivion / Skyrim, but a bit lacking. The foundation of regular swings, charged swing to break guards, and guarding for Melee combat would be fine if it were not for the speed at which enemies swing or how slow they react to your tactics. It seems at the moment the best solution is to just swing wildly with your stamina to kill anything before it can meaningfully damaage you.\nMagic and Ranged are similarly simple, since it's mostly a point and click ranged projectile from what I could tell of what I messed around with.\n\nBugs are to be expected, especially for a demo, and extra so for a demo of a voxel-based sandbox with moving structures that have collision. But they were definitely all around the place. I'm sure a lot of them will be hammered out, especially since I was playing in Multiiplayer with 3 other friends. \n\nI think a major thing for me right now is the feel of interacting with certain systems. To name a few:\n-Inventory Management and Usage\n-Not being able to use a crafting station or chest if a friend is already doing so, this requires you to wait or make multiple if you want to get around the inconvenience of this\n-The sea level is persistant through blocks, meaning that if you dig down on the surface of an island (say, to look for ore for Copper) you'll hit water. You can't dive, as the game sends you straight to the top of water, and it just generally feels confusing why its persistent everywhere through blocks. \n\nWith time I'm sure there will be clarity, but for now on the first thing I'd like to suggest just a few small things that might make inventory stuff feel nicer:\n- Pressing 1-0 on your keyboard while mousing over an item in your inventory places it in that hotbar slot. This is common in a lot of games like this, and feels really good for fast management of getting things where you can immediately use them.\n- Shift Clicking things in your hotbar into the upper inventory, and vice versa. \n- A way to craft an item multiple times instead of clicking the craft button each time. A selectable amount (min-max, number to craft in general) would be nice.",

The main premise is that the world itself is a series of islands, some at sea level and others floating in the sky, which the player can explore using a flyable ship they can build, discovering dungeons to delve into as well as gathering much needed resources such as copper ore found in veins scattered about the various islands. \n\nThe ship mechanic I found fantastic as the player is able, block by block, to construct their very own ship to their personal design, limited only by the upgradeable engines they've crafted which determine how large and heavy the ship can be. Currently the ships contain a special block called 'Ancient Metal' which I couldn't figure out how to destroy, but these blocks basically act as the skeleton of the ship allowing you to construct the body. \n\nIf you're going to try this game out for yourself, do not forget to use your compass! You can use it to instantly teleport back to your ship and should you ever lose said ship, the compass will direct you to its location. Also, pick up sticks and stones lying around to craft a stone axe then chop down plenty of trees, you can use the logs as fuel for the ships engines. \n\nMy only two major qualms with the game as it is right now is combat and building. Placing blocks is a little clunky and doesn't feel smooth, specially compared to other similar titles such as Enshrouded. I found myself having to move around a lot more and get into a specific position at times to place blocks, something that I rarely have to do in other sandbox titles. \n\nFinally the combat is very basic and somewhat arcadeish. I think it would be much better to improve the combat animations via choreographed attacks and maybe a timed blocking system wherein you need to block at a specific moment in order to avoid damage. Currently the best combat method is to spam click to kill something and this isn't really fun compared to what I know the developers could cook up.\n\nUltimately in two hours I managed to upgrade the engines enough to reach the main island featured in the demo and kill the skeleton boss, after which there wasn't  really anything else to do. What was available was incredibly fun and I can't wait for the full release, Minecraft and dungeon delving... What isn't to love?",

Currently, I think my biggest issues with the demo were:\n- no drive for exploration: There's no hunger and nothing I felt I needed or could find, so I quickly felt purposeless. \n- airships feel arbitrary: I don't know if the number of engines, baloons or generators matters. Seems weird, finding a basically finished airship, and only upgrading it through the upgrade terminal.\n- combat is baaad... I can't pinpoint this precisely, but I think the fact that enemies don't really telegraph their attacks, just rush you and keep swinging, the combat devolves into a wet noodle slap fight with zero tactics or skill involved.",

      "review": "Just kinda boring right now in the demo. Not sure why I would play this over something like modded Minecraft. I just find the simple core principal of the game boring with the islands. All the islands seem small, way to small. I would recommend much larger islands that the player would want to spend time on, such for larger cave systems, dungeons, and dangers with rewards. Right now I take several minutes getting to an island, and then just do nothing on it really and leave unless it has a small dungeon on it, I clear that and take off and repeat.\n\nBracket advice for changes in quick suggestions:\n1. When power attacking enemies, make them stumble or something. Hitting enemies felt way to much like a battle of trading blows, a dodge would be nice.\n2. Much larger islands with more on them. This would help with the issue of flying the ship being boring by making it happen less, and then you can make flying the ship more dangerous so when the play does have to fly, a sense of danger looms along with rewards of a new land.\n3. QoL like inventory sort.\n4. More combat mechanics like shield bashes, dodges, and offhand weapons.\n5. Condense workstations, just too many.\n\n\nRight now, the game feels very basic, and like I played it 1000 times. It is missing a lot, time will tell what happens with the full release.\n\nEdit:\nI understand the game is a demo, that isn't a reason to not be honest and provide criticism to core gameplay aspects like the islands. The animations are great, game looks nice, and in no way do I think this is some low quality garbage, if I did, I wouldn't even bother with a review.",

Only caveat there would be that the default audio makes them WAY too loud.\n\nBuilding and crafting feels just how you would expect from a voxel game and was honestly a  lot of fun! More block varieties in the initial islands would definitely go a long way!\n\nNow for the negative. SORRY DEVS!\n\nCombat feels basic and rushed. There is really no mechanics to it whatsoever and armor doesn't actually seem to have that much of an affect when it comes to mitigating enemy attacks. \n\nUnfortunately this game falls into the same pit that similar ones before it could not get out of. The game very quickly gets repetitive and stale. Fly your airship to an island, If you're lucky find something useful, fly to another, rinse and repeat. The game has no direction. This is the most basic of basic elements of game design! The WHY! Adding some kind of story to this game would immediately elevate it so PLEASE work on this! \n\nI understand that this is a demo version and is unfinished. HOWEVER a demo is meant to showcase most of the core features and get the player base excited for the full or early access release. I still have a TON of hope for this game and the additional character classes so i really hope the devs decide to take these reviews and learn from them. Don't get discouraged, this is a great starting point but it was not ready for a demo release and it just feels rushed.\n\nOverall I would give this a 5/10.

There is no \"combat\" its pretty much a stat check for each mob. If devs slowed down the combat and implemented the stamina system more for both the player and mobs I think it would be some-what enjoyable. There also seemed to be some stagger mechanic or stun ig but its pretty negligible.\n\n   Inventory was also pretty bad. Very cluttered with no auto sort and just a bunch of items.\n\n   Durability is odd because your weapon would lose the amount of damage it did rather than break or not being able to use it. Some people might like that but I would rather the weapon just be unusable, seems pointless to have it do less damage and gives a false representation of the weapon.\n\n  Something I really disliked was a mob dropping a piece of armor that was better than my current but being unable to equip it because I hadn't unlocked \"advanced armor\" in the skill tree. Locking equipment behind a skill tree in an exploration/sandbox game really does not make sense.\n\nTLDR -  Another great potential game that will be ruined by early access coming in half baked and losing all hype.

      "review": "Currently, what sets Everwind apart from any other block game? The answer should be the game's [i]Unique Selling Point[/i], the airship gameplay and exploration. However, at least in the demo, all features feel seriously underbaked and underwhelming. I would not be surprised if Minecraft mods have achieved a similar level of gameplay despite the game's engine barely supporting such functionality.\n\nExploration is at least better than in a few other action-adventurey-RPGish games I have played. I was pleasantly surprised to find improved gear, or even weapons and armor that are above what I can make myself from various chests. It is nice to see that the game is not above rewarding the player for exploration. In addition, the verticality in dungeons is a very pleasant addition.\n\nHowever, that is where the praise ends for now. Below are a myriad of smaller and larger issues that cropped up during the demo gameplay.\n\n[h3]Combat issues:[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]Combat is functional, but too simplistic. You have a basic attack, a heavy attack and a block. Heavy attacks are only useful as openers or if the enemy has a lot of armor. Blocking... might work? Not sure. Beyond that you just swing until the enemy stops moving. Most of them don't have the DPS to kill you before you kill them, anyway.\n[*]Different weapons do not feel particularly different at all. That said, I only saw a couple of different kinds of weapons, but they were largely similar. Why does nobody try to copy Vermintide's homework?\n[*]Enemies are only threatening in large numbers, or only if you have for some reason run out of food to heal yourself with. Most enemies, including the Skeleton King are easily defeated by standing on top of something they cannot reach.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Survival issues:[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]Survival effectively does not exist. You do not have needs other than keeping your health above 0. You can only lose health through falling from extreme heights, being hit by traps or through combat.\n[*]Food is plentiful and its only purpose is to serve as glorified healing potions.\n[*]Alchemy is pointless and not particularly fun. You have to match three ingredients with matching effects to make a basic potion that is likely not even particularly useful. You cannot see more than one out of three possible effects in the demo.\n[*]Repairing items is laughably easy. Copper is the most abundant metal in the game, and all you need are a few pieces of ore to to turn into ingots, and some planks to make a repair kit that fixes anything to maximum durability.\n[*]The game is severely hindered by everything being gated behind recipes you find randomly. Up to and including smelting ingots, and making anything out of said ingots. You can easily get into a situation where you find recipes for bronze or iron equipment, but can't smelt the ingots to make said items.\n[*]Recipes are not shared. In multiplayer means one player may be able to smelt ingots, but another might have a recipe for the tools or weapons that utilize those ingots. Given random generation of recipes, you may wind up with heaps of duplicates but not the ones you need.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Airship issues:[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]The airship building is completely arbitrary. Right now the most effective way to build your flying boat is to just make a one-dimensional flying saucer. Form and function are completely divorced from one another.\n[*]Airship components are arbitrary. The balloons effectively do nothing beyond add +250 max height, limited by the level of your ship's core. You do not have to balance the lift evenly around your boat. Even without any balloons, your boat can still hover up to 15 blocks (technically 7, because sea level is 7 blocks). \n[*]I'm not sure if the generators do anything at all beyond just toggling your balloons and rotors on for as long as there is power. Do you need more than one? Who knows.\n[*]Furthermore, the motors that add speed to your boat can be placed anywhere, even in places where their air currents should be completely blocked. In addition, given that in the demo the max speed is 13.5 blocks, you need two propellers to get to 13 max speed. The third motor adds only a .5 block speed increase before limited by the hard cap.\n[*]Mass does not exist. Your airship can carry as much stuff on it as you can fit in boxes and whatnot. You do not need to build a base anywhere, because your flying saucer does and carries everything.\n[*]Your airship seemingly can not take damage, making using different blocks entirely cosmetic. The most effective way to make your airboat, therefore, is to make a flat saucer with the ballons and motors stacked next to one another in some corner, fed by a single generator.\n[*]If the airboat cannot take damage, then there likely are no flying enemies either that could threaten you and your boat, making using harder blocks pointless and the flying itself uneventful and boring.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Technical issues:[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]The game freezes consistently after a few hours of gameplay.\n[*]Turning up the chunk loading setting causes crippling chugging.\n[*]The game lags considerably when an island is generated.\n[*]Virtually no quality of life features. Cannot easily stack stuff in boxes, have to do everything manually and one by one. Same for crafting, no way to craft large amounts of items at once.\n[*]No FOV settings?\n[*]No rebindable keys in demo?\n[/list]\n\nHopefully the full game will provide a far better air boat captain/crew fantasy than what the demo showcased. The systems need more depth and design. The airship should be the most developed feature and the beating heart and soul of the game. Yet, as it stands right now, it seems little more than a cute gimmick for the game to set itself apart from any other block game.",

      "review": "Without a road map, I can't say for certain that the game is going in the right direction. It has HUGE promise considering the mechanics and little details that already exist so far for this demo.\n\nI'm certain the ships being provided from the start is for the demo ONLY to give players a quick cut to the airship gameplay, however if they're handed out like this in the final product, the main selling point of this game (for me and likely many others) will feel pretty shallow. I highly doubt this is the case, but if it is, then it's pretty sad.\n\nI think it's fine if there's far and few wrecked ships for you to salvage or convert into a fully working airship, but starting from the ground up would be awesome as well. Progression in this game is going to be a major make or break point for me, and if it's as shallow as the demo experience is providing, I'm going to get really bored of this faster than I do with my Minecraft phases. So what are my personal takes/expectations? This isn't going to be fully organized, just some key points from the few hours I've played.\n\n- A slow but meaningful journey to building your first airship.\n\n- Combat improvements (Saw complaints about poorly telegraphed attacks and how it's basically a slapping contest for who slaps the fastest, I strongly agree with this comparison. Combat is pretty dull currently.)\n\n- Enemy variety. If all of the enemies have to be skeletons, that's fine, but I would like to see the skeletons be something more than melee and ranged fighters. (They use mounts or other creatures for whatever evil things they do for example.) This could incentivize the use of multiple combat approaches, and maybe inspire the improved combat?\n\n- Using the separate crafting benches feels a bit arbitrary if you are able to craft a majority of things like the different wood blocks in your characters inventory. Though I can kinda see where they're going with them since certain benches can craft specific things.\n\n- Exploration is a bit iffy to me. I'd love to be able to claim an island as a home base that I can park my ship at when I return from exploring. The problem is that there's no way to mark or indicate your home base without building some obvious structure on the island you settle on. I was hoping for more of a hud element that I can bring into view with the compass, unless there's something I missed?\n\n- Mid to end game should definitely captialize on the airship aspect of the game. There was one island I saw floating high above my ships limit and noticed some dungeon structure tucked into the sides. Plenty of open space to park directly into the dungeon in a way which provides a really neat approach to the dungeons. Though I feel the higher a player goes, the harder the game should get? I'm not entirely certain on how this should work, but if the loot you get doesn't scale with your progression, we're gonna end up with a Minecraft failure where you're essentially giving the player a stack of diamonds before they can even craft a wooden pickaxe.\n\nIs there anything I missed? I'm deeply invested in seeing where this game goes. For now, I'll leave it as a negative review since I'm concerned about progression and the mid to end game experience. Overall, I'm very excited for this title. Compared to Minecraft, this one has a specific focus in mind.",

This is really bad and uncomfortable for me, please add option to disable it, there's a reason almost no game does this.\n\n- General Quality of life :\nInventory management is very poor right now, almost no options to sort inventory, no auto stack to fill chests, and also crafting tables wont pull items from chests when crafting, no way to pin recipes, looted items will fill your hotbar before they fill the rest of your inventory, which is infuriating, no map (or no way to leave waypoints to mark islands)\n\n- Combat :\nThe combat is very very basic and somehow feels worse than minecraft. There is no knockback on enemies, no stagger no impact when you hit them. There are parries and blocks, but very poorly implemented.\n For A block/parry gameplay to work, there need to be some form of telegraph in the animations of enemy attacks, and some form of stagger / stun on successful parry/block, to provide some time frame for counterattack. Here you just have enemies that rush toward you and spam attacks, so the best option currently is to spam a better attack which wouldnt really be a problem if you had reliable means to get better gear, that leads me to the next, biggest complaint about this game.\n\n- RNG progression (wtf ?)\nYou cannot leave game progression to RNG. Currently to get better gear, you need to loot it or loot the blueprint to craft if, for a survival craft game that is bad design. On my game, i never got anything better than the starting stone sword (I just looted a few copper armour pieces), and couldn't really fight decently against the hordes of enemies in the sky island dungeons (I even met an Elite skeleton that I managed to kill, but instead of dying he just went back to full life, two times in a row then I left, i mean wtf, is that fun gameplay ?)\nMy advice would be to provide a fixed, sure way to unlock new tiers of equipment, like a research table for example, that would take a bit of time and some materials to unlock BASIC copper gear and weapons, and THEN have magic/enchanted versions of these items looted rarely in chests (or even some more exotic recipe). That would guaranty some form of progression for players while also providing a fun incentive to go and loot dungeons.\nIf I could research and craft by default items such as : basic copper armour, basic copper tools, and basic copper weapons ( 1h sword, 2h sword, bow, shield) that would be enough ! Then have enchanted variants in loots, and 1/2h maces/axes/spear/whatever lootable as blueprint for example.\n\n-No ship building in DEMO\nMaybe I just missed it, but I didnt like the ship that we salvage at the start, no worries, I'll just go salvage a few other ships and build my own from the parts... couldnt find a way to do that, IF there is a way right now, it's not explained at all. And I could modify the starting ship to my liking because it was full of indestructible metal blocks (maybe a bronze pickaxe would've done the trick, but I could nit find tin to make it in 3 hours).\n\nTo conclude, I recognise that there IS potential to this game, but not the way it is right now.",

There's parrying, but it doesn't seem to work, though the enemies can do it. As far as I can tell, the player can't dodge, but enemies can. It's like those very early versions of minecraft before the hunger bar was added, but with the addition of airships, and enemies sped up to where you can't just backpedal away from them to avoid damage.

If you have a key in your inventory unequipped, you should be able to auto use it to open the appropriate chest. This isn't hard. Most games do this right. Not doing this is stupid.\nCombat is terrible and the ship building is lame because the controls are horrendous.\nHealth doesn't regenerate, instead you have to eat garbage over and over and over and over to restore health, only to lose it in lazily designed HP trade based combat.\n\nThis is like a bad 3D mix between Starbound (your base being a ship you use to travel between islands instead of planets) and Minecraft (for obvious reasons) without any of the good bits of either game, or any good QOL improvements like a decently sized inventory to carry all the CRAP they want you to collect. You go into a dungeon and kill the skeletons and your inventory is full.

Seems weird, finding a basically finished airship, and only upgrading it through the upgrade terminal.\n- combat is baaad...

      "review": "Just kinda boring right now in the demo. Not sure why I would play this over something like modded Minecraft. I just find the simple core principal of the game boring with the islands. All the islands seem small, way to small. I would recommend much larger islands that the player would want to spend time on, such for larger cave systems, dungeons, and dangers with rewards. Right now I take several minutes getting to an island, and then just do nothing on it really and leave unless it has a small dungeon on it, I clear that and take off and repeat.\n\nBracket advice for changes in quick suggestions:\n1. When power attacking enemies, make them stumble or something. Hitting enemies felt way to much like a battle of trading blows, a dodge would be nice.\n2. Much larger islands with more on them. This would help with the issue of flying the ship being boring by making it happen less, and then you can make flying the ship more dangerous so when the play does have to fly, a sense of danger looms along with rewards of a new land.\n3. QoL like inventory sort.\n4. More combat mechanics like shield bashes, dodges, and offhand weapons.\n5. Condense workstations, just too many.\n\n\nRight now, the game feels very basic, and like I played it 1000 times. It is missing a lot, time will tell what happens with the full release.\n\nEdit:\nI understand the game is a demo, that isn't a reason to not be honest and provide criticism to core gameplay aspects like the islands. The animations are great, game looks nice, and in no way do I think this is some low quality garbage, if I did, I wouldn't even bother with a review.",

Only caveat there would be that the default audio makes them WAY too loud.\n\nBuilding and crafting feels just how you would expect from a voxel game and was honestly a  lot of fun! More block varieties in the initial islands would definitely go a long way!\n\nNow for the negative. SORRY DEVS!\n\nCombat feels basic and rushed. There is really no mechanics to it whatsoever and armor doesn't actually seem to have that much of an affect when it comes to mitigating enemy attacks. \n\nUnfortunately this game falls into the same pit that similar ones before it could not get out of. The game very quickly gets repetitive and stale. Fly your airship to an island, If you're lucky find something useful, fly to another, rinse and repeat. The game has no direction. This is the most basic of basic elements of game design! The WHY! Adding some kind of story to this game would immediately elevate it so PLEASE work on this! \n\nI understand that this is a demo version and is unfinished. HOWEVER a demo is meant to showcase most of the core features and get the player base excited for the full or early access release. I still have a TON of hope for this game and the additional character classes so i really hope the devs decide to take these reviews and learn from them. Don't get discouraged, this is a great starting point but it was not ready for a demo release and it just feels rushed.\n\nOverall I would give this a 5/10.

There is no \"combat\" its pretty much a stat check for each mob. If devs slowed down the combat and implemented the stamina system more for both the player and mobs I think it would be some-what enjoyable. There also seemed to be some stagger mechanic or stun ig but its pretty negligible.\n\n   Inventory was also pretty bad. Very cluttered with no auto sort and just a bunch of items.\n\n   Durability is odd because your weapon would lose the amount of damage it did rather than break or not being able to use it. Some people might like that but I would rather the weapon just be unusable, seems pointless to have it do less damage and gives a false representation of the weapon.\n\n  Something I really disliked was a mob dropping a piece of armor that was better than my current but being unable to equip it because I hadn't unlocked \"advanced armor\" in the skill tree. Locking equipment behind a skill tree in an exploration/sandbox game really does not make sense.\n\nTLDR -  Another great potential game that will be ruined by early access coming in half baked and losing all hype.

      "review": "Currently, what sets Everwind apart from any other block game? The answer should be the game's [i]Unique Selling Point[/i], the airship gameplay and exploration. However, at least in the demo, all features feel seriously underbaked and underwhelming. I would not be surprised if Minecraft mods have achieved a similar level of gameplay despite the game's engine barely supporting such functionality.\n\nExploration is at least better than in a few other action-adventurey-RPGish games I have played. I was pleasantly surprised to find improved gear, or even weapons and armor that are above what I can make myself from various chests. It is nice to see that the game is not above rewarding the player for exploration. In addition, the verticality in dungeons is a very pleasant addition.\n\nHowever, that is where the praise ends for now. Below are a myriad of smaller and larger issues that cropped up during the demo gameplay.\n\n[h3]Combat issues:[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]Combat is functional, but too simplistic. You have a basic attack, a heavy attack and a block. Heavy attacks are only useful as openers or if the enemy has a lot of armor. Blocking... might work? Not sure. Beyond that you just swing until the enemy stops moving. Most of them don't have the DPS to kill you before you kill them, anyway.\n[*]Different weapons do not feel particularly different at all. That said, I only saw a couple of different kinds of weapons, but they were largely similar. Why does nobody try to copy Vermintide's homework?\n[*]Enemies are only threatening in large numbers, or only if you have for some reason run out of food to heal yourself with. Most enemies, including the Skeleton King are easily defeated by standing on top of something they cannot reach.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Survival issues:[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]Survival effectively does not exist. You do not have needs other than keeping your health above 0. You can only lose health through falling from extreme heights, being hit by traps or through combat.\n[*]Food is plentiful and its only purpose is to serve as glorified healing potions.\n[*]Alchemy is pointless and not particularly fun. You have to match three ingredients with matching effects to make a basic potion that is likely not even particularly useful. You cannot see more than one out of three possible effects in the demo.\n[*]Repairing items is laughably easy. Copper is the most abundant metal in the game, and all you need are a few pieces of ore to to turn into ingots, and some planks to make a repair kit that fixes anything to maximum durability.\n[*]The game is severely hindered by everything being gated behind recipes you find randomly. Up to and including smelting ingots, and making anything out of said ingots. You can easily get into a situation where you find recipes for bronze or iron equipment, but can't smelt the ingots to make said items.\n[*]Recipes are not shared. In multiplayer means one player may be able to smelt ingots, but another might have a recipe for the tools or weapons that utilize those ingots. Given random generation of recipes, you may wind up with heaps of duplicates but not the ones you need.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Airship issues:[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]The airship building is completely arbitrary. Right now the most effective way to build your flying boat is to just make a one-dimensional flying saucer. Form and function are completely divorced from one another.\n[*]Airship components are arbitrary. The balloons effectively do nothing beyond add +250 max height, limited by the level of your ship's core. You do not have to balance the lift evenly around your boat. Even without any balloons, your boat can still hover up to 15 blocks (technically 7, because sea level is 7 blocks). \n[*]I'm not sure if the generators do anything at all beyond just toggling your balloons and rotors on for as long as there is power. Do you need more than one? Who knows.\n[*]Furthermore, the motors that add speed to your boat can be placed anywhere, even in places where their air currents should be completely blocked. In addition, given that in the demo the max speed is 13.5 blocks, you need two propellers to get to 13 max speed. The third motor adds only a .5 block speed increase before limited by the hard cap.\n[*]Mass does not exist. Your airship can carry as much stuff on it as you can fit in boxes and whatnot. You do not need to build a base anywhere, because your flying saucer does and carries everything.\n[*]Your airship seemingly can not take damage, making using different blocks entirely cosmetic. The most effective way to make your airboat, therefore, is to make a flat saucer with the ballons and motors stacked next to one another in some corner, fed by a single generator.\n[*]If the airboat cannot take damage, then there likely are no flying enemies either that could threaten you and your boat, making using harder blocks pointless and the flying itself uneventful and boring.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Technical issues:[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]The game freezes consistently after a few hours of gameplay.\n[*]Turning up the chunk loading setting causes crippling chugging.\n[*]The game lags considerably when an island is generated.\n[*]Virtually no quality of life features. Cannot easily stack stuff in boxes, have to do everything manually and one by one. Same for crafting, no way to craft large amounts of items at once.\n[*]No FOV settings?\n[*]No rebindable keys in demo?\n[/list]\n\nHopefully the full game will provide a far better air boat captain/crew fantasy than what the demo showcased. The systems need more depth and design. The airship should be the most developed feature and the beating heart and soul of the game. Yet, as it stands right now, it seems little more than a cute gimmick for the game to set itself apart from any other block game.",

      "review": "Without a road map, I can't say for certain that the game is going in the right direction. It has HUGE promise considering the mechanics and little details that already exist so far for this demo.\n\nI'm certain the ships being provided from the start is for the demo ONLY to give players a quick cut to the airship gameplay, however if they're handed out like this in the final product, the main selling point of this game (for me and likely many others) will feel pretty shallow. I highly doubt this is the case, but if it is, then it's pretty sad.\n\nI think it's fine if there's far and few wrecked ships for you to salvage or convert into a fully working airship, but starting from the ground up would be awesome as well. Progression in this game is going to be a major make or break point for me, and if it's as shallow as the demo experience is providing, I'm going to get really bored of this faster than I do with my Minecraft phases. So what are my personal takes/expectations? This isn't going to be fully organized, just some key points from the few hours I've played.\n\n- A slow but meaningful journey to building your first airship.\n\n- Combat improvements (Saw complaints about poorly telegraphed attacks and how it's basically a slapping contest for who slaps the fastest, I strongly agree with this comparison. Combat is pretty dull currently.)\n\n- Enemy variety. If all of the enemies have to be skeletons, that's fine, but I would like to see the skeletons be something more than melee and ranged fighters. (They use mounts or other creatures for whatever evil things they do for example.) This could incentivize the use of multiple combat approaches, and maybe inspire the improved combat?\n\n- Using the separate crafting benches feels a bit arbitrary if you are able to craft a majority of things like the different wood blocks in your characters inventory. Though I can kinda see where they're going with them since certain benches can craft specific things.\n\n- Exploration is a bit iffy to me. I'd love to be able to claim an island as a home base that I can park my ship at when I return from exploring. The problem is that there's no way to mark or indicate your home base without building some obvious structure on the island you settle on. I was hoping for more of a hud element that I can bring into view with the compass, unless there's something I missed?\n\n- Mid to end game should definitely captialize on the airship aspect of the game. There was one island I saw floating high above my ships limit and noticed some dungeon structure tucked into the sides. Plenty of open space to park directly into the dungeon in a way which provides a really neat approach to the dungeons. Though I feel the higher a player goes, the harder the game should get? I'm not entirely certain on how this should work, but if the loot you get doesn't scale with your progression, we're gonna end up with a Minecraft failure where you're essentially giving the player a stack of diamonds before they can even craft a wooden pickaxe.\n\nIs there anything I missed? I'm deeply invested in seeing where this game goes. For now, I'll leave it as a negative review since I'm concerned about progression and the mid to end game experience. Overall, I'm very excited for this title. Compared to Minecraft, this one has a specific focus in mind.",

This is really bad and uncomfortable for me, please add option to disable it, there's a reason almost no game does this.\n\n- General Quality of life :\nInventory management is very poor right now, almost no options to sort inventory, no auto stack to fill chests, and also crafting tables wont pull items from chests when crafting, no way to pin recipes, looted items will fill your hotbar before they fill the rest of your inventory, which is infuriating, no map (or no way to leave waypoints to mark islands)\n\n- Combat :\nThe combat is very very basic and somehow feels worse than minecraft. There is no knockback on enemies, no stagger no impact when you hit them. There are parries and blocks, but very poorly implemented.\n For A block/parry gameplay to work, there need to be some form of telegraph in the animations of enemy attacks, and some form of stagger / stun on successful parry/block, to provide some time frame for counterattack. Here you just have enemies that rush toward you and spam attacks, so the best option currently is to spam a better attack which wouldnt really be a problem if you had reliable means to get better gear, that leads me to the next, biggest complaint about this game.\n\n- RNG progression (wtf ?)\nYou cannot leave game progression to RNG. Currently to get better gear, you need to loot it or loot the blueprint to craft if, for a survival craft game that is bad design. On my game, i never got anything better than the starting stone sword (I just looted a few copper armour pieces), and couldn't really fight decently against the hordes of enemies in the sky island dungeons (I even met an Elite skeleton that I managed to kill, but instead of dying he just went back to full life, two times in a row then I left, i mean wtf, is that fun gameplay ?)\nMy advice would be to provide a fixed, sure way to unlock new tiers of equipment, like a research table for example, that would take a bit of time and some materials to unlock BASIC copper gear and weapons, and THEN have magic/enchanted versions of these items looted rarely in chests (or even some more exotic recipe). That would guaranty some form of progression for players while also providing a fun incentive to go and loot dungeons.\nIf I could research and craft by default items such as : basic copper armour, basic copper tools, and basic copper weapons ( 1h sword, 2h sword, bow, shield) that would be enough ! Then have enchanted variants in loots, and 1/2h maces/axes/spear/whatever lootable as blueprint for example.\n\n-No ship building in DEMO\nMaybe I just missed it, but I didnt like the ship that we salvage at the start, no worries, I'll just go salvage a few other ships and build my own from the parts... couldnt find a way to do that, IF there is a way right now, it's not explained at all. And I could modify the starting ship to my liking because it was full of indestructible metal blocks (maybe a bronze pickaxe would've done the trick, but I could nit find tin to make it in 3 hours).\n\nTo conclude, I recognise that there IS potential to this game, but not the way it is right now.",

It's like those very early versions of minecraft before the hunger bar was added, but with the addition of airships, and enemies sped up to where you can't just backpedal away from them to avoid damage.

The concept is neat, but for now the demo doesn’t bring anything new to the table. It feels more like a 2012-2015 Minecraft-wave game.\n\n- The flying mechanic — the main feature — is surprisingly dull. \nNo pirates, no enemy ships, no weather conditions, damages or entertaining physics. The ship is just a floating base to move between islands.\n\n- No engineering or physics on top of that.\nShip characteristics depends mainly on the core upgrade, the placement of engines/balloons here and there doesn't change or bring anything. It just burns wood or sulfur to fly. That's everything you have to manage. Everything feels like a cosmetic gimmick. As a result building your own stuff and flying feels like a burden.\n\n- Most islands are boring.\nTons of food and basic resources in higher elevations that become useless after 30 minutes. Many small islands serve no purpose at all since you always have food and basic materials by just raiding dungeons. \n\nThere is some potential overall, nice combat and dynamic is there, new biomes, enemies and dungeons will make it more entertaining, some perfomance and lighting problems will be fixed - I am sure. But it feels like it needs some core changes to be a new game.",

Seems weird, finding a basically finished airship, and only upgrading it through the upgrade terminal.\n- combat is baaad...

      "review": "Just kinda boring right now in the demo. Not sure why I would play this over something like modded Minecraft. I just find the simple core principal of the game boring with the islands. All the islands seem small, way to small. I would recommend much larger islands that the player would want to spend time on, such for larger cave systems, dungeons, and dangers with rewards. Right now I take several minutes getting to an island, and then just do nothing on it really and leave unless it has a small dungeon on it, I clear that and take off and repeat.\n\nBracket advice for changes in quick suggestions:\n1. When power attacking enemies, make them stumble or something. Hitting enemies felt way to much like a battle of trading blows, a dodge would be nice.\n2. Much larger islands with more on them. This would help with the issue of flying the ship being boring by making it happen less, and then you can make flying the ship more dangerous so when the play does have to fly, a sense of danger looms along with rewards of a new land.\n3. QoL like inventory sort.\n4. More combat mechanics like shield bashes, dodges, and offhand weapons.\n5. Condense workstations, just too many.\n\n\nRight now, the game feels very basic, and like I played it 1000 times. It is missing a lot, time will tell what happens with the full release.\n\nEdit:\nI understand the game is a demo, that isn't a reason to not be honest and provide criticism to core gameplay aspects like the islands. The animations are great, game looks nice, and in no way do I think this is some low quality garbage, if I did, I wouldn't even bother with a review.",

Only caveat there would be that the default audio makes them WAY too loud.\n\nBuilding and crafting feels just how you would expect from a voxel game and was honestly a  lot of fun! More block varieties in the initial islands would definitely go a long way!\n\nNow for the negative. SORRY DEVS!\n\nCombat feels basic and rushed. There is really no mechanics to it whatsoever and armor doesn't actually seem to have that much of an affect when it comes to mitigating enemy attacks. \n\nUnfortunately this game falls into the same pit that similar ones before it could not get out of. The game very quickly gets repetitive and stale. Fly your airship to an island, If you're lucky find something useful, fly to another, rinse and repeat. The game has no direction. This is the most basic of basic elements of game design! The WHY! Adding some kind of story to this game would immediately elevate it so PLEASE work on this! \n\nI understand that this is a demo version and is unfinished. HOWEVER a demo is meant to showcase most of the core features and get the player base excited for the full or early access release. I still have a TON of hope for this game and the additional character classes so i really hope the devs decide to take these reviews and learn from them. Don't get discouraged, this is a great starting point but it was not ready for a demo release and it just feels rushed.\n\nOverall I would give this a 5/10.

There is no \"combat\" its pretty much a stat check for each mob. If devs slowed down the combat and implemented the stamina system more for both the player and mobs I think it would be some-what enjoyable. There also seemed to be some stagger mechanic or stun ig but its pretty negligible.\n\n   Inventory was also pretty bad. Very cluttered with no auto sort and just a bunch of items.\n\n   Durability is odd because your weapon would lose the amount of damage it did rather than break or not being able to use it. Some people might like that but I would rather the weapon just be unusable, seems pointless to have it do less damage and gives a false representation of the weapon.\n\n  Something I really disliked was a mob dropping a piece of armor that was better than my current but being unable to equip it because I hadn't unlocked \"advanced armor\" in the skill tree. Locking equipment behind a skill tree in an exploration/sandbox game really does not make sense.\n\nTLDR -  Another great potential game that will be ruined by early access coming in half baked and losing all hype.

      "review": "Currently, what sets Everwind apart from any other block game? The answer should be the game's [i]Unique Selling Point[/i], the airship gameplay and exploration. However, at least in the demo, all features feel seriously underbaked and underwhelming. I would not be surprised if Minecraft mods have achieved a similar level of gameplay despite the game's engine barely supporting such functionality.\n\nExploration is at least better than in a few other action-adventurey-RPGish games I have played. I was pleasantly surprised to find improved gear, or even weapons and armor that are above what I can make myself from various chests. It is nice to see that the game is not above rewarding the player for exploration. In addition, the verticality in dungeons is a very pleasant addition.\n\nHowever, that is where the praise ends for now. Below are a myriad of smaller and larger issues that cropped up during the demo gameplay.\n\n[h3]Combat issues:[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]Combat is functional, but too simplistic. You have a basic attack, a heavy attack and a block. Heavy attacks are only useful as openers or if the enemy has a lot of armor. Blocking... might work? Not sure. Beyond that you just swing until the enemy stops moving. Most of them don't have the DPS to kill you before you kill them, anyway.\n[*]Different weapons do not feel particularly different at all. That said, I only saw a couple of different kinds of weapons, but they were largely similar. Why does nobody try to copy Vermintide's homework?\n[*]Enemies are only threatening in large numbers, or only if you have for some reason run out of food to heal yourself with. Most enemies, including the Skeleton King are easily defeated by standing on top of something they cannot reach.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Survival issues:[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]Survival effectively does not exist. You do not have needs other than keeping your health above 0. You can only lose health through falling from extreme heights, being hit by traps or through combat.\n[*]Food is plentiful and its only purpose is to serve as glorified healing potions.\n[*]Alchemy is pointless and not particularly fun. You have to match three ingredients with matching effects to make a basic potion that is likely not even particularly useful. You cannot see more than one out of three possible effects in the demo.\n[*]Repairing items is laughably easy. Copper is the most abundant metal in the game, and all you need are a few pieces of ore to to turn into ingots, and some planks to make a repair kit that fixes anything to maximum durability.\n[*]The game is severely hindered by everything being gated behind recipes you find randomly. Up to and including smelting ingots, and making anything out of said ingots. You can easily get into a situation where you find recipes for bronze or iron equipment, but can't smelt the ingots to make said items.\n[*]Recipes are not shared. In multiplayer means one player may be able to smelt ingots, but another might have a recipe for the tools or weapons that utilize those ingots. Given random generation of recipes, you may wind up with heaps of duplicates but not the ones you need.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Airship issues:[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]The airship building is completely arbitrary. Right now the most effective way to build your flying boat is to just make a one-dimensional flying saucer. Form and function are completely divorced from one another.\n[*]Airship components are arbitrary. The balloons effectively do nothing beyond add +250 max height, limited by the level of your ship's core. You do not have to balance the lift evenly around your boat. Even without any balloons, your boat can still hover up to 15 blocks (technically 7, because sea level is 7 blocks). \n[*]I'm not sure if the generators do anything at all beyond just toggling your balloons and rotors on for as long as there is power. Do you need more than one? Who knows.\n[*]Furthermore, the motors that add speed to your boat can be placed anywhere, even in places where their air currents should be completely blocked. In addition, given that in the demo the max speed is 13.5 blocks, you need two propellers to get to 13 max speed. The third motor adds only a .5 block speed increase before limited by the hard cap.\n[*]Mass does not exist. Your airship can carry as much stuff on it as you can fit in boxes and whatnot. You do not need to build a base anywhere, because your flying saucer does and carries everything.\n[*]Your airship seemingly can not take damage, making using different blocks entirely cosmetic. The most effective way to make your airboat, therefore, is to make a flat saucer with the ballons and motors stacked next to one another in some corner, fed by a single generator.\n[*]If the airboat cannot take damage, then there likely are no flying enemies either that could threaten you and your boat, making using harder blocks pointless and the flying itself uneventful and boring.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Technical issues:[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]The game freezes consistently after a few hours of gameplay.\n[*]Turning up the chunk loading setting causes crippling chugging.\n[*]The game lags considerably when an island is generated.\n[*]Virtually no quality of life features. Cannot easily stack stuff in boxes, have to do everything manually and one by one. Same for crafting, no way to craft large amounts of items at once.\n[*]No FOV settings?\n[*]No rebindable keys in demo?\n[/list]\n\nHopefully the full game will provide a far better air boat captain/crew fantasy than what the demo showcased. The systems need more depth and design. The airship should be the most developed feature and the beating heart and soul of the game. Yet, as it stands right now, it seems little more than a cute gimmick for the game to set itself apart from any other block game.",

      "review": "Without a road map, I can't say for certain that the game is going in the right direction. It has HUGE promise considering the mechanics and little details that already exist so far for this demo.\n\nI'm certain the ships being provided from the start is for the demo ONLY to give players a quick cut to the airship gameplay, however if they're handed out like this in the final product, the main selling point of this game (for me and likely many others) will feel pretty shallow. I highly doubt this is the case, but if it is, then it's pretty sad.\n\nI think it's fine if there's far and few wrecked ships for you to salvage or convert into a fully working airship, but starting from the ground up would be awesome as well. Progression in this game is going to be a major make or break point for me, and if it's as shallow as the demo experience is providing, I'm going to get really bored of this faster than I do with my Minecraft phases. So what are my personal takes/expectations? This isn't going to be fully organized, just some key points from the few hours I've played.\n\n- A slow but meaningful journey to building your first airship.\n\n- Combat improvements (Saw complaints about poorly telegraphed attacks and how it's basically a slapping contest for who slaps the fastest, I strongly agree with this comparison. Combat is pretty dull currently.)\n\n- Enemy variety. If all of the enemies have to be skeletons, that's fine, but I would like to see the skeletons be something more than melee and ranged fighters. (They use mounts or other creatures for whatever evil things they do for example.) This could incentivize the use of multiple combat approaches, and maybe inspire the improved combat?\n\n- Using the separate crafting benches feels a bit arbitrary if you are able to craft a majority of things like the different wood blocks in your characters inventory. Though I can kinda see where they're going with them since certain benches can craft specific things.\n\n- Exploration is a bit iffy to me. I'd love to be able to claim an island as a home base that I can park my ship at when I return from exploring. The problem is that there's no way to mark or indicate your home base without building some obvious structure on the island you settle on. I was hoping for more of a hud element that I can bring into view with the compass, unless there's something I missed?\n\n- Mid to end game should definitely captialize on the airship aspect of the game. There was one island I saw floating high above my ships limit and noticed some dungeon structure tucked into the sides. Plenty of open space to park directly into the dungeon in a way which provides a really neat approach to the dungeons. Though I feel the higher a player goes, the harder the game should get? I'm not entirely certain on how this should work, but if the loot you get doesn't scale with your progression, we're gonna end up with a Minecraft failure where you're essentially giving the player a stack of diamonds before they can even craft a wooden pickaxe.\n\nIs there anything I missed? I'm deeply invested in seeing where this game goes. For now, I'll leave it as a negative review since I'm concerned about progression and the mid to end game experience. Overall, I'm very excited for this title. Compared to Minecraft, this one has a specific focus in mind.",

This is really bad and uncomfortable for me, please add option to disable it, there's a reason almost no game does this.\n\n- General Quality of life :\nInventory management is very poor right now, almost no options to sort inventory, no auto stack to fill chests, and also crafting tables wont pull items from chests when crafting, no way to pin recipes, looted items will fill your hotbar before they fill the rest of your inventory, which is infuriating, no map (or no way to leave waypoints to mark islands)\n\n- Combat :\nThe combat is very very basic and somehow feels worse than minecraft. There is no knockback on enemies, no stagger no impact when you hit them. There are parries and blocks, but very poorly implemented.\n For A block/parry gameplay to work, there need to be some form of telegraph in the animations of enemy attacks, and some form of stagger / stun on successful parry/block, to provide some time frame for counterattack. Here you just have enemies that rush toward you and spam attacks, so the best option currently is to spam a better attack which wouldnt really be a problem if you had reliable means to get better gear, that leads me to the next, biggest complaint about this game.\n\n- RNG progression (wtf ?)\nYou cannot leave game progression to RNG. Currently to get better gear, you need to loot it or loot the blueprint to craft if, for a survival craft game that is bad design. On my game, i never got anything better than the starting stone sword (I just looted a few copper armour pieces), and couldn't really fight decently against the hordes of enemies in the sky island dungeons (I even met an Elite skeleton that I managed to kill, but instead of dying he just went back to full life, two times in a row then I left, i mean wtf, is that fun gameplay ?)\nMy advice would be to provide a fixed, sure way to unlock new tiers of equipment, like a research table for example, that would take a bit of time and some materials to unlock BASIC copper gear and weapons, and THEN have magic/enchanted versions of these items looted rarely in chests (or even some more exotic recipe). That would guaranty some form of progression for players while also providing a fun incentive to go and loot dungeons.\nIf I could research and craft by default items such as : basic copper armour, basic copper tools, and basic copper weapons ( 1h sword, 2h sword, bow, shield) that would be enough ! Then have enchanted variants in loots, and 1/2h maces/axes/spear/whatever lootable as blueprint for example.\n\n-No ship building in DEMO\nMaybe I just missed it, but I didnt like the ship that we salvage at the start, no worries, I'll just go salvage a few other ships and build my own from the parts... couldnt find a way to do that, IF there is a way right now, it's not explained at all. And I could modify the starting ship to my liking because it was full of indestructible metal blocks (maybe a bronze pickaxe would've done the trick, but I could nit find tin to make it in 3 hours).\n\nTo conclude, I recognise that there IS potential to this game, but not the way it is right now.",

It's like those very early versions of minecraft before the hunger bar was added, but with the addition of airships, and enemies sped up to where you can't just backpedal away from them to avoid damage.

It feels more like a 2012-2015 Minecraft-wave game.\n\n- The flying mechanic — the main feature — is surprisingly dull. \nNo pirates, no enemy ships, no weather conditions, damages or entertaining physics. The ship is just a floating base to move between islands.\n\n- No engineering or physics on top of that.\nShip characteristics depends mainly on the core upgrade, the placement of engines/balloons here and there doesn't change or bring anything. It just burns wood or sulfur to fly. That's everything you have to manage. Everything feels like a cosmetic gimmick. As a result building your own stuff and flying feels like a burden.\n\n- Most islands are boring.\nTons of food and basic resources in higher elevations that become useless after 30 minutes. Many small islands serve no purpose at all since you always have food and basic materials by just raiding dungeons. \n\nThere is some potential overall, nice combat and dynamic is there, new biomes, enemies and dungeons will make it more entertaining, some perfomance and lighting problems will be fixed - I am sure. But it feels like it needs some core changes to be a new game.",

If you have a key in your inventory unequipped, you should be able to auto use it to open the appropriate chest. This isn't hard. Most games do this right. Not doing this is stupid.\nCombat is terrible and the ship building is lame because the controls are horrendous.\nHealth doesn't regenerate, instead you have to eat garbage over and over and over and over to restore health, only to lose it in lazily designed HP trade based combat.\n\nThis is like a bad 3D mix between Starbound (your base being a ship you use to travel between islands instead of planets) and Minecraft (for obvious reasons) without any of the good bits of either game, or any good QOL improvements like a decently sized inventory to carry all the CRAP they want you to collect. You go into a dungeon and kill the skeletons and your inventory is full. It's ridiculous, and not fun.\n\nAll of these things could have been refined and made better before releasing a demo.\nAlso, it's another UE5 game.

Seems weird, finding a basically finished airship, and only upgrading it through the upgrade terminal.\n- combat is baaad... I can't pinpoint this precisely, but I think the fact that enemies don't really telegraph their attacks, just rush you and keep swinging, the combat devolves into a wet noodle slap fight with zero tactics or skill involved.",

      "review": "Just kinda boring right now in the demo. Not sure why I would play this over something like modded Minecraft. I just find the simple core principal of the game boring with the islands. All the islands seem small, way to small. I would recommend much larger islands that the player would want to spend time on, such for larger cave systems, dungeons, and dangers with rewards. Right now I take several minutes getting to an island, and then just do nothing on it really and leave unless it has a small dungeon on it, I clear that and take off and repeat.\n\nBracket advice for changes in quick suggestions:\n1. When power attacking enemies, make them stumble or something. Hitting enemies felt way to much like a battle of trading blows, a dodge would be nice.\n2. Much larger islands with more on them. This would help with the issue of flying the ship being boring by making it happen less, and then you can make flying the ship more dangerous so when the play does have to fly, a sense of danger looms along with rewards of a new land.\n3. QoL like inventory sort.\n4. More combat mechanics like shield bashes, dodges, and offhand weapons.\n5. Condense workstations, just too many.\n\n\nRight now, the game feels very basic, and like I played it 1000 times. It is missing a lot, time will tell what happens with the full release.\n\nEdit:\nI understand the game is a demo, that isn't a reason to not be honest and provide criticism to core gameplay aspects like the islands. The animations are great, game looks nice, and in no way do I think this is some low quality garbage, if I did, I wouldn't even bother with a review.",

      "review": "First the positive:\n\nThe game has a great concept! Airships feel very fluid and natural; from building and maintaining, to piloting. Only caveat there would be that the default audio makes them WAY too loud.\n\nBuilding and crafting feels just how you would expect from a voxel game and was honestly a  lot of fun! More block varieties in the initial islands would definitely go a long way!\n\nNow for the negative. SORRY DEVS!\n\nCombat feels basic and rushed. There is really no mechanics to it whatsoever and armor doesn't actually seem to have that much of an affect when it comes to mitigating enemy attacks. \n\nUnfortunately this game falls into the same pit that similar ones before it could not get out of. The game very quickly gets repetitive and stale. Fly your airship to an island, If you're lucky find something useful, fly to another, rinse and repeat. The game has no direction. This is the most basic of basic elements of game design! The WHY! Adding some kind of story to this game would immediately elevate it so PLEASE work on this! \n\nI understand that this is a demo version and is unfinished. HOWEVER a demo is meant to showcase most of the core features and get the player base excited for the full or early access release. I still have a TON of hope for this game and the additional character classes so i really hope the devs decide to take these reviews and learn from them. Don't get discouraged, this is a great starting point but it was not ready for a demo release and it just feels rushed.\n\nOverall I would give this a 5/10. The guts are there, the potential is strong, and I look forward to seeing where this goes.",

There is no \"combat\" its pretty much a stat check for each mob. If devs slowed down the combat and implemented the stamina system more for both the player and mobs I think it would be some-what enjoyable. There also seemed to be some stagger mechanic or stun ig but its pretty negligible.\n\n   Inventory was also pretty bad. Very cluttered with no auto sort and just a bunch of items.\n\n   Durability is odd because your weapon would lose the amount of damage it did rather than break or not being able to use it. Some people might like that but I would rather the weapon just be unusable, seems pointless to have it do less damage and gives a false representation of the weapon.\n\n  Something I really disliked was a mob dropping a piece of armor that was better than my current but being unable to equip it because I hadn't unlocked \"advanced armor\" in the skill tree. Locking equipment behind a skill tree in an exploration/sandbox game really does not make sense.\n\nTLDR -  Another great potential game that will be ruined by early access coming in half baked and losing all hype. Game seems cool and has a good foundation but theres just a few things, mainly the combat, that made me not want to continue playing. Hope the devs clutch up",

      "review": "Currently, what sets Everwind apart from any other block game? The answer should be the game's [i]Unique Selling Point[/i], the airship gameplay and exploration. However, at least in the demo, all features feel seriously underbaked and underwhelming. I would not be surprised if Minecraft mods have achieved a similar level of gameplay despite the game's engine barely supporting such functionality.\n\nExploration is at least better than in a few other action-adventurey-RPGish games I have played. I was pleasantly surprised to find improved gear, or even weapons and armor that are above what I can make myself from various chests. It is nice to see that the game is not above rewarding the player for exploration. In addition, the verticality in dungeons is a very pleasant addition.\n\nHowever, that is where the praise ends for now. Below are a myriad of smaller and larger issues that cropped up during the demo gameplay.\n\n[h3]Combat issues:[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]Combat is functional, but too simplistic. You have a basic attack, a heavy attack and a block. Heavy attacks are only useful as openers or if the enemy has a lot of armor. Blocking... might work? Not sure. Beyond that you just swing until the enemy stops moving. Most of them don't have the DPS to kill you before you kill them, anyway.\n[*]Different weapons do not feel particularly different at all. That said, I only saw a couple of different kinds of weapons, but they were largely similar. Why does nobody try to copy Vermintide's homework?\n[*]Enemies are only threatening in large numbers, or only if you have for some reason run out of food to heal yourself with. Most enemies, including the Skeleton King are easily defeated by standing on top of something they cannot reach.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Survival issues:[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]Survival effectively does not exist. You do not have needs other than keeping your health above 0. You can only lose health through falling from extreme heights, being hit by traps or through combat.\n[*]Food is plentiful and its only purpose is to serve as glorified healing potions.\n[*]Alchemy is pointless and not particularly fun. You have to match three ingredients with matching effects to make a basic potion that is likely not even particularly useful. You cannot see more than one out of three possible effects in the demo.\n[*]Repairing items is laughably easy. Copper is the most abundant metal in the game, and all you need are a few pieces of ore to to turn into ingots, and some planks to make a repair kit that fixes anything to maximum durability.\n[*]The game is severely hindered by everything being gated behind recipes you find randomly. Up to and including smelting ingots, and making anything out of said ingots. You can easily get into a situation where you find recipes for bronze or iron equipment, but can't smelt the ingots to make said items.\n[*]Recipes are not shared. In multiplayer means one player may be able to smelt ingots, but another might have a recipe for the tools or weapons that utilize those ingots. Given random generation of recipes, you may wind up with heaps of duplicates but not the ones you need.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Airship issues:[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]The airship building is completely arbitrary. Right now the most effective way to build your flying boat is to just make a one-dimensional flying saucer. Form and function are completely divorced from one another.\n[*]Airship components are arbitrary. The balloons effectively do nothing beyond add +250 max height, limited by the level of your ship's core. You do not have to balance the lift evenly around your boat. Even without any balloons, your boat can still hover up to 15 blocks (technically 7, because sea level is 7 blocks). \n[*]I'm not sure if the generators do anything at all beyond just toggling your balloons and rotors on for as long as there is power. Do you need more than one? Who knows.\n[*]Furthermore, the motors that add speed to your boat can be placed anywhere, even in places where their air currents should be completely blocked. In addition, given that in the demo the max speed is 13.5 blocks, you need two propellers to get to 13 max speed. The third motor adds only a .5 block speed increase before limited by the hard cap.\n[*]Mass does not exist. Your airship can carry as much stuff on it as you can fit in boxes and whatnot. You do not need to build a base anywhere, because your flying saucer does and carries everything.\n[*]Your airship seemingly can not take damage, making using different blocks entirely cosmetic. The most effective way to make your airboat, therefore, is to make a flat saucer with the ballons and motors stacked next to one another in some corner, fed by a single generator.\n[*]If the airboat cannot take damage, then there likely are no flying enemies either that could threaten you and your boat, making using harder blocks pointless and the flying itself uneventful and boring.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Technical issues:[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]The game freezes consistently after a few hours of gameplay.\n[*]Turning up the chunk loading setting causes crippling chugging.\n[*]The game lags considerably when an island is generated.\n[*]Virtually no quality of life features. Cannot easily stack stuff in boxes, have to do everything manually and one by one. Same for crafting, no way to craft large amounts of items at once.\n[*]No FOV settings?\n[*]No rebindable keys in demo?\n[/list]\n\nHopefully the full game will provide a far better air boat captain/crew fantasy than what the demo showcased. The systems need more depth and design. The airship should be the most developed feature and the beating heart and soul of the game. Yet, as it stands right now, it seems little more than a cute gimmick for the game to set itself apart from any other block game.",

      "review": "Without a road map, I can't say for certain that the game is going in the right direction. It has HUGE promise considering the mechanics and little details that already exist so far for this demo.\n\nI'm certain the ships being provided from the start is for the demo ONLY to give players a quick cut to the airship gameplay, however if they're handed out like this in the final product, the main selling point of this game (for me and likely many others) will feel pretty shallow. I highly doubt this is the case, but if it is, then it's pretty sad.\n\nI think it's fine if there's far and few wrecked ships for you to salvage or convert into a fully working airship, but starting from the ground up would be awesome as well. Progression in this game is going to be a major make or break point for me, and if it's as shallow as the demo experience is providing, I'm going to get really bored of this faster than I do with my Minecraft phases. So what are my personal takes/expectations? This isn't going to be fully organized, just some key points from the few hours I've played.\n\n- A slow but meaningful journey to building your first airship.\n\n- Combat improvements (Saw complaints about poorly telegraphed attacks and how it's basically a slapping contest for who slaps the fastest, I strongly agree with this comparison. Combat is pretty dull currently.)\n\n- Enemy variety. If all of the enemies have to be skeletons, that's fine, but I would like to see the skeletons be something more than melee and ranged fighters. (They use mounts or other creatures for whatever evil things they do for example.) This could incentivize the use of multiple combat approaches, and maybe inspire the improved combat?\n\n- Using the separate crafting benches feels a bit arbitrary if you are able to craft a majority of things like the different wood blocks in your characters inventory. Though I can kinda see where they're going with them since certain benches can craft specific things.\n\n- Exploration is a bit iffy to me. I'd love to be able to claim an island as a home base that I can park my ship at when I return from exploring. The problem is that there's no way to mark or indicate your home base without building some obvious structure on the island you settle on. I was hoping for more of a hud element that I can bring into view with the compass, unless there's something I missed?\n\n- Mid to end game should definitely captialize on the airship aspect of the game. There was one island I saw floating high above my ships limit and noticed some dungeon structure tucked into the sides. Plenty of open space to park directly into the dungeon in a way which provides a really neat approach to the dungeons. Though I feel the higher a player goes, the harder the game should get? I'm not entirely certain on how this should work, but if the loot you get doesn't scale with your progression, we're gonna end up with a Minecraft failure where you're essentially giving the player a stack of diamonds before they can even craft a wooden pickaxe.\n\nIs there anything I missed? I'm deeply invested in seeing where this game goes. For now, I'll leave it as a negative review since I'm concerned about progression and the mid to end game experience. Overall, I'm very excited for this title. Compared to Minecraft, this one has a specific focus in mind.",
