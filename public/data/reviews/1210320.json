Cute little potion game, nice style, fun mechanics.  ~22 hours to 100% the achievements\n\nOverall----------\nPROS\n---No bugs / Smooth FPS\n---Graphics are nice.\n---There is really one mechanic. This is creating and making different potions. During the game you get access to different ingredients that are used in the potions. Each ingredient added moves your bottle around a large 2d map where depending on where you go will determine the outcome of the potion.\n---I liked the different bases of each potion and the different mechanics that came with them. This spiced up the game as you went along \n\nCONS\n---There is not really a story (not really needed but wish there was a bit more than this)\n---This game can be very repetitive. After day 20-30ish I had most rank 3 potions saved and all I did each day was grab new herbs in the garden and then autocraft 99% of the potions I needed. This would not be a problem by itself but the speed you can get rank 3 potions saved and you progressing through the book is a bit off.\n\nGame was good, would recommend for someone looking for a short little game!",

All of these aspects are really fun and can keep you hooked for 10–15 hours. But then it starts to feel repetitive. It wouldn’t be a big problem because the grinding is still enjoyable, but there’s no bigger picture for the player. It’s just: harvest plants, make potions, sell potions, sleep and repeat.\n\nOf course, some things do change: you unlock new ways to craft potions and you get access to the laboratory, but the game still lacks in endgame. Some kind of questline or missions would make it much better. Overall, though, it’s not expensive I’m talking about a game that costs around 8$ or even less on sale so for that price it’s a bargain tho 20$ is bit to expensive so i wouldn't buy it for full price.",

As with many, the art style and prospect of running a medieval apothecary was intriguing to me. I think the game succeeds in what it sets out to do and I feel most players will enjoy the experience.\r\n\r\nThe game's core mechanic is essentially a minigame. Each ingredient appends a unique path to your potion's trail. You are tasked with efficiently combining ingredients to achieve a desired result. As the game goes on, customer requests can become more advanced. Your main form of progression is \"The Alchemist's Path.\" Completing chapters will open up new customers, shopkeepers and inventory.\r\nIt's satisfying to grow and harvest crops and minerals, and haggling is a cool mechanic that isn't as annoying as I thought it would be.\r\n\r\nThe game is very enjoyable while it's chill. After a certain point in the Alchemist's Path the game loses its chill and things become kind of a slog. Creating the Philosopher's Stone and Salt required a lot of convoluted potion-making which honestly wouldn't be so bad if I didn't have to keep looking back to make sure I got the order correct.\r\nIt may already be planned, but the game is in dire need of some postgame incentives. By the time the Philosopher's Salt is made you've already got recipes for making the best of the best potions around.\r\n\r\nOverall, would recommend for ~10 hours of proper enjoyment and another 7 of completionism if you desire.",

With the ability to customize and grow in perks gives Potion Craft a sense of being able to make the space your own. I would love to see this game grow further, perhaps having various music to be able to be played(a music tool/discs to be sold by one of the traders or even a shift when your reputation is good or bad), more abilities to customize the space (changing the color of the walls or ornaments you can hang from the enchanted tree) randomized scenes to take place while resting (a dragon flying through the sky, shooting star, war on the horizon), and etc. Nevertheless, one of my favorite games to come back to when I'm feeling down and need a pick me up.",

The artwork is awesome and the gameplay is great!\nI finished all the success on steam, and the quests in the game and it was fun all along.\nI have only one negative point to make : the game has no challenge, just grind and you cannot loose.\nThe garden will always produce plants and you can just send away customer without consequences.\nBy the day 35 I reached 100 000 gold and haven't finished chapter 8, after i just bought everything from every merchant without fear of losing. (It was fun to fill super rich :D)\nI think adding the possibility to lose the if you go bankrupt combined with new chalands that takes money away from you (tax collector), king, clergy, can be nice to have to play with. As a challenge.\nI would have loved if my potions and who i sold them to actually influenced the kingdom in the background (changing castle, banners , ambiance light to spooky). Maybe rumors from villagers about the impact of our creations on the world could be fun.\nOverall, great game, fun to play.\nWill come back on the next big update (the garden was awesome ! ).",

      "review": "Potion Craft: Alchemist Simulator is one of the most uniquely enthralling, mesmerizingly tactile, spiritually calming yet intellectually stimulating games ever conceived, a title that manages to combine the ancient art of alchemy, the grounded physics of mortar-and-pestle grinding, the creativity of potion experimentation, the strategic depth of resource management, and the hypnotic charm of medieval aesthetics into a single, cohesive, impossibly satisfying experience that grips the player from the very moment the cauldron bubbles for the first time. What makes Potion Craft extraordinary is not merely its mechanics but its philosophy: this is a game that celebrates process over speed, intention over automation, patience over shortcuts, artistry over routine, the physical feel of crafting rather than the abstract numbers typical of crafting systems in other games. You don’t simply click ingredients into a UI; you physically grind herbs, stir the brew, control the temperature, gently adjust the bellows, map your movement across the alchemical recipe constellation, and slowly uncover the vast interconnected galaxy of potion effects like a medieval scientist charting unknown stars. Every action has weight, every ingredient has personality, every fragment of the map feels like a hidden realm waiting to be understood, decoded, mastered. And it is this weaving of tactile, deliberate craftsmanship with deep strategic planning that elevates Potion Craft from “great” to “legendary.” Most games overwhelm players with rapid progression or constant escalation; Potion Craft does the opposite — it invites you to slow down, breathe, and immerse yourself in the meditative pleasure of creation. The sound of herbs crunching beneath the mortar, the bubbling of the cauldron as ingredients dissolve, the soft clink of glass bottles, the whisper of parchment, the settling of dust on neglected tomes — these small sensory details combine to produce one of the most immersive atmospheres in modern gaming. Potion Craft may not have photorealistic graphics, but its style — inspired by medieval manuscripts, old herbalist illustrations, and marginalia — is so distinct and intentional that it becomes a visual universe unto itself, a kind of playable illuminated manuscript that wraps you in a warm, sepia-toned embrace. The shop management layer adds yet another dimension of richness. Customers arrive with needs, moods, problems, moral alignments, and your decisions — what to sell, what quality of potion to provide, what price to negotiate, whether to help the noble knight or the shady assassin — shape your reputation, your economy, your identity as an alchemist. Negotiation feels like a dance: a balance between greed and ethics, risk and reward. Do you price-gouge an adventurer desperate for a healing potion? Do you refuse the poison-seeking bandit? Do you craft the perfect brew for the old herbalist who speaks in riddles? The game gently nudges you to roleplay your own philosophy, creating a story entirely unique to your playthrough. Then there is the magnificent alchemy map — perhaps one of the most elegant design choices in any crafting game. Rather than traditional recipes, potions are discovered by navigation, by steering your mixture through a cosmic network of ingredient paths, hazards, whirlpools, dead ends, teleport nodes, effect points, and secret shortcuts. It becomes a fascinating puzzle, a strategic dance between ingredient efficiency, path optimization, and experimentation. Mastering the map feels like mastering a language, a secret alchemical grammar, and nothing in the game matches the thrill of connecting multiple effects in a single potion through clever planning. The deeper you go, the more complex and beautiful the routes become — like exploring a hidden cartography of the universe through bubbling liquids and crushed leaves. But the brilliance of Potion Craft doesn’t stop at mechanics; it extends into pacing. This is a game that understands the satisfaction of incremental mastery: unlocking new ingredients, expanding your garden, perfecting potion quality, learning every path, discovering obscure effect combinations, experimenting with advanced techniques, brewing legendary potions for the most demanding clients. Progression feels smooth, natural, unforced, and richly earned. The game rewards curiosity, resourcefulness, and creativity — qualities often ignored by modern titles. And the sheer freedom it gives the player is astonishing: you can be a merciful healer, a ruthless poison merchant, a meticulous perfectionist, a chaotic experimental genius, a profit-hungry capitalist, or a gentle herbal artisan crafting only what nature provides. The systems adapt beautifully to any playstyle. Even the economy is nuanced: herb costs fluctuate, inventory must be managed thoughtfully, ingredient scarcity influences your brewing strategy, and the art of negotiation becomes a form of meta-alchemy all its own. The game’s tactile interface is so good it borders on addictive. Stirring the cauldron feels almost therapeutic, grinding ingredients is satisfying on a primal level, and carefully aligning your potion toward just the right effect node without overshooting it becomes a delicate act of craftsmanship. There is a subtle real-world logic to everything — heavier ingredients shift your path more, ground herbs extend it, water thins your mixture, heat accelerates reactions — making the entire process feel intuitively understandable while still offering immense depth. It is rare for a game to achieve both simplicity and sophistication, but Potion Craft executes this balance flawlessly. And the aesthetic worldbuilding is simply enchanting. From the medieval-inspired UI to the warmth of the shop’s wooden interiors, from the whimsical customer dialogues to the gentle background music that drifts like incense through an alchemist’s workshop, the game creates a mood of cozy, scholarly, contemplative magic — a place where you can lose track of time while carefully crafting the perfect brew. Potion Craft is not just a game; it is an experience, a meditative ritual, a celebration of slow creativity in a fast world, a love letter to the forgotten art of alchemy, a space where experimentation feels meaningful and mastery feels rewarding. Its brilliance lies in its restraint, its focus, its authenticity — qualities that make it endlessly replayable and deeply memorable. It is a game that respects the player's intelligence, patience, and curiosity. A game that invites you to think, to experiment, to refine. A game that is as relaxing as it is engaging, as beautiful as it is intricate, as charming as it is ambitious. Few games manage to create a world where every moment — from grinding a leaf to selling a masterpiece potion — feels significant, personal, and satisfying. Potion Craft achieves this effortlessly, securing its place as one of the most creative, atmospheric, and surprisingly profound gaming experiences of the decade, a masterpiece of tactile design, aesthetic cohesion, and player-driven storytelling that will remain beloved for years to come.",
