You can also make life really suck for everyone, including yourself, if you're into that. \n\nBeen playing since it came into early access, and it was so good even then (my over 800 hours in early access as proof) The full release is balanced and the tech tree and difficulty settings definitely has more impact, which makes for more varied gameplay. Huge recommend and don't underestimate its potential for coziness <3",

      "review": "Farthest Frontier is a functional, competent, and sufficiently enjoyable game. There's enough to like here, and while some things could've used some extra honing, ultimately there are no glaring issues in play severe enough to push me towards leaving a negative review.\n\nBut be that as it may, I found myself irreversibly drifting away upon reaching the third research tier and spending some time with it. Yesterday, I wandered off firmly intending to return the next day in order to press on. Today, I find myself deeply reluctant to continue.\n\nAt this point I'm decently convinced that I've seen and experienced enough (if not just about everything), with precious little left to extract from the game. Yes, there's a handful of buildings and production chains I'm yet to build and establish, but sticking around for their sake doesn't feel like a great idea.\n\n[hr][/hr]\nSee, something's just missing in action when it comes to Farthest Frontier. Would more content help, more buildings/upgrades/technologies/resources/professions/whatnot? Would having more elaborate and tricky mechanics be of use (feels like the game's complexity \"budget\" was almost entirely snatched by agriculture, leaving little for all the other things)? Probably, yes, but I don't feel this'd be the full solution.\n\nApproaching this from another angle, there isn't much happening within the world of the game, truth be told. Merchants come and go, some villagers occasionally get sick or smacked around by aggressive wildlife, raiders pop up every once in a while, random buildings erupt in flames sometimes. \n\nThere are also blizzards, heat waves, and some crop-related complications (diseases, droughts), and the reason I'm mentioning these separately is, well, because it took me a bit of time to actually remember that they exist. That's how \"big\" of an impression they've left. So, basically, there are neither windfalls nor curveballs beyond an aforementioned and scarce array of unexciting options.\n\n....alternatively, maybe I've been rewired by Against the Storm, and, moving forward, its cadence is the only one that stands a chance of doing the trick for me. I suppose I can't really exclude this possibility, can I?\n\n[hr][/hr]\nLong story short, for me it's plain as day that Farthest Frontier is an honest and solid effort, but in the end it didn't hit the spot. It certainly manages not to miss the mark completely, and for a while I was actually quite pleased with what it had going for it. \n\nBut I was hoping it'd be a longer while, the sort of while that'd end up encompassing several separate playthroughs, not a single unfinished one.\n\nA hesitant thumbs up at best.",

      "review": "A fun city sim in the vein of banished. Large tech/building tree, and nice art for the buildings. If you're looking for something like banished then I think this is a good version of that, although it doesn't have any environmental disasters so the biggest sources of pressure are raiders if you have that turned on and maybe crop diseases on the farms but even then neither of those are truly that troubling.\n\nSpeaking of the raids what I did find later on was that no matter how big the raid got I could deal with it every time by just grabbing all my citizens and moving them a short distance from the city centre/vault/foundry etc area. Then waiting for the raiders to surround one of those buildings so that they're focusing on tearing that down and then sending the citizens in to attack them.\n\nNo matter the raider they seem to go down pretty quickly when mobbed and even though maybe a dozen citizens might die if I send them in a bit too early that's nothing later on in a map when you have hundreds. Once I figured that out I never felt pressured by a raid and I eventually only started needing to recruit soldiers to deal with the various bandit camps on the map which were way more dangerous as they wouldn't be distracted by your buildings due to living in their own little space.\n\nAll of the above is on default settings/map on normal difficulty and I assume the combat/crop disease etc requires a lot more than the occasional glance and a mob of citizens if you play on a harder setting. \n\nRegardless I don't think the combat is a cornerstone of the game and it's not what I came to the game for so I'm not bothered by it being simple. As I mention at the top I enjoyed my time in the game. I liked trying to build up a functioning city, and trying to unlock the higher levels of the tech tree. However I think I've understood through this that I really prefer the impressions games style of city sim with a campaign, a little story, and maps with focused objectives and this game is definitely not that, but again if you prefer the more open banished style then this is a good modern update on that.",

      "review": "Farthest Frontier is a city-building masterpiece. It came in strong and has only improved since, with a massive amount of potential still ahead. The world feels fluid, realistic and occasionally intimidating in all the right ways. Settlements feel alive, progression is well crafted and thoughtfully paced, and the environment feels tangible. The added tech tree slowed things down compared to early access, which I personally consider an improvement: it gives you more time to refine your town and build the foundation needed to support new development. That realism is a big part of the game’s charm. Feeling worn down in the mayor’s chair? Wander through the streets and just watch the daily routines. The small details add a surprising amount of joy.\n\nIt’s one of the rare early-access titles I never regretted supporting. It showed potential early on and kept its heart. I can recommend it without hesitation. It’s easily among the best city builders available. If not the best, period.\n\nNow for the rest of the sandwich.\n\nThe Trading Post is a core mechanic, but it becomes too micro-heavy as your town grows. Eventually it starts to feel like a trading-post simulator instead of a city builder. Some smart automation or quality-of-life improvements would help a lot. That said, the required level of control makes sense because one bad trade can genuinely hurt you, and that weight is valuable.\n\nCrafting recipes are sometimes too simplistic. It would feel more cohesive if earlier products fed into later ones (for example, letting hide coats contribute to armor production instead of only raw leather). Still, this isn’t a crafting game, so it’s more of a wish than a flaw.\n\nCombat is where the difficulty spikes. Even on the lowest settings, raids can feel overwhelming. Challenging raiders are fine for realism, but it results in an odd asymmetry: the raid settings matter, yet others (starting resources, wildlife, maladies) barely influence the experience. Wildlife can even be beneficial if you get a convenient endless bucket of hides and meat (aka a cluster of wolf dens). Maladies, meanwhile, don’t do anything because soap is the only real countermeasure. You either have it or you don't. And if they were dangerous, the entire run would hinge on a single Black Death coin flip.\n\nSoldiers being idle most of the time is another rough edge. Adding crime and patrol management would give them purpose and training without just waiting on raids to happen.\n\nNone of these points are dealbreakers. They’re simply parts of an experience I otherwise consider exceptional. Farthest Frontier remains top tier, and I wholeheartedly recommend it. 9.2/10",

You can make some seriously pretty/interesting colonies in this. It also does present some challenge, for awhile, unlike other city builders that are more like city painters. I like that the game is very slow paced by design.\n\nI do have a few gripes:\n- Work areas for hunters and especially foragers create an enormous amount of busywork for anyone that tries to optimize. Foragers especially end up idle during different season unless you manually adjust their work area regularly. Instead, both of these \"wander\" job types should have an adjustable work radius, including up to unlimited. Fire a warning if they are wandering so far in search of targets that their walking ratio is above X% (e.g. 75%).\n- The challenge significantly flattens out around tier 3. By then the basic supply and demand is pretty much wholly met, very stable, and on default settings raids are easily repelled. It feels a bit static at this point. It took me long enough to get there that I didn't feel bad about it - I enjoyed the game greatly to that point. But lack of a challenge made going from tier 3 to 4 feel meaningless. Suggest adding more demands/wants for villagers going to tier 4, maybe some that even create more than just a demand challenge (i.e. upset villagers if you don't fill new needs fast enough). \n- Raid AI is pretty damn stupid. Don't notice it early on when you are very thin on military, but once you have walls etc it becomes painfully obvious just how easy it is to trounce incoming raids of any size with certain wall and tower layouts that don't look like they should be exploits. \n- Better dynamic difficulty would help the above - if I'm simply cruising without any issue, maybe trigger an unusually large weather event, or raid, or domestic unrest event. Even better if they are via systems (not just a random fire event), but anything would be better than the current stasis. \n\nStill, I really enjoyed my time with this so far. I expect I'll play more in the future - new DLC is pretty much a certain buy for me. I hope they improve some of the points above.",

Which you can just choose to disable but I would like to see the combat part being improved instead. \n\nThe other only thing driving me nuts is the logistics Ai, it's really annoying for the NPCs to have their workspace across town instead of being assigned from close by same with the way storage works.",

I have been searching for an immersive and reactive city builder, which can also grow in size and turn a few cottages in a considerable town, since like what - early 2000's? Yes, since early Pharaoh games (which weren't even that reactive).\n\nI got to say, from the very first moments of placing down buildings and watching my mvp's work hard to build all that, and then the trees go orange and brown, and I realize that this game has SEASONS and weather effects!? Love.\n\nOne of the first buildings I have to plop down? No, not a line of raw material gatherer and processor. A damn graveyard. Which has actual graves for every single mvp that dies. Love! (Don't misunderstand, I mourn every single one). Ring a bell when danger appears to avoid overfilling the graveyard, have everyone run back to the main base to defend from mister predator? Love! Explore the surroundings to discover old ruins and remains of failed settlements to see what goodies they might have to help me out in this harsh world? Love! Watch the village grow, develop, react dynamically, develop its own centers depending on where there is most traffic. LOVE!\n\nIt is an adventurous city builder that feels real, with exquisite immersion and atmosphere. I actually also see and hear a few things that are references to Grim Dawn, like the sound of thunder, or the way the water in wells has this slight magical glow.

It has the potential to be a 10, and it wouldn't be a massive amount to get there - it would need a couple more features / elements to be fleshed out before that is the case though \n\n The game does a really good job of keeping you engaged, and it looks absolutely beautiful. It strikes a good balance in my opinion between fun.  You don't need to be 100% efficient all the time, but you still need to plan and keep track of what your settlement is doing. I love the way that the logistics & desirability layer over each other, and also how much fun building the cities is. The production chains are complex and interesting enough that its fun, without being a late-game factorio level of complicated.\n\nThat being said, I have a couple things that I would love to see to make the experience better\n1.\tBetter Controls for your villagers – arm as militia, stay within walls\n2.\tAn additional system for logistics. There should be a dedicated role/job to distributing goods after they’ve been deposited\n3.\tTweaks to the desirability of some buildings – its odd that some of the most amazing buildings don’t have any benefits \n4.\tAdditional events / interactions. The current events are fine, and provide gameplay challenges, but they are generally only obstacles. It would be nice to see interactions with the population, deals for specific trades, desires etc. to change experiences between games\n5.\tMaybe some varied assets.

You will be threatened by wildlife, and soon bandits. The battle system is more akin to Age of Empire RTS than Total War which is fine. You can control individual villagers to prioritize tasks or even fight (though they are squishy and you can't rely on using them forever). Be careful of selecting children for fighting, they can be selected and moved, although it's humorous to imagine; they cannot fight.

It's a great sim game.\r\nOn the negative end, the UI is a bit clunky at times, where menus overlap gameplay making stuff a bit difficult. The tutorials don't really get into the details as much as I would like, so I have to go to forums to figure some stuff out. \r\nThere's options for automation, but I haven't found it to be possible. Also, the technology tree is a little clunky too, as you have to confirm your selections, but then you also have to close out the menu. The remifications of the technology you choose isn't really clear or apparent as a newbie--basically, the order of operations matters, but at first, I didn't know what the best order was. \r\nMoney is hard. That's a positive. Money shouldn't be easy. War is also hard. I have wiped out lots of workers due to war. The seasonality makes it so that farmers need to be hunters, and fisherman need to be foragers depending on time of year. I'd love to automate this, but having the control makes it a game worth playing. \r\nFarming is rather baffling--there are just a lot of options and utilising labour feels difficult for me. Adding too many farmers doesn't seem to maximise things. Also, storage is difficult to discern (the difference between some of them is rather ambiguous). These are all neutral-to-positive comments. This stuff SHOULD be hard, and I like that the difficulties and ambiguities seem... realistic.",

Nothing exceptional but everything more or less works the way you think it should and it's not too much hassle. There is a decent tech tree but it takes an absurd amount of time to get all of the perks if you want them, despite the fact that It has a very Banished feel to it and you can make extremely nice/authentic looking villages if that's your jam. 8/10. \n\nThe thing I was most excited about, which most city builders do not incorporate, is RTS mechanics. Every few years bandits will raid your city and you have to defend it. You have an okay amount of troop options and walls/towers to use. Again, nothing special, but the RTS mechanics also very clearly not the focus of this game. Which is the problem. The difficulty in defending your base isn't actually the invading forces, the difficulty is in micromanaging your troops/villagers. This game has beyond abysmal micro. Getting your archers to stand still and shoot is borderline impossible unless you're willing to individually tell each archer exactly which enemy to shoot and when. Infantry spend most of their time getting stuck on each other. When they're not stuck on each other they're following enemies around instead of attacking. The attack move command doesn't work the way you would expect attack move to work if you've ever played an RTS before. Your archers are going to run into melee range and your infantry are going to run past enemies. Not sure what kind of clown programmed the RTS mechanics into this game but they're beyond infuriating to use. 0/10. \n\nI played this game for 20-something hours years ago when I bought it on early access. The game has come a long way since then with it's official release. But the military side of the game is almost unplayable for me. \n\nGot my Desert Jewel Achievement and then uninstalled the game immediately. I don't mind hard games. In fact I like hard games.

My biggest issue is how painfully slow and inefficient the citizens are. I’m in year 9, and it’s still unbearable.\n\nWatching them work is like watching paint dry. Progress crawls because the NPCs are so inefficient. During winter, everyone just stays inside doing nothing, so I end up staring at my monitor waiting for villagers to actually start the tasks I’ve queued. I didn’t buy a game to sit and wait for hours while nothing gets done.\n\nRight now, the gameplay feels like 70% waiting and watching, and only 30% actually playing.\n\nIf I could leave a neutral rating, I would. But as it stands, I can’t recommend this game to anyone. The citizens need major improvements to their productivity. I’m aware of the time-acceleration toggle, but this is about efficiency—not speed. For example: does it really take eight people six in-game hours to chop down a single tree?",

Yes, there are a few interesting mechanics, but they don't really go anywhere.\nMicromanaging your gatherers in the first few years - nice. Doing it in year 20 (or... not doing it) - why?\nSame with farms - it's a nice idea to have crop rotation, but the way it is done feels like a minipuzzle game.\nTechtree is completly random - it's just after some time: \"here's a techpoint\"-> click something -> something is 10% better or \"here is a new building\" -> \"yeah, i have a new building, because i clicked on someting\"\n\nAnd while you might say: at least some new mechanics -> the rest is nothing new and you have all seen it better done. None of the buildings/workcycles are animated. The buildings have some moving parts and people stand around and do the same movement the whole time - the only thing that visually changes is the amount of produce in the storage. This has been done better 20 years ago. Not even the transports are visible - people just go around empty handed and ... 10 wood delivered to building site (there is some hint of it with the baskets and carts, but it just doesn't come to life for me).\n\nYou could say, that's not important, as long as the gameplay is good - but there is none. Building a busy town is the game - that town looks busy but taking a closer look, it's just people walking or standing around doing unconnected animations.\n\n(For clarification: take the brickyard: you see the forms for the bricks, you see bricks layed out for drying, you see the ovens and the pile of done bricks - nobody ever moves anything. nobody uses the forms for the bricks, nobody lays them out to dry, noone puts them in the oven or takes them out - all they do is sit in front of the oven with some stick and then the pile behind them gets bigger.)\n\nMusic is good but very repetitive.\nMenues are bad .... it is a city builder - why is the build menue full of submenues? instead of beeing spread on the bottom of the screen, like every(!) other city builder does it (ok - do it differently, but why do it worse? - feels like \"building is just a small part of the gameplay\" ... well... then where is the rest?)\n\nThat's basically how I feel about it - either there are major parts missing or - if what is there should be all - it's by far not good enough (because it has been done better over and over by others and the devs should and could have done their research).",

      "review": "This is one of those games where the first 20 hours or so are very addicting as you learn to swim in an ocean of content and struggle with balancing your economy with logistics and raids; but once you understand how to swim in the ocean, the mechanics all feel really flat and repetitive. Apparently it is a successor to Banished, I never played/heard of that, so to me this game feels very much like Anno.\r\n\r\nThe good things about this game: the learning curve is rewarding and I think I restarted my game like 15 times before settling on the playthrough where most of my gametime comes in. I think the learning curve for me was easier than it would be for most as I spent lots of hours in Anno and other logistics based building games as well, so for me it was just learning how this game goes about it, but for others this might be a steeper learning curve.\r\n\r\nVisually it looks really good on my machine (others state they had performance issues) and seeing the seasons change and snow collect on the ground then melt is a nice touch. Watching the world change form as you build and plan roads is also fun. Mapping your town out and placing your individual buildings to maximize benefits and resources is always a fun little puzzle to solve; the game also makes it very easy to move things around when you realize you may have placed something incorrectly, so design mistakes are not punishing.\r\n\r\nMy gripe is the flawed logistics systems: most of the storage units don't have dedicated workers to them, and the long distance logistics solution (wagons) don't seem to supply every storage facility. The problem with this is upgrading your residential buildings require that they have a variety of goods, but the citizens/workers are simply too stupid to fill the markets/storage units with the same varieties; rather they stock them with the closest buildings that make those products. This seems like a problem that can be solved 10 different ways easily, and for the life of me I can't get all the storage units/markets to carry everything I'm producing.\r\n\r\nThe combat in this game is also a chore. The first few times you encounter a raid, it will really set you back as having armed units costs money, and this game honestly provides almost no early game economy other than simply being lucky and finding ruins with gold. The AI in this game is also very sub par; RTS games of the early 90s had much more engaging and intelligent enemy behaviors than this game does. The combat was what I was looking forward to the most in this game as it is presented as a real threat, but I found selecting all my units and telling them to attack units one at a time always had me winning in an open field despite the enemy outnumbering me sometimes like 6:1. It's also just raiders, there aren't any diplomatic options with other nations or castles that you can war with, so the combat feels like something slapped together really quickly.\r\n\r\nAs many have already stated, the tech tree feels fun at first, but later it feels like a gate more than a boost as all the buildings you need are locked behind technology and if you don't upgrade the right way, technology can be EXTREMELY slow to gain; I had to once wait like 5 in game years for one tech point because I needed a building that was locked behind a technology I didn't research yet and couldn't find a tech point any other way.\r\n\r\nOverall the presentation and mechanics had me very captivated and impressed the first 25 hours or so, and then I realized I had mastered them all; at this point I was just playing the game to grow, not for a challenge or purpose, and I didn't find the aesthetics or freedom to build captivating enough to play without some goal to work towards.",

If you want a cozy city builder, this game is for you on the lowest difficulty.\n\nI say this as someone who plays on vanquisher.\n\nThe game is fundamentally flawed on what makes a city builder engaging for those looking for difficulty/challenge \n\n\nLogistically this game is extremely lacking in complexity, even though on the surface it may not appear so.  Villagers are completely incapable of handling distances, despite the existence of wagons.  \n\nThere is no simple button of \"only allowed wagons to transport\" a resource.  Villagers will walk half way across the map to a node, to grab 2 ore, instead of waiting for a wagon to deliver.\n\nYou can get gamey with it to try and force it, but to me a city builder has failed on a basic level when you are unable to set such simple limits.\n\nSecond, the tech tree suffers from the same problem.  It may appear to offer depth complexity, but that is far from the truth.  Technology mostly exists to speed bump your city and its expansion by locking previous buildings behind tech.\n\nThere are glimmers of interesting ideas in the tree, active policies that trade benefirs for penalties; but they are mostly ineffectual or extremely strong to the point where the downside might as well not exist.\n\nI could say more, especially the shallow nature of the military, but overall this game leaves me disappointed.",

They ignored all feedback and criticism regarding this for over 3 years and released the game to 1.0 with the tool in the same state as it was when they released to early access. Why is the terrain tool such a big issue you may wonder resulting in my negative review and inability to enjoy the game?\n\nBuildings and paths follow the terrain so if you place a building on uneven terrain, it is wonky. This is especially noticeable for the larger buildings. The last time I played the game on a mountain map, my mind broke as I realised my entire Town was completely wonky made worse and more noticeable with the larger buildings and upgrades to housing.\n\nThe other issue is that any ranged buildings and units get a bonus to their damage depending on the terrain height relative to their target. This means that to create proper defences, you have this incredibly tedious, unintuitive and somewhat broken tool to try and adjust the terrain heights. It's abysmal and ruins the entire game to the point that most people don't even bother playing on maps that have hills or mountains because they do not want to have to deal with this issue.\n\nI thought these devs would be good because they made Grim Dawn, but I was so wrong.

Starting a next run you're gonna be doing the same limited set of actions you can do to build your city. I have exhausted all variation quite shortly. I feel claustrophobic and lonely, it feels like im playing an empty husk of a world. Let me explain several independent thoughts I have which I'm conflicted about. These are only a few examples to explain a small portion of my feels.\n\nSeveral mechanics and rules just live in the wild online as myths and mysticisms: what for, and how to use the wagon shop for example. Of course that's not the only one, as there are several other ones that are just not declared by the game so you kinda have to guess and hope it works like you want. Reading reddit comments and forum posts of other people's thoughts on what they believe the mechanic works like. There are several annoyances in the game that keep piling up at the back of your mind as you build your city and you get to know the systems of the game. Some examples:\n\nThe upgrade and proximity system encourages you to just cramp things together and make grids. It often comes down to \"do you want a pretty town, or do you want to survive?\"\nWe want a pretty town of course, thats the game's appeal. But in the back of your mind this annoyance is always going to be there.\n\nIt's great that you can set a max limit for resources, so that villagers can quit that job and enter an other one. But this isn't true for all jobs: farmers, healers, soldiers are assigned to their duties and are still busy standing in their job title. There is no downside to unassigning them while they are not useful. You can also just let them be, which is what I do: but it's still going to be an annoyance in the back of your mind.\n\nThe reason for my dislike isn't concretely these 2-3 examples, it's the lack of replayability and shallowness. It's the overall feel, for which I have provided these examples. This feel, while the game is in early access is fine, but not as a full release at full price: Which is how I encountered this game the first time. I gave it enough playtime for me to doubt myself, because I did have doubts, maybe I just didn't understand the vision or the game.

It certainly takes a long time for things to happen in the game and it is very anti climatic, the raids are so far in between even on higher settings that it just leaves you wondering what the point of having soldiers or any defensive structures are for. I can honestly say with 30 hours that I did try to like this game and to figure it out. I think the talent tree was a bit of a wrong turn. Putting things behind the knowledge system was a turn off for me. It puts strain on decision making and not in a good way. I hope this game comes around and I will try it again after major updates to see if it is something I can change my review on. I hope the devs continue to work on it.

I checked in here and there and found the picture to be largely the same.  The full release looks pretty much identical to what we had a few weeks ago.  There clearly are a lot of systems.  There are many resource types.   Village development looks promising.   But, stuff is hard to see and some of the mechanics are obscure; it is easy to sink an hour only to find there would have been only one way to proceed in the beginning lest your folks stave or die of cold.  So, perhaps less freedom and a bit more hand holding in the beginning?  Given that I have a life and a family and don't game every day, a disappointing evening is enough to turn me off for months.  10 years ago, when there were not many games in the genre (I also had not reproduced and had a much less demanding job), I would have felt compelled to figure it all out.  Now, I can think of at least 5 similar games off the top of my head and they are not the same of course but are infinitely easier to get into for playing a couple hours here and there.  \n\nAs a side note, games take a long time to develop and FF did look incredibly good when it came out in EA.  Now, the visuals are better than average but not by any means jaw dropping.  Furthermore, there are now a few gridless games with organic road placement and going back to square grids and deliberately building dirt roads does not feel good; grids are an artifact of game coding, not medieval village development.  Dirt roads just happen over time.  I want messy and organic, not neatly tied to a square grid with 90-deg turns.  I did not expect the devs to change their whole game to come up to speed on this so it did not figure into the yea or nay decision.  \n\nI do hope that documentation or a tutorial will make barrier of entry lower because there seems to be a lot there past that point.",

As an example, there are knowledge nodes you can unlock in Tier 2 of the tree, that you cannot actually construct until you have Tier 3 Town Center or materials from Tier 3 resource buildings. (For example the Market upgrade). There is a major hurdle in obtaining bricks to make any sort of progress towards Tier 3, but you cannot actually make bricks until you are in Tier 3. This means the only real way to progress is to purchase bricks from traders, which from my experience so far, is extremely rare.\r\n\r\n2) Fires are extremely overtuned and spread very quickly. Even if you have a well directly next to a building with plenty of water available, 15 villagers will dump buckets on the fire, then walk off to do something else, and now you have to wait for a different set of villagers to continue putting out the fire. By the time they actually are close to putting it out it has now spread to an adjacent building and it just spirals from there. No amount of good placement of wells seems to really help with this.\r\n\r\n3) Raiders/Pillagers are extremely also overtuned compared the type of defenses you can obtain in early and midgame. In early/mid game, Towers cost an absurd amount of gold per month compared to the benefit you gain from them. This is especially apparent on higher difficulties where it's essentially impossible to gain victory over raiders without exploiting the enemy AI or cheesing with multiple sets of walls. Raider events also seem to happen every 3 years, on the dot, leaving very little variability in gameplay when you know exactly when raids will happen.\r\n\r\nWhile I do have some hope there could be future patches that address a lot of these issues, the fact they are in version 1.0 (Full release) at all is quite glaring; This game has far less polish on it's core mechanics than I expected from the developers of Grim Dawn.\r\n\r\nThe variety of gathering, hunting, resource gathering, and buildings you can make in this game is very generous, but it's impossible to fully enjoy these aspects when such glaring issues exist.",

It is laughable.\n\nUpkeep costs for defending against threats are incredibly high for soldiers that are next to useless.

As again, if they don’t do anything more than bug fixes, it feels incomplete.\n\n\nThe tutorial is sporadic at best.  When it does display a tutorial lesson, it gives broad information that leaves those actually reading it to want more or at least where to go for more.   The game assumes the player to know what to do otherwise. It relies too much on players to fill in the gaps from other games that put in effort to explain or teach what you’re supposed to do.\n\nTooltips are vague or misleading.  For a game that has an underwhelming tutorial, it would be nice if they made up for that by giving those that want information what they seek.  Yet so many of the tooltips stop extremely short of giving anything of value.  Want to know how much population a house holds?  Tough, build it first and then find out.  Want to know what these [Greens] are that displays on the overworld as a harvestable?  Too bad, you have to fiddle around with buildings until you see one that allows villagers to gather from that spot.  Would you like to know what that resource does or how long before it regrows, or what season if it does?  Again, nothing more than a name and the player's speculation.\n\nConfusing HUD : The game will flag a noticeable [!] over your resources in the top right, and playing back to the tooltip gripe, you hover over or attempt to click it to get nothing.  So you have to figure out why the game wants your attention there.  One assumption is I want to build a shelter and don’t have enough wood to build it, ok…yet I have no buildings in the build phase requiring stone, yet that same vague [!] lingers on that resource as well.  \nAt times it attempts to give an objective in the top left corner, but once more provides little information when it's needed.  “You need more shelters”  Ok…umm, how many?  The game doesn’t tell you that, so you build them until you have enough.  Now the game is advising how to get more people to move in?  Ok, yet it poorly explains how many shelters you need exactly.  Six more on top of the ones I already had?  Six in total?  That objective lingers there until you can solve the mystery of whatever the game poorly attempts to explain.\n\n\nThrough lack of a reliable tutorial, vague tooltips, misleading HUD, this crescendos into you largely trying to figure nearly everything out with no information provided beforehand.  Your shelter requires firewood, and can hold up to 15 stacks of the resource.  Yet the game doesn’t say how many stacks are consumed in any sense of time span.  I’ve seen no day indicator, and my only sense of time is the seasons layout in the top center, so perhaps 15 stacks are consumed in a month?  I don’t know!  The game doesn’t attempt to explain to those that want these details.  So you are left fumbling around to learn what they couldn’t bother to explain.\n\nPuzzling controls offered:  Seeing as the game allows you to set keybinds for camera positions…yet doesn’t give us the option to hotkey buildings is mind numbingly perplexing.  They were kind enough to make building things such as a road a default hotkey, yet figured there is no reason anyone would want to set their own keybinds for other buildings that will be revisited several times through a playthrough.  \n\nLook, I’m sure there is enjoyment to be had with this game in spite of all these flaws.  They largely scream early access features that will be remedied.  That is why I’m so bothered by all of these early game ordeals…as it will likely define my experience with the rest of what the game has to offer.",

Without the combat, it's a solid city-builder... but:\n\nCombat needs a complete revamp.\n\nWhy do my villagers continue to mill about their day while I get stuck trying to micromanage my guards because they don't get troop flags or a way to group them?\n\nLet me toggle between selecting villagers / combat capable (like hunters) / guards / and soldiers\n\nThere should be better troop grouping and a red-alert mechanic to tell villagers to retreat to a shelter or a keep / inner-city area.\n\nRaids come on a timer, and aren't based on anything in particular (except population numbers?) On vanquisher, they arrive every 3 years with overwhelming attack force, barely in any reasonable proportion to how ready you are. How are the raiders so punctual?\n\nThis is a medieval game but you can't make ramparts, and must rely on painfully inaccurate and ineffective guard towers. You can't have a garrison of archers line a city wall to defensively repel a siege.\n\nHiring soldiers is not worth it because then they cost you 100s of monthly gold to sit around and do ♥♥♥♥-all. People were soldiers in reserve while working normal jobs during peacetime, why can't we put folks in reserve to hold off on paying them, but maintaining their combat experience and veterancy?\n\nWalls and gates crumble like dust. There is no point in building defensive structures except to funnel the enemy into a long corridor of guard towers.\n\nOn top of all that, you can't muilti-select buildings to toggle \"production\" so you can't quickly man and un-man your guard towers when you need to.\n\n1.0 is my first experience with this game. My city has grown to 250 villagers but the raids are just such a slog, and I have been told it has been like this for most of early access. I play this and feel like I just paid $35 for an early access title, so how is this a 1.0?\n\n--\n\nBut again, on the the city builder aspect:\n\n I like that the villagers go about their lives and actually interact with things other than their job and home. They go relax in parks, go to markets to shop for luxuries, they go and mourn at the graveyards and pray at the temples / shrines. The NPC simulation is fairly fleshed out and it adds life to the town. I like watching them, like ants.\n\nThe economy and markets have to be properly stocked by workers and goods must physically move between production areas.",

      "review": "I honestly don't think this is a good game. Been playing on and off for years and was hoping that 1.0 would make it a better game, it didn't. They added a tech tree and the core system is there but its nothing amazing. Wild animals and raid are still \"unbalanced\" even if you prepare for them, they are not game killer for experience player but more like really annoying speed bumps. You know when you \"won\" a game around mid game and how you deal with raiders. Other then that its not that challenging or ground breaking. \n\nThe research tree is a detriment in my opinion, its creating problem that is only solve by using it where there was none before and progression was just how fast you want to go. Troops, hospitals, crop, and many more system that was unlocked by town center progression or population were gutted, nerfed or down right inexcessable now until you research them and they now provide either a small bonuse from before or just to get it unlocked and lower then it before until you research more. The tech tree is artificial speed bump they put in to slow the player down. You cannot even support faster research with more resources because the research building is capped to 1. You will be time gated by research, so you can sit there for years ingame (hours realtime) just on 5x weathering raids and other things while you \"research\".  Its not hard, just annoying really.\n\nPerformance wise, my mid tier PC do chug around 1.2k+pop and you will too as your city expand. So performance is really not an issue unless you're on a laptop or weaker PC. Graphic is good on higher setting if you can run it. No real crashes to worry about really. The game is really good on the aesthetic department, everything fit a renaissance atmosphere.\n\nThere is an ingame soft cap you can put on pop to be at 1k, which I assume what they deem endgame or a big enough city. The only way you get more pop is by immigration and birth. Default birthrate are not enough and they take ingame years to grow. It doesn't matter how big your town is, 100, 500 or 1k, birth rate is capped around ~10 per year for some reason. While immigration is around 2-4x that cap per year and they are at working age already, but not \"educated\" so they work a bit slower then if you grew them yourself and schooled them. You will rely on immigration to grow way faster mid game and after raid/diseases.\n\nCombat wise, walls really do nothing mid and late game unless you trick and funnel the AI into choke points. Its not hard if you know how to deal with them, but it is \"unfair\". Most people just use terrain exploits to block them into a funnel. I use soldier like its a total war game but in the end its usually a numbers game of if I outscaled the raid or not. Your end game top tier soldiers are usually better then the raiders, but again because of the research system, you are stuck using trash to fight end game sieges for a bit until you get your research in. Where as before, if you had the money and resources you can usually be ready by the time the heavy raids comes. Research once again add a problem to be solved only by researching the specific tech.\n\nAnother annoying thing, the terrain reshaper is the worse I've seen in a city builder and the dev refuse to budge on this. Its a city builder game where you can't put building down unless the land is flat enough. So you think they make it easier, but no! The tool they give you only \"level\" an area to be flatter(it combines and averages the height of an area) and you will have to use it multiple times to get flat enough space usually. Some times it bugs out and you brick the spot to be inexcessable or buildable. Terrain manipulation is a cornerstone of a city builder and its a shame its this bad. Yes there are mods to fix this but it should be the dev job not modders.\n\nLastly, I did have fun and got my moneys worth during the beta. Its better then banish(that game was shallow as hell, but if you play on pacifist mode then this would be if banished was actually good) but worse then a good city builder game like Against the Storm. If i had knowledge of what this game was like, I would likely buy it again to support the grimdawn dev(they deserve to experiment after making a great game), but would not buy this as a citybuilder game if it wasn't them.",

It's not terrible, but meh, it feels quirky and unfinished. Some examples:\n\n- Flattening terrain is a truly frustrating experience. I like how it takes labor, but the way it averages out an area is a insane design imo. Since you need to level terrain to be able to mine basic resources on many generated maps, this alone warrants a negative review for me.\n- The maximum x3 speed is terribly slow still.\n- Game performance is quite poor, especially with bustling towns.\n\nedit: after playing it some more with some more villagers (450-500), I can only say that this game runs very poorly. My PC is pretty high-end (9800X3D) but the game just runs bad, resulting in slowdowns, stutters and low fps. This often is the case with Unity based games in this genre, but that doesn't make it right. Especially sad since this game is otherwise pretty well executed.",

Nothing exceptional but everything more or less works the way you think it should and it's not too much hassle. There is a decent tech tree but it takes an absurd amount of time to get all of the perks if you want them, despite the fact that It has a very Banished feel to it and you can make extremely nice/authentic looking villages if that's your jam. 8/10. \n\nThe thing I was most excited about, which most city builders do not incorporate, is RTS mechanics. Every few years bandits will raid your city and you have to defend it. You have an okay amount of troop options and walls/towers to use. Again, nothing special, but the RTS mechanics also very clearly not the focus of this game. Which is the problem. The difficulty in defending your base isn't actually the invading forces, the difficulty is in micromanaging your troops/villagers. This game has beyond abysmal micro. Getting your archers to stand still and shoot is borderline impossible unless you're willing to individually tell each archer exactly which enemy to shoot and when. Infantry spend most of their time getting stuck on each other. When they're not stuck on each other they're following enemies around instead of attacking. The attack move command doesn't work the way you would expect attack move to work if you've ever played an RTS before. Your archers are going to run into melee range and your infantry are going to run past enemies. Not sure what kind of clown programmed the RTS mechanics into this game but they're beyond infuriating to use. 0/10. \n\nI played this game for 20-something hours years ago when I bought it on early access. The game has come a long way since then with it's official release. But the military side of the game is almost unplayable for me. \n\nGot my Desert Jewel Achievement and then uninstalled the game immediately. I don't mind hard games. In fact I like hard games.

Yes, there are a few interesting mechanics, but they don't really go anywhere.\nMicromanaging your gatherers in the first few years - nice. Doing it in year 20 (or... not doing it) - why?\nSame with farms - it's a nice idea to have crop rotation, but the way it is done feels like a minipuzzle game.\nTechtree is completly random - it's just after some time: \"here's a techpoint\"-> click something -> something is 10% better or \"here is a new building\" -> \"yeah, i have a new building, because i clicked on someting\"\n\nAnd while you might say: at least some new mechanics -> the rest is nothing new and you have all seen it better done. None of the buildings/workcycles are animated. The buildings have some moving parts and people stand around and do the same movement the whole time - the only thing that visually changes is the amount of produce in the storage. This has been done better 20 years ago. Not even the transports are visible - people just go around empty handed and ... 10 wood delivered to building site (there is some hint of it with the baskets and carts, but it just doesn't come to life for me).\n\nYou could say, that's not important, as long as the gameplay is good - but there is none. Building a busy town is the game - that town looks busy but taking a closer look, it's just people walking or standing around doing unconnected animations.\n\n(For clarification: take the brickyard: you see the forms for the bricks, you see bricks layed out for drying, you see the ovens and the pile of done bricks - nobody ever moves anything. nobody uses the forms for the bricks, nobody lays them out to dry, noone puts them in the oven or takes them out - all they do is sit in front of the oven with some stick and then the pile behind them gets bigger.)\n\nMusic is good but very repetitive.\nMenues are bad .... it is a city builder - why is the build menue full of submenues? instead of beeing spread on the bottom of the screen, like every(!) other city builder does it (ok - do it differently, but why do it worse? - feels like \"building is just a small part of the gameplay\" ... well... then where is the rest?)\n\nThat's basically how I feel about it - either there are major parts missing or - if what is there should be all - it's by far not good enough (because it has been done better over and over by others and the devs should and could have done their research).",

Apparently it is a successor to Banished, I never played/heard of that, so to me this game feels very much like Anno.\r\n\r\nThe good things about this game: the learning curve is rewarding and I think I restarted my game like 15 times before settling on the playthrough where most of my gametime comes in. I think the learning curve for me was easier than it would be for most as I spent lots of hours in Anno and other logistics based building games as well, so for me it was just learning how this game goes about it, but for others this might be a steeper learning curve.\r\n\r\nVisually it looks really good on my machine (others state they had performance issues) and seeing the seasons change and snow collect on the ground then melt is a nice touch. Watching the world change form as you build and plan roads is also fun. Mapping your town out and placing your individual buildings to maximize benefits and resources is always a fun little puzzle to solve; the game also makes it very easy to move things around when you realize you may have placed something incorrectly, so design mistakes are not punishing.\r\n\r\nMy gripe is the flawed logistics systems: most of the storage units don't have dedicated workers to them, and the long distance logistics solution (wagons) don't seem to supply every storage facility. The problem with this is upgrading your residential buildings require that they have a variety of goods, but the citizens/workers are simply too stupid to fill the markets/storage units with the same varieties; rather they stock them with the closest buildings that make those products. This seems like a problem that can be solved 10 different ways easily, and for the life of me I can't get all the storage units/markets to carry everything I'm producing.\r\n\r\nThe combat in this game is also a chore. The first few times you encounter a raid, it will really set you back as having armed units costs money, and this game honestly provides almost no early game economy other than simply being lucky and finding ruins with gold. The AI in this game is also very sub par; RTS games of the early 90s had much more engaging and intelligent enemy behaviors than this game does. The combat was what I was looking forward to the most in this game as it is presented as a real threat, but I found selecting all my units and telling them to attack units one at a time always had me winning in an open field despite the enemy outnumbering me sometimes like 6:1. It's also just raiders, there aren't any diplomatic options with other nations or castles that you can war with, so the combat feels like something slapped together really quickly.\r\n\r\nAs many have already stated, the tech tree feels fun at first, but later it feels like a gate more than a boost as all the buildings you need are locked behind technology and if you don't upgrade the right way, technology can be EXTREMELY slow to gain; I had to once wait like 5 in game years for one tech point because I needed a building that was locked behind a technology I didn't research yet and couldn't find a tech point any other way.\r\n\r\nOverall the presentation and mechanics had me very captivated and impressed the first 25 hours or so, and then I realized I had mastered them all; at this point I was just playing the game to grow, not for a challenge or purpose, and I didn't find the aesthetics or freedom to build captivating enough to play without some goal to work towards.",

Villagers are completely incapable of handling distances, despite the existence of wagons.  \n\nThere is no simple button of \"only allowed wagons to transport\" a resource.

Technology mostly exists to speed bump your city and its expansion by locking previous buildings behind tech.\n\nThere are glimmers of interesting ideas in the tree, active policies that trade benefirs for penalties; but they are mostly ineffectual or extremely strong to the point where the downside might as well not exist.\n\nI could say more, especially the shallow nature of the military, but overall this game leaves me disappointed.",

The farming system especially, was my favorite out of any in the genre. But after about 20 hours, the 1.0 disappointed me. If you want a quick explanation, it's because the pace of the late game becomes absolutely [b] GLACIAL [/b]. I know this is a given for most strategy and city building games, but the game is designed around several systems that crank it down from \"slow\" to \"borderline reverse\".\n\n[h2] Rant explanation: [/h2]\nFirst off, the fun of planning and checking out unlockables wears off after a day or two of playing, and it quickly boils down to a pretty basic tiered progression system, where you have to stock up a bunch of resources before you can upgrade your town center and unlock new buildings. It would be ok if not for the act of stockpiling totally gimping your economy for years, because saving up 150 stone doesn't only require watching as your lethargic pops take 2 months to dig out a single stone block each, but it also means holding off on expanding vital food and luxury industries for several real world hours. This [i]could[/i] in theory be fine, but the game maxes out at [b] ONLY 3x SPEED [/b]. \n\nIf you don't have a nearby deposit for a resource such as stone, I pity you, as the outpost you will need to setup once you find the resource will consume most of your looking time in this game. You will squint your eyes at the screen, trying to figure out if that cobblestone road you paid 50 stone for has increased pop walking speed by 1% or a breakneck 2%. My estimation is somewhere between the two numbers. You will then click the \"speed up\" button again, and shed another tear as you see that it is indeed stuck at [b] ONLY 3x SPEED [/b]. \n\n\"But andrejb_92, if you need resources, just buy them at the market!\" Good idea, mate. I just hope the vendor with the right goods comes along, and that he has enough in stock to upgrade my entire iron industry complex, otherwise i get to spend another hour or two waiting for their ox carts to slowly shamble into my town, because again, [b] ONLY 3x SPEED [/b]. \n\nFinally, the research system is agonizing. Each research point requires more research than the previous one. Unfortunately, you only get one building for research, which can be upgraded once, and then that's it, you'll eventually be lucky to have one research point per year. Luckily the random knowledge tomes mitigate this somewhat, but it's still a great test for your patience at a warp-cruising [b] 3x SPEED [/b]. \n\nEver spent a really long time playing a game, but felt like you haven't moved an inch? This'll be a familiar experience then. As the proud owner of a fully staffed deep stone mine, I decided to mark all my walls to be upgraded to stone, and watched as it took about 30 mins for only half of one section to be upgraded. I had to end it there. I 100%ed Settlement Survival, and that was a damn slow game by the end, but with this I couldn't even finish more than about 3/4 of the tech tree.\n\nUltimately, if you want a cozy pacifist game, this is really great. If you want a hard-difficulty challenge for some achievement hunting, there's faster and meatier stuff out there.",

I did classic trouble shooting and it seemed to solve the issue with every other game but it presisted with this game. I was shocked I can play Cyberpunk 2077 yet farthest frontier continued to freeze and crash. I'm now playing Anno Pax Romana which has ran great without a single crash. Seems like a cool game but I can't recommend it, its 30$ down the drain but so be it.",

But i still can't give it a positive purely because of how crappy the raiding system works , when this is fixed i will switch it to positive.\r\n\r\nThe issue is: villages are suicidal, needs to micromangement them and in big cities this is extremely frustrating. easy fix is to have your townhall be able to have all villagers, garrison or make a seperation building where they can take shelter from the raiders.Or let them run away quiker when raiders are nearby. plenty of ways to fix the issue.Not sure why this is still not fixed considering this was also an issue in early access.",

ON TOP OF A BLUEPRINT UNLOCKING SYSTEM\n\n\nhow is it possible to have a perfectly good game experience in ea... and end up with such a collection of half baked systems for its full release",
