Gradually pour in the water, constantly stirring. Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic.\nResting the dough: Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or cover it with a towel and let it rest for 30 minutes.\nPreparing the filling:\nBoiling the potatoes: Peel the potatoes, cut them into large pieces, and boil until tender in salted water.\nPreparing the onions: While the potatoes are boiling, finely chop the onions. Sauté the onions in lard or butter until golden brown.\nMaking the potato puree: Drain the potatoes and mash them. Add the sautéed onions, salt, and pepper to taste, and mix well.\nForming the dumplings:\nRolling out the dough: Roll out the dough into a thin sheet about 2-3 mm thick. Use a glass or cutter to cut out circles approximately 7-8 cm in diameter.\nForming the dumplings: Place a spoonful of potato filling on each circle of dough. Fold the dough in half and pinch the edges tightly to seal the dumplings.\nCooking the dumplings:\nBoiling water: Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add salt.\nCooking the dumplings: Gently drop the dumplings into the boiling water, stirring carefully to prevent sticking. Cook until done (approximately 5-7 minutes after they float to the surface).\nServing:\nRemoving the dumplings: Remove the dumplings with a slotted spoon and place them on a plate.\nServing: Serve the dumplings hot, optionally drizzling with melted butter, sour cream, or sautéed onions.\nEnjoy your meal!",

This is seriously the most incomprehensible pay-to-win garbage I've ever seen. 30 different currencies, 50 different menus with 80 different sub-menus within them. Competitive gameplay with gacha'd characters and abilities you level up outside of matches. It's seriously the most heinous example of a terrible, pay-to-win, hell-game I could possibly think of. Even if you are a massive One Piece fan, if you have any integrity or care about your mental sanity and financial situation at all, don't even give this game a second thought. It will be EoS within a year, which the developers absolutely planned for, and it only exists to make money. Passionless, lifeless, meaningless, evil. 0/10.

      "review": "As a long time One Piece fan and gacha game enjoyer, I would have to say that this game is blatantly one of the worst games I have ever played. The matchmaking decides that if you reach a certain point, all you will come up against are players 2 ranks higher than you, in pretty much every match. For such a wide character roster, only 95% of the characters aren't viable or are downright useless. It seems the only way to be competetive is to a) have been playing for years or b) spend way too much money trying to not only get the new \"meta\" character, but get dupes of them so you can have that character at max level. But I think the most egregious part of the game is that they keep coming up with characters that are so oppressive it just sucks the fun out of the game. Take Kizaru for example. As far as I know, he has:\n\n1) An auto-dodge passive that avoids skills if he's at above a certain health threshold - no need to time your dodges.\n2) A passive that heals him based on the damage he does, so if you got lucky to damage him in the first place, he just heals right back up.\n3) A Map-wide damage skill that hits almost every single capture point.

They can afford to give you at least 1 maxed 6 star off the bat, people spending money/time should be because they like the game so much they want to play other characters not so they can play the game at all. Sometimes even though I'm using my best character after days of grinding I get penalized for AFK even though I am trying as hard as I can the whole time because the enemy team is so much stronger I just can't get a KO or capture a single point.

Very unbalanced and company greed rot this game. The pay to win aspect is highly annoying. Maybe I could try to play dozens more hours to get to a level that can beat those players that are paying, but to get there, I would have to struggle through dozens of hours of painful game play. And their is no balanced match making either. I could get into a game with my best character, and all my teammates will be characters no one even knows the name of, while the enemy team will be full of 5th Gear Luffy, Kizaru, and other meta characters. Truly kills the fun of the game when you get into a game where you have a 0% chance to win.\n\nHonestly just simple balanced match making should do the trick even with company greed.

I understand you want the powerhouses, like Gear 5, to hit hard, but you need to care more about balance. Your game is so bad..

      "review": "As a long time One Piece fan and gacha game enjoyer, I would have to say that this game is blatantly one of the worst games I have ever played. The matchmaking decides that if you reach a certain point, all you will come up against are players 2 ranks higher than you, in pretty much every match. For such a wide character roster, only 95% of the characters aren't viable or are downright useless. It seems the only way to be competetive is to a) have been playing for years or b) spend way too much money trying to not only get the new \"meta\" character, but get dupes of them so you can have that character at max level. But I think the most egregious part of the game is that they keep coming up with characters that are so oppressive it just sucks the fun out of the game. Take Kizaru for example. As far as I know, he has:\n\n1) An auto-dodge passive that avoids skills if he's at above a certain health threshold - no need to time your dodges.\n2) A passive that heals him based on the damage he does, so if you got lucky to damage him in the first place, he just heals right back up.\n3) A Map-wide damage skill that hits almost every single capture point. So any Defenders sitting on their points doing their job get obliterated, and Runners trying to capture flags are just straight up dead. So 1 character essentially invalidates 2 of the major roles of the game\n\nSure, you can counter this character with like, 1 or 2 units. But they have a 0.04% chance of being summoned on the banners they come up with.\n\nAnd supposedly the game has a big hacker problem? I couldn't tell who was hacking or not, because I was trying to do objectives and getting blasted by Kizaru from across the map anyways.\n\nWhile the start of the game is relatively generous and fun, and doing some of the character progression events is a nice dopamine hit, it quickly turns into a nightmare of constantly facing teams that have 70,000 combat power higher than you from other tiers, laggy servers, and broken characters that if you didn't summon them, you might as well take a break from the game for the season (or just quit). Absolutely one of the worst new player experiences I have ever had in a gacha game, that trades the good name of the One Piece series and turns it into a blatant cash-grab.\n\nSo if anyone ends up getting to the bottom of this review, just know the game is not worth your time or investment.\n\nTL;DR: Game is not fun.",

This causes u to not be able to do anything related to the missions the game gives u in league battles hence hindering ure progress even more. The main gameplay is boring af after a couple of hours, challenge battles are filled with bots, matchmaking is broken in S-(im getting paired against S+ players with better characters), no way to get good progression without spending money or spending so much time u get depressed. Its a gacha, i expected this anyway(shitty gameplay and pay 2 win mechanics).\nSo no point to play except for some achievements and then definitely leave.

I thought my friend was lying when they told me about how bad the pay-to-win in this game is so I thought I'd try it for myself and find out if they were just bad at it or if they were right. THEY WERE RIGHT. \r\n\r\nThe \"matchmaking\" is a joke and even from the very first hours of playing (I'm posting this originally just 4 hours in) you get utterly shut out and shut down from the way that the \"matchmaking\" will always favor one team over another and force a lower ranked, lesser built group against \"fearsome foes\" (the way the game admits that the match up is utterly unbalanced and unfair but goes ahead and puts you up against them anyway, time after time). So brand new players who are trying to decide if the game play is even worth spend money on to build their account get stomped by whale players and smurfs even as early as C and B ranks at player level 5-6. \r\n\r\nHOW IS THIS A GOOD PLAYER EXPERIENCE? The answer is it's NOT. I watched my friend get matched up against a team of S+ ranked players with three of the special Kizaru characters, 2 of the blue shirted Garps, and two Kuzans - all of them overboosted to 30+ with three medals each, meaning they were fully leveled to 100 - with a team total of over 200000 power and my friend who has their team power at over 47000 and is S- was matched with three other S- players with a combined team total of about 158000 power. How is this even or fair or even entertaining? It's just frustrating when you're getting shut down from rising in a rank that the other team isn't even apart of nor are they apart of the one above it. This happens so frequently to my friend (7 to 8 matches out of 10 will match my friend up with \"fearsome foe\" enemies) that it's not a bug; it's a feature.\r\n\r\nAnd then I experienced it for myself at B rank, where I was faced with an entire group of B+ rnaked players, half of which with the brand new Luffy maxed out already. My team was full of random, not new characters, not maxed out, and some not even wearing medals (think of them as equipment which gives stat boosts) and where normally during a match a players will usually score between 2000-6000 points, we were shut down so fast and hard I had the highest score of 688. That's not fun, it's not encouraging me to play more or pay more because if that quickly I'm made to feel like nothing I can do matters, that's not a positive experience and games ARE MEANT TO BE FUN. Mind you, B rank took me only 3-ish hours to get to at player level 6 and I was playing very casually, not rushing through things. And two of those boosted and maxed out players were again against me in the very next match up.\r\n\r\nEither the very idea of throwing together such an uneven match is the point or the developers DON'T CARE that's what happens, again and again and again and again, thus making new player experience utterly trash. And the biggest problem is that this \"matchmaking\" problem isn't part of a side game or event thing, it's the main mode of play and there's nothing you can do unless you can find three players who do have all the meta characters who are willing to form a team with you so you can have a regular fighting chance. And finding that is, again, very hard for new players. \r\n\r\nSo, I guess if you want, go ahead and play but know that you will have to shell out literal thousands of dollars to catch up with the power curve if you don't want to just be fodder for whales to beat down with their bought and overboosted line-ups of the most current and most powerful characters in the game. \r\n\r\nAnd the thing is the format could be very fun - short small batch PvP matches which have very clear goals with a line up of interesting characters and powers to leverage - but the fact that the \"matchmaking\" is so bad I have to keep putting it in quotes because there's nothing actually matching about it ruins the experience and shuts down new players very early in, forcing them to either spend crazy amounts for very low chances of pulling the units which would actually help them to be competitive, be faced with the very really possibility that on average they will win *MAYBE* 1 in 10 matches because of how unfair and unbalanced \"matchmaking\" is, or give up and drop this game entirely to spare themselves the frustration of being treated like sacrifices to whale players. \r\n\r\nIN CONCLUSION: CANNOT RECOMMEND, VERY PREDATORY GACHA WHICH CRAPS ON NEW PLAYERS WHO DON'T SPEND RIDICULOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY ON IT AND REFUSES TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT HOW UNBALANCED \"MATCHMAKING\" IS.\r\n\r\nFor fairness, will update in a few days to see if the weekend is an outlier.",

As well as a gacha system that didn't seem to be too imbalanced during the early hours of first starting.\n\nBut after those good hours... the game just becomes terrible. Very unbalanced and company greed rot this game. The pay to win aspect is highly annoying. Maybe I could try to play dozens more hours to get to a level that can beat those players that are paying, but to get there, I would have to struggle through dozens of hours of painful game play. And their is no balanced match making either. I could get into a game with my best character, and all my teammates will be characters no one even knows the name of, while the enemy team will be full of 5th Gear Luffy, Kizaru, and other meta characters. Truly kills the fun of the game when you get into a game where you have a 0% chance to win.\n\nHonestly just simple balanced match making should do the trick even with company greed. The people paying will go to higher ranked matches, while those middle of the group can have fun and competitive games while grinding to a higher level.\n\nEDIT: I'm just going for achievements at this point. But every hour I play, it's horrible. The play session I had before this edit, I played like 10+ matches, and every time, my team's power was about 120-130 thousand, while the enemy's team power was over 160 thousand every time, sometimes going as high as 190 thousand. Quite literally not possible to win any of those matches. Worst part is, this is bringing my rank down every time. How am I supposed to rank up if it puts me in impossible to win matches, which lead to a decrease in my rank?",

      "review": "As a long time One Piece fan and gacha game enjoyer, I would have to say that this game is blatantly one of the worst games I have ever played. The matchmaking decides that if you reach a certain point, all you will come up against are players 2 ranks higher than you, in pretty much every match. For such a wide character roster, only 95% of the characters aren't viable or are downright useless. It seems the only way to be competetive is to a) have been playing for years or b) spend way too much money trying to not only get the new \"meta\" character, but get dupes of them so you can have that character at max level. But I think the most egregious part of the game is that they keep coming up with characters that are so oppressive it just sucks the fun out of the game. Take Kizaru for example. As far as I know, he has:\n\n1) An auto-dodge passive that avoids skills if he's at above a certain health threshold - no need to time your dodges.\n2) A passive that heals him based on the damage he does, so if you got lucky to damage him in the first place, he just heals right back up.\n3) A Map-wide damage skill that hits almost every single capture point. So any Defenders sitting on their points doing their job get obliterated, and Runners trying to capture flags are just straight up dead. So 1 character essentially invalidates 2 of the major roles of the game\n\nSure, you can counter this character with like, 1 or 2 units. But they have a 0.04% chance of being summoned on the banners they come up with.\n\nAnd supposedly the game has a big hacker problem? I couldn't tell who was hacking or not, because I was trying to do objectives and getting blasted by Kizaru from across the map anyways.\n\nWhile the start of the game is relatively generous and fun, and doing some of the character progression events is a nice dopamine hit, it quickly turns into a nightmare of constantly facing teams that have 70,000 combat power higher than you from other tiers, laggy servers, and broken characters that if you didn't summon them, you might as well take a break from the game for the season (or just quit). Absolutely one of the worst new player experiences I have ever had in a gacha game, that trades the good name of the One Piece series and turns it into a blatant cash-grab.\n\nSo if anyone ends up getting to the bottom of this review, just know the game is not worth your time or investment.\n\nTL;DR: Game is not fun.",
