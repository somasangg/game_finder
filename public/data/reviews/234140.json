There could've been some improvements but all in all I liked it.\r\n\r\nIf you like collecting cars, you'll enjoy this. Unfortunately you can only upgrade one of them, but there is many ways to do so. Physics of driving is entertaining.\r\n\r\nIf you like Easter Egg hunting, you'll like this open world. There is plenty of things for you to find, some are actually kind of challenging.\r\n\r\nRacing, this game has racing. In addition, you can blow up your competition if you'd like. I'd highly recommend doing so.\r\n\r\nCrazy stunts, this game has plenty that you can do.\r\n\r\nFighting, its kind of boring and repetitive to me, and reminds me of Batman in that element.\r\nThe game to me seems a bit too repetitive, but on that hand its fairly stress free.\r\n\r\nGameplay, is challenging enough, but has harder settings if you desire.\r\n\r\nReplayable.... ehh probably not, unless you wanna collect all the cars.\r\n\r\nAll in all its a little better than OK. \r\n\r\nIf you like honest reviews, please hit that like button or troll me in the comments.",

It is chaotic, action fueled and filled to the brim with explosions and charred carcasses strewn across the post-apocalyptic wasteland. The plot is not exactly the game's strong point, but it does teach us that life is often painful and disappointing and that fairy tale endings are not as common as one would like.\n\nI highly recommend the experience.",

But nah, it was an even mix of foot-walking and driving atleast for me, the story is pretty cool, but the ending was very weird.\n\nGameplay - driving the car was more fun then I thought, especially once you get upgrades especially the spearhook that was awesome, and the thundersticks.\n\nAchievement-wise two achievements are bugged \"Constructionist\" \"Up To The Task\", \"Constructionist\" requires you to upgrade every base, which I did and it just did not pop. \"Up To The Task\" requires online mode , and online mode is gone. To combat those achievements use a guide on steam, where people post their save games.\n\nOverall 9/10",

Cutscenes are dope, gameplay is dope and progression is very satisfying as well. The world is surprisingly full of variation with pretty unique map tiles. The plot is alrighty too and actually dares to show consequences to a few characters that you might really start to like and thats awesome.\n\nOf course its generic af and doing all the camps and collectibles can be really tedious and annoying but most of that is totally optional anyways.\n\nFurthermore it ran great on my Steam Deck on which i did the playthrough and i only had a small handful of bugs and issues here and there, nothing major.\n\nAll in all a clear recommendation, its one of those nice old games that definitely dont need a remake or sequel and offer lots of fun for many years ahead!",

      "review": "2. Excellent Vehicle Combat\r\nCombat behind the wheel is the game’s biggest strength.\r\nYou can ram, harpoon, blast, and rip enemy vehicles apart with satisfying physics and heavy-metal chaos. The Magnum Opus, your customizable car, becomes the heart of the experience.\r\n\r\n3. Strong Visuals\r\n\r\nEven years after release, the lighting, particle effects, and wide-open landscapes look great. Avalanche knows how to build stunning worlds.\r\n\r\n4. Solid Hand-to-Hand Combat\r\n\r\nThe melee system is very similar to the Batman Arkham-style freeflow combat—simple but impactful, with crunchy sound design.\r\n\r\n Where It Falls Short\r\n1. Repetitive Gameplay Loop\r\n\r\nMany missions boil down to clearing out enemy camps, destroying totems, or collecting scrap. The world is big, but its activities can feel copy-pasted.\r\n\r\n2. Story Is Decent but Forgettable\r\n\r\nWhile Max himself is portrayed well, the plot isn't as strong or emotional as the films. It mainly serves as a reason to drive, fight, and upgrade your car.\r\n\r\n3. Side Content Overload\r\n\r\nSome players feel that the game leans too heavily on open-world “busywork.” If you enjoy completionism, it’s fine—otherwise, it can get tedious.\r\n\r\nMy Overall Verdict\r\n\r\nMad Max is a flawed but underrated gem.\r\nIf you love car combat, gritty post-apocalyptic worlds, and cinematic brutality, it’s absolutely worth playing. The moment-to-moment action—especially vehicular battles—makes up for its repetitive structure.\r\n Final Score: 7.5/10",

The ability to upgrade your skills, car, and strongholds — along with a solid story and a tragic ending — kept me engaged for many hours. I also love the storms; they add real tension to the world.\r\nHowever, the map is too huge for a desert environment. Sometimes you spend long periods driving alone from one location to another, with no music and very few enemies, which makes the game feel empty and boring. Once you unlock all the skills and learn the fighting patterns, the combat becomes very easy. The minefields are the worst: deactivating mines takes too long, becomes repetitive, and slows the game down.\r\nIt took me many hours to complete the main campaign and all the side missions, and to explore most of the map. I left only a few locations without scavenging and a few minefields undeactivated. I also didn’t complete the car collection or the history relics. Additionally, due to its age, the game no longer has online features.\r\nIn summary, it’s not one of my favorite games, but I still like it. I’d give it a 6/10.

It has some characters you may recall from movies.\n\nThe ONLY downside to this game is it doesn't have BIKERS! or bikes in general.

It’s so unique and you can clearly tell that the developers put some serious time and love into it. Nothing is half-assed about this game; the attention to detail in every corner of the world is astounding. The environmental storytelling is amazing. No soulless autogenerated landscape here (looking at you Starfield). Every loot location tells a story, and every place is its own thing. I feel like the Wasteland is this game’s great strength. The embracing of the emptiness that sets such a vibe is why you want to spend so many hours driving around and explore this beautiful desert. \n\nYour car is basically your horse and upgrading it is so satisfying. The same goes for Max, which is a freaking unit. The combat is chefs kiss, period. I love how the game manages to capture the feeling of Fury Road and still be its own thing. The game is so underrated in many aspects. Sure, the grind in this game is no joke but at least the game tries to make you truly enjoy your time. The story is not much to brag about either but it gets the job done I think *spoiler* (RIP Chumbucket though). The charm lies in the vehicular combat and the weight and grittiness of it all. Everything you do feels meaningful and like it has an impact. \n\nThis is far from a perfect game and certainly not for everyone but it is something truly special and I don’t think there is anything else like it. Give it a go if you like the movies or a different type of open world game. I think it captures the essence of Mad Max perfectly and is a fun ride all the way through!",

Cars handle great and there's lots of ways to customize them. Hunting down new chassis and trying not to destroy them so you can bring them home was a fun challenge. Game soundtrack is good but it also pairs perfectly with the Fury Road soundtrack. it's everything you could want from a mad max game. \nChumbucket's quotes will forever live rent-free in my brain, but in a good way.\n\nDon't come expecting an amazing story, you're just here to blow up cars and punch people.",

Ok first of all this game's a looker and what absolutely blows my mind is its a 2015 game, the environment and car designs are a stand out in this game cause at no point i felt like i was playing a 10 yrs old game. The game had decent story beats nothing crazy but the ending, OMG the ending.... lets just say some tears were shed. Overall the story was decent i liked the characters and max's journey despite that heartbreaking ending.\nThe gameplay though, idk im kinda mixed on that cause on one hand the car combat was perfect, high speed chases and catastrophic collisions go hand in hand also the game keeps up with all the chaos as its pretty well optimized for this type of gameplay but on the other hand no matter how fun the car combat is or how satisfying the free flow hand to hand combat is, there just ain't enough variety to keep things from getting tedious at some point. All regions have same objectives, all camps have same boss fights and even though the story missions tried to mix things up but still ended up doing more of the same. Still this game is a pretty fun ride throughout if you can look past the variety issues.\n\n[h3]Do i recommend this game?[/h3]\n[b]Yes[/b]\n[h3]Is it worth the price?[/h3]\n[b]Yeah the game does provide a lot of content for the price but you can get it pretty cheap on a sale though[/b]\n\n[h3](Overall Rating- 3.9/5)[/h3]",

Some fighting skills are mostly for fun, but most of them are pretty useful.\n\n - There are tons of camps to invade, and they all have completely different designs. The side quests are so good that I kind of broke the game by doing a ton of them before the main missions. As a result, many challenging missions became quite easy for me.\n\n - The story isn’t a Kojima-level masterpiece, but it has a nice, simple, and dark tone.\n\n\nThe only con I can think of would be some occasional glitches here and there, but they’re intermittent, so you might be completely fine. Other than that, I don’t see any reason not to call this game perfect.\n\n9/10",

There are quite a few bright aspects that kept me playing however. \n\nThe devs 100% nailed the atmosphere and feel of the Mad Max universe, at times I just drove the car around the wasteland just soaking in the world. Speaking of cars, the customisation for the Magnum Opus is really extensive. You change parts such as the engine, exhaust or even the entire body of the car. \n\nVehicle combat is simple but fun, going around blowing up and ramming into War Boys never got old. Same can't be said for on foot sadly, it's the standard fair you see in Shadow Of Mordor or Assassins creed; meaning just beat the bad guys to death and make sure to counter hear and there. \n\nThe story is an oddity, it felt focused for the first three acts but then felt muddled and abrupt in the final two acts. Plot threads felt tied up way too quickly and before I knew it the credits were rolling. \n\nDespite these issues, the game is still worth buying if you just want to play an fun but basic open world title. Though if you're a Mad Max fan, you'll find a lot more enjoyment in exploring the wasteland.",

I should thank the combat system for making me stay and complete the story because it has its difficulty in its on way. the game doesnt let you choose a difficulty, but you can buy a cheaper equipment as an alternative to raise the bar, which I found to be the best way because it lets me spend my resource into another thing while having the desired difficulty. aside from the ground combat, I had a great time with the vehicular one. the car physics might be a pain in the ass but I managed to get the hang of it after a while.",

      "review": "[h2] An okay open world game with an apocalyptic setting, but unfortunately nothing more than that! [/h2]\n\n[h3] Stability and Port [/h3]\n\nStability/Bugs: In times of games with disastrous conditions, it's all the better to see that Mad Max has really done a good job here. There were no crashes or game breakers. Various elements of the game interface disappeared temporarily for no apparent reason. However, these reappeared every time the game was restarted.\n\nPort: In terms of options, graphics (which look very good), and performance, an excellent port has been delivered here. Unfortunately, some annoying aspects still remain, such as intro sequences that cannot be skipped and unnecessary double assignments on the keyboard (particularly annoying: refueling with/igniting a gas can).\n\n[h3] The gameplay [/h3]\n\nWhen you're driving around in your car and chasing a convoy, for example, the game is a lot of fun. Thanks to a range of customization options, every player can build their own hellish vehicle. With several weapons (e.g., a harpoon or flamethrower) and various enemy cars, the car combat is very varied and strongly reminiscent of the film  “Fury Road.” \nOnly the camera can be very distracting at times (e.g., because it focuses on exploding cars instead of showing the direction of travel). As the game progresses, the car's functionality is expanded to include several weapons (e.g., a sniper rifle). The car's good integration into the rest of the game is also worth mentioning. It is a central element, not just a means of transportation.\nAs is common today, all upgrades to the car and protagonist are tied to the player's level and special missions. While this makes sense for car parts (rare engines aren't found on every corner), it makes absolutely no sense for the character's appearance. Why does you have to reach level 30, for example, to unlock a dirty face with glasses and a full beard?\n\nUnfortunately, the game is much less spectacular when played on foot. Here, a 1:1 copy of the popular Batman combat system is used. This also looks very spectacular here, but quickly becomes boring due to very few “gadgets” and the lack of depth. \nOnce again, the camera is a nuisance here, as it is too close behind Max, especially in rooms, to be able to see the majority of attacks from behind. In addition, in “Fury” mode (where Max deals more damage and performs cinematic attacks, some of which are taken directly from wrestling), attacks cannot be blocked during some moves. \nAdditional attacks can be unlocked for Max, but unfortunately, the melee combat never becomes more complex.\n\n[h3] Story[/h3]\n\nWell adapted to the setting, the story unfortunately leaves no more than a very average impression. Almost all of the characters have interesting aspects and potential, which unfortunately often goes unexploited. \nThey serve more or less only as very transparent mechanisms to advance the predictable plot. The only character who leaves a somewhat lasting impression here is the mechanic, who accompanies the player almost constantly.\n\n[h3] Beyond the story [/h3]\n\nHere, the game strongly conveys the impression of having been designed according to a checklist inspired by, for example, the Tomb Raider reboot.\n\n- Large map? - (In my opinion, the size here is perfect.)\n- Camps/bases? - (Varied layout, but unfortunately always the same tasks.)\n- Side quests? - (A few, but good quality.)\n- Observation towers? - (Hot air balloons here.)\n- Searching for/finding collectibles? - (With more than 200 hiding places (including camps), which often look similar or exactly the same, this was clearly overdone. Due to the enormous confusion of some camps, the hunt for the last artifact/symbol/scrap part can quickly become frustrating)\n- Challenges? - (Similar problem as with the collectibles, too many and often a bit boring)\n- Adrenaline mode? - (Called Fury mode here)\n- Mini-bosses? - (Which look exactly the same except for their color and all (!) fight the same way)\n-...\n\nOverall, there is a lot of “filler” here, which varies greatly in quality. Not much attention was paid to variety here. Depending on how many of the tasks are completed by the player, the difficulty level of the game also changes noticeably (as more upgrades can be purchased for the car and protagonist). This cannot be adjusted! This makes the game far too easy for people who want to see everything. Casual players, on the other hand, will find it very challenging at times.\n\n[h3] Conclusion [/h3]\n\nFans of the films (Especially “Fury Road”) may find this game entertaining, but the story is somewhat disappointing. The well-executed car combat is a very positive highlight. Unfortunately, this quality is not maintained in other aspects of the game. \n\nIn the age of open-world games such as “The Witcher 3,” more high-quality content is needed here in order to be even remotely competitive.",

Дуже дивна гра, в плані контрасту між якістю, гейплеєм та сюжетною частиною. \n[b][u]Сюжет[/u][/b] мабуть найслабша частина гри. Якщо ви прийшли за цікавою чи драматичною історією - одразу проходьте повз. Хоча автори намагались вмотивувати через сюжет, але спроби слабкі, та й лише під цінець гри. А ще врахуйте, що він основна лінія дужа коротка. Більше часу витрачається на  збір потрібних деталей для прокачки, щоб рухатися далі. При тому всі діалоги - просто набір слів від божевільно-деградованих психів, яких мені, я не нативному спікеру, важко було зрозуміти на аглійській (не граю з локалізаціями взагалі). Скоріше це було зроблено для аутентичності світу, але значно нашкодило розкриттю персонажів і до них була лише відраза і не бажання допомагати/взаємодіяти. Ну і кінцівка, скажімо, - спроба зарахована, але не вийшло. Особливо напрягає, що не пояснено багато ключових подій під час самої гри, я вже мовчу про опис світу.\n[b][u]Геймплейно[/u][/b] гра розкривється просто шикарно. Дуже багато різних механік: рукопашний бій, авто-перегони, бої на авто, зачистка/розвідка територій, розмінування, розбудова баз і прокачка персонажа/авто. Все це круто лягає в динамічний і божевільний світ, в якому навіть погода зійшла з розуму і може вбити вас просто серед пустки. Все це цікаво робити першу сотню раз - трощити щелепи, підривати машини, знищувати пугала, шукати припаси, розвивати базу, потряпляти у шторм і т.д. Продумано дуже багато і навіть якісно анімовано: серія ударів як у іграх про Бетмена (але значно простіше комбо), заправка авто, вивих ніг при падінні, наповнення фляги водою, зручно розкидані запчастини (не треба перевертати \"кожен камінь\"), шрами і кроваві сліди. Набір скілів великий, але повторюваний - більшість просто копії, під різні ситуації і зброю. Але є і косяки - незручно користуватися холодною зброєю, пити воду чи використовувати фаст-тревел на чужій машині. Звісно, після зачистки 2-х регіонів (складається з 4-5 зон) - це все тупо набридає. Ворогів хоч і багато, але розбиратися з ними можна лише однією тактикою. Шукати альтернативні входи в ворожі бази - не дає значного бенефіту, набагато веселіше і досить не важно розгромити те все атакою \"в лоб\". В четвертому регіоні розробники самі це догнали і знизили кількість активностей, скомбінувавши декілька в одну. Думаю треба було взагалі 3й регіон не додавати, а зробити його як 4й - був би ідеальний баланс.\n[b][u]Графіка[/u][/b] як на 2025 - звичайно застаріла, але виглядає добре. Як я казав - багато пропрацьованих анімацій та ефектів. Текстури теж ок для 2К. Достойно на свій час.\n[b][u]Звук[/u][/b] - не збалансований: мотор може ревти гучніше на старті, ніж вибухи навколо, а діалоги ледве чути. Але якість звукових ефектів - висока. Музичний ряд - не моє. Розумію, що все під стиль божевілля, але інколи кров з вух могла піти) Не люблю таке, тому вимкнув.\n[b][u]Отже[/u][/b], середній проект 2015 року, який би у 2012 зробив би багато галасу, але зараз у 2025 - не вартий часу.

To the point i questioned if it was my keyboard and if i needed to buy a new one. If i wasnt playing other games here and there in the middle, it might have just convinced me to do it.\n\nThe questing is equally pretty atrocious, basically the entire MSQ is go here to talk to someone, do them a favor, go back repeat. \n\nThe world is pretty lack luster i mean its literally a desert but the entire world is just akin to the farcry/just cause formula of destroy all the bad guys shit but with no where near the creative freedom to do so as even far cry let alone the immense choices of the just cause series \n\n****SPOILERS****\n****SPOILERS****\n****SPOILERS****\nHOLY BURN THIS ENDING IN HELL \nI have never felt like everything i had just done has been so pointless in my entire life \nNow let me first say, i dont know the mad max story, i dont know if this is based on the movies and this is literally what happens but it can suck an entire donkey dick\nEvery character you are introduced to where you could feel literally anything for dies \nYour right hand man literally riding with you the entire time? dead\nlove interest? dead\nlove interests kid? dead\ndog? de... i actually dont know if the dog died i was to angry to even find out or pay attention at this point.\nBut not only is everyone dead, chum (our right hand man) BETRAYS US for a car...

А ще врахуйте, що він основна лінія дужа коротка. Більше часу витрачається на  збір потрібних деталей для прокачки, щоб рухатися далі. При тому всі діалоги - просто набір слів від божевільно-деградованих психів, яких мені, я не нативному спікеру, важко було зрозуміти на аглійській (не граю з локалізаціями взагалі). Скоріше це було зроблено для аутентичності світу, але значно нашкодило розкриттю персонажів і до них була лише відраза і не бажання допомагати/взаємодіяти. Ну і кінцівка, скажімо, - спроба зарахована, але не вийшло. Особливо напрягає, що не пояснено багато ключових подій під час самої гри, я вже мовчу про опис світу.\n[b][u]Геймплейно[/u][/b] гра розкривється просто шикарно. Дуже багато різних механік: рукопашний бій, авто-перегони, бої на авто, зачистка/розвідка територій, розмінування, розбудова баз і прокачка персонажа/авто. Все це круто лягає в динамічний і божевільний світ, в якому навіть погода зійшла з розуму і може вбити вас просто серед пустки. Все це цікаво робити першу сотню раз - трощити щелепи, підривати машини, знищувати пугала, шукати припаси, розвивати базу, потряпляти у шторм і т.д. Продумано дуже багато і навіть якісно анімовано: серія ударів як у іграх про Бетмена (але значно простіше комбо), заправка авто, вивих ніг при падінні, наповнення фляги водою, зручно розкидані запчастини (не треба перевертати \"кожен камінь\"), шрами і кроваві сліди. Набір скілів великий, але повторюваний - більшість просто копії, під різні ситуації і зброю. Але є і косяки - незручно користуватися холодною зброєю, пити воду чи використовувати фаст-тревел на чужій машині. Звісно, після зачистки 2-х регіонів (складається з 4-5 зон) - це все тупо набридає. Ворогів хоч і багато, але розбиратися з ними можна лише однією тактикою. Шукати альтернативні входи в ворожі бази - не дає значного бенефіту, набагато веселіше і досить не важно розгромити те все атакою \"в лоб\". В четвертому регіоні розробники самі це догнали і знизили кількість активностей, скомбінувавши декілька в одну. Думаю треба було взагалі 3й регіон не додавати, а зробити його як 4й - був би ідеальний баланс.\n[b][u]Графіка[/u][/b] як на 2025 - звичайно застаріла, але виглядає добре.
