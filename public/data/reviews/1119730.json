It feels like living out on a real ranch, and I’m all for it.\n\nThat said, I think the game could get even better with a few updates and additions\n\nBigger Coolers / Freezers\nFor storing more meat and produce  especially after a big harvest or butchering session.\n\nMore Animals & Produce Options\nWould be awesome to see new additions like rabbits, fish, or even larger crop varieties to expand the ranching side.\n\nNew Structure Types\nMetal buildings, barns, or ponds would help diversify layouts and give players more creative freedom with their ranch setup.\n\nFlatbed Trucks & More Trailers\nTo make hauling livestock, gear, and produce easier (and more fun).\n\nConveyor Belts / Processing Lines\nWould add a cool touch of realism for meat or dairy production and  smoother, more efficient, and just satisfying to use.\n\nmy feed back",

      "review": "Been playing Ranch Simulator and honestly it’s a chill, low-key addictive game. You rebuild an old ranch, take care of animals, and somehow end up chasing chickens more than anything else. It’s got that cozy grind where you look up and realize an hour’s gone. Co-op is where it really shines—total chaos in the funniest way. Loading animals into a truck should NOT be that hard, but it is, and it’s hilarious. Yeah, there are some bugs and janky physics, but nothing that ruins the fun. If you like calm farm sims with a bit of goofy chaos, it’s a solid pick.",

Farming, Animals, \"Base Building\" seemed like we had it all, but it felt empty for some reason and I couldn't put my finger on why.. we put about 17 hours into the game over the last few days and I will say, I would not have put this time into the game solo.. We bought the things we needed to build, farm, raise out animals, threw it all together aaaand.. that was it. We ran out of goals and were sitting there staring at each other when I realized... I think were done. I will say, we didnt get into the oil or slaughtering cows.. but even if we had used those to make money, there was nothing else to buy, the game had nothing to offer.. I Bought the game on sale for five bucks and I got my money out of it but I think it was mostly because of the hanging out with gaming friend aspect as much as it was the game. If you and your friends can catch the game on sale, nab it, but, probably not an exciting solo experience.  I will give this game a thumbs up simply because it was cheap so I feel I got my money out of it. Wait. for. A.

      "review": "I have been playing this game on and off throughout its development, and it is just a fun game. I just wanted to pet animals and figured I would get a few hours entertainment here and there when I bought it. But then I got so addicted to the gameplay that I CALLED OUT OF WORK the next day. (I think this is the only game that I've ever done that for). I'm not really a sim-farm sort of person. I like RPGs, sandbox creative games, horror, etc, but this gameplay loop is just incredibly addictive. The game is imperfect in a way that makes it fun. Sometimes bears spin away from you after you shoot them? You can make floating log piles? Baby pigs can be born through fences and end up outside of them? And don't get me started on driving. Every glitch literally makes the game more entertaining somehow. That said, it is very functional overall!\r\n\r\nThe one warning I will give to new players - be careful not to lose or set your cats and dogs free. NOW this may no longer be an issue, but I got a cat in the first playthrough and put out food and water for him and just let him roam the farm. I figured - farm cat, he can wander, it will be fine! Well, I found his body in the yard some time later. The body laid there and when you hover over it, it wants you to \"skin\" the animal like with pigs/cows. \r\n\r\nI almost never came back to the game, and I absolutely had to restart a new farm.  Since then, I've kept cats inside a house with the food and water, and even though they poop on the bed it keeps them alive so that's good. Personally - I feel like the cats and dogs should be immune to death.",

I spent time asking around to figure out my chickens wouldnt eat the feed off the ground (like the tutorial says they should) and it shows you how to get water for your animals but I spent an in game day and asking my friends to find out I had to build something for them to drink from.  Just a bit more flushed out on how to handle the animals, a way to pause the game if you need to step away, maybe a hospital to respawn in during friendly fire in an online game XD.",

The animals are adorable and I love to collect them all, although at this point only one animal is necessary for money making. \nMy Husband has no interest in building and this game provides little more once he experienced it once. Farming makes little money but it expensive to set up and is a waste of time. I love farming in games so this was sad for me, there is also almost no uses for crops except to sell them so this makes it even worse. \n\nThe world is empty and all the shops are far away from each other and most of them are boring (you cannot even enter the gas station). There is only one quest that allows the player to unlock a new item and I loved that, wish more quests had this feature. Maybe even locking some animals behind quests to make the town feel like it is growing with you. There is one high paying collection quest where it felt impossible to find the items without a guide but I did not hate it as it was at least unique. There are other side quests that can reoccur but they pay little and add little to the game. But I am glad they exist as it is the only thing connecting you to the town besides the shops.\n\nThere needs to be more do at low income and more to do late game when you have money. I felt like once I had money I spent it on horses and I was so excited to get a horse only for it to not be useful. I would love for horses to be able to pull items so I can take a horse to town instead of a vehicle, or at least a saddle bag so I can ride the horse to town to get one bag of food, just literally anything.\n\nThis games has lots of glitches it needs to work out. Expensive animals like my horses would die of starvation or dehydration even right next to food. Plants in a greenhouse (which had no buffs or improvements for the crops growing within for some reason) would occasionally show that it did not have water even if it was surrounded by sprinklers. Items to build would show as incomplete even if we gave it everything it needed to be complete. Driving is kinda annoying especially when pulling trailers. It was hard to connect in multiplayer but once joined it was fine.\n\nOverall I had fun discovering things in this game, but its long term retention is low especially if building is not of any interest.

I also would love to see some realism added to the game such as chopping trees, milling them, turning them into lumber, and everything else made more realistic.  The game itself is unrealistic and that defeats the whole purpose of me wanting to buy it.  The hardware store has like 30 items total.  My recommendations would be to make the graphics look less like a roblox game, include way more realism into all aspects of the game; milling your own lumber, processing animals, and every other aspect of ranching.  \n\nI think this game could have a lot of potential, however it just needs way too much work still.

The driving is not intuitive so you end up careening every which way, one of your first tasks is to demolish your entire house, all three floors, but you have to destroy things in a specific order or you just get told you have to demolish something else first.  Once you demolish it all, you have to build an entire new house from scratch.  The first thing is building base parts.  Each base takes 6 planks, you get 2 planks from each log that is put through the table saw, and each chopped down tree gives between 2 and 5 logs.  And since you have to carry each log to the table saw and wait for it to finish, this is very tedious and takes a long time.  The controls are not intuitive and make the game more frustrating.  For instance, you have to push E to put a log on the table saw, but E also turns the saw on and off, so you might turn it off by mistake, and if you put the log on the saw when it is off it falls off the table.  Then if you click on the saw when it is off you pack it back up in a box.  Everything about this game is tedious, not fun.  I've been on Steam a long time and never written a review before, but I hated this game so much I felt compelled to write one this time and save others the trouble of needing to refund it.",

Would honestly see that the developers pay me to even entertain the thought to start up this game or a monthly revenue to store it in my library. Screenshots are nothing like the game even on max settings, feels like a cheap ripoff between Farming simulator and the hunter. I have a pretty decent pc (ryzen 7 5800x, 1070ti, 64gb ram) but this concoction runs at 15-20 fps on max settings, had to drag it down to lowest to barely reach 60fps and to be honest couldnt spot a difference (except that the fences doesnt load and makes it easier to drive lol). No, save your money and time from this shit, its nothing like screenshots or the trailers. Dont even get me started on the mulitplayer, rubberbands as f*** and gets kicked/crashed out from my friends server all the time. Barely anything to do in the game except make tedious and boring missions (hunt rabbits, treasures and figure out how not to kill your chickens with starvation or dehydration).

A plank of wood that would sale for anywhere between $25-$50 sales for $2 and buys for $4 making your lumber worthless (probably because the trees grow fasters than chickens). eggs start off selling at $6 each!? roosters that people have to give away almost in reality, sale for $250 in game. Concrete that sales for $5 a 80lbs bag in reality, they're charging $250 a 50kg bag which is stupid. The game could be easily modded to be better but they don't allow mods atm (mods that are available are cheats) . pricing doesn't seem balanced for the game. feed seems over priced and doesn't last, a $30 bag of feed last 5 chickens a day when it should last a week or longer (maybe that's why the eggs sale for so much) Then I found out having a grain silo lets you buy it for less then growing it. There is also a diminishing return on sales, which I guess is a new feature...and selling a few hundred eggs is flooding the market lol (the government controls the prices of farmed goods because farmers depend on set prices since they do everything from loans and are millions in dept by the time they harvest) if you want to make the game more difficult/ interesting make it so you have to eat/drink sleep and use the restroom. Maybe make vehicles cost more then animals and have you never heard of trailer brakes? By mod I mean a pricing overhaul rework. I got this game for me and my two sons 14 and 10 who play farm games and store management games and they won't play this game. So if kids won't play it because it isn't mathing to them something is wrong. people enjoy a challenge. My favorite game atm is hunter classic.

Without clear instructions the first major mission is demolishing a home. none of the resources are kept from tearing down an entire structure. Fuel economy on your ATV matches a V12 engine's pull. There is no clear path to making money out of the gate, and following the games guidance leads to dead chickens. Finally after driving through town I came across a deer to kill, but was further disappointed that all I got for my efforts was chunks of meat. No pelt or antlers.\n\nThis game suffers from over simplicity where you'd want more, and over-complications where you want less. It needs work to be playable. I'd have really liked to see a gathering ability so that the ranch can provide an income for beginners. Maybe berries and herbs? Right now it is a chopping down trees and buying fuel game.

Vehicles are TERRIBLE at steering, takes forever to make a turn without doing a 5 point maneuver. \n\n2. Vehicles have an atrociously drive system, whenever you want to inch forward by tapping the throttle, nothing happens, so you hold it down and the vehicle just takes off at mach jesus, also when doing 5 point turns its arduously bad, you go forward and then hit reverse, and it takes a long second for the gears to switch.\n\n3. Metal comes in a stack of 50 however, when you break something down you cannot re stack the metal like you can with wood planks, which turns into a nightmare of big bundles of metal that only have 1 piece in it.\n\n4. there needs to be some more house / roof structures to choose from, if youre designing a complex, fancy shamncy house, it will come out terrible since there are no inverted roof corners to accommodate any curved walls stemming from triangle foundations, leaving you with limited design options. \n\n5. Almost forgot, there is a bug where the cats and dogs will not eat the food if placed outside, instead they will just wander around and die, leaving you no choice but to lock them up in a building with pet food.\n\n6. There needs to be more light options for field lighting: It gets so dark at night that some lights around the area would help the atmosphere besides the headlamp.\n\n7.  I cannot stress this enough; Fix the build menu book.  It is annoying to have to look straight ahead as to be centered with the book pages before whipping it out, also if you have a headlamp on, even during day time, and look at the book, it will reflect a brilliant light like the face of god back at you and you cannot read it unless your headlamp is off.\n\n8.

      "review": "Let's get one thing straight - in no way is this a simulator. I've played it long enough to get to the point of profitability. Overall it's cute, and kind of fun, but SO many things are either poorly implemented or lacking in layers of detail that would make it satisfying as a simulation to the point that they're killing any desire I might have had to play it further. Some specifics:\n\n- the jump animation for your character is *hilarious*. The chest thrust makes it look very camp.\n- bees just.....do not work this way lol. Sure, capture wild hives, ok, but they need to be split between multiple frames and you can't just randomly mix/match frames from different hives because the bees will smell it (there's methods to merge hives but the game just views each frame as a single hive and lets you mix/match without consequence). Additionally, bees need to be cleared off a full frame onto an empty one before extracting the honey because believe it or not, they're not super keen on being spun around at speed. Also they need be checked for varroa mites and other parasites, you need to winter them with sugar syrup, they won't produce honey if there's an active smoker near the hive because the smoke makes them chill out etc etc etc etc\n- relatively small amount of available building pieces that don't always snap to each other or snap in silly ways\n- inability to replicate existing in-game building designs due to above\n- new building parts are promised but my guess is they'll be tied to the southwest DLC since all the recent content additions have been\n- crop farming is limited to the 3 small fields at the front of the ranch. STACKS of space in the back of the ranch but you can't till any of it for planting crops\n- no seasons, no need to plan ahead/manage crops/rotate\n- no cost/profit margin breakdown or any display of earnings over time\n- no planning system a la Mediaeval Dynasty (which has it's own quirks and faults but actually manages to be a better farming simulator)\n- no way to hire farmhands and make them do the tedious stuff, e.g. processing 200 units of pork into meatballs\n- animals never get sick, they just die if they run out of food/water or get attacked by wolves/bears\n- haven't bought any cows or horses but I'm presuming their hooves never need to be reshod\n- basic economics of farming are entirely upside-down, e.g. $3000 or so for a truck and trailer but chickens sell for $60 and eggs for $3 apiece\n- the setting is American-ish, sure, but then why is fuel sold in litres?\n- the driving model is just bad. all the vehicles feel like driving toy cars with no real weight to them, they're all indestructible (as are the wild deer lol), and the chase camera is awful when driving with a trailer - it insists on placing itself between trailer and vehicle, making it impossible to see the road ahead. Cockpit view is also pretty useless for situation awareness.\n\nIt's cute, and there's potential for a nuanced game with real depth that would be deserving of the title 'Simulator', but it's ultimately unsatisfying.

The game itself is unrealistic and that defeats the whole purpose of me wanting to buy it.  The hardware store has like 30 items total.  My recommendations would be to make the graphics look less like a roblox game, include way more realism into all aspects of the game; milling your own lumber, processing animals, and every other aspect of ranching.  \n\nI think this game could have a lot of potential, however it just needs way too much work still.

The driving is not intuitive so you end up careening every which way, one of your first tasks is to demolish your entire house, all three floors, but you have to destroy things in a specific order or you just get told you have to demolish something else first.  Once you demolish it all, you have to build an entire new house from scratch.  The first thing is building base parts.  Each base takes 6 planks, you get 2 planks from each log that is put through the table saw, and each chopped down tree gives between 2 and 5 logs.  And since you have to carry each log to the table saw and wait for it to finish, this is very tedious and takes a long time.  The controls are not intuitive and make the game more frustrating.  For instance, you have to push E to put a log on the table saw, but E also turns the saw on and off, so you might turn it off by mistake, and if you put the log on the saw when it is off it falls off the table.  Then if you click on the saw when it is off you pack it back up in a box.  Everything about this game is tedious, not fun.  I've been on Steam a long time and never written a review before, but I hated this game so much I felt compelled to write one this time and save others the trouble of needing to refund it.",

Time consuming and you don't get much for it.\n- Handling the animals sucked. I hated that they ran for the gate the second you opened it. Also, you got stuck on them constantly.\n- Managing items was terrible. Having to pick up things one at a time was incredibly tedious. Also, why is it that only wood planks can stack but nothing else can?\n- Driving was terrible. The wheels on every vehicle felt like they were made of ice. The only vehicle that I thought was half-way decent was the ATV.\n- Game looks terrible. Tons of artifacting everywhere.\n- On top of the above, it's also terribly optimized. Every time I played, it turned my pc into a space heater.\n- Milking things was abysmal. I got stuck on things constantly. You always had to make sure the animal wasn't next to a solid object, or else you'll end up clipping into it if you tried to milk it.\n- There wasn't enough things to do or to spend your money on. When I was playing with my friends, we managed to make hundreds of thousands of dollars. Problem is, there was nothing to spend all that money on.The game doesn't give you better ways to make money, just the same crap over and over again.\n- The supply and demand system isn't interesting. It just artifically forces you to stop selling a particuar item until it reaches +50% again. During which time, my friends just build up a massive supply of a good until it hits that threshold, then we mass sell. IT takes weeks for the price of a good to recover. The waiting game is not all that interesting, just boring.\n- Hunting is useless. Nothing much to be said about that.\n- Building in the game is completely useless. I tried building a house when I first started playing with my mates, thinking it would be cool. The game hardly gives you any options in customizing your home though, just a flat, boring wooden structure with maybe a few options of furniture. I ended up tearing the whole dang thing down so that the wood could be used for more useful things.\n\nPros\n- The fireworks were cool. We shot off tons of them for some explosive, fps-tanking fun once we got sick of the game.\n\nHonestly, it blows my mind they want 25 bucks for this, and have the nerve to try and sell you dlc, even though the game is already sparse on content.

A plank of wood that would sale for anywhere between $25-$50 sales for $2 and buys for $4 making your lumber worthless (probably because the trees grow fasters than chickens). eggs start off selling at $6 each!? roosters that people have to give away almost in reality, sale for $250 in game. Concrete that sales for $5 a 80lbs bag in reality, they're charging $250 a 50kg bag which is stupid. The game could be easily modded to be better but they don't allow mods atm (mods that are available are cheats) . pricing doesn't seem balanced for the game. feed seems over priced and doesn't last, a $30 bag of feed last 5 chickens a day when it should last a week or longer (maybe that's why the eggs sale for so much) Then I found out having a grain silo lets you buy it for less then growing it. There is also a diminishing return on sales, which I guess is a new feature...and selling a few hundred eggs is flooding the market lol (the government controls the prices of farmed goods because farmers depend on set prices since they do everything from loans and are millions in dept by the time they harvest) if you want to make the game more difficult/ interesting make it so you have to eat/drink sleep and use the restroom. Maybe make vehicles cost more then animals and have you never heard of trailer brakes? By mod I mean a pricing overhaul rework. I got this game for me and my two sons 14 and 10 who play farm games and store management games and they won't play this game.

Want to drive back? wait 1.5 second to switch gears. want to go back with precise and press \"S\" multiple times for shor time? because of that 1.5s delay it's not possible to properly drive backward with precision\r\n\r\nAnother thing are colliders, and damn it's really trash\r\n- Cars - will explode into air just by hitting some tree\r\n- Animals - at some point huge pig escaped from my gate because it stepped on other animal, when then I've tried to drag it inside for 5 mins but it'd block itself until all animals escaped from gate, then I've spend another 15 mins fighting to put them back, but some starved to death because I could either go for food which was missing and have much bigger problem with them escaping, or try to catch all\r\n- Wild animals - once I've tried to kill deer with car, it's like rock, didn't move but the car flied away\r\n\r\nAnother thing is how this game encourage to abuse bugs\r\n- Big hill, will u go by road around? Why? just jump with car it will hit 20 trees with huge force and no consequences, you could even make such small thing as idk losing fuel after hit, you have time to develop shifting gears, but zero penality for not being aware of trees?\r\n- Chopping trees? Yeah you could carry each log to saw, but instead you can bring saw to few trees and do it there, well not bug that's right, but if you're too lazy you can just go 30m away, chop 2 trees and just spam E and keep pick up and drop logs, so instead of transporting 1 log, you can do 3-5 depending on your skill of spamming, could be fixed if you'd need to stand much closer to log, but for now you can pick it up from 10-15m\r\n\r\n\r\nSo who is this  game for?\r\nIf you're looking for farming games and you never played any before, it may be not bad choice at discount, to see if you will like this type of game-loop, but it's not game for long time\r\n\r\nOh, and the shameful DLC - crazy to release DLC when game is unpolish and flat\r\n\r\nAbout balance, need to admit economy is quiet good",

Like others I purchased this game for $5 and I got my money's worth, unfortunately my ADD Husband disagrees and would not recommend this game even on sale. The main reason is lack of meaningful progression, this game can stagnate immediately if you figure it out quickly.\n\nBuilding is the main reason to enjoy this game and the reason I play it, more building options would be amazing. The animals are adorable and I love to collect them all, although at this point only one animal is necessary for money making. \nMy Husband has no interest in building and this game provides little more once he experienced it once. Farming makes little money but it expensive to set up and is a waste of time. I love farming in games so this was sad for me, there is also almost no uses for crops except to sell them so this makes it even worse. \n\nThe world is empty and all the shops are far away from each other and most of them are boring (you cannot even enter the gas station). There is only one quest that allows the player to unlock a new item and I loved that, wish more quests had this feature. Maybe even locking some animals behind quests to make the town feel like it is growing with you. There is one high paying collection quest where it felt impossible to find the items without a guide but I did not hate it as it was at least unique. There are other side quests that can reoccur but they pay little and add little to the game. But I am glad they exist as it is the only thing connecting you to the town besides the shops.\n\nThere needs to be more do at low income and more to do late game when you have money. I felt like once I had money I spent it on horses and I was so excited to get a horse only for it to not be useful. I would love for horses to be able to pull items so I can take a horse to town instead of a vehicle, or at least a saddle bag so I can ride the horse to town to get one bag of food, just literally anything.\n\nThis games has lots of glitches it needs to work out. Expensive animals like my horses would die of starvation or dehydration even right next to food. Plants in a greenhouse (which had no buffs or improvements for the crops growing within for some reason) would occasionally show that it did not have water even if it was surrounded by sprinklers. Items to build would show as incomplete even if we gave it everything it needed to be complete. Driving is kinda annoying especially when pulling trailers. It was hard to connect in multiplayer but once joined it was fine.\n\nOverall I had fun discovering things in this game, but its long term retention is low especially if building is not of any interest. I have put some hours into this game because I wanted to build and own every animal in this game, if you are like my Husband and you just want to make money in the most effective way this game is extremely short.",

Without clear instructions the first major mission is demolishing a home. none of the resources are kept from tearing down an entire structure. Fuel economy on your ATV matches a V12 engine's pull. There is no clear path to making money out of the gate, and following the games guidance leads to dead chickens. Finally after driving through town I came across a deer to kill, but was further disappointed that all I got for my efforts was chunks of meat. No pelt or antlers.\n\nThis game suffers from over simplicity where you'd want more, and over-complications where you want less. It needs work to be playable. I'd have really liked to see a gathering ability so that the ranch can provide an income for beginners. Maybe berries and herbs? Right now it is a chopping down trees and buying fuel game.

Vehicles are TERRIBLE at steering, takes forever to make a turn without doing a 5 point maneuver. \n\n2. Vehicles have an atrociously drive system, whenever you want to inch forward by tapping the throttle, nothing happens, so you hold it down and the vehicle just takes off at mach jesus, also when doing 5 point turns its arduously bad, you go forward and then hit reverse, and it takes a long second for the gears to switch.\n\n3. Metal comes in a stack of 50 however, when you break something down you cannot re stack the metal like you can with wood planks, which turns into a nightmare of big bundles of metal that only have 1 piece in it.\n\n4. there needs to be some more house / roof structures to choose from, if youre designing a complex, fancy shamncy house, it will come out terrible since there are no inverted roof corners to accommodate any curved walls stemming from triangle foundations, leaving you with limited design options. \n\n5. Almost forgot, there is a bug where the cats and dogs will not eat the food if placed outside, instead they will just wander around and die, leaving you no choice but to lock them up in a building with pet food.\n\n6. There needs to be more light options for field lighting: It gets so dark at night that some lights around the area would help the atmosphere besides the headlamp.\n\n7.  I cannot stress this enough; Fix the build menu book.  It is annoying to have to look straight ahead as to be centered with the book pages before whipping it out, also if you have a headlamp on, even during day time, and look at the book, it will reflect a brilliant light like the face of god back at you and you cannot read it unless your headlamp is off.\n\n8.

      "review": "Let's get one thing straight - in no way is this a simulator. I've played it long enough to get to the point of profitability. Overall it's cute, and kind of fun, but SO many things are either poorly implemented or lacking in layers of detail that would make it satisfying as a simulation to the point that they're killing any desire I might have had to play it further. Some specifics:\n\n- the jump animation for your character is *hilarious*. The chest thrust makes it look very camp.\n- bees just.....do not work this way lol. Sure, capture wild hives, ok, but they need to be split between multiple frames and you can't just randomly mix/match frames from different hives because the bees will smell it (there's methods to merge hives but the game just views each frame as a single hive and lets you mix/match without consequence). Additionally, bees need to be cleared off a full frame onto an empty one before extracting the honey because believe it or not, they're not super keen on being spun around at speed. Also they need be checked for varroa mites and other parasites, you need to winter them with sugar syrup, they won't produce honey if there's an active smoker near the hive because the smoke makes them chill out etc etc etc etc\n- relatively small amount of available building pieces that don't always snap to each other or snap in silly ways\n- inability to replicate existing in-game building designs due to above\n- new building parts are promised but my guess is they'll be tied to the southwest DLC since all the recent content additions have been\n- crop farming is limited to the 3 small fields at the front of the ranch. STACKS of space in the back of the ranch but you can't till any of it for planting crops\n- no seasons, no need to plan ahead/manage crops/rotate\n- no cost/profit margin breakdown or any display of earnings over time\n- no planning system a la Mediaeval Dynasty (which has it's own quirks and faults but actually manages to be a better farming simulator)\n- no way to hire farmhands and make them do the tedious stuff, e.g. processing 200 units of pork into meatballs\n- animals never get sick, they just die if they run out of food/water or get attacked by wolves/bears\n- haven't bought any cows or horses but I'm presuming their hooves never need to be reshod\n- basic economics of farming are entirely upside-down, e.g. $3000 or so for a truck and trailer but chickens sell for $60 and eggs for $3 apiece\n- the setting is American-ish, sure, but then why is fuel sold in litres?\n- the driving model is just bad. all the vehicles feel like driving toy cars with no real weight to them, they're all indestructible (as are the wild deer lol), and the chase camera is awful when driving with a trailer - it insists on placing itself between trailer and vehicle, making it impossible to see the road ahead. Cockpit view is also pretty useless for situation awareness.\n\nIt's cute, and there's potential for a nuanced game with real depth that would be deserving of the title 'Simulator', but it's ultimately unsatisfying. Give it a go if it's 80% or more off, otherwise I'd avoid.",

Let me tell you this game is janky and a mess I waited a year to make this review this game has not resolved any issues its the same game stop making positive reviews of optimism the developers have made it clear they wont be fixing any issues with the game mechanics they would rather squeeze in new content that makes no sense. \n\nTLDR:\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME AT ALL COST IT IS TERRIBLE!!!!",

The graphics and movement are very choppy and it makes it unenjoyable to play.  I also would love to see some realism added to the game such as chopping trees, milling them, turning them into lumber, and everything else made more realistic.  The game itself is unrealistic and that defeats the whole purpose of me wanting to buy it.  The hardware store has like 30 items total.  My recommendations would be to make the graphics look less like a roblox game, include way more realism into all aspects of the game; milling your own lumber, processing animals, and every other aspect of ranching.  \n\nI think this game could have a lot of potential, however it just needs way too much work still.  I would not recommend this game.",
