Sinking hundreds of hours into Cookie Clicker is almost effortless because it’s just that addictive. You click the cookie, buy upgrades, repeat — and suddenly you’re training a dragon, taking out loans, pulling off absolutely wild combos (which are basically the only way to progress), racking up 20 achievements at once, and before you know it, you’re 90% through the game.\r\n\r\nI’ve had a broken foot this past week, and Cookie Clicker has basically become my entire life — and honestly, I’m not complaining. Please buy this game. I grabbed it on sale, but even at full price, five bucks is nothing for the sheer amount of joy you’ll get out of it.",

You don’t know why you’re still clicking. You just know you need more cookies.\n\nIt’s simple, addictive, and weirdly soothing. The numbers get stupidly big, the upgrades get funnier, and before you realize it, you’ve spent hours optimizing the production output of digital biscuits.\n\nThere’s no losing, no pressure just progress, cookies, and the creeping realization you might actually be enjoying a spreadsheet.\n\nRecommended for anyone who likes idle games, watching numbers explode, or falling into an addictive cookie cult with no intention of leaving.",

      "review": "[b]Strong thumbs up[/b]. It’s easy to look at incremental games and think there’s no real value in them, because they seem completely mechanically uninvolved. I was willing to give [i]Cookie Clicker[/i] a chance, a glance for curiosity, given its posterity- but for years, I absolutely assumed it would bounce off me. Sure- there’s an initial rush from the sheer stimulation and sure, I have an intrinsic motivation to see what’s next, wether or not I’ll even get anything from it- but surely these materials and numbers would also stop meaning something at some point…\n\nYou know. Like unchecked capital, excess greed and the idea of infinite growth. That’s what [i]Cookie Clicker[/i] is actually about.\n\nThe game has some strategy, strange as that sounds, but most of it is waiting. It’s a slow game! Look at Sugar Lumps and you’ll see that [i]Cookie Clicker[/i] withholds minigames for an entire day. Flip through its achievements and you’ll find several that rely on total chance. This game indirectly mocks you for spending your time on it. Progress slows exponentially as you gain Prestige, eventually becoming reliant on luck-based combos. Just gotta spend more time for that next goal- once you do, congratulations, you get a little icon or some higher numbers. Then you sit down, look at yourself, wonder why and decide you’re not done yet.\n\nIt’s vapid, but isn’t that part of the point too? One thing that makes [i]Cookie Clicker[/i] such a great critique of unchecked growth is that it’s inherently a wasteful game. I guess I don’t like that I’m wasting real-life resources on running this, but honestly, being able to spend time on this means I must have some freedom of vanity and some free time afforded to me. At least I have a little comfort in that.\n\nIs that how every day feels for people that never have to worry about affording a single thing in their lives? I’m not trying to imply wastefulness in real life is good, but wrapping that up and presenting it in a game like [i]Cookie Clicker[/i] is fun, actually. It’s fun how this game goes from the humble grandmother to the complete destruction of reality, but it’s also just fun to laugh at myself wrapped up in it.\n\nThe implied destruction isn’t relegated to background lore or flavor. You can easily ignore in-game headlines about the planet becoming hollowed out or elder gods visiting for cookies, since early in the game, those seem completely offhanded. It would be a lot harder not to notice how so many of the buildings are conceptualised around the destruction of reality for the sake of more dough. Or the eventual uprising of overworked grandmas. Or the Ascension mechanic, where you just abandon an entire universe for profit. The game’s final building is the crown jewel of its commentary, since it points back at the player and their entire experience with the game.\n\nThere’s a lot of waste- solely for the sake of profit, for people who don’t need that, by their own hand- on Earth. [i]Cookie Clicker[/i] is basically a joke about that tragedy. Even the hundreds of upgrades reinforce that, with surprisingly lengthy and thoughtful descriptions and concepts. It’s one thing to be critical of oligarchy, another to take that critique so far, to have it be this entertaining and deeply pertinent.",

One cookie. Infinite **numbers that should not exist**.\n* Upgrades escalate from “cursor clicks more” to “summon eldritch grandmas from the cookie dimension.” Totally normal progression.\n* Buildings: farms, factories, banks, temples, time machines, antimatter condensers, and other things definitely used in bakeries.\n* Prestige system: reset everything, get heavenly chips, and do it all *again* but faster because you’ve decided inner peace is overrated.\n* The stock market minigame, sugar lumps, seasons, golden cookies, wrinklers… this “idle” game has more systems than most MMOs.\n\n---\n\n### Cons\n\n* “I’ll just check my bakery” has the same energy as “I’ll just check one more YouTube video.”\n* The numbers stop meaning anything after a while. You’ll casually say things like “I’m only at 4.2 undecillion, kinda slow today.”\n* Steam will report 500+ hours and you’ll have to explain that “I wasn’t really playing” to people who absolutely do not believe you.\n* The game will keep running while you sleep, and you *will* think about that.\n\n---\n\n### Peak Cookie Moments\n\n* Clicking a golden cookie, getting Frenzy + Lucky, and experiencing a brief religious awakening.\n* Realizing your top producers are now a coven of horrifying grandmas and deciding not to think about it too hard.\n* Staring at the screen, waiting for the stock market to hit “massive profit” like it’s your actual retirement plan.\n* Finally resetting for prestige and feeling physical pain as your empire vanishes for a 3% boost. And then doing it again. Willingly.\n\n---\n\n10/10\nNot a game. A lifestyle. A background process for your soul.\n\nWould once again open it “just to idle,” come back three days later with 40 time machines and a mild addiction to brown circles.",

      "review": "Well, instead of reviewing this as an idle game, \nI present to you: Review from a new player who used Brute Force to Speedrun the game.\n\n7/10, surprisingly fun and in-depth to figure out how. Not leaving a review, instead I'll just talk about how:\n\nPreview\n- \"\"Completion point\"\" is when mainstream progression is done* (u'll see how I define this later on), and only very grindy task remain ie. mostly achievements.\n- A notable portion of the game won't be covered due to \"Sugar Lumps\", items that require 24hrs/unit and can't be bypassed.\n- Using everything at disposal to cut corners except directly editing cookie numbers ie. Mods like Autoclicker, AutoCalculators (You'll find out it's manditory to even attempt this)\n- You can do it under 24hrs, but you need to tend to it most of the day.\n- No online guides AFAIK (that's what makes it fun)\n\nPreface:\n1. Use Web AI for anything you don't know- it's your best friend. Don't use wiki or YT, they are all terrible.\n2. Before the game even starts: Option->Mods->Manage Mods->Open Workshop-> Subscribe to:\n- CCSE (Mod enabler)\n- Fortune Helper (Autoclicker)\n- Cookie Monster (Statistics)\n- Download OP Autoclicker on any Browser\nRelaunch game, go tinker with new settings.\nIf possible replace Fortune helper with Cookie Assistant, but it's bugged at time of writing. \n\nFirst run:\nJust play. \n- Buy blue/green items coded by Cookie Monster on cd. Stalling progression is very bad and matters much in this game as new items significantly boost production. It wastes a lot of time.\n- Ascend at 365 Heavenly Chips\n- Purchase everything in \"Ascension 1\" on wiki\nProgression is hardlocked at a certain point, buildings cost too much for too little return. Thus game forces you to restart (\"Ascend\") for new buy upgrades (Currency is \"Heavenly Chips\").\n365 is the exact number to purchase all tier1 unlocks. Nothing in tier2 is purchase as the amount is impossible to reach first run.\n\n2nd-3rd:\nRinse repeat. \n- Ignore the Grandmapocalypse, it's good for you (with Fortune Helper mod.)\n- Max everything in winter season, and valentine season.\n- Set Krumblor on Dragonflight and Business's season to minmax golden cookie combos\n- Ascend the moment you stop seeing big progress.\nYou can brute force to end of buildings like this.\n\nTowards the end of brute-forcing ascensions you can set Krumblor to Dragon Orbs to force golden cookies, but without sugar lumps you can't produce enough for the end-game.\n\nEnd of first 24hrs:\n- When sugar lump is ripe, Options->General->Export Save\nCHECK you copied all the text (due character copy limit)\n- Harvest, if you don't get Golden Sugar Lump (x7 normal amt.), Import Save, rinse repeat. \nIt has 7% chance to drop.\nThis is called \"save scumming\" (aka. abusing last save point). \nI messed up by only copying the first few text lines due to copy limit and can't return point. I have to wait another 24hrs just to access the remaining 'game content' and calling it quits. \n\nThe rest:\n- Just google AI what to spend the 7x amt. on, the 4 basic unlocks.\n- Max out farm to get sugar lumps on cd.\nThe farm minigame is like 10pages of tutorial that you actually need to read to gl\nMost of the 'midgame' content is actually locked behind here, summon golden cookies and farming sugar lumps to increase production. That is unless, of course, if you didn't brute force it with raw Prestige Levels from ascension runs. (and using mods, mainly autoclicker).\n\nThis is by no means 'the end of the game'. But you're more or less there, less AFking for 1wk for sugar lumps for the rest (which would probably take half a day to finish).\n\nWill update if I ever return to collect the sugar lumps\nedit: yeah, it's impossible. The very last ascension unlocks require sugar lumps to both enable enough heavenly chips and sugar lumps themselves to unlock, 1,355 total. Even with every possible tactic this would take weeks. For semi-serious probably months. For casuals years. Sad.",
