We all unanimously agree that this is hands down the best digital version.  Pogo had a good one for awhile on their website, but this is a lot easier and smoother to connect to with the cross platforms.  Buying the 'premium' version to play unlimited matches is not a lot imo for the quality you get and ongoing support.  That said, I don't advise buying the map packs.  I had initially got into this on the mobile.  Later on I began playing on my MacBook.  I took a hiatus for a few years and when I came back I noticed MANY of the map backs I bought, vanished.  It's wild that I would have to spend over $100 to get every single current map pack knowing that some may disappear for good after I buy them.  The rewards for leveling up are a joke as well.  There are some levels where the developers don't give you anything.  And when you do get in game tokens for leveling up, it's very small.  That said, at least none of the purchases can help you win.  All DLC is purely cosmetic and you don't need the map packs to play with someone who has them.  You only need them to host or practice on your own with bots.",

The overall experience is smooth, the visuals are clean, and the matchmaking is surprisingly quick most of the time.\r\n\r\nThe game nails that “one-more-turn” feeling, especially when you’re locked in a tense back-and-forth with another player over a continent. The animated dice rolls and attack sequences add some excitement without dragging the match out too long.\r\n\r\nThat said, the RNG can feel a bit brutal at times, and some matches really come down to lucky rolls rather than strategy. A few UI elements also feel slightly outdated, but nothing major that ruins the experience.\r\n\r\nIf you’re into strategy games or you just enjoy the original RISK, this is definitely worth jumping into. Easy to pick up, fun with friends, and overall a solid way to scratch that competitive itch.",

Разнообразие карт и правил, включая классический RISK, Capitals и другие, делает геймплей реиграбельным и увлекательным.\n\nХотя иногда встречаются случаи неравномерного распределения войск в начале игры, что может дать одним игрокам существенное преимущество, в целом баланс достаточно хороший. Интерфейс интуитивно понятный, а графика приятная глазу, хотя и без особых изысков.\n\nИгра требует стратегического мышления, планирования и умения адаптироваться к изменяющимся обстоятельствам. Победа зависит не только от удачи, но и от способности заключать союзы, вовремя наносить удары и обманывать противников. Это отличный способ проверить свои стратегические навыки и приятно провести время. Рекомендую всем любителям настольных стратегий!",

Lovable digital Risk game that players hadn't quit or stalling or you would have seen more less suicidial and other abusrd moves so players were more enthusiast to play on the other hand since a long time so stupid players raming around. They going after one mistake move, or even after one round if they didn't succeded to be victorious in enviroment that suggest be competitive with another player and all you have to do wait they round be end even if they surrendered or quit by not wawing white flag. \r\nIt's always nice to have that simple strategic small sized game on corner and they add new nice maps but players sectiong go downard at not limeted speed and game technicals insisted to not solve this stupidity.",

This company openly acknowledges it's shady behaviour, too, on their discord server.  They regularly wrongly ban players who spend real money on the game, hoping it causes them to create a new account to re-purchased in-game content.  They don't even deny their methods.  Lawyers need to get involved.  As bad as that is, the players are some of the worst.  Cheaters are everywhere and nothing is done about it.  As far as I can tell, only legit players are punished.  Truly evil.  If not for cheaters, you have cowards who only accept new members (i.e., newbs) into their lobbies for easy wins.  \r\n\r\nSo., in summary: you rarely find a legitimate game, due to rampant cheating and cowards, and the game developers openly admit they ban you without cause, and they refuse to change their ways. AVOID THIS GAME!!!  I hope a lawyer see's this and sues them.",
