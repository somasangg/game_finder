      "review": "Back 4 Blood is visually great and the gunplay feels modern. But the problem is, it doesn’t understand what made Left 4 Dead 2 unforgettable.\n\nLeft 4 Dead 2 is simple yet satisfying. Just pick a gun, survive the chaos, work together, move to the safe room.\n\nBack 4 Blood added too many systems that made the experience feel like a chore. Cards, builds, supply points, grinding. And instead of focusing on pure teamwork and unpredictable panic moments, they turned it into a meta progression shooter.\n\nThe zombies also don’t feel as iconic or scary as the Special Infected we faced in Left 4 Dead 2. The AI Director in Back 4 Blood often feels scripted, while Left 4 Dead 2’s chaos felt natural and unexpected.\n\nMany Left 4 Dead 2 players wanted a modern spiritual sequel, but what we got felt like a live service game forced to be “more complicated” than it needed to be.\n\nIn the end, Back 4 Blood is not a BAD game, but it never captured the soul and simplicity that made Left 4 Dead 2 legendary, which is why a lot of Left 4 Dead 2 players hated it and went back to the classic.\n\nIf you’re a big Left 4 Dead 2 fan, you might miss the classic feel, but Back 4 Blood is still worth trying if you want a fresh take on co-op zombie action. Just don’t expect it to be exactly like Left 4 Dead 2. It’s different, but still fun in its own way.",

The card system and progression are cool ideas, yet they sometimes get in the way more than they help. As a standalone game, it’s absolutely enjoyable and has lots of potential, but it still feels like there’s a piece of its soul missing.",

But mainly these rumors are people who grew up with \"Left 4 Dead\" and is jealous or not happy how this game is a remake version. I will tell you this, I was born in the 90's and also a \"Left 4 Dead\" player. I honestly never liked the original because it was dull, repetitive, and frustrating how the tank and tongue zombie easily kill the team and you lose frequently. \n\nThis game is very different. It seems a lot easier, more enjoyable to win. They are also creative. A lot of variety of weapons. I remember \"Left 4 Dead\" having so little weapons to choose from. Definitely a huge upgrade. There's also other things like traps, baits, different healing items, variety of grenades. CARDS! Perks and buffs. SKINS! That you can easily unlock just for playing. Cool different scenarios and backgrounds, places to explore. Specific Zombie scare tactic sound effects like the Fleshpound and Scrake in Killing Floor 2. EIGHT playable characters with more skins instead of the standard 4. The list goes on and on. This game is absolutely amazing! Highly recommended if you love zombie shooting games. I will be honest though, the game can feel repetitive but who cares. Nothing more than \"Hunting\" zombies for fun.\n\nLike omg, half of ya'll hate this game just because you're a \"Left 4 Dead\" fan but wow. You gotta actually try it and test it out yourself before assuming or judging.",

      "review": "This is one of the most misunderstood games in my library. This game was criticized and hated upon release, and to be fair it was a pretty rough start. I have asked many friends of mine to try this game many many times over the past few years, and nearly everyone single one of them told me no and wen't on a hate speech about this game calling it trash or saying they wouldn't even bother with it. \nI have gotten over 5 friends the past year to play it now, most of them I had to gift the game to, and EVERY single one of them now greatly enjoys the game. \nThe real problem is expectations. HOW can you possibly beat left for dead two? How could you possibly satisfy fans of the legendary Left for Dead 2 who have been patiently waiting for a third game for over a decade. You can't. \nThat being said, this game had major major issues at launch. No solo offline mode with consistent progress, bugs, the card system was a mess, balancing was all over the place. But after over a year of updates, and content drops, this game is DAMN GOOD now, and its a shame the reputation never recovered. \nUnderneath the slow introduction of the game, and poorly explained mechanics, is a true gem of smart intense gameplay. The games difficulty SPIKES from each difficulty. Recruit is like left for dead, its stupid easy, and if you die you really messed up. THEN veteran requires team work, a well put together build, and smart decisions to survive. This game thrives on veteran, the difficulty forces you to pay attention, and coordinate everything with your team, but still easy enough to enjoy slaughtering the undead.\nNIGHTMARE mode is like Left for dead RANKED. You have to dedicate builds to roles, and every decision you make as a team can make or break your run. \nHERE IS THE BIG ISSUE, AND MY ONLY REAL COMPLAINT ABOUT THE GAME DESIGN- You HAVE to grind recruit mode for Supply points at the start so you can unlock cards. You have to play around 4-6 hours at minimum of the game to unlock cards to be able to play Veteran mode, and around 8-10 for nightmare. You cannot beat higher difficulty off pure game skill alone, so you are forced into recruit. This is frustrating because the best thing in my opinion in this game, is developing the perfect strategy with your friends, and you can't really experience that at first- and with a game most of the time I am trying to convince my friends to try, its hard to get them to stick around for over 5 hours of gameplay to get the good stuff. \nCards are basically Perks, from increased Ammo, to Weakspot damage, to revive speed, ETC. You get 15 cards, so each member of the team has to be smart with them, while you do runs you can find other cards and add them ontop of your build as well. \nThe gun play is solid with many weapon types, enemy design is good (None of the specials are as memorable as L4D2, but there is 3 times as many, and they do prompt a strong challenge), and map design is just as good as L4D2.\nI think the real reason this game isn't as big is because we never got Workshop support. WHY. WHY. WHY.\nOne of the best parts of Left for dead is the endless replay ability with workshop content.\nHighly recommend this game, just give it some time. It goes on sale quite often for pennies on the dollar, and you can find a CD key for under 3 dollars online usually.",

      "review": "Back 4 Blood is a cooperative first-person shooter developed by Turtle Rock Studios and released in 2021. Designed as a spiritual successor to Left 4 Dead, it features four-player co-op missions against hordes of infected enemies known as the Ridden. While it inherits the cooperative foundation of its predecessor, it introduces new mechanics like deck-building and character classes to modernize the formula.\n\nGameplay focuses on team coordination and survival through linear missions filled with ambushes, special enemy types, and resource management. Each player chooses a “Cleaner,” a character with unique passive bonuses and abilities that influence team composition. Combat feels tight and impactful, with responsive gunplay and a strong sense of weight in weapons. Coordination is crucial—solo play is possible but less rewarding.\n\nThe card system is the main innovation. Before each run, players build decks that provide gameplay modifiers such as stamina boosts, reload speed, or extra health. These cards create strategic variety and replay value, allowing for different team builds and approaches. However, the system can also feel unnecessarily complex for casual players, occasionally slowing down pacing between missions.\n\nEnemy variety is solid. Standard Ridden rush in swarms, while “Special Ridden” like Tallboys, Stingers, and Reekers force the team to adapt and communicate. The director-style AI ensures that each match feels slightly different, adjusting enemy density and item placement dynamically. Despite this, mission structure can become repetitive over time.\n\nVisually, Back 4 Blood uses Unreal Engine 4 to deliver detailed environments and smooth performance. Lighting, weather effects, and gore are well-rendered, though level design tends to favor function over creativity. The sound design is excellent—gunfire, enemy cues, and voice chatter provide clear feedback and tension during intense moments.\n\nOnline performance and cross-play support are generally stable, but early balance issues and overly punishing difficulty drew criticism at launch. Turtle Rock’s post-release patches improved accessibility, enemy tuning, and progression pacing, making the experience more manageable and enjoyable for mixed-skill groups.\n\nIn summary, Back 4 Blood successfully revives the cooperative zombie-shooter genre with modern mechanics and strong technical polish. It doesn’t fully recapture the simplicity and charm of Left 4 Dead, but its depth, customization, and replay value make it a capable evolution. For players seeking coordinated, fast-paced survival with friends, it delivers solid teamwork-driven action despite uneven pacing and design quirks.",

In contrast, games like Gunfire Reborn and other hero shooters often feel like they devolve into a mad sprint towards the level end as everyone is trying to get the highest damage numbers.\n\nIn B4B, sharing your resources, playing to your strengths, and communicating fully is the key to victory; a play style that I greatly appreciate.\n\nI'd highly recommend this game to anyone interested, but would note that it frequently goes on sale for ~90% off. If you're able to snag it for cheap, it'll be well worth your time, whether you're racking up 10 or 1k+ hours.",

Was expecting much worse but had a lot of fun in the end.\n\nTurtles wanted to make L4D3 for so long - but they also wanted to get away from Valve as much as possible\nSo they renamed Infected into Ridden\nCharger is now Tallboy\nTank is now Breaker\nSpitter is now Stinger\nHunter is now Stalker\nOgre is just Bigger Tank from Fan Maps of L4D\nAnd Witch was remade into Snitcher and Hag\n\nTbf, if they just made that - it would be completely okay. But noooo, they've added something else.\nAnother case of inventing a square for no reason when you already have a circle.\nSo what happened? Lets take a look.\n\n[h1]Unreal Engine 4[/h1]\n🟢Good choice for an engine. Considering how well UE4 handles random spawns (but the Director barely does anything)\nIt runs great, gives a great visuals\nBut uh....it looks generic still. It looks WAY better than I thought it would look.\nBut CGI Cutscenes are still whack tho\nAlso stutters and shader compilation curse. Deal with it\n\n[h1]Card System[/h1]\n🔴Yeah so one of the main reasons the game failed - is forced mechanic that makes people use whatever left from their brains - to build either completely broken card build and turn themselves into a living god...or fail the entire team.\nThe cards also affect the random factor on each run you start - and if it was only THAT - it would've been okay but the cards also affects stats - and they're crucial on hardest difficulties\n\nOther than that - its your standart Looter Horde Shooter(Yes, there are guns with quality levels) - with unique events in various levels. Such as - repairing defences. Rescuing innocent people. Holding out. Running around with quest items - the usual.\n\n[h1]The General is Good Guy[/h1]\n🟡Yeah... I was expecting one of the supporing characters to be a villain in the end but no. You're just a group of survivors who deal with a crisis situation in your group. You save people, find weapons, repell attacks and fight giant monsters - Thats kinda it. If you have DLCs - you're also have to deal with an Evil Cult that is behind all of this mess.\n\n[h1]Mid sound design[/h1]\n🟡Barely any music (not counting jukebox)\nAnd sound cues that will not help at all to understand what type of Special Ridden spawned just now\nMost of the weapon firing sounds are kinda bad too\n\n[h1]Great level design[/h1]\n🟢Its UE4 for you. While it looks generic - it still hella detailed (most of the times). Loved pretty much every level to play through.\n\n[h1]12 completely forgettable characters[/h1]\n🟡And also 4 types of special Ridden \nThey have mutation variations tho. \nAlso Cultists. But they still look kinda bland\nReminds me about Fireteam Elite - every enemy looks the same.\n\n[h1]Endless Replay Value because of the Random Factor[/h1]\n🟢Best part of the game - there are so many things that could change before run is started - its insane\nEach run - there's a different sets of mutations for common zombies, Specials, Bosses - environmental hazards - its just that good.\nA shame that aside from campaign - there's nothing to play anymore\nHive levels are looking the same\nRandom mode is just complete BS\nAnd Versus mode is just boring\n\n\nThere are also 2 Online Cheevos which can be annoying to do\nAnd No Hope Difficulty was tuned so hard because of the certain people - its just frustrating to deal with\nFinally, 53k kills are back - so have fun with that.\nIt took me about 50 hours (not counting 53k kills) to get most of the cheevos\n\n[h1]8/10 - Pretty good, Cards and No Hope were a mistake[/h1]\n💚Other than that - I dont understant what y'all been smoking - the game looks great. Its gory, bloody, fun and each run gives the same vibes as L4D back in the day.",

Sometimes you get a try hard player who can carry the team and you might be able to complete the campaign to unlock the next difficulty, but likely not. This game was certainly more fun when it launched and there was a higher player population.\n\nOn a different note, sometimes grinding through the intestinal dungeons of the worm caves and all the horror gore can just get like too much after a while. The visuals certainly can be disturbing at times. The characters sometimes crack jokes or drop one-liners which are funny the first 10 times, cause maybe you didn't quite hear it right, but get really annoying after that.\n\nOne of the best game modes in Left 4 Dead was the campaign based pvp. I truly loved that mode, this game doesn't have that- which is a huge miss, and the PvP that is there, isn't very fun.

There are apparently variants of each special infected, but you would have difficulty to tell that just from playing the game as they all look and sound extremely similar.\n\nI played about 8 hours on the non-steam version and tried again on Steam to see if something changed, but it's just the same mess that was released.",

      "review": "I have extremely mixed feelings towards Turtle Rock's spiritual successor to Left 4 Dead. I spent countless hours playing 1 & 2 on the Xbox 360, only to sink more hours as I finally got it on Steam and saw the amount of content on the Steam Workshop. I loved the atmosphere of the campaigns in both games and I loved the B-movie style they went for with the poster loading screens and end credit roll at the end of every campaign. The Special Infected became iconic with their designs, sounds, and a musical string dedicated to each of them, a fun indication to let you know which one spawned in. And I loved that all the characters were just regular everyday people.\n\nThe characters in this game are really generic with slight standouts but the Marvel writing dialogue doesn't do them any favours. Both L4D 1 & 2 take place 2 weeks after first infection so the outbreak is still a new thing and people are still trying to process the madness. B4B takes place one year after first infection which I still would say is new but the character's attitudes would tell you differently, like they've been doing this for years. L4D characters cracked jokes to ease tensions and keep some grip of sanity and high spirit in the madness. The B4B characters do it constantly and it really downplays the entire pandemic in my honest opinion, Holly has to be the best example of this. \n\nThe Ridden design is really generic as they've become more mutants than actual people because of the parasite, Devil Worm. I think they could of taken advantage of this if they did body horror designs with them. The same can be said with the Specials which could of heavily benefited from body horror designs to make them frightening and show how much the parasite has manipulated their bodies. Seriously out of all the Specials, screw the Sleeper Ridden, it's not a fun \"enemy\" as it hides on walls and pins you. It kills the pace of the game where you're always moving, especially backpedaling away from Ridden. Especially on harder difficulties, they are the worse. On Recruit they just pin you as an annoyance, however on Veteran and higher they now summon a horde every time you're pin and you'll grow irritated very quickly.\n\nThere is a total of 41 weapons in the game. 27 of them are primary firearms that range from assault rifle, shotguns, SMGs, LMGs, and snipers. There are 8 secondary firearms from pistols, a sawn-off, and a bow. There are 6 melee weapons that of course replace your secondary with bats, fire axes, machetes, hatchet, knife, and iron claws. There are 8 legendary weapons, they either being a gun or a melee weapons. B4B introduces a weapon attachment system with each weapon having three slots except for the legendary weapons as they can't be modified. Better sights, barrels, magazines, etc. Melee have better grips, better damage parts, etc. Not a bad selection however the weapon you currently have with attachments you like will only be kept through the current campaign. Upon starting the next campaign you're back to tier 1 weapons, whether you can find that same gun with the same attachments isn't certain, trying to creating a roguelike experience.\n\nThe Card system is a neat but gets dull real fast, especially the Corruption cards. There is 51 Corruption Cards related to enemies and they either:\n-Make them faster\n-Give them armor or an increased amount of armor\n-Add negative effects to their attacks or deaths, like exploding acid after they die.\n\nThere is 26 Corruption Cards related to giving playing negative attributes, whether it lowers your health, makes you walk slowly the more money you have in your inventory or having a hordes spawn on a fixed timer through the level.\n\nThe Active Card decks you can build to create different playstyle and benefits for yourself. A single person only has a 15 card limit with their being 151 total cards to use, and I get they do this because they want you to do online play and everyone has their own decks where as bots don't. However if you just wanna play with bots there is a handful of helpful mods to install. Such as a mod increasing the number of Active Cards in a deck, a mod that makes the AI of bots so much better that the harder difficulties are possible, and mods to lower the grind such as increasing the amount of rewards you receive. Rewards include weapon skins, character skins, useless display profile names and cards for players, and of course the Active Cards as they need to be unlocked before you can add them to your deck.\n\nNot worth full price. You maybe can get some entertainment out of it with friends but if you're looking to do solo download those mods I mentioned.",

I was there through the hype, the developer updates, the promises of “spiritual successor” glory, and what we got instead feels like a game that completely misunderstood what made Left 4 Dead magic in the first place.\n\nThe card system is the worst kind of gimmick. It’s convoluted, unnecessary, and somehow manages to make every run feel less fun. Instead of clean, skill-based progression, you’re buried in deck-building menus that have no place in a game about shooting zombies with your friends. Nobody ever asked for Slay the Spire: Undead Edition. \n(Well actually, that sounds sick, BUT THAT'S BESIDES THE POINT.  IT DOESN'T WORK FOR THIS GAME.)\n\nThe gunplay feels clunky, movement is stiff, and the special zombies, sorry, [i] “Ridden” [/i] lack personality and impact. Even the AI Director, once a genius system that made every Left 4 Dead match feel alive, is now an unbalanced mess that can’t decide if it wants to be too easy or unfairly punishing. The atmosphere, pacing, and flow are all off, like a cover band playing the right notes but missing the soul.\n\nAnd where’s the mod support? The versus mode? The charm? Gone. All sacrificed in favor of bloated systems and “live service” nonsense that nobody wanted. It’s painfully clear the devs were chasing trends instead of trusting the simple, perfect formula they helped create.\n\nAs a longtime fan and early supporter, this one stings. I wanted Back 4 Blood to be Left 4 Dead 3 in spirit. What we got was Left 4 Dead stripped of everything that made it timeless, replaced with a pile of half-baked ideas and soulless systems.\n\nVerdict:\nA tragic case of overthinking greatness. Back 4 Blood had the pedigree, the potential, and the fanbase, and wasted all three. 4/10.",

But ultimately there's too much going on in this game for it to work.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nWhat worked great about Left 4 Dead was that it allowed you to *breathe* - there are moments of quiet and fear that provide important contrast to the hordes, or allow you to hear the great sound design of the specials. This works great for a game about surviving a zombie apocalypse. Back 4 Blood discards all of this in favor of a constant stream of stimulation: gun COMPARISONS a la Borderlands, picking up GOLD to spend in SHOPS at each checkpoint, CARDS that change your game or playstyle, DECKS you build BEFORE you even play, CONSUMABLE cards you can APPLY before you play, RANDOM CARDS that appear on each map.\n\nIt's too much. None of these are bad ideas on their own, but together they're too much. I would have taken a Left 4 Dead where each character had a different ability / role - and no more. That alone would have been interesting. But the game loses the magic that the originals had because it bombards me with game mechanics that have no narrative basis in the world (why are there infinite supplies at each checkpoint? why do I need to pay money like it's a vending machine? why am I constantly stopping to compare guns while trying to move through a zombie-infested area? what even are CARDS?).\n\nAnd the cherry on top? The characters just... won't shut up. If you're going to make the characters this chatty, at least make them entertaining/interesting (see Vermintide 2 for how it should be done).",

      "review": "Too much working against this game:\n========\n--Bots--\n========\nBot teammates are very infantile. They can alert snitches, hordes of enemies, and set off environmental hazards by randomly throwing molotovs at cars and explosive barrels. Regardless of what gun they hold, they barely do any damage unless it is on an easy difficulty (at which point the game is more of a walking simulator). \n- Bots cannot take nor use legendary rated gear\n- Bots can take tool kits and then never use them\n- When bots die and another bot has a Defib, they will not revive anyone unless you stand over the body and spam Q (ping) for about a minute at which point they will finally give in and use the item.\n- Bots can hold on to medical accessories, but will rarely (if at all) use them, even if you are left with only a few points of health.\n- If you die on \"odd\" terrain such as on a car; on stairs; on a barrel; on a fence; or any other terrain that isnt an easy flat ground, bots will not pick you up or use a defib. At best they will just run in circles around you.\n- Bots can (and will) automatically take money, thus ruining the card \"Heads, you lose\" in which picking up copper can give you +5% damage for each copper pile or reset the effects you have gained thus far from the card.\n- Bots are not \"silent\" even in silent missions; they will see an enemy and immediately shoot at it, alerting all of the enemies in the area, even if you are sniping from a distance with a suppressor\n- For mission-critical items, a human player must carry them-- a bot will not pick them up (only exception being duffel bags which give a tiny cosmetic spray or profile icon when they carry it to the safe room)\n- The bots have no sense of \"cover\" in that they will face and shoot in one direction that they choose, and you're left with looking behind you constantly for random enemies spawning from the ground.\n- Bots can kill you if they throw a grenade at/near cars or explosives that you are near (and you cannot command them).\n- The card \"Down in Front\" which disables friendly fire damage is essential as bots WILL run directly in front of you while you are firing (including constantly with LMGs) and get mowed down. They also seem to have some kind of coding that makes them run directly in front of any minigun that you set up and operate so they die faster.\n- If a bot is near a bridge, they will fall off and die or be left hanging. If you are left hanging, they will \"attempt\" to pick you up like in L4D2 but in reality, they just run in front of you and let you die.\n\n============\n--Weapons--\n============\nSome of the gunplay is fun, but it feels like they are pushing for players to use either an LMG or shotgun. Every other gun comes nowhere near these two unless playing in a skilled 4-player co-op that values teamwork over screwing around.\nYou can also spend a large portion of a campaign upgrading one of your guns, only to have it outdone by a random gun lying around because it is a higher rarity (but same gun model and action).\nThe bow is just silly if you have the right deck for it (firing multiple arrows every second as though your traditional wooden bow is belt-fed with automatic firing).\nThe melee weapons, if you build your deck right, are insanely overpowered with the ability to heal on kill and grant yourself armor (although it can sometimes struggle with Ogres on the No Hope difficulty if earlygame.\n\n===========\n--Enemies--\n===========\n- All enemies can outrun you and attack while doing so. Getting hit significantly slows you down, meaning if your bot \"allies\" alert a horde or group of enemies, you will need to find a choke-point where enemies cannot spawn.\n- Enemy spawns are very silly in a negative way, kind of like No More Room in Hell way back in the early days of Steam zombie games. You can clear a room and ensure it has no entry points, leave it for a second, and then turn around and find it full of enemies again. Similarly, if you block your field of view by looking at a wall or walking indoors (in an outside map), enemies can spawn infinitely, with a stupid amount spawning during hordes\n- The \"Tallboy\"-style mutation is often the strongest, having incredibly high speed; the ability to grab you; an arm that takes out half your health in a single swing; and a very awkward weak point (its back shoulder where its oversized arm is, which it covers by holding behind its back). \n- Snitches (alerts the horde if not killed before it screams) can be set off by bots quietly (e.g. bots shoot at and kill the snitch, and a horde immediately follows but without the horde timer or scream). Additionally, theres sometimes a \"Corruption Card\" where even if you one-hit headshot a snitch from far away with a suppressed rifle, it will still alert the horde after it dies. \n\nThe names for all the zombies are also ridiculous and annoying to memorize when bots call them out:\nHocker, Stalker, Stinger; Reeker, Retch, Exploder, Shredder; Bruiser, Crusher, Tallboy, Ripper; Sentinel, Wailer, Swarmer, Lobber; Snitcher; Sleeper; Breaker; Hag; Ogre; Abomination; Harbinger. For common zombies (\"ridden\"), you have: Common, armored, blighted, charred, volatile, festering, and armored soldiers (SWAT/military gear where your .50 cal rifle turns into a .22lr and headshots are useless until you break the armor).\n\n=========\n--Cards--\n=========\nThe game uses a card-based upgrade system wherein after completing missions you gain supply points that can be spent on both permanent and burn cards. Burn cards are used one time only on the map that you select before starting the mission. If you select a burn card, you cannot unselect or change it; it auto-locks in, even if it was a misclick. If you try to save-scum it back (e.g. task kill before the mission starts), you just lose it.\n\nThe \"permanent\" cards are what you use before you start a mission. You can build a \"Deck\" with 15 cards, though, some of the cards are kind of necessary and waste slots (such as Down in Front to disable friendly fire while crouched so you dont slaughter all of your bot allies in a second of them walking in front of your barrel). There are a lot of varieties of card  types and special abilities they grant you, and it is painfully evident that card design was where the vast majority of the development of the game was focused on. So. Many. Cards. Yet, very few guns and basic QoL features (still no flashlights?)\n\nThere is far more that can be said about the wasted potential of this game such as the lack of map variety; the linear paths (some cars you can jump on, some you cant; some roofs will be invisible walls while some roofs will have a secret idol that gives an achievement). The game speaks for itself in these following points:\n- No mod support. Check out the interview with Matt O'Driscoll (lead producer at Turtle Rock Studios) where the following was asked by Liana:\n\n\"So back in the day, I used to be a part of the Left 4 Dead modding community and uh, my BEST memories were learning coding and learning how to mess around with game files and stuff. Do you... is B4B going to facilitate the modding community at all, with the online element and all or... or is it gonna... purely be... contained game files?\" \n\nMatt:\n\"Its contained at launch for sure. Yeah. We're not gonna have anything like that available then.\"\nLiana says under her breath \"...sad...\"\n\n- No proper flashlight support. From even when the game first launched, most if not all of the playerbase found that no buttons were assigned to a flashlight key in this VERY dark game. As it turns out, that is intentional-- the flashlight ONLY turns on in specific parts of certain maps where the devs have implemented a flashlight-friendly zone (kind of like a kill-zone for OOB, but intentional for flashlight \"mechanics\"). Theres much more, but I have hit the review character limit.",

Sometimes you get a try hard player who can carry the team and you might be able to complete the campaign to unlock the next difficulty, but likely not. This game was certainly more fun when it launched and there was a higher player population.\n\nOn a different note, sometimes grinding through the intestinal dungeons of the worm caves and all the horror gore can just get like too much after a while. The visuals certainly can be disturbing at times. The characters sometimes crack jokes or drop one-liners which are funny the first 10 times, cause maybe you didn't quite hear it right, but get really annoying after that.\n\nOne of the best game modes in Left 4 Dead was the campaign based pvp.

The game has a great emphasize on builds instead of teamwork. In higher difficulties, if the game decides to spawn a boss right out the gate before you get the chance to collect your deck, that round is basically done. This is the reason why I decided to stop playing B4B. And the grinding part is also true for games nowadays. They add complicated systems, then make you grind for the upgrades, artifically pumping up your game time. People stay for the fun, not for the grind.

      "review": "I came with low expectations: I knew this wouldn't be a a worthy sequel to Left 4 Dead 2, given how much video game standards have changed since 2009. Still, I'm seeing several faults that make me unable to enjoy this complex mess of a game.\n\nBack 4 Blood feels completely detached from an action-horror standpoint, because as much as I support being able to change your character's aspect and weapon loadout, you're constantly depending on this bloated virtual economy where you spend money on the distracting card system (having multiple bonuses tied to your character based on the cards you've equipped), healing your character and giving them a temporary shield, even refilling your ammo with a single press of a button: it makes the survival aspects meaningless. Besides, it feels ridiculous, since I was so accustomed to the more immersive format of Left 4 Dead where you're not constantly seeing heaps of coins or purchasable items in the middle of a level, which removes all immersion for me.\n\nAmong other cons, I fail to see any kind of charisma or \"genius\" factor in the characters, because despite being a dozen of them they never come close to being likeable or interacting meaningfully between them (save the cutscenes), which feels like they threw away this fantastic concept they had with Left4Dead 1 & 2 where you didn't need a long introductory cinematic, because the dialogues happened naturally between the four named protagonists as you played the maps, and this organic narrative is now long gone with Back 4 Blood.\n\nAnd speaking of cinematics: a little exaggerated, and unnecessary. They don't drag on for too long, but feel like padding nevertheless. Had those been handled in a more natural way I wouldn't want to hit the \"SKIP\" key as soon as I see the option on-screen.\n\nThe \"hub\" military base where you stop by before and after every act of the game does feel like a good idea on paper, but for me it's a bland place I don't really need, in part because you can access all of the relevant \"weapon\", \"card\", and \"supply line\" menus just by pressing the TAB key, and for its unappealing layout: a smaller, more focused map would've been much better. The room you start in, during Act 1, seems like a better contender than this generic design we have in B4B.",

      "review": "I have extremely mixed feelings towards Turtle Rock's spiritual successor to Left 4 Dead. I spent countless hours playing 1 & 2 on the Xbox 360, only to sink more hours as I finally got it on Steam and saw the amount of content on the Steam Workshop. I loved the atmosphere of the campaigns in both games and I loved the B-movie style they went for with the poster loading screens and end credit roll at the end of every campaign. The Special Infected became iconic with their designs, sounds, and a musical string dedicated to each of them, a fun indication to let you know which one spawned in. And I loved that all the characters were just regular everyday people.\n\nThe characters in this game are really generic with slight standouts but the Marvel writing dialogue doesn't do them any favours. Both L4D 1 & 2 take place 2 weeks after first infection so the outbreak is still a new thing and people are still trying to process the madness. B4B takes place one year after first infection which I still would say is new but the character's attitudes would tell you differently, like they've been doing this for years. L4D characters cracked jokes to ease tensions and keep some grip of sanity and high spirit in the madness. The B4B characters do it constantly and it really downplays the entire pandemic in my honest opinion, Holly has to be the best example of this. \n\nThe Ridden design is really generic as they've become more mutants than actual people because of the parasite, Devil Worm. I think they could of taken advantage of this if they did body horror designs with them. The same can be said with the Specials which could of heavily benefited from body horror designs to make them frightening and show how much the parasite has manipulated their bodies. Seriously out of all the Specials, screw the Sleeper Ridden, it's not a fun \"enemy\" as it hides on walls and pins you. It kills the pace of the game where you're always moving, especially backpedaling away from Ridden. Especially on harder difficulties, they are the worse. On Recruit they just pin you as an annoyance, however on Veteran and higher they now summon a horde every time you're pin and you'll grow irritated very quickly.\n\nThere is a total of 41 weapons in the game. 27 of them are primary firearms that range from assault rifle, shotguns, SMGs, LMGs, and snipers. There are 8 secondary firearms from pistols, a sawn-off, and a bow. There are 6 melee weapons that of course replace your secondary with bats, fire axes, machetes, hatchet, knife, and iron claws. There are 8 legendary weapons, they either being a gun or a melee weapons. B4B introduces a weapon attachment system with each weapon having three slots except for the legendary weapons as they can't be modified. Better sights, barrels, magazines, etc. Melee have better grips, better damage parts, etc. Not a bad selection however the weapon you currently have with attachments you like will only be kept through the current campaign. Upon starting the next campaign you're back to tier 1 weapons, whether you can find that same gun with the same attachments isn't certain, trying to creating a roguelike experience.\n\nThe Card system is a neat but gets dull real fast, especially the Corruption cards. There is 51 Corruption Cards related to enemies and they either:\n-Make them faster\n-Give them armor or an increased amount of armor\n-Add negative effects to their attacks or deaths, like exploding acid after they die.\n\nThere is 26 Corruption Cards related to giving playing negative attributes, whether it lowers your health, makes you walk slowly the more money you have in your inventory or having a hordes spawn on a fixed timer through the level.\n\nThe Active Card decks you can build to create different playstyle and benefits for yourself. A single person only has a 15 card limit with their being 151 total cards to use, and I get they do this because they want you to do online play and everyone has their own decks where as bots don't. However if you just wanna play with bots there is a handful of helpful mods to install. Such as a mod increasing the number of Active Cards in a deck, a mod that makes the AI of bots so much better that the harder difficulties are possible, and mods to lower the grind such as increasing the amount of rewards you receive. Rewards include weapon skins, character skins, useless display profile names and cards for players, and of course the Active Cards as they need to be unlocked before you can add them to your deck.\n\nNot worth full price. You maybe can get some entertainment out of it with friends but if you're looking to do solo download those mods I mentioned.",

I was there through the hype, the developer updates, the promises of “spiritual successor” glory, and what we got instead feels like a game that completely misunderstood what made Left 4 Dead magic in the first place.\n\nThe card system is the worst kind of gimmick. It’s convoluted, unnecessary, and somehow manages to make every run feel less fun. Instead of clean, skill-based progression, you’re buried in deck-building menus that have no place in a game about shooting zombies with your friends. Nobody ever asked for Slay the Spire: Undead Edition. \n(Well actually, that sounds sick, BUT THAT'S BESIDES THE POINT.  IT DOESN'T WORK FOR THIS GAME.)\n\nThe gunplay feels clunky, movement is stiff, and the special zombies, sorry, [i] “Ridden” [/i] lack personality and impact. Even the AI Director, once a genius system that made every Left 4 Dead match feel alive, is now an unbalanced mess that can’t decide if it wants to be too easy or unfairly punishing. The atmosphere, pacing, and flow are all off, like a cover band playing the right notes but missing the soul.\n\nAnd where’s the mod support? The versus mode? The charm? Gone. All sacrificed in favor of bloated systems and “live service” nonsense that nobody wanted. It’s painfully clear the devs were chasing trends instead of trusting the simple, perfect formula they helped create.\n\nAs a longtime fan and early supporter, this one stings. I wanted Back 4 Blood to be Left 4 Dead 3 in spirit. What we got was Left 4 Dead stripped of everything that made it timeless, replaced with a pile of half-baked ideas and soulless systems.\n\nVerdict:\nA tragic case of overthinking greatness.
