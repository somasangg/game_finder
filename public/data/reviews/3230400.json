      "review": "I haven't played Madden in decades. So for me, this game is an incredible improvement over what I remember. It scratches that itch to play a football franchise simulator. Madden is so realistic at times, my wife actually watched part of the \"Super Bowl\" last year (M25) without realizing it was a game, lol. Tbf she's not a football person.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note, I don't play multiplayer. I'm also not good at football games, so I let the AI do a lot for me. My experience is tailored to my wants, and I can totally see a more hardcore player hating things that don't even register with me. \r\n\r\nI have experienced some optimization issues with the game (well-known on the discussion boards.) My setup is a 5080RTX / Ryzen 9800 / 64 GB RAM; needless to say, I shouldn't have any issues running any game on the market on max settings. I followed some user's advice and hid on-screen notifications and that fixed the issue--so it is a M26 problem. \r\n\r\nLastly, I don't like the price or downloading third-party launchers. All games should be more affordable and not require you to download a launcher to play. These are minor complaints for me, but I make pretty good money. If I were a teen or less-fortunate person, $70 for a game would be pretty tough to attain.",

Everything is new, fun game, new graphics, new system, but of course ea has to make a problem that's never been a problem before. DEFENSE is horrible. I can't tell you how many games i have lost because a saftey or linebacker can't catch a pick or decide to swat the ball down. Trust me ea did good, it's actually possible to stop the run and glitched pass plays, blitzes arn't as bad. But please make the defense good again i don't need my oppenents getting bailed out because of some blown coverage. If you just fix the defense i think you have one of the best maddens since 2015, i see ea actually put effort into the game this time. I would say it's worth to buy just don't expect much. ALSO thank you for fixing the loading screen animations it actually looks cool and not like you spent 3 dollars making it.",

Its Madden.\nLooks like Madden, feels like Madden and does Madden things, \nNothing more, nothing less.\n\n\nI started with Madden 92 on my Sega Genesis 1991 and since then everyone has been always complaining that the new Madden is always only a roster and player update without anything new.\nBut just compare Madden 92 with 26, it improves slightly, but it does.\nSo, if you want technical improvements: Don´t by it every year.\n\nFor me, every 3 to 4 years a new Madden is ok. So you can feel the changes.\nEvery year one ore two little new features, every 3 a major one and every 3 to 5 years a little step fwd in graphics.\n\nBut if you need always new teams and players, better put away 5€ or $ every month, or wait for black friday week ;-).",

For a sports sim, the physics are pretty solid, some of the tackles can be a little wonky; it doesn't ruin the experience.

I don't play MUT or Online in Madden but I can say unequivocally that Madden 26 is a huge leap forward. Finally you can be a back up or get benched in Madden! It feels way more realistic. Having to manage your relationship with you HC, teammates, agent, fans, etc. Has made the game feel like you are actually \"playing\" in the NFL.

That also makes it impossible to call time outs after your plays and you constantly get delay of games, making the game unplayable. The game was stutterring constantly even before that issue presented itself, even on a good PC. Beyond that there has been zero innovation to the Madden Franchise honestly for like a decade - they just keep making us buy the same game every year to get the most up to date rosters. If you're going to make us rebuy the game year after year, please at least make sure the new version works at least as well as the last, or preferably better.",

I have some cracked players and if you tickle them, they fumble the football. I'm posting this trying to snap a 3 game losing streak to broken plays like mid blitz which glitches your offensive line out and leaves a man unblocked every play. The guy I was playing against threw 3 interceptions and I fumbled the ball, not joking, 7 times. Hold RB all you like, Patrick Surtain II with 67 power can apparently win the tackle and knock the football out of Omarion Hampton with 99 trucking. Oh Omarion Hampton also lost to Darien Porter who has fucking 61 power. Avoid the mistakes I made which I wish I hadn't for many years. Fuck EA, fuck Madden, fuck this game.",

Can’t play this game without launching with the EA app which would be fine but the EA app is unstable and constantly goes offline and guess what happens when it goes offline? If you said you lose all progress and have to start over then u are correct. So offline franchise mode is really the only mode you can play since mut and superstar are online only. What’s better than throwing for 400 yards and 5 tds and being 3 mins away from a 100% completion percentage game then getting kicked from the game back to the main menu because the ea app randomly decides to go offline? Nothing……absolutely nothing. Also during the madden special event u get a 3 day 5x xp token which is great right?

      "review": "This game looks like its from 2005 but only in the graphics department. EA really only just made this game worse than what it was a few years back. EA also only cares about console players not PC players and College Football 26 on PS5 is a million times better than this game. When it comes to sports games that have a monopoly on the market there is a pattern with them, they have good years and then bad years. EA's good years game recently is College Football 25 or 26, Madden 26 is in EA's bad years. After a long string of bad years a sports game company has to make a banger once and a while. For 2k that was NBA 2k16 for EA at the moment that's College Football, they just don't care about Madden at the moment. Also, why did they not get a big name announcer? If they wanted to actually make the game good they would contract with big name announcers like Tom Brady and actually make the graphics good and actually advertise the game. Instead they took the cheap, short term profit, way out this year and took the same game from before and put a different skin on it. And the skin they put looks even worse this time, plus what kind of song selection is this, barely any big name songs. This might be the first game I actually return on Steam, the graphics and UI, and music, and everything is just terrible. I understand how Sports games because they come out every year can't make bangers all the time and plus they need years where they sell really cheap quality games to make money so that once every 3 - 7 years they can put a huge budget and really put their heart into it to make an absolute banger of a game. Like NBA 2k 16 did by even getting a World Famous Director Spike Lee to direct the storyline of the game. That game was a beautiful game! And to be fair College Football 26 on PS5 is actually a really good game too, not as good as NBA 2k 16 in its prime but still a very good game. Just get College Football 26 if you have a PS5 or Xbox but if not then just reminisce in the bangers of Sports games of the past or wait eagerly for a banger of a sports game in the future!",
