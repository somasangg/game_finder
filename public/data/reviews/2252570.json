      "review": "Football Manager 2024 is a deep, numbers-and-narratives football management sim where your main job is to build a club identity and make a hundred small decisions that add up to results on the pitch. You pick a team, inherit its problems, and then live in a loop of scouting, planning, training, matchdays, and media scrutiny. The appeal is that it treats football like a living ecosystem: players develop, reputations shift, and your choices echo across seasons.\n\nTactics remain the heart of the experience, and FM24 gives you a robust toolbox to define how your team plays in and out of possession. You can shape roles, duties, pressing intensity, build-up patterns, and how aggressive your defensive line should be, then watch those ideas collide with real opponents who also adjust. When it clicks, it feels earned—like you solved a puzzle using both football logic and long-term planning.\n\nTransfers and squad-building are as addictive as ever, with negotiations that feel like a mix of poker and therapy. You’ll juggle budgets, promises, agent demands, work permits, registration rules, and board expectations while trying to keep the dressing room from erupting. Scouting and recruitment can be approached in a minimalist “trust my eyes” way or a data-heavy approach through reports and metrics, and FM24 supports either style without forcing you into one.\n\nMatchday presentation is designed to help you understand why things are happening, not just whether you’re winning. The 3D engine isn’t about arcade flair; it’s about clarity and patterns—where space opens, how your press triggers, and which matchups are being exploited. Highlights, analyst feedback, and in-game tweaks give you constant levers to pull, and the best matches are the ones where a small adjustment changes the whole flow.\n\nOff the pitch, FM24 leans into the “club manager” fantasy: training schedules, staff hires, development pathways, morale management, and youth integration all matter. Handling personalities is a quiet difficulty curve—some players thrive with tough love, others need a gentler touch, and team hierarchy can make or break a season. The game shines when you commit to a project over multiple years and watch your squad evolve into something you intentionally built.\n\nThat said, it’s not a game for people who want instant payoff or a tidy learning curve. Menus and systems can feel overwhelming at first, and the simulation’s realism sometimes means slow progress, ugly defeats, and board politics that frustrate even when your logic is sound. If you enjoy tinkering and storytelling, those “unfair” moments often become the most memorable parts of a save—but if you want quick matches and constant action, it can feel like work.\n\nOverall, Football Manager 2024 is best for players who love football strategy, long-term development, and the drama of managing humans as much as tactics. It’s a sandbox where you can roleplay a strict disciplinarian, a youth-first builder, or a transfer-market magician, then see how the world reacts. If you’re willing to learn its language and embrace the slow burn, it’s one of the most absorbing sports simulations you can play.",

Its probably the best iteration of the series.\n\nIve just started a new save starting in tier 12 of England in the North Devon League. My new quest is to start from the very bottom and go all the way to the top. All this is possible thanks to modders. \n\nI have a different skin, real team names fix, and a host of other mods that help me to become completely engrossed in the game.

      "review": "Gameplay – 8 \n\nThe only big change going into FM24 from FM23, was the new and improved set pieces. Which are much more detailed and intuitive, compared to previous iterations, although can still be exploited easily, but that’s up to the player. The rest of the game is practically the same as FM23, still good and easy to navigate (yes, this review is after playing FM26). I think it does its job of being an engaging, well-designed system, that at first can be daunting for newer players, but once you learn it, you'll be hooked and sink countless hours into the game.   \n\nVisuals and Art Style – 4 \n\nObviously, this is and unfortunately will always be the weakest part of Football Manager (or so I thought, “cough cough” FM26).  The players still plain looking and nothing like their real-life counterparts. Animations of the game are slightly improved, but not enough to make the experience feel completely new and refreshing. I'm not too fussed about how it looks, but to the average gamer who might come across FM, the game will look ugly in their eyes, and for good reason, graphically the game is more than a decade behind the industry standard at this point. \n\nAudio and Music – 5 \n\nAudio and music are whatever. Not relevant for a game like Football Manager. It’s a cool little gimmick having music at the start of Champions league and Europa league games, but this is very minor immersion and is not important overall. The sounds of the crowds are bit poor, but I have this switched off, as I found it to be more annoying and not relevant enough to the game itself. \n\nPerformance and Stability – 9 \n\nOn launch there were a few bugs, but SI did make quick work of it. As of 2025, there really are not many bugs. Luckily, I haven’t encountered any game breaking bugs either which is good. The main ones that are still present are small graphical bugs in the match engine, like occasionally a player phasing through another player, though this is as bad as it gets, and it is a very minor issue. \n\nReplayability – 9    \n\nThe biggest sale point of Football Manager is the replayability factor of the game. There are so many countless experiences you can have on the game, so many different countries and leagues to explore, all with their own unique and wacky rules (Uruguay, if you know you know) and competitions. You can play the game how you want, glory hunting, fallen giant, rising through the leagues etc. I’d personally recommend a build a nation save, very long and difficult, but can be rewarding if successful. I managed with an Austrian second division team, and in a twenty-year period, managed to become the number one club in Europe and take the Austrian league up to fifth in the coefficients.    \n\nSubjective Rating – 10 \n\nI’m reviewing this post release of FM26, so I'm more biased than ever towards fm24. However, I do believe this to be the perfected football manager game (on the old engine). Although recent Football managers have had a lack of new content and changes to its games, FM24 felt like a final au revoir before taking the big leap forward in FM26 with its new unity engine. Football Manager is one my favourite game series of all time, and will always have a place in my heart, and this game felt like the end of an era, which is why personally, it is a ten out of ten for me. \n\nOverall Score – 8",

      "review": "SI is basically a scammer company, and their products should be removed from Steam. Regarding this game:\n\n1- The game’s coding is fundamentally flawed. Training sessions that claim to improve certain attributes don’t actually train those attributes at all.\n\n2- SI is straight up lying about this. The real issue is that SI has been using the same underlying match and competition engine since FM10, and for 15 years they’ve been marketing it every year as a “brand new match engine.” FM is basically a 15 year-old, rotten, moldy apple being sold as “fresh and new.\n\n3- In most games with a meta, if you use the meta, you win; if you go against it, you struggle but still win. But FM isn’t like that. In FM, even top tier clubs like Man City or Real Madrid perform terribly with defensive tactics. The game forces you to play the meta if you want to succeed, any deviation from it is punished.\n\n4- Yes, physical strength matters in real football too, but if a physically strong player has poor passing, he’ll still make bad passes. In FM, though, a player with 1 Passing and 20 Pace can play like Modric or Messi, making brilliant key passes and through balls. That clearly shows attributes have little to no real effect on the match engine. The match outcomes are basically pre calculated using mathematical formulas. And the worst part? Those formulas are broken. Players with high Pace and Acceleration perform perfectly in every aspect (movement, shooting, passing) regardless of their other attributes.",

Its been getting worse for a decade, FM23 looked like a step back in the right direction, but the devs just have to try to be egotistical about everything and \"outsmart\" the playerbase by altering functions people had worked out and used for decades. \r\nYour tactics don't matter. Gegenpress + Inside Forwards + high physicals. You'll win every match. You have a style of play you like and want to implement? 0 - 0 every week. I'm heading back to FM13 or FM14. SI are as pathetic a company as modern day Creative Assembly, once great, now just garbage. Adieu, Miles. You always were the dumbest member of the team.",

      "review": "Title: Football Manager 2024 — A Masterclass in Disappointment\n\nIf Football Manager 2024 were a real football club, it would be bottom of the league, fans booing, and the manager sacked before Christmas.\n\nThe “improvements” they bragged about feel like someone just rearranged the menus and called it innovation. The match engine still looks like cardboard cutouts running through treacle, press conferences feel like reading a phone book, and your assistant manager is still about as helpful as a traffic cone.\n\nThe new “dynamic tactics” feature? Yeah, dynamically awful. Your star striker goes from Haaland to Sunday league after one bad training session, morale plummets if you blink the wrong way, and the board still demands you win the Champions League with a budget smaller than a League Two side’s sandwich fund.\n\nEvery year they promise realism, but if this is real management, then I’ll stick to managing my fantasy team on autopick.\n\nVerdict:\n\n2/10 for trying.\n\n+1 point for still letting me sign 16-year-olds with 5-star potential who’ll never develop.\n\n-50 for making me feel like I need therapy after every save file corruption.\n\nFinal Score: 3/10 — It’s not Football Manager, it’s Emotional Damage Simulator 2024.",
