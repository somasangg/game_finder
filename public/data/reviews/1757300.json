      "review": "This game is tons of fun. For an early access, it already has an incredible amount of polish. The game currently gives access to a handful of campaign missions, which give access to more types of missions and eventually cosmetic options.\n\nThere are a total of 9 main missions. They are structured in a roguelike format, you basically start with nothing (other than ship upgrades and stuff on your character) and progress along mission nodes that you can choose from. Loot mainly comes from completing the mission objective in those nodes, such as ship parts, credits are weapons. These vary from clearing an enemy outpost, stopping a jammer that's keeping you from jumping to the next node and such. Not much variety but still a good time. Mission and structural layouts are quite same-y, but it's not a big deal for now and the devs seem to be updating to keep the game fresh (Recently they added a vendor update and mutation modifiers to missions). At the end you complete the main mission and once that's done you can return to the hub. Wishing the devs luck for the future\n\nGameplay wise, everything feels solid. The weapon variety is currently lacking, only boasting a handful of weapons, that can range from mk0 to mk3 variants, which can either be purchased from the starting hub with credits, or found inside missions as random spawn or loot. The moment to moment gameplay however is very satisfying and barely any jank. Most importantly they have an unstuck button which so many EA games seem to avoid for some reason, which comes in handy sometimes when you get into weird out of bounds issues, but those aren't frequent.\n\nThe flight mechanics are nothing fancy, but as everything else fluid and smooth to control. You can pilot the ship, shoot out from tubes into space, repair ship core using kits, recharge shields (manually I might add, by crafting a shield kit, then going on the bridge outside and interacting with the shielding interfaces), maintain the ship (putting out fires, repairing faulty equipment and more). This all sounds like a lot, however once you get more familiar it feels very smooth going. If you've played Warframe's space combat, it's pretty much like that.\n\nThere is currently only server browsers for multiplayer purpose. I've mostly done solo, which has been a great experience too, you get a robot buddy (named buddy) who helps you out in ship combat as well as ground combat. He is VERY competent as an NPC which is refreshing. The multiplayer part of the game is also quite fun. However currently there seems to be some performance issues which hopefully will be addressed as time goes on.\n\nCurrently the game released with only chapter 1, and the story isn't all that grand, but intriguing enough to keep me wondering what the future holds for this game. The NPCs are all voice acted, and each of them are top tier and radiates personality. I hope they extend these interactions more in the future. I specially like the mad scientist guy named Vosk who basically sounds like Emperor Palpatine. \n\nThe game is looking very solid and I hope the devs keep on delivering with new content and story elements. Wishing them all the best and hope the community for this game grows",

It is very smooth and polished, has no noticeable lag in co op play and allows for multiple people to get together and play to their individual strengths as a team.  Prefer to pilot?  Or are you better as a turret gunner in 3rd person perspective?  Does being a ship engineer who runs around like the proverbial chicken with its' head cut off to repair, reload, and keep the ship from exploding sound good to you?  All of these options and more are at your fingertips and switching roles is effortless if you want to try something new.   The mission profiles are somewhat repetitive but I'll account for that by its' early access state.  QOL is already good and plenty of flavor can be had through the jukebox, wheel of fate, vendors and customization options that currently exist in the game.  All in all, a solid title that has a real chance to go somewhere once the developers finish it.  I recommend buying it now before the price inevitably goes up at full release.",

It's a mix of a serious game like Elite Dangerous with deadly dogfights where your lives are on the line., but leans into the goofy side of things whether it's hanging out with friends eating pizza (which can offer insane melee damage buffs) or shooting yourself out of a launch tube sea-of-thieves style. The grapnel points are a stroke of genius and I can confidently say that without them, I would have probably despised the game. They make boarding ships easy and clean, and add to the list of unique movement mechanics this game has.\n\nIf you buy this game, especially for multiplayer, with friends you will have a blast. But keep in mind this is not a finished game. Weapon and ship equipment options are relatively limited. The ship options are basically nonexistent. As of writing this, I have only encountered 4-5 types of ground enemies and 3 types of space enemies. However, this game has the potential to be my favorite game of all time.\n\nSingleplayer, you can have fun but it is reliant on your own FPS and Piloting skills. Multiplayer in groups of 3 or more is far more forgiving.\n\nFor $20, you will have fun with friends. In a year from now, I'll update my review based on how the development is going.

      "review": "Another case where I wish there was a 'mixed' option.\r\n\r\nI wanna make this clear, the game feels great to play. For a few hours, me and my friend had tonnes of fun. There's not much content, and what's there gets repetitive, but that's the nature of early access: it's a great starting point and I'm very happy to see what comes in the future. I really want this game to succeed, which is why I'm gonna go into a lot of detail on my thoughts for the improvements (this 'review' will be *very* long and is more for the devs than other potential players). I want to make clear I'm not going to be critical out of hate, but more out of love and out of foresight for how incredible this game could be if it gets things right.\r\n\r\nThere are a few niggles I think would really help the feel along, like inertia when moving through 0G (currently the ship controls are weird, and I think them being too responsive is to blame for that, also if you let go of movement keys both in ship and on foot in 0G, you just come to a stop very quickly which feels weird, unnatural and I would much prefer if you kept your momentum). This could be implemented in such a way as 'Space Engineers', where you have dampers you can turn on and off, which when on allow you to slowly come to a stop when you are not inputting movement, and would have the 'Jet Drive' slow down before stopping instead of just coming to an almost instant stop. The is would help emphasise the 'space' feel of the game, which currently feels more cosmetic than mechanically impactful. \r\n\r\nI also feel an air-dash would take the on-foot combat to the next level - it already feels pretty Doom-like (fast paced, close quarters combat feels very fun) and honing in on that aspect and developing it further would elevate an already fun combat system to be the 'star of the show'. You have a double jump, so an Air-Dash wouldn't break the established 'rules' - you'd be using the same propulsion that enables the double jump (which would assumedly be the dampers), just directing it to move the player in whatever direction the player is inputting instead of upwards. Could even have them be restricted by the same 'cool down', so can either do a double jump *or* an air dash. That would also emphasise that they use the same propulsion system and add a bit more connection between the setting and the mechanics.\r\n\r\nIn tune with these movement modifications, having some content that requires entry into, say, abandoned satellites that don't have active gravity, making the player explore it and do combat, objectives, etc in 0G. Maybe these places already exist, but in the time it took us to hit Lv 5, we didn't encounter any objective that wasn't either 'use the ship' or 'have some artificial gravity'. Maybe can scatter some sparse 'anchor points' that people can grapple to in these areas that can help with people who might get a little motion sick or head-spinney from 0G combat, so those players have an option to fight with boots on the ground, but the sparsity would encourage the 0G combat, and if they wanted to fight on a surface, they would need to search for an anchor point whist under fire from the enemy, adding some agency and active decision making during these combat encounters.\r\n\r\nI would very much recommend being able to adjust the difficulty of combat though (ship combat and on-foot combat should be adjustable separately), because as it stands it's very easy. Even just a simple 'player takes x% more damage' would do wonders. Don't necessarily make enemies tankier though, that doesn't fix the problem - the direction I'm coming from is the view that enemies should die quickly, but so should the player - emphasising risk vs rewards, especially in group combat as you would need to actively pay attention to the enemy types and fight around which ones are currently appearing. As it stands, if one of those 'explode-y drones' flies at me in combat, I know I can easily dodge it, so I don't need to pay attention to them, but what makes it worse is that even if I don't dodge it... It just breaks my shield and does 10 damage. Which is just pathetic. It's a completely ignorable enemy, just like the 'spider drones' (which have no range and I'm not sure I've ever been hurt by one, I hardly tend to notice they're there), and any enemy that's outside of shotgun range because they basically can't hit (nor kill) you unless you deliberately stand still. Again, in our time getting to Lv 5, neither me nor my friend ever died, except one time where my friend fell into a 'death pit' because he wasn't paying attention. Recharging shield is fine, that's not the problem, neither is the accuracy of the enemies (although I would increase the average accuracy, and also make it scale with the number of enemies shooting at the player, so more enemies means a bit less accuracy and/or lower fire rate, to ensure the player doesn't get overwhelmed but always feels on the edge of being overwhelmed). As it stands, enemies just don't feel dangerous, which is a horrible misplay for a game with such a solid core combat system. Having adjustable 'player damage taken' and maybe even adjustable 'enemy accuracy' would solve a lot of the core combat issues.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, here I have to get very negative. Still talking about the combat: the weapons suck ass...\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAfter spending like 2 hours writing this and trying to post it, Steam told me the review was 21,000 characters too long (yes I am a video essay enjoyer, how could you tell), so I'mma cut this here, and instead point towards the full review which I put in a PasteBin. Again, I wouldn't go to this effort if I didn't think this game was worth it so I hope the devs will consider reading further: https://pastebin.com/UALrkKe5",

From seeing how you interact with your ship's parts, the map, the NPCs. You will find those little animation quirks just like in Helldivers 2. The game's simple, very easy to grasp, you can feel the scale much like in No Mans Sky. The matches with other people feel inviting but railroaded and brief, much like doing anything in No Mans Sky or Call of Duty. There's moments you feel like you're in Deep Rock Galatic based on how you interact with things from your ship to grappling, polished and smooth. It's like Star Citizen in the sens of 3D mobility, moving on an X, Y, and Z plane can be extremely overwhelming and disorientating. I'm not sure why it is for me but that Z motion while moving X and or Y just never feels good, I can play VR for hours but the nano second I experience this on a monitor it's like being drunk instantly... Plenty of people love that feeling because it's more immersive, it's more engaging and realistic. I agree, I'll just be somewhere in the ship not helping with the dog fights.\n\nThe game I feel will have that endless replayability like Star Citizen and No Mans Sky, hopefully they decide to make every update free too, otherwise give us something like Helldivers 2 or Deep Rock Galatic. Time will tell.\n\nMore importantly... Do you like sci-fi? Do you like space dog fights? Do you enjoy good co-op games?\nDid you install the game already or is your internet as cheap as your wallet?",

I tried to play with a friend who had played a little before and the progress sharing became wonky. It was like you played together but with your own save. He had done some quests I hadnt and also some missions wich led to me accessing some contents i shouldnt be able to. Also since the only one who can swap and upgrade components i just earned more and more ingots with no way to use them while my friend needed to spen it all on uppgrades. It would be better if it was a system more like minecraft were you start a new world together and progress that way together through the quests. Hope the devs see this and make a solution. Otherwise than that though it was almost a flawless game. Loved it.",

Yes. \n\nThe concept of the game's mechanics is what holds it together. You will know if this is something you want to try or not just by reading the games description.\n\nWith that said, here's what I think urgently needs to change \n1. Inventory. This isn't lethal company. 4 slots is INCREDIBLY annoying and it's actually stunnning to me that they made the decision in the first place.\n2. Weapon recoil is all but random. Extremely annoying, just copy counterstrike \n3. Missions get extremely repetitive, quickly. You see the same zones OFTEN even after only a couple hours \n4. Progression and cosmetics is hollow\n5. More ships are needed ASAP. Your ship is the fantasy, only having one is lame\n6. More guns. More modules. This isn't optional if you want to be successful \n7. WAY MORE rogue elements, or none at all. \n8. Get rid of Meteor storms, chill tf out with the power grid disruptions. They are so common to the point it's not fun \n\nThis game is currently tied with Void Crew for my friend groups Pulsar: Lost colony replacement. However it has a LONG way to go before it's in a place to really pull good numbers down.

Fortunately, there are enough unique elements here for me to forgive it. I will silently hope it's an homage.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay at higher difficulties is fast-paced and engaging. The game rewards you for ensuring you have crew members in the right places at the right time. During combat, surplus crew can leave the ship and board enemy corvettes rather than sinking huge amounts of ammo into them. However, if you send everyone out and your ship takes damage, the pilot alone is usually unable to bring it back from the brink. This creates a highly enjoyable tension.\r\n\r\nGround combat works similarly; you are often required to storm enemy encampments or facilities. This also rewards teamplay and coordination—specifically ensuring the team packs the right gear and stays close together to reduce the risk of enemy flanks, which can be devastating.\r\n\r\nHowever, the fact that the game is in Early Access is very obvious. There are features missing all over the place, and there isn't enough content yet to keep it fun for long periods. Progressing in the story and unlocking new sections of the map feels grindy and unsatisfying.\r\n\r\nOverall, the game is fun. If you enjoy games like Void Crew, you will probably like this too.",

On the topic of movement, a mantle ability on by default could be beneficial.\r\n\r\n3. Ship combat can be greatly enhanced if the ship had more aerial moves like an actual dodge roll aka a barrel roll to dodge incoming missiles instead of just hitting boost to run away from them. More maneuverability has never been a bad thing.\r\n\r\n4. I think the ability to store Mk.3 weapons between runs on the ship would cut down on the clutter but You would also need to make them more rare or make the on-foot weapons customizable with unlocks found in missions.\r\n\r\n5. I would like to be able to enter the ship in the staging area. This one is for a few reasons: If I change a ship-module I need to arrange it on my power-wall before I take off because I will forget once its too late and I'm already in combat lol and potentially be able to ground test new weapons before I leave for a mission.\r\n\r\nShort wish-list from someone who has had way too much fun playing this with friends and would like to see this project flourish.",

      "review": "Sadly I cannot recommend this game just yet. This game has a massive identity crisis and with current content it's essentially an extended demo.\n\nFirst let me commend this game for what it does right:\n- combat is fun and satisfying, both when flying the ship and when on foot, there's issues with it like scarse ammo, harder difficulties throwing obscene amounts of enemies at you from buggy spawn points and heavy weapons being a waste of inventory slots (more on inventory slots in a second) but overall it's a pleasant experience with strong potential.\n- the current system of missions is quite varied with multiple random events, as you fly a lot of these missions it will need more than that but it's a good start\n- concept of ship being damaged and needing repairs while not new is quite fun and feels well executed\n- lore is good enough for a game of this type\n\nNow with the negatives:\n- The game struggles with identity regarding progression-based gameplay and rougelite approach. It asks you to sink in hours of gameplay for very little reward yet at the same time if you fail with your party - recovery will cost you dearly as weapons that you might have been collecting through 5-10 different missions simply disappear. Re-collecting them will take ages. Having both slow, incremental progression yet at the same time harsh punishments that can erase a whole day worth of progress feel like disrespect to player's time, especially since all missions depend only on the last stage, no matter how well you've done in prior stages. Pick one: either slow grindy progression with scaling difficulty and permanent progress, or fast non-permanent progression resetting every mission, with RNG based power upgrades that all disappear on failure.\n- Inventory slots are picked straight from Lethal Company-like extraction games, limited to 4 of whatever, however 1 slot is already permanent so essentially only 3 are left for the player. Given small amounts of ammunition and large amounts of enemies you usually end up taking 2 weapons extra leaving only one slot for any loot, making it really cumbersome and frustrating to play around.\n- There's currently very few quests in the game, they are also all very basic.\n- There’s an obvious opportunity for functional armor stats, but there's nothing there, it's just cosmetics. It feels like the devs intended to do more here but dropped it to push out Early Access.\n- Rewards from mission stages are so wildly inconsistent that difficulty levels barely matter. If you get the right artifacts, Hard missions become trivial. If you get nothing useful, even Easy becomes annoying without good guns.\n\nThere’s a good game buried in here, and the core mechanics have real promise. But right now the progression, inventory system, and lack of meaningful content hold it back badly. I’ll keep an eye on development, but I can’t recommend it yet.",

The concept is great, the gameplay is fun, but when you try to play with friends all the positives go out the window.  Me and my girlfriend played this during the open beta and we are both surprised to see that the beta was more stable than early access release.  I cannot keep track of how many times me and her have either lagged out of the match, have been booted out by the end loading screen where rewards are shown, or jumped over a gap to then get lagged into a death plane and lost all of our weapons.  weapons that are hard to come by, that cannot be stored unless in your hotbar (with limits of 3 items).  I am so very disappointed because the concept is something I have always wanted, its like a FPS Dark void with multiplayer, but the multiplayer aspect is thrown out the window with these issues, and the higher difficulty missions requires more than 1 player.  \n\nEdit \nThe developers say they are working on stability issues for the game, and that people within the same household have issues with connectivity.  hopefully by the end of the year the connection problems will improve, and if so I will change my opinion and highly recommend the game.",

While I agree players who decide to support the devs beyond the base price of the game should deserve something in return, paid cosmetics are in poor taste in my opinion. I feel like a \"Supporter\" title next to player names would be a better option, as currently it's just a straight up cosmetic microtransaction under a different guise. If the studio cannot sustain active development without relying on cosmetic microtransactions in an early access title, maybe they should revisit the base price of the game instead of dangling shiny FOMO cosmetics in front of players.\r\n\r\nFun concept, decent execution, questionable practices, let this one bake a while longer.",

      "review": "CONS!!! - You lose the vast majority of everything you collect after each mission.  You have 3 slots on your character to carry items. (technically 4 but one can not be changed).  EVERYTHING ELSE is deleted at the end of each mission.  You could have found some incredible weapons, tools, ship upgrades etc.  It doesn't matter, if you are not holding it in one of the 3 slots it is deleted at the end of the mission.\r\n\r\nSome upgrades to your ship do carry over, but they must be installed components.  However the (artifacts) which are installed and can provide significant buffs to your ship, are also deleted at the end of every mission.\r\n\r\nAlong with deleting the vast majority of all your cool loot, they also delete any addition a ship / shield repair kits you may have stocked up on, as well as the currency \"materia\" which is used to create them.  So you have to start every single mission with NOTHING but the clothes on your back and about 1/2 the installed components on your ship.  You could technically but materia canisters to take into a mission and have them at the beginning, but that is prohibitively expensive.\r\n\r\nYour shields do not auto recharge.  You actually have to build 4 components, exit the ship, do a space walk, and install these components on 4 different areas of the ship to recharge your shields.  Which is gone the first time a enemy gunship strafs your ship.  The method to repair the ship is similar but at least you dont have to leave the ship.  You build the components, which you can need up to 5 of to fully repair, and you have to stand in front of a console and insert them one at a time every 5 seconds or so.  IF you are playing solo, and piloting the ship in battle, then your robotic companion will build and use repair kits only when the ship is critically damaged (assuming you have meteria).  Your companion will not fully repair the ship and will never repair the shields.  So every time you have a small battle, you have to park the ship, get up, and go do choirs for 1 - 3 minutes before you dare get into another scrap.  This might happen 3 - 10 times during a single mission.  The game seems to be designed to require a crew of 4, where 1 is pilot, 2 gunners, and one is a base b'tch who has to spend what could be a fun game just running around constantly repairing the ship without even a view of the combat happening outside.\r\n\r\nEVEN THEN... the ability to build ammo resupply for the ship, or any repair components is severely limited by the RNG of \"materia\".  Which you can think of like a 3d printer cartridge.  Enemy ship randomly and very scarcely drop materia when they explode.  Then to actually get it you need to fly over to it.  A collector outside your ship picks it up, but is apparently incapable of routing it into the ship to be used.  So you have to park, get out of your seat, do another space walk to collect two separate containers.  Bring them inside, and put them into a recycling bin to actually get to use the materia.  Good luck if you are in battle, out of shield and ammo, and just need a smidgen to build bullets to finish off the last enemy.  You are going to be a sitting duck for a while while you get this sorted.  The game always only lets enough materia drop to barely get you to the next area, assuming you did everything right, and quickly dispatch your enemies before they do to much damage.  Its incredibly irritating.  It kinda feels like you are a soldier sent out with 1 bullet, and the only way to progress is to use that to kill another soldier and take his bullets.  But he might have 1 - 3 bullets.  He will never have a full mag.  So irritating.\r\n\r\nThen there are the scripted losses.  When you get to the end of some missions your AI companion say \"lets get out of here\" and enemy ship arrive.  Perhaps you got really lucky on the RNG and build up a small stockpile of materia, so you choose to fight off this fleet rather than warp away like a cowardly dog with its tail between its legs.  You want to feel like you actually won, instead of barely escaped.  NOPE.  The game is programed to make you lose if you do this.  The enemy ship NEVER drop materia, and they NEVER stop coming.  So no matter your skill you will run out of materia and die, if you don't warp out in the middle of the battle.  This seems to be a common theme of many of the missions which I find intolerable.  That's not winning, it just \"not\" loosing.\r\n\r\nI strongly recommend against this game in its current condition.  At least some of these game mechanics should at least be optional, and some should be changed completely.",

      "review": "[EDIT]  After playing this game some more, I decided to change my rating to \"Would not recommend\".  \n\nSomething they don't tell you upfront is that each mission you lose the items you collected.  \"Lose\" in the sense that when you are on a mission, your ship gets damaged, then you have to go to a fabricator in your ship, make shields and health repair, and then run around using those items in specific locations.  So since this happens often, you will stock up on shields, ammo, and health.  Well each time you go back to the hanger, these are deleted...  So when you go back to your ship, thinking you are stocked up for the next mission, nope!  Also they give you drops like gnomes for your ship and even THOSE are deleted even though they give you shelfs to place them on.  The only thing you can keep are your weapons...sort of.  Lets say you're in a mission and die, guess what, you drop those and if you are in a multiplayer mission and you die because your team doesn't revive you, they can wait til you die and then take your weapon... \n\nYeah this is only fun for 1% of the gamer base, you know those players who live and breath fortnite lol.  This game could be fun but the item system is terrible and they only give you 4 spots total for inventory.  Why do you need more inventory?  Because the points system is such that there are items you collect and want to install in your ship, and when you can't you want to save them, but can't.  So within 4 hours of play time you are farming the same exact things over and over which you want to be able to install on your ship but the point system to be able to upgrade your ship is so slow that all you are doing is losing out 95% of the time.  They did a horrible job of balancing the rewards system. \n\n I mainly play survival games so I'm not one of those gamers who needs free stuff and a pat on the back, so when I say it's horrible, it really is.  Not the game itself, just how they organized it.  Is it possible to waste $20 on this game?  Yes.  I think if it was a free demo it would make sense, not paying $20 for this.\n\n[Original Review]\nI play a lot of NMS and avoid games like COD.  So if you're looking for a crazy full server game like COD, it's not there...yet.  This game is fun and smooth.  The onboarding mission is totally worth playing.  As is, this game is worth the full $19.99 price and I'm assuming that like most games when they first come out and then mature, this one too will mature quite nice.  This is kind of restricted gameplay but with being able to fly in space both as a player and as a ship, being able to dock and fly into areas to do on foot things, space battle, I think this game has a lot to offer if the devs are smart.  This gives you that first Destiny experience where you have that area the players all spawn into upon game start.  Unlike The First Descendent, which is a soulless Destiny copy, this game has its own feel and has full soulful-game potential.  I see the potential.",

The game also has some realy big inventory problem You have only 4 slots... oh wait did I say 4? I ment 3 becouse your first slot is always taken by your multitool. Did I say 3? What I realy wanted to say is 2 becouse you second slot is taken by an aditional weapon. Also I think I'm gonna need a healing item so now it is only one slot left, ONE SLOT LEFT. So you eather going to go back to ship and back to loot multiple times (witch in some missions you can't do), OR what is way better option is not taking any aditional items. Witch is a problem since even when you leave ALL of your gear behind you still have only 3 slots!\n\nIn conclusion:\n----------------------------------\nPros:\n- The ship gameplay is fun.\n- The idea behind artifacts is interesting.\n- The ability to hook onto your enemies ships is realy fun.\nCons:\n- The inventory, you get punished for trying to use tools the game gives you.\n- Optimisation is curently meh, but it is only early access so this is expected.\n- Usefulness of tools and weapons is Debatable (again problem with inventory system).\n----------------------------------\nThere is a HUGE potential in this game.

      "review": "Sadly I cannot recommend this game just yet. This game has a massive identity crisis and with current content it's essentially an extended demo.\n\nFirst let me commend this game for what it does right:\n- combat is fun and satisfying, both when flying the ship and when on foot, there's issues with it like scarse ammo, harder difficulties throwing obscene amounts of enemies at you from buggy spawn points and heavy weapons being a waste of inventory slots (more on inventory slots in a second) but overall it's a pleasant experience with strong potential.\n- the current system of missions is quite varied with multiple random events, as you fly a lot of these missions it will need more than that but it's a good start\n- concept of ship being damaged and needing repairs while not new is quite fun and feels well executed\n- lore is good enough for a game of this type\n\nNow with the negatives:\n- The game struggles with identity regarding progression-based gameplay and rougelite approach. It asks you to sink in hours of gameplay for very little reward yet at the same time if you fail with your party - recovery will cost you dearly as weapons that you might have been collecting through 5-10 different missions simply disappear. Re-collecting them will take ages. Having both slow, incremental progression yet at the same time harsh punishments that can erase a whole day worth of progress feel like disrespect to player's time, especially since all missions depend only on the last stage, no matter how well you've done in prior stages. Pick one: either slow grindy progression with scaling difficulty and permanent progress, or fast non-permanent progression resetting every mission, with RNG based power upgrades that all disappear on failure.\n- Inventory slots are picked straight from Lethal Company-like extraction games, limited to 4 of whatever, however 1 slot is already permanent so essentially only 3 are left for the player. Given small amounts of ammunition and large amounts of enemies you usually end up taking 2 weapons extra leaving only one slot for any loot, making it really cumbersome and frustrating to play around.\n- There's currently very few quests in the game, they are also all very basic.\n- There’s an obvious opportunity for functional armor stats, but there's nothing there, it's just cosmetics. It feels like the devs intended to do more here but dropped it to push out Early Access.\n- Rewards from mission stages are so wildly inconsistent that difficulty levels barely matter. If you get the right artifacts, Hard missions become trivial. If you get nothing useful, even Easy becomes annoying without good guns.\n\nThere’s a good game buried in here, and the core mechanics have real promise. But right now the progression, inventory system, and lack of meaningful content hold it back badly. I’ll keep an eye on development, but I can’t recommend it yet.",

      "review": "This was one of those games I was super excited about. I checked on its progress almost every day leading up to the launch. My friends told me to grab it first and let them know if it was worth our time and honestly I have to say no.\n\n[h3]Pros:[/h3]\n\n+ Ship-to-foot combat is incredibly smooth. Moving around on the ship while it’s flying feels great\n+ I had no performance issues. It runs really well\n+ There’s some basic customization and I hope they add more options later\n+ Managing the ship is fun with features like combat stations, repairs, a cool power grid system and shield repairs\n+ You can craft items on board for materia\n+ The guns feel satisfying to shoot\n+ The grappling hook is awesome\n+ You can board other ships but only from the outside\n+ I love that it’s PVE with no PVP at all\n+ It’s a roguelike which is cool\n+ I really like that it’s also designed for solo play. I’ve heard it gets tough later on but I haven’t hit any missions yet that I couldn’t do solo\n+ P2P servers mean you can still play even if the community shrinks\n\n[h3]Cons:[/h3]\n\n- It’s a roguelike but it suffers from the most criticized aspect of the genre: replayability. It gets repetitive really fast. Every mission feels the same no matter what you do. There are a few mission types but they all boil down to the same elements. For example a vault mission always plays out the same way with each scripted \"surprise\" event. It gets boring quickly.\n\n- The enemies are way too generic and uninteresting to fight. Whether on foot or in ship combat they lack variety. The game tries to introduce different types like suicide drones and small AOE bots but they all feel the same.\n\n- The loot isn’t rewarding enough. After fighting for 20 minutes getting just three ship repair kits feels underwhelming especially if you didn’t need them in the first place. You often have to repair your ship after almost every mission making the whole thing feel pointless. Even finishing a full run feels like an empty accomplishment. You earn some credits that don’t have any real use which is frustrating. The rewards for missions seem like an afterthought with future purchases being limited to items like ship repair kits.\n\n- The weapons are lacking. There are a few options but most of them are pretty useless except for one that deals more damage. I don’t like when games offer a selection but make 90 percent of it obsolete.\n\n- You’re forced to take the starting weapon with unlimited ammo which doesn’t make sense especially when playing solo with a bot companion. Your inventory is already too small and losing another slot makes it impossible to carry all the cargo from a vault mission when you also take a better weapon with you.\n\n- The prologue which is basically the tutorial didn’t prepare me for the actual game. When I first got an artifact I was completely lost on what to do with it. I later learned that your ship gets repaired through additional missions unlocking a new room for artifact use but how was I supposed to know that.\n\n- Every artifact which are basically ship perks felt useless to me. For example gaining 50 percent more melee damage while holding a slice of pizza is not helpful. Not only have I never ordered pizza on my ship but melee combat is never necessary. Why would I waste one of my four inventory slots on a pizza? This is even more confusing given that they announced melee weapons in the next update. Receiving these trivial artifacts felt like a slap in the face after a tough mission.\n\n- It’s way too grindy. I hope this is just to stretch out the early access playtime until new updates arrive because you need to do a lot of bland repetitive runs to achieve anything. I’m too tired of the game to even think about grinding for another map tile.\n\n- The ship doesn’t behave like it’s in space. You have two boosts but the ship only speeds up during the boost and immediately slows down afterward. That’s not how space works making ship-to-ship combat feel off. Maneuvering is limited. You just have to position yourself behind the enemy which makes avoiding hits feel pointless and combat in space gets repetetive. There is no strategy to it.\n\n- I thought it was cool that you can board other ships only to find out you can just walk on their outside. Enemies spawn and you shoot them....that’s it. It is also crazy that the game encourages you more to fly freely in your spacesuit outside the ship to combat other enemy ships.\n\nI have to say of all the games in this genre this is one of the better ones. It breaks my heart not to recommend it but I can’t because the most important aspect - interesting replayability - is missing. I got tired of this game way too quickly. A roguelike should offer more than just three mission types played in random order. It needs variety within those mission types. This game is a diamond in the rough that could be really good down the line, but right now it feels like a moon rock. It’s a rare find, but ultimately just a rock.",

      "review": "At first the game feels very promising, but the fun runs out quickly.\nThe co-op mode is basically unplayable. Out of the ~15 missions I played in co-op, I lost connection in more than half of them, and all progress was gone. You can’t just rejoin either—you have to wait until the mission is finished. For an online co-op game, that’s pretty unbelievable.\n\nOn top of that, there are only about 2–3 mission types that just repeat over and over. The enemies are always the same, the buildings are always the same, the level layouts are always the same.\n\nThe inventory system is also a joke. You only get 4 slots, and one is permanently taken by the multitool. You need at least one more for a weapon, which leaves you with only 1–2 slots for loot. That means you’re constantly running back and forth to the ship, which isn’t fun at all—it just feels like filler content to pad out the lack of variety.\n\nThat said, there are some positives.\nWhen it actually works, playing a level for the first time is fun. I also really like the ship and the upgrade options—it’s one of the better parts of the game.\n\nI’ll keep an eye on it, but the developers still have a very long way to go.\n\nTo the people who commented: \"It's in early access ...\"\nOf course, I’m aware that the game is in Early Access. By purchasing it, I’ve supported its development. I’m also active on their Discord and try to provide feedback. The concept of the game and certain parts of it are a lot of fun.\n\nBUT here’s an excerpt from the game’s short description:\n“Jump Space (formerly Jump Ship) is a mission-based co-op PvE for 1–4 players, where you are the crew of a spaceship.”\n\nThe game is advertised as a co-op experience — that’s the main reason I bought it. I wanted to have fun with friends. However, this co-op mode simply doesn’t work. My friends and I keep getting disconnected constantly, making the game unplayable in its intended form.\n\nAnd that’s exactly why I wrote my review.\nI’m not reviewing an unfinished game — I’m reviewing a promised feature that should already be functional, but currently isn’t.",

Losing good gun means struggling on high difficulty stage preventing you from doing/clearing it. Its become a mandatory to find good gun before engaging high level on foot mission.\r\n\r\nTo keep it short, even if you playing solo alone, dropping your gun to sorting your ship cargo just to lessen your round trip from going up and down stair can be risky. A simple disconnect or/ EOS (Epic Online Service) says \"No You\" can suddenly booted you to the main menu and makes you lose everything on that hours run including your dropped gun a moment ago.\r\n\r\nExample : you only have 3 empty inventory slot, you will need to always carry at least 1-2 high rank weapon to deal with high difficulty map.

I've been following this game for a pretty long time and was looking forward to its release. I played the demo a few months ago and enjoyed what was there. I thought it was a little lacking after a few hours but I chalked it up as it being just a demo and that the full game would have bit more going on. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, even after 4 hours the game feels near identical to the demo. A lot of the objectives boil down to defend an area/ find batteries, loot your rewards, leave, and repeat. The enemies aren't much fun to fight either. There is a solid variety of them but none of them feel different from each other. You just shoot at all of them until they stop moving. They don't really challenge you in any way besides walking at you/ shooting at you.\r\n\r\nThe game is in no way bad. I like the cargo management and organizing even if it is simple. It allows someone to organize during downtime instead of leaving everything in a messy pile. Ship combat can sometimes be hectic and fun since someone needs to run around and repair the ship while another crew member can grapple to the enemy ships 1 by 1 and take them out or someone loots.\r\n\r\nI wanna like the game and I do to an extent but I guess I'm just a little disappointed there wasn't a bit more. If you're brand new to it and have a few friends it's really easy to recommend, especially for how cheap it is. If you're returning from the demo and/or beta just keep what I said in mind.

      "review": "At first I thought this game was going to be a perfect example of needing more time to cook, but after the 20 hours (including the demo) in the game I have, I feel very different now. \n\nFirst off I want to say, the Route Keepsake Games took with Jump Space is hands down one of the best for early access I have seen in a while, They really did nail down their gameplay loop making sure everything feels decent & works properly. However that biggest strength also ends up being their biggest weakness here as well, content. The amount of unique mission types / map layouts is very very sparse here, things start to feel repetitive pretty dang fast because you can tell they really wanted to make sure the core concept was working, If this was my only complaint I would gladly give the game a recommend and move on, however as my time with the game increased, I started realizing there are issues with this game that I don't know can be ironed out of the experience.\n\nLets get the most obvious offender out of the way here, the campaign. The story is downright just absolutely forgettable to the point of leaving me shocked how much time and effort is put into it both voice acting and unskippable dialogue as mission briefings before heading on a mission, however this issue is the easiest to fix as well, just make the mission briefings skippable and you are good to go.\n\nMy predominant issue lies both with ship combat / movement and The FPS combat / movement. They have this 5.5/10 feeling, where everything does work and come together but nothing about any of the combat or movement really feels fantastic or has that wow quality, it just works. Sometimes you got a zip line around to get stuff done but it feels very minimal with what you can do with it and not super exciting to use. Yes you can Space walk but besides   boarding ships (a very quick and dull affair), and collecting loot from scannable bonus areas, there is really no use for it. \n\nThere isn't a unique element to this game that feels like it's giving the game an identity, It just feels like it is a bunch of different ideas thrown together and put into a aspect to this game, Don't get me wrong it's a slightly above average package but there's just nothing there to make me really feel like this game is offering me something I can't get somewhere else in some regard. \n\nArtstyle is going to vary greatly from person to person but for me the color palette, weapon design, and enemy design just feels so bland and uninspired, nothing really grabs my attention or comes across as cool or unique, it all is functional. The weapon upgrades only add a splash of color and some scopes to them usually, all the robot enemies feel like robots I could be fighting in another game with mechanical baddies. all of your armor outfits look like generic armor, all the ship weapons are your usual big space guns, ect.\n\nTo me it feels like they tried to make something that was too people pleasing in almost every way so it never really gets the chance to shine in any specific way at all everything just kind of sits together like a slightly above average casserole you're eating, is it food you don't have to choke down and will be able to eat without complaining? Sure! But is it a meal that you  ask for the recipe for so you can make it for all your family and friends? no. It simply is just functional in too many ways, sure there aren't many bugs, or glitches and everything you want from the core experience is there but everything around that core experience feels so....lifeless. In a way this game comes off just as mechanical and function bound as the robots you are killing in the game, If you are someone who just wants a fun game to shoot enemies that you can play with friends go for it, but the lack of having any personal identity or bringing anything unique to the table really just makes it a game I don't want to stay with at all. \n\nTLDR; Gameplay and core of the game works very well and not buggy at all for early access but the game doesn't have enough content, while also not having any unique gameplay elements or a gripping world or art style to keep people around for long, worth getting if you just want something to do while playing with friends, otherwise a forgettable experience that won't be able to be fixed by adding more features and content",

      "review": "After playing more, and reaching a new difficulty, it immediately becomes clear that the devs did not take certain feedback to heart. At least not what me and mine mentioned. There is no sustainability, and that drains the fun. Revives aren't free, which quickly becomes an issue as difficulty increases. The issue is that you'll take down five waves of enemy ships, 10 elites, and 2 corvettes...and get no supplies. The gameplay is not sustainable. It goes from fun to simply frustrating as enemies infinitely spawn until you die, and there's nothing you can do. The loop is: Ship catches on fire, your radiation leaks, it takes 1 person to pilot and one to fix. The other person MUST be on objective, but it takes two people to activate it, making it literally impossible to progress without dying. This was all pointed out in a post I left detailing it, and the developers responded without mentioning things they liked or didn't. They simply said they were happy with their progress. \n\nThis does not bode well. I'd rather just be told they agree or didn't. This allows a dialogue with players, not just \"We hope you like it!\" without anything more. It's not helpful, it's not engaging. Just like the artificial difficulty in this. Just like how it is now almost impossible to grapple to any ships. The option doesn't appear even if you're right in front of it. Fun new bug.\n\nThis game almost nails it. I played the early demo version when it launched with my stack of friends, and we all felt the same way about it. Incredibly fun, but in need of some work. It's a real shame the devs didn't listen. There is a lot I want to say and add, but I have only so much text allowance for these reviews. I'll share what I can. \n\nWhat I need to point out, above all else, is that this game gives something nothing else quite manages. Seeing your ship, being on the deck during combat, and having the ability to walk out and onto the hull in the heat of battle, is just the coolest f**king thing ever. It creates gorgeous moments that leave you yearning for another run with your friends. A pilot weaving through debris while your friend guns down an enemy gunship the moment you step out to repair a materia leak is breathtaking. The way you can see everything happening around you gives that perfect sense of scale. You feel small on your ship, but far from insignificant. It's a feeling that no other game has given me, especially not with friends. Especially when you repair your ship enough to go boarding another vessel, take it down, then grapple right back home in time to fight another fire.\n\nThe good: \n\nGameplay loop. With friends, this game's gameplay loop is incredibly fun. The ship itself gives access to a lot of silly things you can just mess around with to have fun. The emotes paired with chairs are a natural fit for friends wanting to just goof around. When you're not doing that, the mechanics of the combat are heady. The pilot is always a necessity, and I can't really imagine this game as a solo. Where this game truly shines is once you have more crew, allowing for the other mechanics to truly shine. \n\nGunning from within the ship is pretty nice, if not entirely unique. It gets more engaging once you get mounted weapons, like railguns, to let you unleash some real devastation on your enemies. The real chaos begins when you take basically any ship damage, because things go wrong fast. Fires start up, radiation leaks, your ship's lifeblood (materia) can leak, and you need to do rapid repairs. The moment this happens, the casual combat gets frantic. But it's a good frantic, because it greatly rewards fast responses from your crew. I didn't expect to be the one running around putting out fires, shooting from the gunner seat, and managing ship health, but here I am. It's appealing and necessary. \n\nBut the other half of space combat is just as alluring, and I absolutely cannot get enough of it. This game gives you a grapple hook. A grapple hook with simply absurd range. If it were any shorter, it would harm the game drastically. Any longer and I probably wouldn't stop using it. This game lets you board enemy ships to take them down, and take them down fast. Bigger ships take longer, and even BIGGER ships yield some real loot. It's an incredibly fun, fast paced mechanic that adds a whole new level to the already enjoyable space fights. There is simply no other game I've seen that lets you jump out of your ship to take down a corvette you can't shoot because your railguns are down. It is exhilarating. \n\nThe bad:\n\nDevelopers are questionably listening to feedback. \n\nThis game has improved a lot, but also lost some things along the way. The game runs WAY worse than the demo. My 4090, even with DLSS on, is struggling to get 90 frames around enemies. My friend with a lesser card is often hitting 12fps. I'm not sure what happened, because the demo ran smooth. This is a huge issue that I hope gets addressed sooner rather than alter. \n\nItems not held are lost inbetween runs, automatically sold for salvage...even if you put them on a shelf. I don't like that items labeled as \"Decorative\" are deleted after runs, as they hold no salvage value. They're worth a little materia, but given their very titular nature, I expected them to remain as just that. Decorations you could keep. \n\nShelves, in general, are a flawed system that could make for an amazing feature. They seem intended for you to prep exits with weapons and gear. I love that so much. The idea of having your ship- YOUR ship- stocked with items of your choosing and ready to use in the heat of battle is amazing. You memorize it so that you're prepped when things go bad. But that's not possible. Even items on shelves are deleted. Sold for scrap. Even if those items lose their value, let me hoard. Let me shove my ship so full of things that it bursts. I'm losing out on the value, so it's not exactly like I'm reaping the rewards anyways. I'd be plenty happy to see them have no value if kept like that, ensuring you don't stockpile for a big payout. I just want the ship to be MY ship. Also, there's a glitch where shelf items get stuck. Very bad glitch. \n\nSpiderbots still suck. They made quite literally no sound in the beta, meaning little flamethrowers would just sneak up on you and burn you to death. They...kind of make sound now? They make a sound on spawn, but it doesn't follow their body, leaving them still soundless until killed. Even their attack is soundless. My entire group confirmed this, so it's not just me. \n\nYour ship's name not appearing on the side simply will not do. It's the final touch lacking from making the vessel truly yours. I really hope that, eventually, we see that changed. \n\nLarge space debris, like exploded vessels, have terrible hitboxes. The first time I got truly frustrated with the game was during a very high stakes mission in which I died because I couldn't fly through a hole large enough for my entire ship. Except, I wasn't in my ship. It was just me, the very small person utterly dwarfed by this hole. Hitboxes like this will outright kill you, and that's some simply bad design in a game where half your time is spent flying around as a very vulnerable human. \n\nYour flashlights suck. The areas you need to use it don't actually get naturally darker, but simply drop all lighting...so your flashlight also does nothing. It also just sucks in general, making it doubly lame. Using your jetpack shuts it off as well, so you have to flick it on and off a lot.\n\nMission diversity in the first zone is very lacking. Either we got really unlucky with spawns, or there are only three mission types, one of which is nearly identical to another. Complaints about diversity are well warranted, at least for zone one. I'm hoping other zones branch out, because if not, that's a huge problem.\n\nOverall: \n\nI want to love this game. But I hate that the devs are being cheeky about feedback, and that its difficulty is artificial.",

      "review": "I will likely keep playing this game as long as my friends keep wanting to, but I'd say 10 hours is about the real limit of the fun to be had. The story part of the game is pretty short, after which you can sorta sandbox around until you get tired of it, and I'm getting tired of it.\n\nBasically, the problem goes like this: Everything is scripted to continually go wrong whether it makes sense or not, and they deliberately designed hassle into all sorts of unnecessary places. This problem is 100x overtuned if you play with 3-4 players, but it exists solo or with 2 players, too. \n\nThe ship is made of cardboard and breaks or catches fire after ONE HIT. Often, waves of enemies are scripted and will never stop spawning until you touch the magic quest button, at which point they all magically give up. The spawn in from nowhere significant. Not in any way that makes sense, just whenever the mission designer thought it was time for some shooting. And it's kinda half-ass, too. Like, there are big mech things but they just show up whenever. Not as a boss fight or something, just in the middle of waiting for several minutes for a door to open while you go around and pull levers to \"override\" the door opening system. Mysteriously, every door in the game either takes several people to open, running around to six places to pull levers, or some combination of the two. I get that it's early EA but come on, you couldn't think of anything more convincing? Like having me fix a gear or coolant line or something? Just buttons to shoot my science pistol at?\n\nThere are dozens of things so dumb that it totally kills all immersion. There is a zero percent chance that if this was actually a thing that happened, these people, this plot, etc, that things would behave the way they do in the game. It just gets dumber the more you think about it. Here are some examples: \n\nYou can upgrade your ship, but you can't upgrade your carried guns, get armor or a better personal shield, or even use grenades. Guns do have upgrades, but you just have to randomly find them. You can bring weapons back to your militarized hangar/mission hub, but no one figured out that you can maybe put them in a box for later use. Because why would a resistance fighter need a gun? If you lose your gun in space, find another one, because the resistance lost all the ones you brought home last time.\n\nYou have a matter crafter on ship that can craft repair items and consumables, but not guns, of course. You're in a spaceship advanced enough to warp, but they haven't learned to make fire suppression systems yet. Your ship has shields, but when they lose their batteries, you replace them from OUTSIDE the ship, not inside. Why? So you can get shot at, of course. Why would they put that inside the ship?\n\nYour ship will harvest materia from space, but it won't send it to the cargo bay--it puts it in a container, which you then have to move yourself. Your ship has scanners, but they only detect stuff scripted for the mission. IE, not any out-of-the-way loot. Mission loot shows up for some reason, tho.\n\nThe button to open airlock doors isn't on the airlock door, nor did anyone at Space Engineering School figure out how to make them work automatically. We reserve that advanced technology for grocery stores. The Dart ship only has a door on one side, just to add hassle. The main ship has a deliberately confusing layout, which might work if it was a pleasure vessel. It's not, though. It's a military craft but it doesn't really have duty stations people expect to stay in. There's the pilot, and then all the other players running around frantically doing everything else. The very important systems are spread throughout the ship and you're going to use 6 staircases getting anywhere. I'm convinced they did that on purpose to make it feel more 'tense' when you're in a bad spot.\n\nLike, I love the idea of the game. It looks great, runs great, feels good to play. There are lots of cool ideas here and some of the roguelike advancement elements are interesting. I suspect they'll be doing a lot of tuning as they go, and I don't really regret buying it to play with friends. We had a good time for a few hours there. It's just that now the novelty is starting to wear off and so much of it feels fake, contrived, and forced, that I don't recommend it to anyone at this point. \n\nHappy to change my review after future updates. We'll see how it goes.",

The set pieces and scenery of the game however is beautiful, and the graphics are really nice. The ship feels cozy and has some nice additions like crew quarters and other small additions around that give a bit of life to the ship. \n\nMissions are repetitive and often times become boring. Piloting the ship feels slow, even with the new faster ship they added. Ship momentum and weight feels very weird. Gunfights with the pilot feel slow and uneventful.\n\nThe game feels like a side grade of Void Crew by detracting from ship combat and adding more EVA/pilot gameplay. Jump Space feels like a it could be a great space game, but it doesn't have a set identity yet. The mission structure they have is a little too rigid and repetitive to make me want to sink multiple hours in it without wanting to switch to a different space crew game. \n\nI think this game could benefit from being a bit more \"open world\" in the sense of instead of doing specific missions from the hub world, allow the players to make continuous jumps with the ship from mission to mission while still out on their ship. perhaps limit exploration of planets and space to the specific system they are currently in. This way, you get a bit more freedom and time to play with your ship, only coming back to the hub to upgrade, restock, and rearm. \n\neither way, game is fun, but just feels like it doesn't know what kind of space game it wants to be just yet.",

      "review": "Let me preface this review by saying that I have found this game to be very fun (when it works). The gameplay loop is intense, fun and addictive, and the game is pretty well polished for an early access title. Sure there are some problems such as getting stuck inside terrain, or items disappearing when dropped, but these are fairly typical small problems that one would expect to see in an early access title, and they should get fixed.\n\nThe reason I am (with a heavy heart) giving this title the dreaded thumbs down is because it lacks a fundamental feature which it should have included right out of the box: A robust reconnect/resume system.\n\nAs it stands currently, if you are playing with a friend and the friend gets disconnected, they have to wait until you have finished the current node (map). They cannot reconnect until you jump to the next node. What makes this even worse is if they get disconnected during the final node, they cannot reconnect at all, and they gain NO REWARD.\n\nThis is a pretty big deal, since some runs can easily take 1 hour or longer. To invest that amount of time into a run to walk away empty-handed is absolutely not acceptable. It is a serious level of disrespect and disregard for the player's time and effort.\n\nIt would be unacceptable even if my internet connection were bad, but it's made even worse by the fact there clearly are wide spread connection/stability issues with the game, judging by the number of complaints one can see on Discord. Ultimately it doesn't matter whether it's the game, or Epic online services, or the player's dial up internet connection - ALL of these problems are solved effectively by a robust resume system.\n\nBrowsing through the feature requests channel/threads in Discord, there is some indication that the devs are \"aware of the problem\" and \"want to improve it\", but I have to wonder - If you have designed a game where a single session can take 1+ hour, how is it that a robust \"resume\" system hasn't already been built in from the very beginning? Why is it being discussed for improvement like an afterthought? What possible justification could exist for that?\n\nWorse yet, there is a developer comment acknowledging this issue from over 3 months ago, and yet the resume system is still awful to this day. It definitely seems like improving it is not a priority for them.\n\nIt concerns me, because it tells me that: \n\n1) The devs didn't think their systems out very well from a point of practicality and user friendliness.\n \n2) The devs do not respect the player's time and effort enough to make these factors a core consideration in the design of their game.\n\nI will gladly change my review and start recommending this game if/when the developers have implemented a robust resume system that doesn't rob the player of their rewards or time (make them wait 20+ minutes to rejoin their friends).\n\nDevs, if you are reading this: I really think you're onto a winner gameplay wise, but if you truly want your game to shine, you need to make respect for your players a core part of your design philosophy, not an afterthought. Like many people, my leisure time is limited. I want to spend it on games that respect me, not games that take away my shinies and say \"too bad, so sad\".",

Ground combat can be chaotic when enemies spawn outside the map and start shooting you. There isn't a great progression system either. You don't keep loot, only the weapons you had on you. There needs to be some sort of \"stash\" or \"locker\" system in the hanger.\n\n\"The Ugly\"\nJoin in progress makes you wait until the team jumps, which is really annoying. You don't get to spectate either, you just sit at a loading screen. The AI placeholder voice acting is somehow worse than normal text to speech programs, they fall right into the uncanny valley.

If you have a rocket launcher, this means it fires the rocket and kills you and your teammates.\n\nThe biggest issue? Jump Space is a fine game for two people, but there is not enough for the other two players to do on the ship!  If you aren't in the pilot or gunner seat, HAVE A GOOD GAME ON YOUR PHONE, because you'll be bored for a good portion of the space combat sections.  There really needs to be more to to, because player 3 and player 4 end up with nothing to do.\n\nAdditionally, while the ground combat feels competent, the missions bore me to tears. Quite simply, having a squad scrambling about to click on a button is toddler bait, and not fit for game play in 2025.

Also, they hide this after a long single player tutorial and a few lvl 1 and 2 missions which are easily doable solo where you can't refund it afterwards.\n\n- fun mechanics\n- good graphics\n- decent sounds on occasion. Some sounds are missing or weird.\n- grappling to enemy ships and back\n- fast flying around\n\nissues:\n- a lot of bugs: sudden graphics freezes, scopes stuttering the game for a while, all locations being marked as A and the mission asks you to go to B or C, ctd on occasion for no reason. That is fine I guess as this is early access.\n- ships steering gets stuck sometimes. for whatever reason, the turns stall and you keep turning one way or the other, only sometimes though.\n- game has no single player in mind in further missions (no commanding the bot). They give you a bot that magically does 2 things at the same time but you can't ask it to navigate the ship while you go on foot to something. it's always next to you. Example: artillery mission, take over artillery a, b, c. Going great, ship waves, massive battle overhead, ground assaults to take the cannons. Then we get a message saying the enemy will counterattack to take the cannons back. Sure, multiple waves are fended off, enemy somehow magically takes a cannon without landing, I can't land because the ship waves do not end, eventually I run out of materia and ship goes boom. This is just lame lol. There's no way to do this mission solo unless you've got everything maxed and this is only level 4. Keep in mind, aside from about 8-9 waves of cruisers and co back to back I was fine. ALLOW SOLO PLAYERS TO TAKE A FULL CREW OF BOTS which can accept commands with that middle click you keep spamming and a button to call them back. I'm ok with ai crew.\n- the bot does not: douse out fires, steer the ship nor go on foot to objectives. it's right at your butt all the time. \n- fire locations sometimes bug out. It took me 5 mins to find one of the fires as the icons just disappear and reappear at whim when close (was in one of the vents but the icon disappeared when going downstairs so I thought it was outside)\n- materia collection is extremely tedious. the bot can at least drive the ship to collect them, jeez.\n- They give you this fantastic mechanic (boarding ships and going on foot to attack things) and then take that away when the full enemy fleet attacks your ship immediately, wherever it is. Wht happens is, you board a cruiser, kill it, and then see 5 other ships going bananas on your ship which is now far away. \n- Ship boosting is done wrong imo, there are multiple games that implemented it properly, even free space decades ago. We boost, and then we immediately brake to top speed for some reason. We brake?",

Imagine early Warframe, except without any of the fun movement, and also you're using the deeply unsatisfying guns from No Man's Sky.\n\nSpace combat similarly feels underbaked, with the nose of the ship whipping around wildly at the slightest movement, rather than having any sort of weight or momentum behind it. Enemy missiles sluggishly chug along as if through gelatin, allowing you to literally dip the nose of your ship to avoid them. This bizarre lack of momentum is especially jarring when viewed from outside the ship, where you can see it spinning in place at absurd speeds as the pilot moves their mouse around; no thrusters, no animations, nothing.\n\nYou'll be seeing this quite a lot, too, as despite the ship... existing, it mostly just serves as a way to ferry you from one dull co-op shooting segment to another. The game's entire loop consists of flying to a point of interest, disembarking, shooting a few enemies, then carrying some loot back to the ship. Most often this means a wave survival mission that involves pressing a co-op button every 5-10 seconds over the course of several minutes. It's like the drill from Payday, only worse, because it breaks down every few seconds instead of every minute or so. I want to emphasize that I am [i]not exaggerating,[/i] it's legitimately every 10 seconds or so.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the game aggressively tutorializes you, locking you out of seemingly the only roguelike element (Artifacts), as well as the basic functionality of your ship, until you've completed several easy (and tediously long) missions. If you're unlucky, the map may not even give you access to the correct mission type to complete these story quests, forcing you to play even more long, easy missions with the gimped tutorial ship until they decide to appear.\n\nOh yeah, and all those currencies you're collecting, about those... bet you're wondering when you unlock the ability to spend them, huh? Welp, too bad, because the shopkeeper isn't implemented yet and there's nothing to do with them, lol. Right, and that other ship that you can unlock? It's got crippling design flaws that prevent in-flight repairs, and the developers have acknowledged that they'll have to revisit it and redesign it, so it might as well not exist.\n\nI get why people are hyped, the core concepts here are interesting, but the execution leaves much to be desired, and the game's aesthetics are about as bland as vanilla yogurt. Worse, this feels more like a proof of concept than a project that just needs a bit more development time, and even then, I'm not sure there's really any [i]vision[/i] behind this project; most everything here is taken directly from existing games, albeit executed poorly. Right now it feels like this game has no voice, no identity, if that makes any sense.\n\n[b]Hard not recommended.[/b] Severely underbaked.

      "review": "CONS!!! - You lose the vast majority of everything you collect after each mission.  You have 3 slots on your character to carry items. (technically 4 but one can not be changed).  EVERYTHING ELSE is deleted at the end of each mission.  You could have found some incredible weapons, tools, ship upgrades etc.  It doesn't matter, if you are not holding it in one of the 3 slots it is deleted at the end of the mission.\r\n\r\nSome upgrades to your ship do carry over, but they must be installed components.  However the (artifacts) which are installed and can provide significant buffs to your ship, are also deleted at the end of every mission.\r\n\r\nAlong with deleting the vast majority of all your cool loot, they also delete any addition a ship / shield repair kits you may have stocked up on, as well as the currency \"materia\" which is used to create them.  So you have to start every single mission with NOTHING but the clothes on your back and about 1/2 the installed components on your ship.  You could technically but materia canisters to take into a mission and have them at the beginning, but that is prohibitively expensive.\r\n\r\nYour shields do not auto recharge.  You actually have to build 4 components, exit the ship, do a space walk, and install these components on 4 different areas of the ship to recharge your shields.  Which is gone the first time a enemy gunship strafs your ship.  The method to repair the ship is similar but at least you dont have to leave the ship.  You build the components, which you can need up to 5 of to fully repair, and you have to stand in front of a console and insert them one at a time every 5 seconds or so.  IF you are playing solo, and piloting the ship in battle, then your robotic companion will build and use repair kits only when the ship is critically damaged (assuming you have meteria).  Your companion will not fully repair the ship and will never repair the shields.  So every time you have a small battle, you have to park the ship, get up, and go do choirs for 1 - 3 minutes before you dare get into another scrap.  This might happen 3 - 10 times during a single mission.  The game seems to be designed to require a crew of 4, where 1 is pilot, 2 gunners, and one is a base b'tch who has to spend what could be a fun game just running around constantly repairing the ship without even a view of the combat happening outside.\r\n\r\nEVEN THEN... the ability to build ammo resupply for the ship, or any repair components is severely limited by the RNG of \"materia\".  Which you can think of like a 3d printer cartridge.  Enemy ship randomly and very scarcely drop materia when they explode.  Then to actually get it you need to fly over to it.  A collector outside your ship picks it up, but is apparently incapable of routing it into the ship to be used.  So you have to park, get out of your seat, do another space walk to collect two separate containers.  Bring them inside, and put them into a recycling bin to actually get to use the materia.  Good luck if you are in battle, out of shield and ammo, and just need a smidgen to build bullets to finish off the last enemy.  You are going to be a sitting duck for a while while you get this sorted.  The game always only lets enough materia drop to barely get you to the next area, assuming you did everything right, and quickly dispatch your enemies before they do to much damage.  Its incredibly irritating.  It kinda feels like you are a soldier sent out with 1 bullet, and the only way to progress is to use that to kill another soldier and take his bullets.  But he might have 1 - 3 bullets.  He will never have a full mag.  So irritating.\r\n\r\nThen there are the scripted losses.  When you get to the end of some missions your AI companion say \"lets get out of here\" and enemy ship arrive.  Perhaps you got really lucky on the RNG and build up a small stockpile of materia, so you choose to fight off this fleet rather than warp away like a cowardly dog with its tail between its legs.  You want to feel like you actually won, instead of barely escaped.  NOPE.  The game is programed to make you lose if you do this.  The enemy ship NEVER drop materia, and they NEVER stop coming.  So no matter your skill you will run out of materia and die, if you don't warp out in the middle of the battle.  This seems to be a common theme of many of the missions which I find intolerable.  That's not winning, it just \"not\" loosing.\r\n\r\nI strongly recommend against this game in its current condition.  At least some of these game mechanics should at least be optional, and some should be changed completely.",

      "review": "Not worth 20€, too barebones. And I feel it will stay that way for at least couple years.\r\nIt has some cool concepts (free movement on the ship), but I think the game will stay without depth.\r\nExamples why I feel this way:\r\n- There are 3 linear upgrades per module and weapons.\r\n- Weapons feel very arcadey.\r\n- No classes.\r\n- No mod support planed for the future.\r\n- Loot feels unrewarding and arcadey in general.\r\n\r\nIt reminds me heavily of some flopped games with similar intents (but those had more depth).\r\nEA or not, it focuses more on visuals/ease of gameplay than actual depth.\r\n\r\nIt COULD be worth, if mod support would be planed as a basis for the game. It has decent bones for it. Without this though, I doubt the developers will add enough content/variety to make it the next barotraumaesque game in 3D and instead be a 5-20h of fun and done.",

It completely takes me out of the game entirely.\nIts grating and annoying on top of my ability to tell they're AI generated.\n\nThis game has roughly 10k concurrent players with an 100k peak.\neven at 1 dollar, that's more than enough to pay an inde VA for some rough voice work. \nEven voice acting from the developers would be better than an AI voice. They're programmers, artists, and game designers- learn a new skill guys, it'd be more widely appreciated when its coming from you, and hell, you can add a new thing onto your resume.\nI don't doubt the people working on this have skills, and the game was fun while i played it, and maybe ill give it some more time, but the generated voices will keep this review negative as long as they remain.",

I hope the dev's are working to add some cool stuff like enemy and mission variety, a more constant and faster stream of upgrades and resources to upgrade your ship and it's components, a basic weapon modding system would be cool too and a progression maybe? I dunno, I am not a game dev but this feels very hollow.\n\nGrab it to support these guys is my reccomendation, but don't expect to get hundreds of hours out of it at this stage.",
