      "review": "Long story short, this game was my first immersive MMORPG that I played back in 2017. Because of this game, I met my first foreign best friend, and everything got better after that I made more friends and created unforgettable memories. It felt like living in a dream world, where the guild felt like my second family. We spent time talking on Discord while farming or helping each other level up. I stopped playing in 2019, but I came back during the pandemic!\nI just realized I’ve already spent around 4.5k hours in-game, with about 1k hours on the steam version I’ve never spent this much time on any other MMORPG. If you’re asking whether this game is still worth playing in late 2025, I’d say YES and NO!\n\n[b] Pros : [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]PlayStation 2 style graphics that give a retro MMO vibe.\n    [*]Freedom to create your own class and equipment. You can switch between different builds as long as you have similar stats no need to make a new character if you don’t want to grind too much. Yes, you can be a mage with a ninja scroll, an archer with a katana, a dual-sword user, a tank with magic, or even a samurai with a magic device and more!\n    [*]Customizable stat builds and skill choices to match your playstyle. You have a lot of options, you can build high penetration DPS for boss battles, go for fast attack speed, or play a mage DPS with support skills. It’s all up to you, since you can choose which skills you want to learn.\n    [*]Mid-tier storyline that’s quite interesting and enjoyable to follow.\n    [*]trading and consignment board. The economy is controlled entirely by players. You can get better gear and weapons from the consignment board, search for the best stats, and find affordable prices since most listed items are player crafted.\n    [*]Improved UI and HUD. the Steam version feels cleaner and easier to use, while the mobile version is a bit crowded. I personally prefer the Steam version because of its better shortcut system.\n    [*]Own land and raise pets! You can buy land to build and decorate your own house, buy pets, train them, and even bring them to boss fights. Plus, you can cook food buffs to increase your stats and get extra buffs from visiting other players houses.\n    [*]Not P2W. You only pay for cosmetics and extra bag slots, which don’t give a major advantage. You can even get free cosmetics and tickets through in-game events, and expand your bag using materials dropped by mobs.\n    [*]Unique combat mechanics that require maintaining proration instead of just spamming skills. It might take some time for beginners to get used to, but you’ll eventually master it and discover new mechanics as you progress.\n    [*]Server flexibility. You can freely switch between servers without creating a new account. Since there aren’t too many servers, it’s easy to move from an empty one to a more active server.\n[/list]\n\n[b] Cons : [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Confusing quest guidance. Some quests can be really confusing sometimes the game gives you directions, sometimes it doesn’t. Be ready to actually read the quest text and check the map yourself to find where to go.\n    [*]Inflation. This has always been an issue prices on the consignment board are often too expensive for beginners, making it hard to gear up early on. but still can craft from blacksmith.\n    [*]Spam bots, farming bots, and RMT. Yeah… this has been around for years. Be careful if someone offers you cheap Spina most of them are scammers. But don’t worry, there are still plenty of active and friendly players around.\n    [*]Repetitive events.Honestly, not much has changed since 2017. Most events just repeat with higher difficulty and new item drops. Occasionally there’s a collaboration event and those are usually the best ones.\n    [*]Dead guilds. Many guilds feel empty or inactive these days. Still, you can find a few active ones that run boss raids and community activities if you look around.\n    [*]Level cap grind. The game isn’t finished yet, and the level cap keeps increasing. It can get tiring to grind again every time the cap is raised, especially if you’re not into heavy grinding.\n[/list]\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3605840814\nLike I said before is Toram Online still worth playing?\n[b] YES! [/b] for its solid gameplay and the incredible freedom to customize your own build.\n[b] NO! [/b] because I’m not sure how long this game will keep going, and you’ll need to be prepared for a long, grindy journey.\nAfter all these years, Toram Online is still my favorite MMORPG. The community may have changed, but the charm of building your own class and exploring the world remains. These days, I’ve settled into being more of a merchant helping out new players, trading, and just enjoying the peaceful side of the game. And honestly? I’m perfectly happy with that.",

I find it quite enjoyable.\n\nIf you hate farming(We talking like, you sits for hours farming just to make some bucks) then, don't even try, just go find some other healthy game instead. And if you're okay with it, give it a try.\n\nWhat I like:\n- Combat and the freedom of skills\n- Socializing with fellow player (Guild)\n- Testing different build and play styles (create new character)\n- Partying and Raid with Guild members\n\nWhat I dislike:\n- Farming...\n- Since everything mostly you have to buy from players... making money...\n- Special Item are hard to come by, you have to buy it from players again...\n- Bots\n\nOverall, a Playable/10.

Mostly from premium shop, but they give a ton of currency and tickets to pull for cosmetics , over time you'll have a collection.\r\nGame overall has a unique vibe that only games like Final Fantasy has offered in terms of settings and feel. (Audio, monsters, bosses, world, ect)\r\nIts not perfect & nor should it be, but it lives in its own little world happily along side the rest of the current MMO's.  \r\nIf you need a new MMO, this game offers something only Toram can offer, and I think thats fair to say. \r\n\r\n7/10 - Not for every MMO gamer, but for those willing to try new games and enjoy them for what they offer.",

The stories been interesting and the character designs are wonderful!\n\nI'm not big on how the costumes are handled, having to be online so much just to get an orb that'll get you to where you can try to pull for an outfit... but it's not the first time I played a game with hard to get costumes, so I'll manage.",

      "review": "Story is Good, Lore is easy to Understood. The IAP is just too expensive. But you can get the IAP currency pretty easily from most event. I used to own High level account with High Blacksmith and Synthesize skill back in 2019. Served hundreds of Players. Too bad, I forgot the password and I lost access to the email. So I start fresh and quitting BS.\n\nEarly-game wise, the combat is very easy and enjoyable, but as you progress, the enemy is becoming much-much stronger, as it's damage and HP increasing exponentially. In Late/End-game, you either become a very-very Powerful DPS that can one-shoot any monster, but you are very fragile, meaning even one shoot from enemy, you're down. Or becoming a very-very thick tank with highest survivability and almost no damage given. There is no in between.\n\nMain City is full of bots promoting phising sites and RMT, which is highly forbidden according to the rules. Once you do that and get caught, your account will be flagged and basically, you can login, but unplayable. You cannot buy, sell, let alone trade. I would avoid that kind of interaction, you should earn money yourself. Even if it's take too long. \n\nThe minimum requirements for this game is overly exaggerated on it's official website and steam. You can literally run fine with max settings on 1st Gen Intel Processor and with GTX/GTS 400 series, without FPS drop whatsoever.\n\nI would rate 6.5/10 Overall. It could be better if Devs listen to the players. Do you MMORPG lover, and Should you try this game? Absolutely. But don't invest too much on this game.",

The freedom in character creation is insane — over 500 billion combinations really lets you make your own style. I spent way too long experimenting with different weapons, colors, and skills.\nCombat is smooth, and I like the ability to mix and match weapons and abilities. Partying with friends or even borrowing mercenaries when playing solo makes tougher monsters manageable. The 3D world is huge and colorful, though some areas feel a bit empty or repetitive.\nA couple of downsides: the game can lag a bit on older PCs, and sometimes figuring out optimal skill combos takes trial and error. Overall, it’s a solid MMORPG experience with a lot of freedom.",

      "review": "The game is probably one of the successful MMOs in my opinion. The developers does listens to feedback, although some may or may not be implemented. But from what I've seen is, they always give us what we need, not what we wanted.\r\n\r\nThe combat may be janky for today's standards, but it gets better the more you play. It is also not a friendly game for beginners, as there is almost no guideline on what to do, so you will have to rely heavily on the community or seek experienced players. There is no 'class' in this game, you could be whatever you could wish to be or at least come close to it. However, they may or may not be the most efficient ones, but 'viable' in the least. There are also no heads-up from the developers regarding specification for in-game skills or any relevant sort, they are figured out by the players up to the calculations, even in the scenario they give an update on new skills. This may be debatable, but I find it as a good engagement.\r\n\r\nThe monetization is mostly centered around cosmetics gacha, but there are equipment upgrades that is arguably not worth to be put attention on, as it is obtainable by in-game currency. The economy of the game is player-driven. They usually gives out the currency for the cosmetics gacha every now and then. \r\n\r\nI'd also argue that the community is relatively bearable, there are a lot of that would help or pour the juices for you. I'm open to criticism or clarification if there's anything wrong in my perspective. Please try out the game. Thanks in advance.",

Here are my thoughts as a casual/solo player:\n\n[h3]Pros[/h3]\n[list]\n    [*]The game has nostalgic retro graphics and a great soundtrack, and the character designs are cute.\n    [*]The story is surprisingly good for an MMO.\n    [*]Combat is fun, and there is no class system so you can use skills from any skill tree.\n    [*]The game still receives regular updates and main story expansions.\n    [*]You can recruit your guild members' characters as NPCs, which makes it much easier to play the game solo.\n    [*]You can farm money fairly easily and buy player-made gear from the auction, which allows you to skip a lot of grinding.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Cons[/h3]\n[list]\n    [*]Combat seems unbalanced. Nearly every attack will kill you in one hit, so gear that increases your health or defense seems useless.\n\n    [*]Refunding your skill points costs premium currency, so you cannot experiment with your build. Instead, if you want to try a different playstyle you need to create and level a new character. The game's systems are a bit convoluted, so you will likely waste skill points if you don't follow a guide.\n\n    [*]You need to create multiple characters for specific purposes since stat points are limited and also cannot be refunded for free. For example, you need a mage character with high luck to farm drops optimally, and you need another character with high vitality to craft gear and consumables with maximum success rate.\n\n    [*]The game was originally designed for mobile devices and is not at all optimized for PC. Even with a good PC, you will find yourself staring at a lengthy loading screen every time you start the game or enter a new area for the first time. The UI is also designed with mobile in mind, so it's often unresponsive and unintuitive.\n\n    [*]You will often find bots spamming links in the chat in the main city, and large groups of bots farming enemies in certain areas.\n\n    [*]A lot of cosmetic items are locked behind a gacha system.\n[/list]\n\nToram Online is a fun MMO to play casually, but not one I can see myself spending thousands of hours in. I'd rate it 6/10.",

Of course, I was a bit confused when building my character at the beginning of the game. If you're wondering, is there a guide? Perhaps you need a community to ask questions or any tips and tricks. \n\nI hope the developers keep updating this game. <3 <3 <3",

And if you're okay with it, give it a try.\n\nWhat I like:\n- Combat and the freedom of skills\n- Socializing with fellow player (Guild)\n- Testing different build and play styles (create new character)\n- Partying and Raid with Guild members\n\nWhat I dislike:\n- Farming...\n- Since everything mostly you have to buy from players... making money...\n- Special Item are hard to come by, you have to buy it from players again...\n- Bots\n\nOverall, a Playable/10.

I used to own High level account with High Blacksmith and Synthesize skill back in 2019. Served hundreds of Players. Too bad, I forgot the password and I lost access to the email. So I start fresh and quitting BS.\n\nEarly-game wise, the combat is very easy and enjoyable, but as you progress, the enemy is becoming much-much stronger, as it's damage and HP increasing exponentially. In Late/End-game, you either become a very-very Powerful DPS that can one-shoot any monster, but you are very fragile, meaning even one shoot from enemy, you're down. Or becoming a very-very thick tank with highest survivability and almost no damage given. There is no in between.\n\nMain City is full of bots promoting phising sites and RMT, which is highly forbidden according to the rules. Once you do that and get caught, your account will be flagged and basically, you can login, but unplayable. You cannot buy, sell, let alone trade. I would avoid that kind of interaction, you should earn money yourself. Even if it's take too long. \n\nThe minimum requirements for this game is overly exaggerated on it's official website and steam. You can literally run fine with max settings on 1st Gen Intel Processor and with GTX/GTS 400 series, without FPS drop whatsoever.\n\nI would rate 6.5/10 Overall.

The freedom in character creation is insane — over 500 billion combinations really lets you make your own style. I spent way too long experimenting with different weapons, colors, and skills.\nCombat is smooth, and I like the ability to mix and match weapons and abilities. Partying with friends or even borrowing mercenaries when playing solo makes tougher monsters manageable. The 3D world is huge and colorful, though some areas feel a bit empty or repetitive.\nA couple of downsides: the game can lag a bit on older PCs, and sometimes figuring out optimal skill combos takes trial and error.

For me though, it's so nostalgic even if I never played this specific mmo growing up. Aesthetically, it reminds me a lot of the game that the original dothack games are based around. The community is pretty small, but seems nice, there's a pretty even mix of multi language users and no separate chats for each of the languages, so you'll probably have to rely on guilds to find a guild that speaks your native language. There is SO much information online, which you will need because you can get lost really quickly. \n\nMy main complaint is that cosmetic gacha system is pretty dated, it's like half cosmetics and half useless consumables per banner, but if you've played older games with gacha that was pretty normal. It's also pretty expensive to do a 10 pull, but they do seem to have decent deals here and there, as well as a discount system for some(?) of the banners. I will say, they don't seem to last very long, so there is a bit of fomo, but at least it seems to filter through cosmetic banners a lot??",

Can we solo the game by ourselves? Hell no, unless you want to spend months soloing the whole boss alone on easy or normal difficulty. Even though it's a free game, inside we can find almost no microtransactions; it's a heavily grindy game where we slay hundreds of thousands of mobs and bosses to create perfect equipment for our builds. It also has no classes where we can learn skills from others' classes, like images; I can learn skills from archery, samurai, and tank classes to create my own unique build.While it mostly has great mechanics.\n\nToram also has a few quite striking bad implementations, like its heavy RNG. Its drop rate makes many players farm for days, months, or even years just to get top-tier items, and some people can get them in under 30 minutes. Other than that, leveling our characters is very grindy; like, after you reach level 240+, it can take one hour just to increase 1 level, and that does not count if we easily get a party or we can kill the boss quickly; it becomes very boring. Other than that, to make money in the game for newbies is farming, but for high-end players it is crafting/stating and selling that item to other players on the market. This means the economy in the game is created by players and unintentionally controlled by players, which can be a good thing or bad if you look at it like at some point this X price is cheap, only 300k, but next month it becomes so expensive, reaching 1m. This also makes the biggest problem in the game, which is farming bots that ruined many players' experiences.",

But from what I've seen is, they always give us what we need, not what we wanted.\r\n\r\nThe combat may be janky for today's standards, but it gets better the more you play. It is also not a friendly game for beginners, as there is almost no guideline on what to do, so you will have to rely heavily on the community or seek experienced players. There is no 'class' in this game, you could be whatever you could wish to be or at least come close to it. However, they may or may not be the most efficient ones, but 'viable' in the least. There are also no heads-up from the developers regarding specification for in-game skills or any relevant sort, they are figured out by the players up to the calculations, even in the scenario they give an update on new skills. This may be debatable, but I find it as a good engagement.\r\n\r\nThe monetization is mostly centered around cosmetics gacha, but there are equipment upgrades that is arguably not worth to be put attention on, as it is obtainable by in-game currency. The economy of the game is player-driven. They usually gives out the currency for the cosmetics gacha every now and then. \r\n\r\nI'd also argue that the community is relatively bearable, there are a lot of that would help or pour the juices for you. I'm open to criticism or clarification if there's anything wrong in my perspective. Please try out the game. Thanks in advance.",

      "review": "✨️Vibes\nIf Final Fantasy XIV had a baby with an early 2000s JRPG, and that baby was raised by Monster Hunter, you’d get Toram Online.\n\nIt’s got the heart and charm of a classic JRPG — peaceful towns, mysterious ruins, whimsical NPCs — mixed with the social, story-driven focus of FF14 and the gear-crafting, boss-grinding soul of Monster Hunter. Character customization is deep and charming, areas are colorful and distinct, and combat effects are flashy without being blinding.\nThe soundtrack is chill, sound design nostalgic, and for a PC port of a mobile MMO, Toram looks beautiful — colorful, detailed, and handcrafted. Mobs are varied, animations are charming, and exploration feels cozy and deliberate.\nIt’s not an open-world MMO, but a web of interconnected zones. The map UI is excellent — showing mob and boss locations, drop tables, and area links. If you’ve played Tales of Symphonia or Dragon Quest, exploring Toram will feel instantly intuitive. The UI is clean, consistent, and very user-friendly.\nToram’s new player experience is surprisingly strong. It doesn’t just dump text boxes — you learn by doing. Tutorials are embedded into story missions and exploration, making progression feel natural and satisfying. Systems unlock gradually, giving you time to understand them before new mechanics appear.\n\n⚔️ Mechanics & Gameplay\nCombat is Toram’s bread and butter. There’s no fishing or mining, but what’s here is polished and rewarding. Classes are free-form — no archetypes, just skill trees. You can mix magic, melee, archery, and support however you like, creating hybrid builds similar to Path of Exile.\nIt’s action combat with real dodging, positioning, and combo timing — closer to Monster Hunter than the usual “tap and wait” MMO. Bosses are the highlight: you can set difficulty for better drops, use gems for modifiers, and even break boss parts mid-fight to alter attacks and earn rare materials.\nCombat is simple to learn, challenging to master, and never dull. The combo system lets you chain skills into one button press, keeping things fluid. Numbers are refreshingly grounded — every small stat increase feels impactful.\nYou can solo with mercenaries, pets, or your own alts. Mercenaries are other players’ characters you can hire; you can also register your own. Pets add another layer — they have their own skills, weapons, and natures, and can be trained, fused, and customized.\nQuests — both side and main — are worthwhile. Many side quests are stackable, letting you over-farm quest items and turn them in multiple times for huge EXP boosts. It’s a simple feature but a massive quality-of-life win.\n\n⚒️ Inventory & Crafting\nInventory management is smooth and intuitive. Drops auto-sort into neat categories, and you even have an overflow bag when full.\nCrafting is one of Toram’s biggest strengths. Items break down into material points to save space, and you use these to craft weapons, gear, or consumables. The UI shines here — click an item to see what mob drops it and where. Crafting feels rewarding, not frustrating.\nGear you make actually matters, whether sold on the player economy or worn as best-in-slot. Enhancements use “Crysta,” Toram’s version of FF14’s materia system, for added bonuses.\n\n📜 Story\nToram’s world is newly reformed after a cataclysm, and your character helps rebuild it while uniting divided races and fighting back creeping corruption. It’s straightforward but well-written, with surprisingly polished English localization.\nYour character actually participates in the story — you’re not just watching NPCs talk at each other. You make dialogue choices, and NPCs treat you like a real part of the world. Writing is tight and purposeful, giving enough backstory to make each quest giver feel distinct.\nIt’s not Shakespeare, but it works — and it’s refreshing for a mobile MMO to feel so alive.\n\n💎 Cash Shop & Premium\nThe cash shop is fair and non-predatory. There’s no PvP, so it’s not pay-to-win — more like pay-for-convenience. The $5 monthly premium pass adds small perks: more inventory, EXP boosts, cosmetics, and fast-travel tickets. Cosmetics use a gacha system, but odds feel generous.\nYou can earn premium currency just by playing — achievements and events reward you. The only true monetization nudge is travel tickets, which are optional since manual travel or in-game currency works fine. Toram values design over corporate greed, and it shows.\n\n💻 Performance\nToram runs great on PC and Steam Deck (even though it’s not “officially” supported). Performance is smooth, even in crowded zones, with only minor screen tearing. Controller support isn’t native, but with custom layouts it works perfectly — my DS4 and Steam Deck layouts are on the community page under author WeirdBarbie.\nIt feels like a PS2-era action JRPG — best played with a controller and a Bluetooth keyboard for chat.\nCross-platform play is seamless once you register (just avoid special characters in your password — the login system is picky).\n\n🏡 Community & Economy\nToram’s community is genuinely one of the nicest I’ve seen in an MMO. The player-driven economy feels alive thanks to the Consignment Board (auction house) and player-run shops. Prices fluctuate naturally based on supply and demand — no developer meddling.\nGuilds are cozy social hubs with a shared bar, maze mini-game, and weekly guild quests that level up your guild for bonuses. The vibe feels old-school — like early Runescape or EverQuest — cooperative, helpful, and player-centered.\nPlayer housing (“Lands”) is available to everyone from the start. It’s mostly decorative, with optional cooking buffs and pet storage, but it’s a nice touch for collectors and decorators alike.\n\n🎮 Final Thoughts\nToram Online isn’t trying to compete with giants like FF14 or Black Desert — it’s happily carving out its own niche. It’s deep yet cozy, grindy yet satisfying, and fair to both free and paying players.\nIf you love:\nMonster Hunter’s combat and crafting loop\nFF14’s social storytelling\nAnd the colorful nostalgia of early 2000s JRPGs\n\n…then Toram Online is absolutely worth your time.\nJust be prepared to blink — and realize 100 hours have gone by.",

Here are my thoughts as a casual/solo player:\n\n[h3]Pros[/h3]\n[list]\n    [*]The game has nostalgic retro graphics and a great soundtrack, and the character designs are cute.\n    [*]The story is surprisingly good for an MMO.\n    [*]Combat is fun, and there is no class system so you can use skills from any skill tree.\n    [*]The game still receives regular updates and main story expansions.\n    [*]You can recruit your guild members' characters as NPCs, which makes it much easier to play the game solo.\n    [*]You can farm money fairly easily and buy player-made gear from the auction, which allows you to skip a lot of grinding.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Cons[/h3]\n[list]\n    [*]Combat seems unbalanced. Nearly every attack will kill you in one hit, so gear that increases your health or defense seems useless.\n\n    [*]Refunding your skill points costs premium currency, so you cannot experiment with your build. Instead, if you want to try a different playstyle you need to create and level a new character. The game's systems are a bit convoluted, so you will likely waste skill points if you don't follow a guide.\n\n    [*]You need to create multiple characters for specific purposes since stat points are limited and also cannot be refunded for free. For example, you need a mage character with high luck to farm drops optimally, and you need another character with high vitality to craft gear and consumables with maximum success rate.\n\n    [*]The game was originally designed for mobile devices and is not at all optimized for PC. Even with a good PC, you will find yourself staring at a lengthy loading screen every time you start the game or enter a new area for the first time. The UI is also designed with mobile in mind, so it's often unresponsive and unintuitive.\n\n    [*]You will often find bots spamming links in the chat in the main city, and large groups of bots farming enemies in certain areas.\n\n    [*]A lot of cosmetic items are locked behind a gacha system.\n[/list]\n\nToram Online is a fun MMO to play casually, but not one I can see myself spending thousands of hours in. I'd rate it 6/10.",

And once again I was trolled.\r\nlv101, over 1/3rd of the way through the MSQ and I just don't want to play anymore.\r\nEverything is just poorly designed. \r\nThe combat is extremely basic and practically automatic. The menus are some of the worst I've ever seen [b]Like I honestly could not believe my eyes how awful the menus were, if you don't believe me, be my guest and waste your time seeing for yourself.[/b]\r\nThe zones are barren of players 95% of the time and just have that empty design with excess mobs roaming about. The MSQ boss fights become mathematically impossible to beat without cheating with OP overpriced gear, food buffs, or player NPC mercenaries. \r\nThe story is boring and obvious, you have a FF14 ripoff midget chasing you around ruining what little intrigue there is. There's barely any gear, you farm one new piece of gear maybe every 40+ levels. The economy is completely broken and you get next to no currency from anything. Mobs only drop mats which NOT ONLY clog your extremely limited inventory but also sell for literally nothing at the vendor and are a time consuming pain to sell to other players. You RARELY get currency as a quest reward.\r\nIn the 1/3rd I've played I got about 7k. You need 10k to buy land. You need land to craft a \"fishing workbench\" to start fishing. You then are expected to fish for several hours each month to catch a gambling crate that sells for several million currency just to afford literally anything you may need as a casual player in the broken, botted marketplace. \r\nAnd the fan made wiki for the game you will inevitably need to navigate all this? Outdated and constantly offline.\r\nSo just ask your questions in-game then? No. People ACTUALLY get angry with you for asking for help. And you have to talk in several parted messages because there's like a 30 character limit to each chat message.\r\nAt the end of the day, I've played worse.

And sometimes, when I don't want to attack the enemy, my character still won't stop attacking or having the camera lock onto the enemy even if I try to right click to stop attacking and to exit the targeting mode already. \n\nWhat made me finally lose my patience and ultimately quit the game due to this control issue was when I ended up not being able to tame the Maple Fox monster multiple times simply because of the unreliable targeting and attacking system. My character kept attacking the Maple fox monster non-stop while I was taming it even if I had already been trying to stop my character from attacking.

      "review": "I write this review coming from someone who's played since the beta.  I love this game with all my heart and I keep coming back to it time and time again, even after long breaks.  I give this a negative review mostly due to the developers not really paying attention to the PC port's broken issue (to this day) security system.\n\nSure, RPG devs are not cyber security devs and I understand that they're focusing on growth, but the fact PC players can't really experience this without either breaking TOS, or having to disable their own built in firewall is a bit much.  For your own sake, either call attention to this more with me or just, download the mobile port instead.  It maybe a headache with the way text chat is in the game, but it's better than having to remove vital systems for cyber security, or being outright IP banned for VPN usage.\n\nThat being said, RPG is great.  Decent story, actual good mechanics that have a decent amount of variety due to its unique skill tree system.  You don't have to max it out or basically get restricted to whatever skill only fits your equipment.  I would say the only restrictions in this game are really only being able to invest into two stats at once at minimum, and three stats on different scales if you really know what you're doing.  For beginners reading this: \n\nStrength: You hit harder physically, and deal more critical damage as the hidden bonus stat.  It's great for becoming a glass cannon for halberd, increasing your crit fantasies as a katana, hitting harder with your two handed weapon (be chicken leg or warhammer, or badass sword) and hybrid damage builds (hybrid meaning you can deal both physical and magic damage).  This scales well with 2 Handed Swords and Halberds, scales moderately with 1 Handed Swords, then minorly with Katanas, Knuckles, and Bows.\n\nIntelligence: Magic good, you get 1 free mana point per 100 int investment, and it's a really reliable stat both for and against magic due to magic defense being a part of this stat.  Sure, you need to invest into the last tier of battle skills tree to get crit chance for magic, but it always hits unless if it's a directional magic that is fixed to attack one area, like a magic skill called finale.  A lot of skills also utilize this stat so it's not insane to put this on some outlandish builds, but still keep it within reason, don't bottleneck your skill points for some insane wizard build. This scales well with Staffs and Magic Devices, and some other weapons with int scaling stats that are kind of specific models of weapons.\n\nVitality: It makes your physical armor and HP go up.  Really straight forward but it also helps on the tank builds tremendously.  Knight, Shield, and Darkness skill trees utilize vitality for their own ends, Knight uses it for both offensive and defensive bonuses as well as drawing enemy attention (like a good tank).  Darkness utilizes it on its health consumption power scaling, more HP, more raw damage.  And Shields, it's mostly to boost your resistances, but shields are mostly independent of all scaling besides refinement on said shield.  This only scales with certain armor equipment, and a very select few weapons in terms of damage, this is more about enduring the worst of the worst (unfortunately, not against the rare Fatal Damage).\n\nDexterity: One of the best stats due to the amount of benefits from investment: accuracy, casting speed, small magic, and physical damage increase.  It's used in a stupid amount of damage builds and even used in reliable tank builds due to accuracy being that main thing tanks lack without this.  It scales good with Katanas, Bows, Bowguns, Staves, Magic Devices, scales moderately with 1 Handed Swords, Knuckles, and scales poorly with 2 handed swords.\n\nAgility: This is purely if you're wanting to either cosplay any Jojo character really, or if you love being an evasive person who deals not damage per hit, but damage per second.  This stat helps with evasion regeneration + capacity, and attack speed.  This scales good with Halberds, Knuckles, and scales poorly with Magic Devices.\n\nAnd for the \"hidden\" stats, here's the last summary:\n\nTech; you make equipment good and get 1 free mana point per 100 invested into, basically a smith, alchemist, and refiner's best friend in terms of making god tier equipment, but man it makes said character you invest it into weaker due to low damage scaling. \n\nCrt: very straight forward, just critical chance & damage boost, great on every character who deals in crits (which is almost everyone).\n\nRes: Resist all status ailments like a stoic chad, and really, most status effects are laughable if you're a tank built for every punishment with this stat on.\n\nLuck: your drop rates increase.  And despite what some folks try to gaslight you into: no, it does not effect the party, only yourself.  Damn great for farming materials.\n\nLast part to succeed, research bosses you can farm for good equipment or money making, power level with random folks due to it being harder alone (always ask for parties and don't be afraid to be friendly, everyone's usually nice when it comes to farming most things), and always avoid the text roleplay folks in towns, they're the biggest repulsion to the game, and it happens a lot in all RPGs when it comes to free to play MMORPGs.  Grinds feel nice, the combat loop isn't too similar thankfully, just enough to mix things up to not feel like you're draining your brain when it comes to boss farming due to their AI kind of being chaotic at times, or certain bosses having mechanics that piss them off if you use them, and it can result in a party wipe if you're not careful.",

Of course that's not to mention the fact that they don't moderate the game, they instead use AI to do it, which has led to bugs where people were banned for any reason under the sun, even if you get banned for no reason, the devs say it's your fault, but don't explain at all why, and there's a huge pedo problem that has been completely ignored.",

The community is full of people who will never quit because of the time and money they have spent in this game, or can't look past their nostalgia. The management is terrible, frequent server crashes, a toxic community and microtransactions everywhere.\n\nSpeaking of microtransactions... that's the only area where Asobimo does not disappoint. There's cosmetics for sale, and that would be fine except they're strictly gacha-only. The drop rates are abysmal and cosmetics aren't even guaranteed. There's also an extra enchantment system on your cosmetic slot, where you can add extra stats to your character- in another gacha, of course. Some powerful items that are insanely rare to acquire through regular gameplay are conveniently available in the gacha too. And they're tradable, which is how you can turn your cold hard cash into worthless spina [the in-game currency] if you wish. You can even buy access to what is arguably the best source of XP, Adventurer Diaries, which are basically one-time use items to reset your main campaign and allow you to gain XP from it all over again. \n\nNext up is combat. It's fun at first, something unique and interesting, with a plethora of status effects and afflictions that are either not explained at all or poorly translated within a paragraph with no visual reference. Skill descriptions are so vague and misleading that they aren't even mysterious, just outright terrible. But if you still stick through and decide to slog through the early game, no one will want to party up with you because you're still new, and your damage is miniscule. If you still enjoy the combat and decide to build up your own unique class or playstyle, it won't matter in the endgame as most people follow two paths. You're either a glass cannon dps with zero survivability or you're the tank. Supports and tanky dps exist, but they're usually avoided or even kicked out of parties because most people don't play this game for the combat anyways. Parties want more drops, and that means sticking to the meta, or being kicked. Fast kill parties are mind-numbing and a disappointment to the wider combat system in general. You can directly blame how certain skills are designed to contribute to this.\n\nThe economy is rotting away too, since there's a huge amount of bots, which is obvious as it's the first thing you'll see in the chat as a new player. The main city always has bots advertising spina for sale or even links to scam websites.\n\nTL;DR I wouldn't recommend this to anyone I care about.

And once again I was trolled.\r\nlv101, over 1/3rd of the way through the MSQ and I just don't want to play anymore.\r\nEverything is just poorly designed. \r\nThe combat is extremely basic and practically automatic. The menus are some of the worst I've ever seen [b]Like I honestly could not believe my eyes how awful the menus were, if you don't believe me, be my guest and waste your time seeing for yourself.[/b]\r\nThe zones are barren of players 95% of the time and just have that empty design with excess mobs roaming about. The MSQ boss fights become mathematically impossible to beat without cheating with OP overpriced gear, food buffs, or player NPC mercenaries. \r\nThe story is boring and obvious, you have a FF14 ripoff midget chasing you around ruining what little intrigue there is. There's barely any gear, you farm one new piece of gear maybe every 40+ levels. The economy is completely broken and you get next to no currency from anything. Mobs only drop mats which NOT ONLY clog your extremely limited inventory but also sell for literally nothing at the vendor and are a time consuming pain to sell to other players. You RARELY get currency as a quest reward.\r\nIn the 1/3rd I've played I got about 7k. You need 10k to buy land. You need land to craft a \"fishing workbench\" to start fishing. You then are expected to fish for several hours each month to catch a gambling crate that sells for several million currency just to afford literally anything you may need as a casual player in the broken, botted marketplace. \r\nAnd the fan made wiki for the game you will inevitably need to navigate all this? Outdated and constantly offline.\r\nSo just ask your questions in-game then? No. People ACTUALLY get angry with you for asking for help. And you have to talk in several parted messages because there's like a 30 character limit to each chat message.\r\nAt the end of the day, I've played worse.

My character kept attacking the Maple fox monster non-stop while I was taming it even if I had already been trying to stop my character from attacking.

      "review": "I write this review coming from someone who's played since the beta.  I love this game with all my heart and I keep coming back to it time and time again, even after long breaks.  I give this a negative review mostly due to the developers not really paying attention to the PC port's broken issue (to this day) security system.\n\nSure, RPG devs are not cyber security devs and I understand that they're focusing on growth, but the fact PC players can't really experience this without either breaking TOS, or having to disable their own built in firewall is a bit much.  For your own sake, either call attention to this more with me or just, download the mobile port instead.  It maybe a headache with the way text chat is in the game, but it's better than having to remove vital systems for cyber security, or being outright IP banned for VPN usage.\n\nThat being said, RPG is great.  Decent story, actual good mechanics that have a decent amount of variety due to its unique skill tree system.  You don't have to max it out or basically get restricted to whatever skill only fits your equipment.  I would say the only restrictions in this game are really only being able to invest into two stats at once at minimum, and three stats on different scales if you really know what you're doing.  For beginners reading this: \n\nStrength: You hit harder physically, and deal more critical damage as the hidden bonus stat.  It's great for becoming a glass cannon for halberd, increasing your crit fantasies as a katana, hitting harder with your two handed weapon (be chicken leg or warhammer, or badass sword) and hybrid damage builds (hybrid meaning you can deal both physical and magic damage).  This scales well with 2 Handed Swords and Halberds, scales moderately with 1 Handed Swords, then minorly with Katanas, Knuckles, and Bows.\n\nIntelligence: Magic good, you get 1 free mana point per 100 int investment, and it's a really reliable stat both for and against magic due to magic defense being a part of this stat.  Sure, you need to invest into the last tier of battle skills tree to get crit chance for magic, but it always hits unless if it's a directional magic that is fixed to attack one area, like a magic skill called finale.  A lot of skills also utilize this stat so it's not insane to put this on some outlandish builds, but still keep it within reason, don't bottleneck your skill points for some insane wizard build. This scales well with Staffs and Magic Devices, and some other weapons with int scaling stats that are kind of specific models of weapons.\n\nVitality: It makes your physical armor and HP go up.  Really straight forward but it also helps on the tank builds tremendously.  Knight, Shield, and Darkness skill trees utilize vitality for their own ends, Knight uses it for both offensive and defensive bonuses as well as drawing enemy attention (like a good tank).  Darkness utilizes it on its health consumption power scaling, more HP, more raw damage.  And Shields, it's mostly to boost your resistances, but shields are mostly independent of all scaling besides refinement on said shield.  This only scales with certain armor equipment, and a very select few weapons in terms of damage, this is more about enduring the worst of the worst (unfortunately, not against the rare Fatal Damage).\n\nDexterity: One of the best stats due to the amount of benefits from investment: accuracy, casting speed, small magic, and physical damage increase.  It's used in a stupid amount of damage builds and even used in reliable tank builds due to accuracy being that main thing tanks lack without this.  It scales good with Katanas, Bows, Bowguns, Staves, Magic Devices, scales moderately with 1 Handed Swords, Knuckles, and scales poorly with 2 handed swords.\n\nAgility: This is purely if you're wanting to either cosplay any Jojo character really, or if you love being an evasive person who deals not damage per hit, but damage per second.  This stat helps with evasion regeneration + capacity, and attack speed.  This scales good with Halberds, Knuckles, and scales poorly with Magic Devices.\n\nAnd for the \"hidden\" stats, here's the last summary:\n\nTech; you make equipment good and get 1 free mana point per 100 invested into, basically a smith, alchemist, and refiner's best friend in terms of making god tier equipment, but man it makes said character you invest it into weaker due to low damage scaling. \n\nCrt: very straight forward, just critical chance & damage boost, great on every character who deals in crits (which is almost everyone).\n\nRes: Resist all status ailments like a stoic chad, and really, most status effects are laughable if you're a tank built for every punishment with this stat on.\n\nLuck: your drop rates increase.  And despite what some folks try to gaslight you into: no, it does not effect the party, only yourself.  Damn great for farming materials.\n\nLast part to succeed, research bosses you can farm for good equipment or money making, power level with random folks due to it being harder alone (always ask for parties and don't be afraid to be friendly, everyone's usually nice when it comes to farming most things), and always avoid the text roleplay folks in towns, they're the biggest repulsion to the game, and it happens a lot in all RPGs when it comes to free to play MMORPGs.  Grinds feel nice, the combat loop isn't too similar thankfully, just enough to mix things up to not feel like you're draining your brain when it comes to boss farming due to their AI kind of being chaotic at times, or certain bosses having mechanics that piss them off if you use them, and it can result in a party wipe if you're not careful.",

There's an expensive Gacha system with poor odds, the designs of armors and appearance items are glitchy, with clipping, and in some cases missing necks and detached arms, and the drop rates for limited time only events are so bad, you need a full group of people farming for hours, or even days just to get one thing that you're after. Of course that's not to mention the fact that they don't moderate the game, they instead use AI to do it, which has led to bugs where people were banned for any reason under the sun, even if you get banned for no reason, the devs say it's your fault, but don't explain at all why, and there's a huge pedo problem that has been completely ignored.",

The community is full of people who will never quit because of the time and money they have spent in this game, or can't look past their nostalgia. The management is terrible, frequent server crashes, a toxic community and microtransactions everywhere.\n\nSpeaking of microtransactions... that's the only area where Asobimo does not disappoint. There's cosmetics for sale, and that would be fine except they're strictly gacha-only. The drop rates are abysmal and cosmetics aren't even guaranteed. There's also an extra enchantment system on your cosmetic slot, where you can add extra stats to your character- in another gacha, of course. Some powerful items that are insanely rare to acquire through regular gameplay are conveniently available in the gacha too. And they're tradable, which is how you can turn your cold hard cash into worthless spina [the in-game currency] if you wish. You can even buy access to what is arguably the best source of XP, Adventurer Diaries, which are basically one-time use items to reset your main campaign and allow you to gain XP from it all over again. \n\nNext up is combat. It's fun at first, something unique and interesting, with a plethora of status effects and afflictions that are either not explained at all or poorly translated within a paragraph with no visual reference. Skill descriptions are so vague and misleading that they aren't even mysterious, just outright terrible. But if you still stick through and decide to slog through the early game, no one will want to party up with you because you're still new, and your damage is miniscule. If you still enjoy the combat and decide to build up your own unique class or playstyle, it won't matter in the endgame as most people follow two paths. You're either a glass cannon dps with zero survivability or you're the tank. Supports and tanky dps exist, but they're usually avoided or even kicked out of parties because most people don't play this game for the combat anyways. Parties want more drops, and that means sticking to the meta, or being kicked. Fast kill parties are mind-numbing and a disappointment to the wider combat system in general. You can directly blame how certain skills are designed to contribute to this.\n\nThe economy is rotting away too, since there's a huge amount of bots, which is obvious as it's the first thing you'll see in the chat as a new player. The main city always has bots advertising spina for sale or even links to scam websites.\n\nTL;DR I wouldn't recommend this to anyone I care about.

And once again I was trolled.\r\nlv101, over 1/3rd of the way through the MSQ and I just don't want to play anymore.\r\nEverything is just poorly designed. \r\nThe combat is extremely basic and practically automatic. The menus are some of the worst I've ever seen [b]Like I honestly could not believe my eyes how awful the menus were, if you don't believe me, be my guest and waste your time seeing for yourself.[/b]\r\nThe zones are barren of players 95% of the time and just have that empty design with excess mobs roaming about. The MSQ boss fights become mathematically impossible to beat without cheating with OP overpriced gear, food buffs, or player NPC mercenaries. \r\nThe story is boring and obvious, you have a FF14 ripoff midget chasing you around ruining what little intrigue there is. There's barely any gear, you farm one new piece of gear maybe every 40+ levels. The economy is completely broken and you get next to no currency from anything. Mobs only drop mats which NOT ONLY clog your extremely limited inventory but also sell for literally nothing at the vendor and are a time consuming pain to sell to other players. You RARELY get currency as a quest reward.\r\nIn the 1/3rd I've played I got about 7k. You need 10k to buy land. You need land to craft a \"fishing workbench\" to start fishing. You then are expected to fish for several hours each month to catch a gambling crate that sells for several million currency just to afford literally anything you may need as a casual player in the broken, botted marketplace. \r\nAnd the fan made wiki for the game you will inevitably need to navigate all this? Outdated and constantly offline.\r\nSo just ask your questions in-game then? No. People ACTUALLY get angry with you for asking for help. And you have to talk in several parted messages because there's like a 30 character limit to each chat message.\r\nAt the end of the day, I've played worse.

This lvl 180 metacoenubia boss was the last nail on the coffin for me, i can avoid skillshots and aoes all day, i don't mind getting chunked by unavoidable auto attacks that much, but fighting three bosses at the same time, while evading 3 unsynced skillshots that cover half the map, while autoattacking on every small window to gain mp back so i can actually try to kill the boss (with invulnerability phases too, great job devs!) is just absurd cancer gameplay.. the ranger don't even have the movement speed required to avoid all these! no dashes either! who balanced this clownfest of a fight? the first fight at level 150 with this boss was already extremely poor and had nothing to do with the bossing Toram offered, it's like the devs wanted their cute little \"hard\" boss in the game so they came up with this thing.\r\n\r\nThis hurts man, i really wanted to keep playing but my character is just bricked.. and don't you dare bring raid finder, that thing is dead.",

I have three characters at lvl 250, but cannot go about lvl 250 (max is currently 305) without an excessive grind. Why do I have three characters? Because the stat system does not allow you to play one character. You need to be able to create your own items, but that requires a certain stat and skills which are limited per character. When I finally built my blacksmith, I found that you need to lvl your skill through endless grinding. This game is just a genuine grind, if that is what you want, go for it. The point, nothing special about this game after the current story ends. You are lvl 250 and cannot even 1 v 1 a lvl 250 boss. And no one wants to party. good luck.",

I mean when you played modern game like ZZZ, WuWa, etc, they usually give you invicibility frame (can't get damaged when using skill), especially when the skills have automatic movement. Like when you use reaper sword, jumped 5 metes backward and goes to boss lava zone and died instantly (because the game doesn't care about your armor, and just straight kill you with 100% health).......",
