Now here we are.\n\nAlthough I prefer the story of the first Dead Island, this one has naturally more polished gameplay.\n\nIt had bugs, sure, and some parts of the game were annoying, but I had fun playing Dead Island 2, much more than I expected. Maybe because I played with friends (although I also played the others with friends), and also because we had more characters to choose from compared to its predecessors. I personally love playing with Carla.\n\nThe skill tree is very varied, making it possible to build your character in many ways. There are a lot of cool upgrades and mods for the weapons too, and some weapons have unique designs.\n\nHonestly, I don't think I'd enjoy this game as much if I played solo. The Dead Island franchise is really meant to be played with your buddies.\n\nIt's worth noting that there's a returning character from the first game. I won't spoil which one!",

      "review": "Is it a kinda fun game? Yes it is, but its boring. Coming from someone who finds most games of this genre fun, there is just something missing. Stability is solid. Gameplay is satisfying. However thats about all this game has to offer. It feels oddly soulless to play. One of those games where you can enjoy playing it at the time, but its only getting you by. Just enough fun to prevent you from closing the game and never returning for your first few hours, but you quickly realize there isnt much of any variety left to offer after that. This is just my personal experience with the game. Im not saying you cant or wont enjoy the game, but dont expect it to be a classic you will constantly come back to over the years. \r\n  \r\n  If I had to rate this game out of 10, Id probably give it a 5. Average, but painfully so. Basic gameplay loop is a solid 7. Story is probably 4 or lower, honestly forgettable. Graphics are a high 7. Its biggest sin of course being its oddly boring nature that hits this one hard for me. Id recommend this game only if you can get it $20 or lower.\r\n\r\n  Despite everything Ive said, I still gave it a thumbs up. Its an average game. As far as I know, there isnt any predatory microtransactions, its stable, and fun enough to get you by for awhile. There are far worse games and business practices out there.\r\n\r\nCheers and love you :3",

And yet somehow it came out decent. Its short, unpolished in many aspects and has very mediocre narratives... so its essentially on par with the first game. Which isn't bad, because despite the first shortcomings it was fun to play; and so is this.",

      "review": "It really is amazing that Dead Island 2 emerged at all, considering it (kind of like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2) survived roughly a decade of \"coming soon\"ness to finally appear after all.  And in Dead Island 2's case it was stripped from two other developers over that decade (not to mention seemingly never in development from the original two games' developer Techland, another red flag for a game that might never come out).  So not only is it amazing that this game even came out, it is even more amazing that it is basically a wholly logical and enjoyable extension of the first two games, even picking up exactly in continuity without any (obvious anyway) retconning of the backstory; as someone who even plays zombie parkour games in part for the lore, I definitely appreciated that one.\r\n\r\nAnyway this is probably the most horrific game ever made in terms of body horror and gore, possibly topped this year by Dying Light: the Beast, but still, you can tell the developers really, really wanted every last person with even a tiny bit of squeamishness to stay far away from it.  I assume they succeeded?  Someone who is nauseated by gore check in and let me know.\r\n\r\nIf you have played any other zombie parkour-type game you know exactly what to expect here, though admittedly the parkour elements are more developed in the Dying Light line.  You get weapons, kill zombies, get better weapons, kill more nightmarish zombies, and after a VERY reasonable amount of time you win!  Seriously, I cannot praise Dead Island 2 enough for not overstaying its welcome.  Just about the time I was thinking to myself \"all right, even average hordes of zombies are starting to have too many weird variant miniboss-types to be fun\" I was at the end, and completing the game provides you with some added combat boosts directly and indirectly that then make you feeling less overwhelmed (if you want to keep playing or do the expansions or whatever).  I mean I beat the base game and one of the expansions in about 30 hours; that is a great length for a game like this to last.  I still remember being about 100 hours into Days Gone with the third \"this must be the end ... wait there is ANOTHER NEW MAP AREA?\" moment and wondering whether I had the stamina for it.  I mean, I DID, but I would definitely have cut about a third of that game out personally.\r\n\r\nJust gonna ramble meaninglessly now like I just did up there.  Boy it sure is fun when you have to shoot a zombie 50 times in the head to kill it huh?  No but like, by and large I love the combat here; I played Amy, a famously bad choice if you enjoy hand-to-hand fighting seemingly, but I gotta say once the game gave me my first gun I immediately took to it as a zombie military simulator instead.  I imagine the more hardy characters make the short-range fighting a lot more interesting than \"oh I am instantly dead again from a thing I did not even see coming exploding something near me\" moments I had a dozen times.  But yeah, super-fun game, definitely worth checking out, even if I am not sure how excited I am for the next new generation of Hyperrealistic Human Organ Detonation Simulator.",

      "review": "制作武器+砍杀僵尸+第一人称，这类游戏的竞品好像除了消逝的光芒就没有了。但是消逝的光芒2拉了一坨大的，所以相比之下，死亡岛2更适合我的口味。\r\n总体来说，死亡岛2没有那么多花里胡哨的系统，因为游戏没有难度可以选，所以你就算不用什么卡牌，职业随便挑，也能通关，当然了，如果职业选得好，卡牌配得好，武器改装得好就像切菜一样。\r\n推荐打折后直接买黄金版。\r\n\r\n硬要说游戏有什么缺点，也有，但不影响整体的游戏体验：\r\n1.废物卡牌偏多或者不够形成体系。比如说眺踢和飞踢本来就是辅助技能，你加了卡牌也没什么伤害，更不可能作为主攻技能（如果能主攻还要武器干什么）而且相关卡牌也不够填满所有的技能栏位。\r\n2.后期伤害很高但是防御偏低。除了个别职业可以把防御拉满（坚韧或者说物理抗性45%），其他 职业都做不到。虽然完美防御可以无伤，但是相比坚韧高的职业容错率就是低。\r\n3.元素伤害趋同化严重。除了电击带控制YYDS（站在水里一起被电也是真的麻），其他火焰、腐蚀、流血都是持续性伤害，而且那点伤害还不如我多砍几刀来的快。\r\n4.武器平衡性差。高速武器的DPS更高，而且施加的状态效果也更快，所以电击武士刀打得怪物几乎没有反击的余地。有些橙装的属性更是没法看 ，能用的也就AK（但是DLC里你特么的居然让有些BOSS对流血免疫）。\r\n5.挑战的进度设置不够合理。比如打开3000个箱子，我通关了也就完成了2000次。又比如外卖僵尸和蜂群僵尸，后期几乎遇不到。",

The story is largely forgettable (though there is a nice twist at the end) and the sterotyped characters can be genuinely annoying. However, the gameplay makes up for it. It is incredibly fun to collect weapons, modify them to your playstyle, and slash through hordes of zombies.\n\nThe gore system is the best I've seen, rivaled only by the most recent releases. The procedural damage is impressive: you can really see the impact of blunt weapons and the deep slices of sharp ones on the zombie models.\n\nHowever most unique legendary weapons can only be acquired after the main story is finished and new side quests emerge. Given how central the weapons with unique aspects are to the gameplay, this is a real shame because it feels like extending the playtime unnecessarily.\n\nGraphics and sound design were above average. I did experience some driver crashes, but these were solved by reinstalling the game and disabling FSR2.\n\nEven though I played Dead Island 2 solo, I think it really shines as a gory Co-Op experience where you can bring mayhem to HELL-A with friends.\n\nVerdict: Grab it from the bargain bin if you search for a gory zombie slasher.",

I've been playing with another person which makes it more fun and interesting but I think it would be just as good going solo. There is very little to no bugs with the game from personal experience. With so many side quests to do if you get bored of the main story you can always detach yourself and do the endless amount of side quests. The graphics and physics of this game are amazing with dynamic zombies.

I don't think anyone expected them to create such a superb game after 14 years of development hell. You can stage a brutally bloody and spectacular massacre in it, all with absurd humor. I think the 'card' skill system missed the mark—it's not bad and offers plenty of variety, but I would have preferred a skill tree. Technically, it has been nicely fixed up by now; I only had maybe two crashes. For me, it was far more entertaining than DYING LIGHT.\r\n\r\nThe DLCs aren't bad, although SOLA is, in my opinion, less entertaining than the base game or the HAUS DLC.",

      "review": "im very pleasantly surprised. yall have made 15 year old me very happy\r\n\r\nalright. im 24 hours into this game and it is a very interesting experience for me. i played the first dead island when it came out back in 2011. i was in highschool, to this day it is still my most memorable zombie game ive ever played. mostly for 2 things, the setting: having a zombie game on such a beautiful island setting was such a cool new experience. and the game feel: i remember hitting a zombie in the face with an oar for the first time and it was the first time in a game where i really felt the melee connect. like you FELT when that oar cracked them in the face. \r\n\r\nnow we all know the development hell this game went through and to be honest i really figured this game to be a lost cause and expected it to be a half baked game that the developer just flopped out to save whats left of their already financially torn apart ass, because thats what we've come to expect now a days from these developers. but i gotta say that i am very pleasantly surprised with this game. its fun! \r\n\r\noriginally in the first couple hours the combat did not feel good. it kinda felt lame like that connection of the weapons felt off, kinda like they wouldnt react right when they were hit, but that was firstly my fault as the player because i hadnt learned the combat system well enough yet but ill tell ya, once you learn the flow of your swings and where to aim it is VERY satisfying especially with the claw hammer and the golf club. you FEEL when you connect with a zombies jaw and their head snaps back. its done very well. alot of the big weapons just make them fly away and rag doll kinda lazily but if youre looking for that good crack of a melee weapon hitting, its definitely in this game. the gore is fantastic as well. great job on that. \r\n\r\nthe setting is done very well too. the color pallets are very rich and broad. it doesnt get boring to look at and i think thats important.\r\n\r\nso from a dude in his 30s now who loved the first game and went through the DECADE waiting for this game and being very apprehensive to play it in the fear of it being trash, its not. they made a very solid game that i am very much enjoying. its worth your time if you loved the first one.",

Great-looking LA zones, very satisfying limb-by-limb carnage, and enough side jobs to keep you roaming. It is not deep, and there are rough edges, but I had a good time.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]What It Is[/h1]\nFirst person action RPG set in a quarantined Los Angeles. You pick a Slayer with unique perks, fight through themed districts, scavenge parts, mod weapons with elements like fire or acid, do side quests, and push the main story about escaping the outbreak.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]World & Visuals[/h1]\nLA is split into chunky zones that still feel big: beach fronts, upscale neighborhoods, neon strips, malls, studios. Environmental detail is excellent and the art direction sells the setting. Just walking around and taking in the scenery was a win.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Combat & Gore[/h1]\nThis is where it clicks. Weapons hit hard, elemental effects stack in satisfying ways, and the gore system delivers nasty, readable feedback every swing. Enemy variety plus status combos kept me engaged from start to finish.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Slayers, Builds, Weapons[/h1]\nMultiple playable characters with different starting stats and innate perks. Swapping characters gives the game some replay value. Weapon modding is simple and fun, but durability is a drag. Tools break and need repairs more often than I’d like, which slows the flow.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Quests & Structure[/h1]\nMain story is straightforward. Side quests are decent and send you across zones with light puzzles and fetch steps. At times the objective text and markers were vague enough that I had to look things up. Lost & Found style treasure hunts are the most repetitive, and the bounty-style chores tied to specific “brain rot” enemies was annoying.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Performance & Stability[/h1]\nGenerally smooth for me with a few noticeable hiccups in certain areas. Nothing show-stopping, but not spotless either.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Co-op[/h1]\nDrop in with friends and the game shines. Mobbing through mansions and boardwalks while chaining status effects is the ideal way to play.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]DLC[/h1]\nTwo story add-ons: Haus and SOLA Festival. I wasn’t into Haus much, but SOLA’s festival setting in LA was a fun detour.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]What Works[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Gorgeous, highly detailed zones that are fun to explore\n[*] Punchy melee with great dismemberment and elemental combos\n[*] Multiple Slayers that change your starting feel and perks\n[*] Co-op elevates everything\n[/list]\n\n[hr]\n[h1]What Falls Short[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Weapon durability and repairs feel too aggressive\n[*] Some side objectives are unclear without a guide\n[*] Lost & Found and bounty-style tasks get repetitive\n[*] Occasional performance dips\n[/list]\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nThumbs up, especially on sale. If you want a deep RPG, this is not it. If you want flashy LA vistas, crunchy melee, and a steady loop of zombie shredding, Dead Island 2 delivers.",

Fights are brutal, bloody, and unpredictable, and the body explosions and weapon effects can still surprise even after many hours of playing. The variety of weapons and attacks gives each fight a different rhythm and allows creative approaches to combat.\r\n\r\nThe game world is big and full of life. There are hidden corners, abandoned buildings, and small details that give each area a unique atmosphere. The story is not too complicated, but it is engaging enough to keep going through missions and follow how events develop.\r\n\r\nDead Island 2 combines the spirit of the previous games with new ideas. The game surprises with dynamic fights and a good dose of adrenaline, while also letting players explore a detailed world full of secrets. It gives many hours of satisfying gameplay and keeps the series' strong rhythm and atmosphere. [b] Solid recommendation from me, especially if you plan to play with friends. [/b]",

The combat is somehow both really weighty in that swings seem to be quite slow but they also seem to have no momentum to them so crashing a sledgehammer into a zombie feels like you're wailing on it with a pool noodle.  It feels like early game Fallout 3, New Vegas or Oblivion on 'very hard' but every enemy you're fighting is scaled 20 levels above you - so you are just swinging on even the basic enemies, sometimes you're fighting 10 of them, and each of them takes 5-8 swings to take down it becomes very tedious. The 'special zombies' are also horrendously unbalanced. A random slightly off-the-beaten-path area  ~60 mins into the game has zombies with red skulls on their healthbars that the game says you shouldnt try and fight - but why are they here if so? They don't seem to be guarding anything. The tank zombies are just utterly anti-fun to fight. You block the shockwave, run in, heavy attack, move back and repeat untl it dies. This is the same for every single tank zombie you encounter in the game. \n\nI dunno man. I'm a huge fan of Dead Island 1 and this feels like a very appropriate Dead Island sequel where the good aspects of DI1 have been amplified but so have the bad ones.

Why can't i trade with my friends like in the first ones?\nSecond the Damage over times .. how much bullshit can be added to the ground? The electric cables, caustic tanks, explosive tanks, oil tanks, you turn around and shit starts exploding and doing damage over time, its literaly worse than in borderlands.\nAlso what is this card deck? What even is the point in picking your character if everyone in the end gets the same cards anyway? why not a proper skill tree like there was before?\nThe characters? Absolute cringe fest, but sure has to be in the age of \"diversity\" cant have any normal humans.\nQuests? Fetch this go there, nothing to it, boring all in all\n\nAdding more points: The infinitely and instantly respawning zombies, clear an area, turn a corner and move back? Zombies are respawned\n\nEnding? Rushed with a bad final boss\n\nIt is a huge let down compared to the first one",

Then I waited even longer for it to go on sale for $20 for all the content, not worth the wait, definitely glad I got it on a deep sale, otherwise I would have been getting a refund.\n\nThe game has zero plot and every quest is basically the same thing, go here, find a key, open a locked door, now go kill some super zombie and get another key to open another door. On top of opening doors with keys, you'll be backtracking to locations you've already visited to, so you can unlock safes with keys that drop off of unique zombies, that just randomly spawn in certain areas... sound tedious? It is.\n\nThe weapon system is bleh as well... You find a weapon, mod it with a specific element so you can complete weapon challenges to earn paltry stat boosts. Challenges such as, slay 250 zombies with shock, fire, caustic damage...etc.. From what I've seen, Katana Blades are basically the go to weapon, just like they were in Dead Island. The impact of Sledge Hammers feels good, but they're slow and not efficient when dealing with more than a few zombies at once.\n\nThe card system is generally worthless... There are only a few cards that actually help you in all general settings of combat, otherwise, they're specific attack based and very situational. The challenges are what keep the combat fresh, after you reach the goals, you never want to use certain techniques or weapon types after that because they're just inefficient. Handguns are terrible and certain weapons like the brass knuckles feel fun but they're weak at the end game... There's novelty weapons like meat mallets, hammers, crow bars and other worthless crap... but Sledges, Katanas, Rifles and Shotguns are the ones you want.\n\nIt feels like a slog at all times honestly... Once you're done killing zombies in every possible way the game wants you to, the only thing left is efficiency, and that boils down to just running past everything, avoiding fights and reaching your destination as quickly as possible. I've been playing this for 20+ hours, I can't even tell you what the game is even about... It's just you trying to escape L.A. and running in to other peoples problems, except their problems almost have nothing to do with you escaping... just \"get me a gun\", \"go restore water to the building and maybe we'll talk.\"\n\nThere was more of a plot on the first game and a mystery surrounding the outbreak... Now it's mostly just about going from point A to point B so you can get to point C and then run back to point A again, so you can check in on the people you were originally trying to help, and in between all that, slaughtering zombies.\n\nThe gore effects are cool and stuff but this game gives me mad vertigo for some reason... It's all the frantic looking and running around and aiming at specific body parts on zombies etc... after a while it makes you dizzy. \n\nAt the end of the day, this game was 10 years of hype and the delivery was just that, 10 year old mediocre and generic game play. It's basically just Dead Island 1 with a face lift and a much more linear map. Everything seems overwhelming at first but there's so many blockades and dead end streets that you start to realize the maps aren't as complex as they look. This actually might be a good thing because Dead Island 1 had some serious navigational issues...\n\nEither way, final verdict, it's not worth the time spent on it, I've been playing it for 20 hours, feels like 60... like it's just boring. There's also a NG+ mode, so they expect you to run through this entire thing again for a single achievement... No thanks. Definitely a one and done for me... if I ever do end up finishing it. \n\nIt's mid at best. If you can get it on a deep sale or even get it for free on Epic/Game Pass, I would suggest doing that... definitely not worth it at full price.",

The combat is somehow both really weighty in that swings seem to be quite slow but they also seem to have no momentum to them so crashing a sledgehammer into a zombie feels like you're wailing on it with a pool noodle.  It feels like early game Fallout 3, New Vegas or Oblivion on 'very hard' but every enemy you're fighting is scaled 20 levels above you - so you are just swinging on even the basic enemies, sometimes you're fighting 10 of them, and each of them takes 5-8 swings to take down it becomes very tedious. The 'special zombies' are also horrendously unbalanced. A random slightly off-the-beaten-path area  ~60 mins into the game has zombies with red skulls on their healthbars that the game says you shouldnt try and fight - but why are they here if so? They don't seem to be guarding anything. The tank zombies are just utterly anti-fun to fight. You block the shockwave, run in, heavy attack, move back and repeat untl it dies. This is the same for every single tank zombie you encounter in the game. \n\nI dunno man. I'm a huge fan of Dead Island 1 and this feels like a very appropriate Dead Island sequel where the good aspects of DI1 have been amplified but so have the bad ones.

The look of this game is amazing- so vibrant and beautiful. And the gore is so good, I loved the carnage when fighting.\n\nThis game immediately holds your hand so damn hard I'm surprised I wasn't on a moving track the whole time just watching the game play for me. The whole thing that made the original Dead Island so good, was as soon as you did the intro, it was OPEN WORLD! I didn't get tunneled exactly where to go at all times! I wanna have fun! Lol.\n\nThe beginning of ANY plot or story should always be the most engaging, or at least somewhat interesting- this is writing 101. This game does not do that whatsoever. From janky mechanics, poor writing and to then  making a somehow boring combat sequence- it was all executed terribly.\n\nThe character choices are very bland to say the least? I don't know if they're just not my cup of tea or if they're unlikable. (it's subjective) Me personally, none of the characters really stood out as \"Oh! I wanna be them!\" which is really a bummer.\n\nThe general dialogue is so insufferably \"millennial\" that even a minute into the intro I'm already tapped out. NOBODY talks like this! Unless is this some sort of edgy take on how people from LA talk? If that's the case then the punchline isn't set up to be sarcastic or meta-humorous.

While the game has cool, bloody fights, the main experience has problems that stop it from being as good as the first game.\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue is the melee fighting. Even though the game is all about killing zombies up close and has a cool \"FLESH\" system to break them apart, the fighting itself feels awkward and not very smooth. After finishing the whole game, I still found myself annoyed by how each swing felt. It just doesn't feel good or right, which is super important for a game focused on smashing the undead.\r\n\r\nOn top of the gameplay, the story is a big weakness. For a game that took almost 10 years to make, the story is all over the place and not very deep. It doesn't give you a good reason to keep playing, leaving you with an empty feeling where an interesting story should have been. It's a missed chance to build on the world of the first game.\r\n\r\nAnother frustrating thing is the environment itself. While I understand why they made it fun, with all the explosions and things to mess with, it can be really annoying. Sometimes, the environment will just randomly explode and kill you, all because you killed a zombie and it started a chain reaction you didn't see coming.\r\n\r\nAdding to the frustration is having to use the Epic Games platform. As someone who tries to keep anything from Epic off my computer, this was an instant and annoying problem that made the whole experience worse from the start.\r\n\r\nIn the end, my feeling about Dead Island 2 is the same as my feeling about the Dying Light series. The first game was amazing and a perfect 10/10. The sequel, on the other hand, was just \"meh,\" and didn't have the same magic as the original. Dead Island 2 follows that same bad pattern. Even with its fun moments, it's not the sequel fans waited years to play.",

      "review": "I'll write this review in fair comparison to the original and Riptide, which I believe are objectively superior to Dead Island 2.\n \nGoing against the flow of positive comments, I heavily dislike the game, and I find it utterly worse than the original in every aspect, save for the graphics and gore system. In many ways, it feels like I'm not playing a game from the Dead Island franchise, and I'm convinced that this installment should have owned up to being it's own thing. It's not a bad game in and of itself, but being released under the same franchise name sets up unrealistic expectations, which Dead Island 2 simply does not live up to.\n \n[h1][i]Stylistic Clash[/i][/h1]\nSwapping out the original horror and grit for a fresh and comedic take on the zombie genre can be an interesting idea, but it comes back to bite itself in the neck. The humor is stale, the dialogue cheeky, and the tone uninspired. Dead Island 2 just does not know what it wants to be, switching back and forth between serious and cartoony way too frequently. Is it a zombie survival game? Is it a parody of other zombie titles? Does it want to be its own thing? \n \nDesperate attempts to cram in references to the originals, while also doing away with them completely, causes the game to fall into this limbo of corny mediocrity. I honestly can't remember any specific moment beyond the general areas, as the game blends and smears together into this shallow puddle of forgettability.\n \n[h1][i]Weightless[/i][/h1]\nIf I had to describe Dead Island 2 in just one word, it would be this one. The atmosphere, story, tone, exploration, gameplay depth, the entire identity of this game can be described as having no weight to it, not even through the poorly executed comedic direction. Dead Island 2 doubled down on [i]style over substance[/i], and the studio thought it could be carried by the gore tech, upgraded graphics and the franchise name alone, and neglected all other aspects that made Dead Island and Riptide, although flawed, such an enjoyable experience.\n \nLeaning into tragedy and horror, the original felt oppressive, unsettling, and lonely at times. Your presence in Banoi and Palanai was [i]actually important[/i] to its survivors, and through the story, [i]consequences were felt[/i]. This sequel can only be described as a colorful, shallow, segmented playground. Nothing you do brings a true sense of payoff or satisfaction, which is quintessentially reflected in how abruptly the main story ends. \n \nThen the two DLCs were released, which I hoped would continue the story. Even though this would have been a very scummy move, it would have made sense to further the narrative of escaping a zombie infested '[i]Hell-A'[/i]. Instead we got Haus, which adds absolutely no value to the game except for proposing the interesting concept of surreality within the genre, and SoLa, which attempts to dive deeper into the premise of you being a [spoiler]Numen[/spoiler], but leaves you with more questions than it answers.\n \n[h1][i]Regressive Gameplay[/i][/h1]\nAs a fan of the gritty and desperate vibe most zombie games have, I must say I am disappointed in how Dead Island 2 managed to dumb down on all aspects of gameplay, like the weapon system and skill building aspects. All of these come together to form an unpolished, unfinished prototype-y system that developers would use to debug. \n \nIn stark contrast to the original, where you had to scrounge for parts and weapons, consider which modifications to apply, craft throwables and select which skills in your characters' skilltree to unlock/upgrade, Dead Island 2 decided to stick to a system where weapons can be upgraded and modded with no limitations, where throwables 'recharge' and where skills are infinitely swappable. The game fears asking players to make commitments to their choices, which is exactly what a zombie game needs to reinforce one of its crucial themes: consequence of actions.\n \n[h1][i]Hell-A: Enough is Enough[/i][/h1]\nLos Angeles is a beautiful city with many different locations like Beverly Hills, Hollywood, Downtown, Venice Beach. But let's be honest, it's not original in any way. Choosing LA was a lazy choice, the easy road, which is the common thread throughout this game. Introducing Banoi and Palanai, inspired by the many island groups surrounding Papua New Guinea, was a great choice for a zombie setting. While fictional, it was still grounded and graspable. Coinciding with the virus origin being Kuru which is also found there, it makes for a very enjoyable, interesting and deep-dive experience. \n \nI ended up searching up more information about Kuru and Papua New Guinea outside of the game, which made the game even more immersive (stuff like the Japanese bunkers was awesome to see). Dead Island 2 rather wants to rely on the big US city trope, which was already outdated when the original Dead Island released. A better choice that would have allowed for more creative freedom would have been Hawaii, the Australian coastline, or an Asian country like Vietnam or Taiwan.\n \n[h1][i]A Dissapointing Entry[/i][/h1]\nThis game is a slap in the face of fans of Dead Island and Riptide. It retcons nearly everything while still cramming in references, and manages to downgrade almost everything that made the originals so iconic; story, tone, theme, narrative weight, gameplay and creativity. The story is haphazardly connected, the theming bland and unconnected. Narrative and thematic weight is dropped in favor of uninspiring and corny humor and lackluster pop-culture references. The gameplay is a shell of what could have been, offering no value and barely any replayability. Creativity left the door through the many years of developer hell, ending up with the studio opting to just choose the laziest way to finally get this title out there.\n \nWhile the [i]FLESH [/i]system (the procedural system that allows for anatomically correct damage to zombies) and the upgraded graphics [b][u]really do[/u][/b] look awesome and deserve all the praise they get, the developers relied too much on those gimmicks, as well as the franchise name, to release this title. Dead Island 2 should have been a standalone, its own installment, to avoid limiting itself to the groundwork and expectations the previous titles laid down. With creative adjustments to the story, theme and gameplay, this title truly could have been great.\n \n[h1][b][i][u]Final Rating - 3/10[/u][/i][/b][/h1]",

Well, as it turns out, there's a lot not to like: A constant connection to Epic Online Services and the presence of Denuvo Anti-tamper on a single player game, non-competitive game are mind boggling but, to a degree, forgivable. You know what's not forgivable? Having to play as a smarmy, self-indulgent twit who just WILL. NOT. SHUT UP! \n\nIf you want to change the fundamental game systems that made Dead Island and Riptide so fun - that's your (incredibly risky) choice as a developer. You own the IP, you can do with it as you want. Why not throw in a skateboarding session in the middle or a minigame where you can romance the zombies -- after all, you clearly aren't as interested in making a \"Dead Island\" game as you in tricking folks like me into thinking you have. But when the opening prologue is the game trying to make me care about inherently unlikable people then forcing me to play as one who makes quips every single time he does ANYTHING, I can feel my teeth start to grind. \n\nAnd what awaits me at the end of a linear tutorial sequence that somehow treats people buying a M-rated 'sequel' zombie game as if they've never played a video game before? Some of the worst written \"comedy\" that a game who's tags include \"Horror\" should simply never have and your first zombie kill of the game in the form of a DDR-style button mashing sequence culminated in your unlikable protagonast yelling \"You're boring me!\"\n\nAnd he was right. I was being bored. The game was boring me. The design choices were boring me. The fact that I could feel the aftershocks of an untalented writing team with a hip-high stack of studio notes and demands trying to shoehorn loads of approximate \"comedy\" into this zombie survival horror game, was boring me. I was in the game for 20 minutes and that's purely because I was AFK for 10.\n\nIf you can't make a realistic and likable character for the player to play as, you should really consider going the silent protagonist route. This was a hugely disappointing experience to such an extent that I authentically don't know how this game has ~75% positive reviews, unless standards have fallen so far that the masses are happy with anything that doesn't show them ads every two minutes.",
