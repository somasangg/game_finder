During the demo I had no connection issues and the game ran smoothly. The combat requires real strategy beyond pointing and shooting. Having to factor in the wind, ammo type, and size of your ship compared to the enemy's will determine the result. Having a boarding mechanic is also a nice touch (unlike a AAAA game) and it has a little mini-game that doesn't make you just sit and watch for 50/50 result. Whether you're a person who likes to play solo or with friends there are ways to get around having to fight stronger vessels. For the solo players, you can add ships you've defeated in a boarding to your fleet and for the MMO players, you can create/join a guild on full release.\n\nThe game's open-world structure doesn't have a story, but it has a lot of freedom and progression. There are many ships to unlock and upgrade throughout your playtime. Whether you want to be a pirate, a trader, or apart of the military you can choose what you want to do or be apart of freely.\n\nI was only disappointed with the fishing mechanic. I do enjoy a fishing mini-game whenever they're available, but here it's a press of a button. I do hope it's a placeholder until there is one added. Please devs I beg of you!\n\nDespite that, the demo was a great experience, I wasn't able to get too far into the game, but with the game releasing soon I'm excited to get into the world and see what it has to offer.",

The world feels truly alive — even with a smaller player base, you’ll be surprised how often you cross paths with others out in the open seas.\n\nPvP is intense, rewarding, and perfectly balanced between risk and reward. But the real magic lies in exploration — the open world is bursting with life and adventure! One minute you’re teaming up with strangers to sink a merchant convoy, and the next you’re hunting down bounties on rival players.\n\nThere’s just so much to dive into that words don’t do it justice. Honestly, the best thing I can say is: give it a try. It’s free, and you even get 5 days of premium to start your journey.\n\nGood luck out there, captain — see you on the seas! ⚓🔥",

Having a boarding mechanic is also a nice touch (unlike a AAAA game) and it has a little mini-game that doesn't make you just sit and watch for 50/50 result. Whether you're a person who likes to play solo or with friends there are ways to get around having to fight stronger vessels. For the solo players, you can add ships you've defeated in a boarding to your fleet and for the MMO players, you can create/join a guild on full release.\n\nThe game's open-world structure doesn't have a story, but it has a lot of freedom and progression. There are many ships to unlock and upgrade throughout your playtime. Whether you want to be a pirate, a trader, or apart of the military you can choose what you want to do or be apart of freely.\n\nI was only disappointed with the fishing mechanic. I do enjoy a fishing mini-game whenever they're available, but here it's a press of a button. I do hope it's a placeholder until there is one added. Please devs I beg of you!\n\nDespite that, the demo was a great experience, I wasn't able to get too far into the game, but with the game releasing soon I'm excited to get into the world and see what it has to offer.",

I can say without a doubt that with proper care and regular future updates/content by the developers, this game can surpass all the other titles that has thus far been created. This game has an old school vibe meets new generation feel. I am excited to see this game succeed and make big waves in the age of sail community once released. plus its free :)",

The world feels truly alive — even with a smaller player base, you’ll be surprised how often you cross paths with others out in the open seas.\n\nPvP is intense, rewarding, and perfectly balanced between risk and reward. But the real magic lies in exploration — the open world is bursting with life and adventure! One minute you’re teaming up with strangers to sink a merchant convoy, and the next you’re hunting down bounties on rival players.\n\nThere’s just so much to dive into that words don’t do it justice. Honestly, the best thing I can say is: give it a try. It’s free, and you even get 5 days of premium to start your journey.\n\nGood luck out there, captain — see you on the seas! ⚓🔥",
