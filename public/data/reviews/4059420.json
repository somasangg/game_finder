      "review": "I've played the 2 playtest and the current demo. It's a survival coop russian fallout game similar to STALKER or games like that. I found the game intriguing and wanted to play it. Here's what I got to say about it in its current state.\n\nPro\n- Opening is awesome, you have a limited time to grab what you can and reach the bunker before the bombs hit. very neat and affects how you start out.\n- Coop, I like being able to play with people I know so it's a plus\n- Randomzied area, every day is something different so it's not as predictable. Familiar areas but mixed around.\n- Mainly improvements, there were mainly QoL that the game need or general improvements and the devs do a pretty good job listening to the community. There are many negatives I could have listed but they either fixed it or toned down certain things.\n- I like that the environment can harm other enemies too so I would lure a bandit into black holes and they die from them.\n\nMeh\n- Flashlight is weak, not as helpful at night as you'd expect when it goes dark. Suggestion: Make it stronger or have a stronger one we can build, and also maybe a miner helmet with a light we can craft by combining flashlight and the hard hat.\n- The game has moments where they don't explain where you get certain items and I think this issue could be solved by having it be available for purchase from the shop.\n- Not crazy about the crafting UI where you have to click the tables on top to switch between the 2 functions. Suggestion: top window = items, bottom window = things you can craft.\n- Not being able to swap items in your inventory, you must move an item out of the way to be able to put your item in the places you want. could be a good QoL for item management.\n- No auto sort button for your inventory to easily arrange things, would be nice option.\n- optimization issues but they're working on it.\n\nCon\n- Bandits are stupid, as in intellectually dumb. They rush you until death. They have no self preservation such as retreating when low on health after taking a beating, seeing their allies go down especially their most powerful one, or witnessing me with a gun that can end them all, or just observing before determining if they should attack. No, they fear no death and will charge you. Suggestion: Moral system where they determine if they should keep attacking or retreat. And a behaviour system where maybe some are aggressive and will fight to the death, cowards who will flee at the sight of others or when hit once, cautious, where unless you pose a threat to them they won't attack you.\n-- Speaking of bandits and enemies in general, they don't drop what they're equipped with(with some exceptions), very annoying that you can't strip them of their gear when you kill them and just find nothing on them.\n--- ALSO the bandits only roam in certain set areas so it's predictable where you'll encounter bandits, they should be roaming around and maybe even getting into fights with other bandits.\n- Melee combat is not great, it works but basically whoever hits faster and harder will win the battle, but you're always going to generally take some hits and this really incentivizes you to find a gun to avoid melee.\n- At the moment, there's not many threats to deal with, so a lot of the time, I'm just running into a location and getting stuff asap and getting out. There use to be these bigfoot enemies in the tutorial but you don't really see them.\n- Most crafting tables needing electricity; It's infuriating that I craft a new craft table and see I need to power it. It makes sense for some but almost all of the crafting tables need power. The ammo crafting should not need electricity to manually craft. Suggestion: Option to craft without power but you must be at the table and can have the table auto craft if there's power.\n- The toxic players that can easily come into your room and try to kill you(what they don't know is I was packing) for laughs. Anyone can join in your room regardless of your code. Good news, they added kick function and setting your room to only have a certain amount of people helps.\n- The high jump anomaly, there's no counter play to that. you walk in you get flung into the sky and most likely will die. it should just be occasional explosions that propel you that you can time to run past.\n- Can't build outside your base, was annoyed that we couldn't build in the front yard and that all building materials are just for your bunker.\n- Certain houses or buildings that are fake and can't be accessed, annoying and probably just a placeholder for now as some houses did in fact get rooms in recent updates.\n- Shopkeep only sells item once, why? I bought ammo once and couldn't again because they're out of stock.\n- Only 10 days, would be nice if they just put an infinite mode for us to play as many of the things the devs want you to do within the 10 days, needs you to speedrun the game to gather the resources in order to do them. I was at day 10 when I finally got the advance crafting table.(you can save and reload the game to keep playing infinitely for the time being)\n- Can't see my devices in the dark, my compass and busel are blacked out in the dark and I can't see them. they should have a glow in the dark or light up feature when it goes dark.\n- No dual wielding 1-handed items. I should be able to hold a flashlight and a 1-handed weapon to navigate and fight in the dark.\n- Can't attache flashlight to certain guns, I would have really like it if you could attache a flashlight to your gun to be able to see at night to shoot. it's dumb that I have to keep switching between flashlight to see and weapon to hit things.\n- The insanity meter, they didn't have it before, but they added it and it's not really fleshed out that well. it just makes you crazy, inverts your controls, and curing it from 100% is difficult because it regenerates the insanity which is stupid and only death will save you ironically.\n\nSuggestions: When the sirens go off, reuse the timer from the starting day to show how much time we got before the emission hits.\n\nOverall, I'm looking forward to the full game. The game is getting better and better and I can't wait to see the results.",

In my 7 in game days me and my friends started a small farm in the bunker, played guitar around campfires, took dozens of screenshots, ooh'd and ahh'd at how pretty the world is, and effectively built a tiny little camp. \n\nThe base building and visuals are the selling point for me, though I can't fault people who give it a negative review based on the mediocre combat, limited content for the demo, or bugs.",

      "review": "DEMO: Played Misery with a friend for a little over an hour and we did have fun exploring and seeing the crazy anomalies + getting ourselves blown up with my own grenade. This game certainly has potential and we both liked the PS1 graphics or at least didn't find it detracted from the experience.\n\nI don't usually write reviews but I'm hoping the developer here takes a look at them and considers the constructive criticism some people are giving. I wanted to add my own feedback of what we didn't enjoy about the game thus far.\n\nIn my opinion the AI bandits were inconsistently powered against us. I believe it was Day 2 when we came across our first bunch and were both cornered with a shovel and a machete. I thought we were screwed and managed to slip out of the corner to throw a grenade at them but my friend managed to kill them all with his machete in a few seconds. The grenade I threw blew up and killed us, funny moment and a good intro to the bandits.\n\nThe next day at the gnome houses there was another group. A little spooky but we managed to fight them. I was killed and my friend finished them off by the time I got back. I had about 89% health when they killed me in maybe a second or two with a knife. It definitely made us more wary of them but at this point there should either be a few spawns for a pistol or something.\n\nThe next day we were out and another group of 3 bandits find us in pit. We were much more careful this time, had decent amount of health and got out of the pit trying to hit them while staying out of reach. We were each instantly killed by one with a knife and went back only to be instantly killed by them again. I think this aspect was the most frustrating, as we figured we couldn't keep trying to progress if these guys kept tracking us and killing us in one swing without a means to defend ourselves. It was a massive roadblock in our opinion and we stopped there. I understand that it is supposed to be a multiplayer game but the AI strength*day(n) should be scaled back. I'd also suggest considering scaling the AI strength to the number of players currently in a server.\n\nWe never saw a single gun (which a few other reviews mentioned) but found a few rounds of 9mm. We didn't do much crafting and whatnot since we did not have the materials, but cooking seemed too slow in the tutorial. A technical issue I had was a massive frame-drop ONLY whenever I pulled out the artifact scanner. The game would go from whatever its at (I got a decent computer) to about 15-20 frames while it was equipped in the bunker. I will say I didn't notice a meaningful drop in the open world, so it wouldn't need to be a priority fix for sure.\n\nYou've got a really solid co-op STALKER-esque game here that there is certainly a market for (given it is priced appropriately). I think having those playtests and the demo was a very wise decision to get more feedback and I sincerely hope you take it in good faith. I think there a lot of people here wanting you to succeed.\n\nI did like a lot more of what I saw of the game thus far besides the grievances listed so I'll leave a positive review but hope you take this feedback as well as those of others into account when tweaking and finishing your game.",

Biggest gripes I have with the game so far are:\n-Enemies lack any sort of brain, they just charge at you until one of you drops dead.\n-Kinda hard to judge when the countdown until the map wipe happens, using the timer from the intro would help here.\n-Packing electronics with wires attached deletes the wires, which is also very easy to do on accident since objects instantly pack when you press pick up.\n-Items are *way* too big at times, why is a mushroom taking up 2x2 slots or the shovel / broom taking up 2x5?\n-Items could probably have larger stack sizes.\n-NEEDS AN AUTOSAVE OR AT LEAST A SAVE ON EXITING TO MENU, I accidentally deleted all my progess because I forgot to save before I quit out, there should at least be a confirmation menu.",

      "review": "[h3]Demo review, 2 weeks before release[/h3]\nFirst off i want to say that some of the english reviews are odd, if anything. Dont make sense at times. Some of the issues may consist of just bad PC's perhaps? I've not run into any bugs or issues in regards of gameplay and and if so? extremely little. \n\nAlong with some odd phrased opinions such as \"Game look bad\" or \"Weird animations.\" check out what you are trying to play. Its the art style, its meant to be that way. And stop with the 'slow cook time', you never played a survival game before? This must be a lot of people's first survival game. Its not perfect yet, but has crazy potential.\n\n[h3]Looting[/h3]\nFOOD AND DRINK:\nThe loot is decent, if anything. More then enough even and this is without even farming! I've had loads of vodka's, water bottles. Sodas. Breads and sprats. Etc etc, the loot could perhaps even be adjusted!\n\nWEAPONS AND AMMO:\nWeapons such as melee weaponry is easily to find. Killed some bandits with it. Although, the closest to a gun was the bullet i've found, thats it. Never found any guns while exploring, just about 19x 9mm rounds. I've got to yet explore just a little more in the hope i might find one. This is however, not bad.\n\nMISC LOOT:\nFlashlights are special since they don't shy away from making nights VERY dark, which isn't bad at all. But, do however give us the tools to battle darkness. Lamps, spotlights or handheld flashlights. We do have batteries that allow us to make lights, but there's just one type, an industrial wall light, but no desk lamps, nightstand lights. Worklights. (Or, so far i've seen.)\n\nI've found valuables in the world, that you can sell for a small profit, cash has value. Although, right now there are no real traders except two, One sells ammo and a tool. The other sells food and medicine. I am confident however, we'll get either a full market which is locked right now.\n\n[h3]Mechanics, UI, Sound[/h3]\nMECHANICS:\n1. Mechanics such as the emissions are neat, although. Right now as how the games made. Emissions are the reason why a new world would be generated for exploration. Which is a shame since you can't see anything unique in the skies, perhaps make it thunder, a ominous red glow perhaps, right now we've got a 3d effect.\n\n2. Generators empty out quite fast, but this is probably on purpose since you need to collect batteries, build windmills outside of your bunker, Store power, and thrive. You can also catch little dudes and put them in a running wheel to power generators, keep your peepers peeled.\n\n3. No quests, which is a shame since the game is just 'explore, loot, head back. Repeat', it'd be neat to do quests to find important items, which allows players to stay on the look out. This gives people also goals to achieve.\n\n4. The bunker is cool, you can expand your bunker by removing concrete chunks to increase room. You can go down, left and right. And up. I was initially wrong about not being able to go up or down. Making stairs useful after all!\n\n5. If the maps get adjusted, perhaps in the far future. Allow for base defense. Mutants, beasts, humans attacking your bunker once a long while. This gives the player focus on the bunker, its defenses and how they make their layouts.\n\nUI:\n1. I have no issue with the UI, its simple and is doing what it should be doing. Although, could use some explaining such as the rope slot. The bottom 4 slots are probably for artifacts that might boost you, with some downsides just like stalker. There are however some bugs with how items function in the toolbar.\n\nSOUND:\n1. The sounds are neat, although. Perhaps a few more inventory sounds for certain items. Tin can sounds for canned goods. Aluminum sounds for soda's. Plastic sounds for plastic bottles. And so on. I'm pretty sure one could get the jist. \n\n2. Impact sounds dont make much noise, would be neat to have more impact to them.\n\n[h3]World building, exploration[/h3]\nRight now you experience the game by living in a bunker and expanding it. Other two things you can do is by leaving, you can choose to visit a trader, or. An expedition. The detailing of the world is nice, although, quite cramped and small. This is probably to maintain the enter, loot and leave gameplay loop. Which is unfortunate. As this game could be a whole lot more if its a bit more bigger. Due to emissions, you can't explore 'too much', i can agree with this, but. The changing of maps happen a bit too fast for me. And its not for 'missing out' on POI's. (Points of interest). Its just a bit rushed.\n\nEach map is randomly generated after an emission, and it'll always be different which is nice. But, it has this certain feeling of \"There could be more to this mechanic.\" I've come across a lot of POI's in such a short time, which is cool. But this would perhaps make the game a little bit 'boring' if you've seen it all too fast.\n\n[h3]Suggestions[/h3]\n\nLooting:\n1. Charges on items, what i mean by this is for example, cigarettes. 5 charges? So you can use it 5 times. For water? 3 charges. This could balance the loot as well. Since loot is plentiful, i don't have to much issue with food and drink.\n\n2. Allow for some items to stack properly, right now you can only have 50 rubles per stack. Which is odd since, its cash. The money item should be one grid as well, and should allow for more cash to be collected on a stack. Money should be easy to use, not a burden. What i could also suggest besides increasing stack, is a wallet item that allows cash to be stacked up to 200.\n\n3. What i just suggested, wallets, ammo boxes, coolers? Which increase item stacks for certain items. These could be storage goals for players to tidy their base up a little more. Gun racks could be there as well, which allows weaponry to be stashed away properly.\n\n4. Old radio that broadcasts some old soviet music perhaps? Or record player.\n\nMech/UI/Sound:\n1. Allow players to right click items, such as food, misc loot. Etc. And allow them to PLACE them on surfaces and rotate them. Right now you just drop them on the floor or on tables. (If you crouch jump ontop of them and then dropping.)\n\n2. Mask slot, for gasmasks or face masks. So we can combine clothing more!\n\n3. Have traders cycling wares once every 2 emissions, selling and buying. Or perhaps sometimes an extra trader is standing somewhere at a table dealing either in special items or clothing or general items.\n\n4. Base defense, perhaps a heat meter, when the heat meter is full, bandits or creatures. Beasts. Will visit your bunker/base. This could perhaps allow players to make defenses in the open air, or inside the base. I am not talking about tower defense or anything hardcore. Could allow for items such as 'gun emplacements', mines, sandbags.\n\nWorld/Exploration:\n\n1. The emission timer as been increased, which is great, the dev is listening, although, it might last a little 'too long' now? You can easily explore the world now which is great, but i do think its best to also increase the world map because of it.\n\n2. To negate the 'too short' feeling, When you go on a expedition, if you move to either side of the somewhat small map. You can enter other 'zones', this could decrease the amount of emissions, you could then actually do some pretty decent expeditions. Make temporary camps. Loot and seek, when an emission happens, you could perhaps take cover in the world at least ONCE, the second one you'll be forced to retreat back to base with the loot you might've found. Heading into other zones could increase the danger of enemies, or anomalies.\n\nThis increases gameplay on pretty much everything. This could even allow for short or long term quests, lore finding. Such as the 'old photo of girl' which was interesting. Notes. Or perhaps be greedy to find some really decent loot further away from the map. This doesn't have to be seperate zone's either. It also could just INCREASE the map size itself. This could prevent the POI spam.\n\n3. More underground POI's, tunnels and sewers.",

Not sure if this is a feature as of now since its a demo, but i spent 5 minutes hitting a tree and nothing happened.\n- Need bigger storage, or smaller items. because some things take up way too much storage than they should, for example, jars of food.

The game is in a early state and its free with an amazing atmosphere that you get to explore with friends. I have to say however iam biased since this type of game is right up my alley and I love that it was created.\n\nI have played the game even more now and had no issues.

The core survival gameplay is already fun, and the explore-and-expand loop. Scavenging during the day and upgrading your bunker is genuinely satisfying.\n\nSure, the UI could use some polish as development continues, and maybe some atmospheric music (something doomer-style?) would add to the immersion and the nights are extremely dark but even now, it’s a very promising and enjoyable experience.\n\nLooking forward to seeing where this goes!

Unfortunately this game hooked me right away with its weird look, and interesting gameplay loop. \nI do have some criticisms. The sledgehammer should maybe do a little more damage per wall, maybe the ability to clear 3 instead of 2.5 walls would be nice. The Plague Doctor doesn't seem to need to reload, that should be addressed. Unless you get some serious range on him and keep him running at you, he can stunlock you and kill you that way if you don't run. It just feels really poorly balanced right now. \nThe mosin, probably one of my favorite guns across games. It felt like it took almost 3 seconds to ready a new round.\\\nOtherwise all in all this games pretty dang good. A little polish and it's a good one.

After making this realization I forced my friend to join me in this Hellish Wasteland full of Slav's, Monsters, and Anomaly's.

If I had to compare to any games, I would have to say its a good mix of Survival elements such as rust such as building, and collecting looting ruined monuments to better chances of survival, and Elements of Tarkov & Stalker for obvious reasons. The simplistic rustic style of the game matches the energy and feel of the game perfectly, with a great UI for when you first get in (mainly the sliders dear god I love them so much.) \n\nMisery Thus far has been an enjoyable experience and I look forward to the full release and forcing my friends to play it with me so I don't have to brave this brutal and hellish wasteland alone. \n8.9/10 can't wait for the full game.\n\nGood luck, and Stay strong Survivors, and welcome to Misery.",

      "review": "I've played the 2 playtest and the current demo. It's a survival coop russian fallout game similar to STALKER or games like that. I found the game intriguing and wanted to play it. Here's what I got to say about it in its current state.\n\nPro\n- Opening is awesome, you have a limited time to grab what you can and reach the bunker before the bombs hit. very neat and affects how you start out.\n- Coop, I like being able to play with people I know so it's a plus\n- Randomzied area, every day is something different so it's not as predictable. Familiar areas but mixed around.\n- Mainly improvements, there were mainly QoL that the game need or general improvements and the devs do a pretty good job listening to the community. There are many negatives I could have listed but they either fixed it or toned down certain things.\n- I like that the environment can harm other enemies too so I would lure a bandit into black holes and they die from them.\n\nMeh\n- Flashlight is weak, not as helpful at night as you'd expect when it goes dark. Suggestion: Make it stronger or have a stronger one we can build, and also maybe a miner helmet with a light we can craft by combining flashlight and the hard hat.\n- The game has moments where they don't explain where you get certain items and I think this issue could be solved by having it be available for purchase from the shop.\n- Not crazy about the crafting UI where you have to click the tables on top to switch between the 2 functions. Suggestion: top window = items, bottom window = things you can craft.\n- Not being able to swap items in your inventory, you must move an item out of the way to be able to put your item in the places you want. could be a good QoL for item management.\n- No auto sort button for your inventory to easily arrange things, would be nice option.\n- optimization issues but they're working on it.\n\nCon\n- Bandits are stupid, as in intellectually dumb. They rush you until death. They have no self preservation such as retreating when low on health after taking a beating, seeing their allies go down especially their most powerful one, or witnessing me with a gun that can end them all, or just observing before determining if they should attack. No, they fear no death and will charge you. Suggestion: Moral system where they determine if they should keep attacking or retreat. And a behaviour system where maybe some are aggressive and will fight to the death, cowards who will flee at the sight of others or when hit once, cautious, where unless you pose a threat to them they won't attack you.\n-- Speaking of bandits and enemies in general, they don't drop what they're equipped with(with some exceptions), very annoying that you can't strip them of their gear when you kill them and just find nothing on them.\n--- ALSO the bandits only roam in certain set areas so it's predictable where you'll encounter bandits, they should be roaming around and maybe even getting into fights with other bandits.\n- Melee combat is not great, it works but basically whoever hits faster and harder will win the battle, but you're always going to generally take some hits and this really incentivizes you to find a gun to avoid melee.\n- At the moment, there's not many threats to deal with, so a lot of the time, I'm just running into a location and getting stuff asap and getting out. There use to be these bigfoot enemies in the tutorial but you don't really see them.\n- Most crafting tables needing electricity; It's infuriating that I craft a new craft table and see I need to power it. It makes sense for some but almost all of the crafting tables need power. The ammo crafting should not need electricity to manually craft. Suggestion: Option to craft without power but you must be at the table and can have the table auto craft if there's power.\n- The toxic players that can easily come into your room and try to kill you(what they don't know is I was packing) for laughs. Anyone can join in your room regardless of your code. Good news, they added kick function and setting your room to only have a certain amount of people helps.\n- The high jump anomaly, there's no counter play to that. you walk in you get flung into the sky and most likely will die. it should just be occasional explosions that propel you that you can time to run past.\n- Can't build outside your base, was annoyed that we couldn't build in the front yard and that all building materials are just for your bunker.\n- Certain houses or buildings that are fake and can't be accessed, annoying and probably just a placeholder for now as some houses did in fact get rooms in recent updates.\n- Shopkeep only sells item once, why? I bought ammo once and couldn't again because they're out of stock.\n- Only 10 days, would be nice if they just put an infinite mode for us to play as many of the things the devs want you to do within the 10 days, needs you to speedrun the game to gather the resources in order to do them. I was at day 10 when I finally got the advance crafting table.(you can save and reload the game to keep playing infinitely for the time being)\n- Can't see my devices in the dark, my compass and busel are blacked out in the dark and I can't see them. they should have a glow in the dark or light up feature when it goes dark.\n- No dual wielding 1-handed items. I should be able to hold a flashlight and a 1-handed weapon to navigate and fight in the dark.\n- Can't attache flashlight to certain guns, I would have really like it if you could attache a flashlight to your gun to be able to see at night to shoot. it's dumb that I have to keep switching between flashlight to see and weapon to hit things.\n- The insanity meter, they didn't have it before, but they added it and it's not really fleshed out that well. it just makes you crazy, inverts your controls, and curing it from 100% is difficult because it regenerates the insanity which is stupid and only death will save you ironically.\n\nSuggestions: When the sirens go off, reuse the timer from the starting day to show how much time we got before the emission hits.\n\nOverall, I'm looking forward to the full game. The game is getting better and better and I can't wait to see the results.",

In my 7 in game days me and my friends started a small farm in the bunker, played guitar around campfires, took dozens of screenshots, ooh'd and ahh'd at how pretty the world is, and effectively built a tiny little camp. \n\nThe base building and visuals are the selling point for me, though I can't fault people who give it a negative review based on the mediocre combat, limited content for the demo, or bugs.",

      "review": "DEMO: Played Misery with a friend for a little over an hour and we did have fun exploring and seeing the crazy anomalies + getting ourselves blown up with my own grenade. This game certainly has potential and we both liked the PS1 graphics or at least didn't find it detracted from the experience.\n\nI don't usually write reviews but I'm hoping the developer here takes a look at them and considers the constructive criticism some people are giving. I wanted to add my own feedback of what we didn't enjoy about the game thus far.\n\nIn my opinion the AI bandits were inconsistently powered against us. I believe it was Day 2 when we came across our first bunch and were both cornered with a shovel and a machete. I thought we were screwed and managed to slip out of the corner to throw a grenade at them but my friend managed to kill them all with his machete in a few seconds. The grenade I threw blew up and killed us, funny moment and a good intro to the bandits.\n\nThe next day at the gnome houses there was another group. A little spooky but we managed to fight them. I was killed and my friend finished them off by the time I got back. I had about 89% health when they killed me in maybe a second or two with a knife. It definitely made us more wary of them but at this point there should either be a few spawns for a pistol or something.\n\nThe next day we were out and another group of 3 bandits find us in pit. We were much more careful this time, had decent amount of health and got out of the pit trying to hit them while staying out of reach. We were each instantly killed by one with a knife and went back only to be instantly killed by them again. I think this aspect was the most frustrating, as we figured we couldn't keep trying to progress if these guys kept tracking us and killing us in one swing without a means to defend ourselves. It was a massive roadblock in our opinion and we stopped there. I understand that it is supposed to be a multiplayer game but the AI strength*day(n) should be scaled back. I'd also suggest considering scaling the AI strength to the number of players currently in a server.\n\nWe never saw a single gun (which a few other reviews mentioned) but found a few rounds of 9mm. We didn't do much crafting and whatnot since we did not have the materials, but cooking seemed too slow in the tutorial. A technical issue I had was a massive frame-drop ONLY whenever I pulled out the artifact scanner. The game would go from whatever its at (I got a decent computer) to about 15-20 frames while it was equipped in the bunker. I will say I didn't notice a meaningful drop in the open world, so it wouldn't need to be a priority fix for sure.\n\nYou've got a really solid co-op STALKER-esque game here that there is certainly a market for (given it is priced appropriately). I think having those playtests and the demo was a very wise decision to get more feedback and I sincerely hope you take it in good faith. I think there a lot of people here wanting you to succeed.\n\nI did like a lot more of what I saw of the game thus far besides the grievances listed so I'll leave a positive review but hope you take this feedback as well as those of others into account when tweaking and finishing your game.",

Biggest gripes I have with the game so far are:\n-Enemies lack any sort of brain, they just charge at you until one of you drops dead.\n-Kinda hard to judge when the countdown until the map wipe happens, using the timer from the intro would help here.\n-Packing electronics with wires attached deletes the wires, which is also very easy to do on accident since objects instantly pack when you press pick up.\n-Items are *way* too big at times, why is a mushroom taking up 2x2 slots or the shovel / broom taking up 2x5?\n-Items could probably have larger stack sizes.\n-NEEDS AN AUTOSAVE OR AT LEAST A SAVE ON EXITING TO MENU, I accidentally deleted all my progess because I forgot to save before I quit out, there should at least be a confirmation menu.",

      "review": "[h3]Demo review, 2 weeks before release[/h3]\nFirst off i want to say that some of the english reviews are odd, if anything. Dont make sense at times. Some of the issues may consist of just bad PC's perhaps? I've not run into any bugs or issues in regards of gameplay and and if so? extremely little. \n\nAlong with some odd phrased opinions such as \"Game look bad\" or \"Weird animations.\" check out what you are trying to play. Its the art style, its meant to be that way. And stop with the 'slow cook time', you never played a survival game before? This must be a lot of people's first survival game. Its not perfect yet, but has crazy potential.\n\n[h3]Looting[/h3]\nFOOD AND DRINK:\nThe loot is decent, if anything. More then enough even and this is without even farming! I've had loads of vodka's, water bottles. Sodas. Breads and sprats. Etc etc, the loot could perhaps even be adjusted!\n\nWEAPONS AND AMMO:\nWeapons such as melee weaponry is easily to find. Killed some bandits with it. Although, the closest to a gun was the bullet i've found, thats it. Never found any guns while exploring, just about 19x 9mm rounds. I've got to yet explore just a little more in the hope i might find one. This is however, not bad.\n\nMISC LOOT:\nFlashlights are special since they don't shy away from making nights VERY dark, which isn't bad at all. But, do however give us the tools to battle darkness. Lamps, spotlights or handheld flashlights. We do have batteries that allow us to make lights, but there's just one type, an industrial wall light, but no desk lamps, nightstand lights. Worklights. (Or, so far i've seen.)\n\nI've found valuables in the world, that you can sell for a small profit, cash has value. Although, right now there are no real traders except two, One sells ammo and a tool. The other sells food and medicine. I am confident however, we'll get either a full market which is locked right now.\n\n[h3]Mechanics, UI, Sound[/h3]\nMECHANICS:\n1. Mechanics such as the emissions are neat, although. Right now as how the games made. Emissions are the reason why a new world would be generated for exploration. Which is a shame since you can't see anything unique in the skies, perhaps make it thunder, a ominous red glow perhaps, right now we've got a 3d effect.\n\n2. Generators empty out quite fast, but this is probably on purpose since you need to collect batteries, build windmills outside of your bunker, Store power, and thrive. You can also catch little dudes and put them in a running wheel to power generators, keep your peepers peeled.\n\n3. No quests, which is a shame since the game is just 'explore, loot, head back. Repeat', it'd be neat to do quests to find important items, which allows players to stay on the look out. This gives people also goals to achieve.\n\n4. The bunker is cool, you can expand your bunker by removing concrete chunks to increase room. You can go down, left and right. And up. I was initially wrong about not being able to go up or down. Making stairs useful after all!\n\n5. If the maps get adjusted, perhaps in the far future. Allow for base defense. Mutants, beasts, humans attacking your bunker once a long while. This gives the player focus on the bunker, its defenses and how they make their layouts.\n\nUI:\n1. I have no issue with the UI, its simple and is doing what it should be doing. Although, could use some explaining such as the rope slot. The bottom 4 slots are probably for artifacts that might boost you, with some downsides just like stalker. There are however some bugs with how items function in the toolbar.\n\nSOUND:\n1. The sounds are neat, although. Perhaps a few more inventory sounds for certain items. Tin can sounds for canned goods. Aluminum sounds for soda's. Plastic sounds for plastic bottles. And so on. I'm pretty sure one could get the jist. \n\n2. Impact sounds dont make much noise, would be neat to have more impact to them.\n\n[h3]World building, exploration[/h3]\nRight now you experience the game by living in a bunker and expanding it. Other two things you can do is by leaving, you can choose to visit a trader, or. An expedition. The detailing of the world is nice, although, quite cramped and small. This is probably to maintain the enter, loot and leave gameplay loop. Which is unfortunate. As this game could be a whole lot more if its a bit more bigger. Due to emissions, you can't explore 'too much', i can agree with this, but. The changing of maps happen a bit too fast for me. And its not for 'missing out' on POI's. (Points of interest). Its just a bit rushed.\n\nEach map is randomly generated after an emission, and it'll always be different which is nice. But, it has this certain feeling of \"There could be more to this mechanic.\" I've come across a lot of POI's in such a short time, which is cool. But this would perhaps make the game a little bit 'boring' if you've seen it all too fast.\n\n[h3]Suggestions[/h3]\n\nLooting:\n1. Charges on items, what i mean by this is for example, cigarettes. 5 charges? So you can use it 5 times. For water? 3 charges. This could balance the loot as well. Since loot is plentiful, i don't have to much issue with food and drink.\n\n2. Allow for some items to stack properly, right now you can only have 50 rubles per stack. Which is odd since, its cash. The money item should be one grid as well, and should allow for more cash to be collected on a stack. Money should be easy to use, not a burden. What i could also suggest besides increasing stack, is a wallet item that allows cash to be stacked up to 200.\n\n3. What i just suggested, wallets, ammo boxes, coolers? Which increase item stacks for certain items. These could be storage goals for players to tidy their base up a little more. Gun racks could be there as well, which allows weaponry to be stashed away properly.\n\n4. Old radio that broadcasts some old soviet music perhaps? Or record player.\n\nMech/UI/Sound:\n1. Allow players to right click items, such as food, misc loot. Etc. And allow them to PLACE them on surfaces and rotate them. Right now you just drop them on the floor or on tables. (If you crouch jump ontop of them and then dropping.)\n\n2. Mask slot, for gasmasks or face masks. So we can combine clothing more!\n\n3. Have traders cycling wares once every 2 emissions, selling and buying. Or perhaps sometimes an extra trader is standing somewhere at a table dealing either in special items or clothing or general items.\n\n4. Base defense, perhaps a heat meter, when the heat meter is full, bandits or creatures. Beasts. Will visit your bunker/base. This could perhaps allow players to make defenses in the open air, or inside the base. I am not talking about tower defense or anything hardcore. Could allow for items such as 'gun emplacements', mines, sandbags.\n\nWorld/Exploration:\n\n1. The emission timer as been increased, which is great, the dev is listening, although, it might last a little 'too long' now? You can easily explore the world now which is great, but i do think its best to also increase the world map because of it.\n\n2. To negate the 'too short' feeling, When you go on a expedition, if you move to either side of the somewhat small map. You can enter other 'zones', this could decrease the amount of emissions, you could then actually do some pretty decent expeditions. Make temporary camps. Loot and seek, when an emission happens, you could perhaps take cover in the world at least ONCE, the second one you'll be forced to retreat back to base with the loot you might've found. Heading into other zones could increase the danger of enemies, or anomalies.\n\nThis increases gameplay on pretty much everything. This could even allow for short or long term quests, lore finding. Such as the 'old photo of girl' which was interesting. Notes. Or perhaps be greedy to find some really decent loot further away from the map. This doesn't have to be seperate zone's either. It also could just INCREASE the map size itself. This could prevent the POI spam.\n\n3. More underground POI's, tunnels and sewers.",
