      "review": "As soon as you throw yourself off a rooftop, the game grabs you by the hoodie and shouts, \"YOU ARE COOL NOW\" to your face. The swinging mechanics are extremely smooth and close to perfect, that's why most people will choose to use fast travel not to save time but in order to not missing the fun of the swinging several times in a row of which fast traveling is the only efficient way. \n\nThe gameplay is the right combination of acrobatics to the extreme and “press square, repeat, until the villain’s health bar disappears.” Creatively you’ll be dodging streams of bullets, leaping backwards over the opponent who is double your size, and then, you’ll be smashing the floor with that manhole that although it looks obvious, you shouldn’t really be able to do with your upper, body strength. Peter Parker does it because he’s Spider Man. You do it because the game puts more faith in you than your gym teacher ever did. \n\nThe story? At odds with the expectation, substantially emotional. The first thing that may come into mind is the superhero styled witty, works but pretty soon it becomes a game about feelings, moral dilemmas, and the kind of heartbreak that makes you stare in disbelief and think, \"Sorry, I didn’t buy this kind of sadness from the pack, Insomniac.\" Aunt May, Otto, MJ, everyone convinces you to stay tuned. Even the pigeons get character development. \n\nThe \"Remastered\" tag is there to indicate that everything is more shining. The first time you see Peter's new face might be a little jump scare if you played the original but eventually, you accept it, The graphics are stunning, the illumination is sharp and the reflections on the glass facades are so spot, on that you could very well gauge your real, life, self, esteem from them. \n\nSide activities span the gamut from “actually pretty fun” to “you want me to chase WHAT now?” However, even in such instances, the swinging modus operandi makes everything tolerable. You’d gladly have to trample after twelve surveillance pigeons to have them scatter all over Manhattan because the city is so jaw, droppingly beautiful that you lose sight of the fact that you’re merely doing errands which Peter Parker definitely ought to be delegating to interns who are not paid. \n\nIn short, It is very hard for the remastered spiders game to wield its clawed web and hook you into play just like this one did: Marvel’s Spider, Man Remastered is joyful, slick, heartfelt, and wildly fun, a superhero power fantasy that actually respects your time and your desire to feel awesome for 20 straight hours. \n\nThe moment one finishes it, one feels lighter, cooler, and at the same time somewhat let down, real, world gravity, unfortunately, won’t let me swing to the grocery store.",

      "review": "Going to start by saying you don't need to know a thing about Spider-Man to enjoy this. My previous knowledge was memes and hearing friends talk about it. I still loved this.\n\nIt's been a long time since I had this much fun in a game! I pretty much no lifed this since I couldn't put it down. \n\nThe story is really good and easy to follow, even for those not versed in the Marvel universe (like me) There might be some references that could be missed but it really doesn't take too much away from the story when you don't know what you're missing. There's some really likable and well written characters and the dialogue is pretty solid. They also hired some great voice actors for this that make the characters feel more like real people.\n\nThe parkour in this is probably my favourite of any game that I've played. Quite a few of my hours are just me web slinging around and enjoying the view (Speaking of view, it also has a great photo mode to catch some cool screenshots) It feels really responsive for the most part, though it can be annoying trying to change direction on a wall if you're scaling it. The rest feels great though.\n\nCombat is fantastic in my humble opinion. It's not a mash this button over and over but there's different moves to enjoy as you kick the bad guys asses. Lots of fun gadgets to enjoy and switch up the combat and make that combo rise. It can take a little bit of learning (not too much) but it feels so satisfying when it clicks and you're pretty much untouchable in some encounters with the combat flow.\n\nAs a 100% this was an absolute blast! There are collectibles but they're all listed on the map and with the web slinging, they're a lot of fun to get to. Nothing is missable and you can even continue after the final quest for clean up. Side quests are fun and I'd recommend doing them, even if you aren't a completionist.\n\nDLC's were also quite fun to go through, though I did feel in it that I was missing some context from not knowing about the world. It's easy to fill in the gaps for the most part though.\n\nI'm already excited to dive into the 2nd one.",

The combat, swinging, and overall gameplay were super well done!\n\nI loved every second of it, and on top of that I got to make some amazing memories with my lovely Boyfriend.

Combat plays like the Batman games and there's a ton of upgradables such as gadgets, spider suits,  your skills etc. I can imagine after 20 hours getting a little tired of it all but it's extremely well done and one thing that never gets old is swinging around controlling Spider-Man and doing some tricks, it's really fun.\r\n\r\nSomehow I always knew Insomniac Games would someday do a Spider-Man game since they nailed those Spider movements in the Sly Cooper games of old. Is it a great game? I'm not sure about that. Is it a great Spider-man game? Absolutely, the best ever made in my opinion. \r\n\r\nIf you like superheroes and especially Spider-Man get the game it's totally worth it and it runs wonderfully with very few glitches and bugs.",

      "review": "Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered delivers a highly enjoyable open-world adventure that successfully captures the spirit of playing as Spider-Man. While it has its flaws, the overall package is worth recommending.\n\nExceptional Traversal: The web-swinging mechanics across Manhattan are fantastic. They are fluid, engaging, and make moving around the city the game's best feature. It's the primary reason to keep playing.\n\nAccessible Combat: The fighting is generally fun, visually appealing, and satisfyingly fast-paced. It's easy to pick up, leaning into a style that's quite forgiving. This often puts it in the \"easy win\" category, as it doesn't provide a significant challenge. The combat only gets genuinely difficult in situations where you are overwhelmed, such as being surrounded by 20 enemies who frequently attack from off-screen or outside the hero's view.\n\nWeak Narrative: The plot is arguably the weakest part. It's formulaic, pretentious, and overall just mediocre—classic superhero boilerplate with little originality.\n\nGood Pacing (Despite the Story): A saving grace is that the cutscenes are kept reasonably brief, ensuring you can quickly return to the gameplay loop.\n\nUbisoft-Style Map Bloat: The game eventually starts adding a plethora of (repetitive) objective markers to the city map, such as \"climb tower to unlock map segment\" or \"complete X challenge as fast as possible.\" When this starts, you might think, \"Oh no, not again.\" However, due to how incredibly satisfying and fun the traversal is, even these checklist activities become surprisingly enjoyable and never truly feel like a chore. The sheer pleasure of swinging makes clearing the map a low-stress activity.\n\nSteam Deck Performance:\nA great experience for portable play. Using custom medium settings with FSR (no Frame Generation) allowed for a 45 FPS play, making it a highly playable title on the Steam Deck.\n\nFinal Verdict: Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered is a super fun, high-quality game that perfectly executes the fantasy of swinging through a major city. While the story is weak and the open-world design is conventional, the excellent traversal and fun combat make it a solid and easy recommendation. It's a great game, but perhaps not a masterpiece.",

      "review": "Marvel's Spider Man was a true near masterpiece of a video game capturing the pure essence of what it was like to be Peter Parker. Lets talk pros and cons:\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\nGraphics - The game is stunning. Swinging around NYC, the attention to detail is insane. All the way down to the local mom and pop pizza shop, you see everything in this game and they don't hold back. The ability effects, enemy attacks, even the vehicles and surrounding water, it all looks stunning.\r\n\r\nGameplay - This game features top tier gameplay, a nice well paced upgrade system that gives you just enough for it to feel different everytime as you continue to level and play the game. The amount of gadgets is insane and you can really customize how you go about each encounter. The dodge system with the combo system flows well, similiar to batman arkham series. Overall theres so much fun gameplay to be had here, with very minimal faults (but there are faults).\r\n\r\nStory - The story is pretty good, i wouldnt call it a 10/10 knock out, but its definitely well above average, featuring some of spider mans most notorious villians and the pre nerf mary jane, it all comes together nicely as a good packaged spider man story that made you want to have more. The DLC is even good as well, with black cats DLC being the best imo. \r\n\r\nDifficulty - The game has a wide range of difficulties available. I 78/78 perfected this game so I beat it on ultimate and it wasnt that much of a step up in difficulty. I feel like alot of it is stream lined until you are on either end of the extremes. \r\n\r\nSuits / Gear - There is SO many suits. A fuck ton of suits. Unlocking the suits and gadgets are fun and will definitely keep you wanting to do the mediocre grind stuff just to unlock more suits. \r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\nMediocre Grind - The game has alot of grind to it. They love adding their open world nonsense to do in the game to keep you busy and to make you think its a longer game than it actually is. Theres like 15 different things to do at any given moment and most of which is basic find this, kill that, stop this kind of system. \r\n\r\nBoring Mary Jane And Miles Missions - I absolutely hated the mary jane and miles missions. They completely killed the flow of the game when they showed on screen and while I get it from a story perspective I feel like there was just quite frankly too much. People want to play as spider man, not mary jane or miles without his powers. Super slow forced BS to keep the momentum down and extend the game.\r\n\r\nRepetitive - The game can start feeling repetitive really fast with all the same mission types to do over and over and over again to unlock gadgets and suits. \r\n\r\nOverall Marvel Spider-man is a ton of fun and will absolutely make you feel like you are Peter Parker himself. Its a great game thats bogged down by boring side character missions and repetitive mission design but when its on beat, its incredible. \r\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

Join me and review one of the best Marvel games\n\nThe game starts off very well and exciting and the mechanics of the game are not just punches and kicks and fighting and you can really feel the attention to detail in the combat. What really caught my attention was that practically until the last 1.2 hours of the game, new elements and missions were added to the map and the map of the game did not become repetitive at all. The side missions were very well designed. The enemies are good, but after a while, when you go through the story stages, maybe fighting them in the city for criminal missions can be a bit boring and that is the only problem with the game. But making the game 100% easy and experiencing 10/15 hours of story and 30/40 hours to make it 100% is enough to have fun and not get bored. The game in Act 3 in particular is very great and we see unique and memorable enemy fights.  Also, the stealth missions you take on with Miles or MG are awesome, and the best part of the game is the beauty of New York City and the incredible sense of warping it. It's so addictive that you'll just want to spend hours wandering around New York City and swinging from buildings and doing nothing else. Overall, Marvel's Spider-Man not only proves how great the Marvel universe is for game development, but also proves that this title is a great experience in every way, and with a little indulgence, even perfect. So, without a doubt, Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered is 100% worth buying and immersing yourself in its world.",

Across 66.3 hours, I completed everything — story, side missions, collectibles, and all 78 achievements — and the experience stayed magical from start to finish.\n\nThe game’s blend of mechanics, scenery, music, and voice acting is near perfect. For something originally released in 2018, it still looks incredible, and swinging through New York feels as fluid and cinematic as ever. The gameplay loop is so polished that even after hours of patrols and crime-fighting, I never got bored. Combat is tight, responsive, and stylish — chaining dodges, web shots, and gadgets feels effortless and rewarding.\n\nI encountered a few crashes due to “video memory exceeded” errors, which is strange considering my RX 7600 XT’s 16GB VRAM, especially while using FSR. Beyond that, performance was stable, and no bugs or gameplay hiccups interfered with the experience.\n\nWhat sets this entry apart is the emotional core of Peter Parker’s journey. This first game in the modern series captures the essence of Spider-Man better than almost any adaptation — that bittersweet cycle of heroism where Peter never truly gets closure. When something good happens, something worse always follows. The ending still hits hard no matter how many times I see it; the first time, I was genuinely in tears.\n\nAfter 9 months and 27 days, I returned for the New Game+ and Ultimate Difficulty achievements. It wasn’t frustration that brought me back, but closure. The feeling of finishing it all again was *complete* — like ending a story that defines why Spider-Man will always matter.\n\n**Final Verdict:**\nA near-perfect superhero experience, slightly repetitive at full completion but powerful, emotional, and timeless.\n**Score: 8.5/10** — For anyone, not just Spider-Man fans.",

The story, the characters, and the dynamics are all great.\n\nIt runs smooth and there is so much to do. You can play for hours or replay it multiple times and it’s still fun. The upgrades are cool, the soundtrack is amazing, and the voice acting is spot on.\n\nHonestly the best part is just the swinging. You can ignore the game, put on some music, and just swing around the city for hours. It’s the kind of game you can always come back to and it feels incredible every time. The characters are the perfect balance of simple and complex, so even if you don't know the lore, you'll love them instantly. 10/10.",

      "review": "Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered – Be Greater, Look Better\n\nVerdict: Essential\n\nInsomniac Games didn't just make a superhero game; they built the definitive Spider-Man simulator. With the release of Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered, an already masterpiece of a game has been polished to a mirror sheen, proving that Peter Parker’s adventures are timeless. Whether you are revisiting New York or swinging through the skyscrapers for the first time, this is an experience that simply cannot be missed.\n\nThe Definitive Web-Swinging Experience\n\nThe crown jewel of this game remains its traversal system. It is, without hyperbole, one of the most satisfying mechanics in gaming history. The momentum, the physics, and the sheer sense of speed make simply moving from point A to point B an absolute joy. You never want to fast travel because diving off the Empire State Building and swinging through traffic at street level feels too good. The Remastered version enhances this with buttery-smooth 60fps (and higher on PC) performance, making the motion feel more fluid and responsive than ever before.\n\nCombat: Improvisational Acrobatics\n\nCombat is a ballet of punches, webs, and gadgets. It borrows the rhythmic counter-system popular in the genre but infuses it with Spidey’s signature agility. You aren't just hitting buttons; you are sliding under enemies, webbing them to walls, throwing manhole covers, and zipping across the arena. As you unlock the skill tree, the flow of combat evolves from a brawl into an art form. It makes you feel like a veteran superhero who has been doing this for eight years.\n\nA Story with Heart\n\nWhere many superhero games treat the plot as an excuse to punch bad guys, Marvel’s Spider-Man tells a story that rivals the best comic runs and films. It understands that the most interesting part of Spider-Man isn't the mask—it's Peter Parker. The narrative balances the dual life of a struggling young adult and a city-saving hero perfectly. The relationships with Aunt May, Mary Jane, and Otto Octavius are handled with genuine emotional weight, leading to a third act that is surprisingly tear-jerking.\n\nThe Remastered Polish\n\nTechnically, the game is a marvel (pun intended). The addition of ray-traced reflections transforms New York City. Glass skyscrapers actually reflect the bustling city around them rather than generic static images, adding a layer of immersion that is hard to go back from. Textures are sharper, loading times are practically non-existent thanks to SSD optimization, and the lighting is gorgeous.\n\nConclusion\n\nMarvel’s Spider-Man Remastered is a triumph. It combines best-in-class gameplay mechanics with a narrative that has real soul. It is a love letter to the character and a masterclass in open-world design.",

And the web swinging is definitely the highlight as it's so much fun that you'll ignore the fast travel option most of the time. \n\nThe only real negatives I can even come up with in regards to the game is the repeated audio from Peter after beating a group of bad guys. It may not be back to back, but you'll definitely hear the same lines multiple times if you're doing everything. The other one is that my settings wouldn't save for graphics even when setting them within the NVIDIA app and within the game launcher and within the game itself it would always default to Exclusive Fullscreen with DLSS upscaling and frame generation on which would constantly give me graphical issues.

The story is fantastic, heart-wrenching, and triumphant all the same, being both a classic Spider-Man story and a new and fresh take on Spider-Man. The villains are implemented very well, which are key to how the story plays, and characters close to Spider-Man are done very well, in a way that makes the player care for them. The gameplay is excellent, particularly the web-swinging, which is one of gaming's best traversal mechanisms, and makes the very fast fast-travel redundant due to how fun it is to swing around New York. Manhattan is captured well, with many icons of the skyline present and a well-planned out world that makes traveling it fun and never boring. The combat is good, with enough variety in how to fight to make it always feel fun and make you feel like Spider-Man, and although sometimes repetitive, it is never boring. The graphics are good, and the game runs well, with only the occasional lag-spike. Three DLC are included with the game which are fun and add more to do around the city. 10/10.",

The story is also pretty good with some good villains and a good story, about 8/10 for me. Loved the Black Cat DLC, a little less with the second and third parts of the DLC. the enemies are kinda annoying to fight sometimes when they get in big groups. About the main game i love the combat but sometimes its easy to get overwhelmed by some enemy camp especially a certain type of enemy that gets revealed towards the end, definitely not my favorite to clear those camps. I loved 100% all the districts and the suit that you get is pretty funny and was a nice reward wasn't disappointed with it. Overall this game is really good, 9/10. A little side note i HIGHLY recommend getting the Miles Morales game ON SALE, not even close to being worthy of a $50 game but i got it for $17 on sale and i loved it, it takes basically everything from this game and improves it, the stealth, the traversal, and even the story is pretty good. Extremely short though i was really sad when it only like took me 9 hours to finish and that was with just roaming around and doing side quests at the same time.

Oh darkness my friend!\n\nThere’s a lot of optional collecting involved here, as you need these collectible tokens to unlock gear and upgrades.

First, I like that they have grapple points all over the city, but it's hard to use them effectively - they're very difficult to target when swinging with any real speed, and they never seem to be in reach where you really want them to be. Second, there isn't a reasonable way to slow down and land - most people are probably okay with just stopping and falling, but it's immersion-breaking for me that Spider-Man is supposed to constantly just plummet 150 feet or slam into a wall at 80 miles per hour.\n\nCombat: Too many toys in the toybox. You have 20 different buttons doing 50 different actions. Great for people who are into that kind of thing, but for us casuals, it's just hard to keep track. And some of the Arkham-style mobs are just silly. Why are eight guys robbing one liquor store?\n\nStory: Didn't pull me in. I guess a kid-friendly vanilla tone is an okay fit for Spider-Man, but there wasn't anything that grabbed my interest.\n\nMap and World: Yawn. The swinging around is fun, but a lot of things are in high places that are more tedious than challenging to get to - you can't web swing between skyscrapers when the only skyscraper nearby is the one you're trying to climb. The mini-games for towers, research, etc are universally terrible, but at least they're skippable.\n\nBoss Fights: The Shocker is the worst boss fight I have ever played.\n\nI tried it for five hours and can't say I really want to play more. Not worth 60 dollars, barely worth 20 dollars. Guardians of the Galaxy or Lego Marvel Super Heroes are better choices if you're looking for a fun Marvel game.",

      "review": "Spider-Man Remastered is a game that sits right in the middle for me — not bad, but not amazing either. Visually, the game looks fantastic, and swinging through the city is easily its strongest point. It nails that feeling of actually being Spider-Man, flying between skyscrapers and slinging webs with smooth, responsive movement. In terms of presentation and feel, the game absolutely delivers.\n\nBut once you get past the gorgeous graphics and the fun traversal, the cracks start to show.\nThe gameplay feels almost identical to Batman: Arkham Knight, just dressed up with Spider-Man’s web-slinging and a few upgradeable gadgets. It’s basically the same formula: counter, punch, dodge, repeat — just faster and flashier. The story is also very average, nothing special, and the combat system plus the repetitive mission loop becomes boring surprisingly fast — for me, within the first couple of hours.\n\nYes, the graphics look great, and the game is responsive and polished. But gameplay-wise, there’s not much depth, and the repetition sets in quickly. It ends up feeling like a reskinned Arkham game with slightly different toys.\n\nThat said, I think most people are rating it higher because of nostalgia or due to being fans of the movies and tv series not because it’s actually a great game on paper keep that in mind as someone whos a gamer first not a fanboy its quite over hyped for what it is.\n\nOverall rating: 5/10.\nIt looks good and plays smoothly, but the repetitive combat, average story, and overly familiar gameplay hold it back. Definitely worth picking up on sale if you want to sling around as spiderman throughout the city— but at full price, it’s not that great of a game.",

      "review": "Seeing how this is: \n- the 2nd highest selling PS4 game of all time: \n  -- especially how late during the console's life-cycle it was released\n- Spider-Man 2 is the highest selling PS5 game of all time\nI thought I would have nothing to lose getting it. I bought it via a CD key and took the risk; which excludes it from Steam's refund policy. \n\nBut this goes to show, that, both mass critic and user reviews, cannot be relied upon as it is mostly generated hype and cult followings, favouring style over substance.\n\nThis game unfortunately falls into the generic Ubisoft sandbox. The map is huge, but there is little ways to interact with the world. The people walking around are nothing but cardboard NPCs, and the buildings are just blocks for you to swing off. There are no interiors and few unique charms that make exploring the city worth while. A denser, more alive open world with more content would have done this world favours.\n\nThe physics and controls are pretty tight. Spiderman has a varied move-set and the combat is somewhat similar to Batman Arkham series, where you have to perform timed dodges, deal with enemies wielding melee or ranged weapons, shields etc which means you have to spin a different combo to deal with them and not mash the same buttons. That part works, what doesn't is the overall game-loop. \n\n- the graphics are not that great, older titles like MGS Phantom Pain look far more stunning\n- there is no day and night cycle or changes to weather - they do change based on story script only, so if you are just exploring, the world feels static, not dynamic.\n- the side-quests are just generic activities:\n  -- wave fights: (personally I think this is one of the lowest forms of gameplay, to program it you just need a simple loop of enemy respawns and triggered conditions). The particular waves in this game get very tiresome, it isn't a matter of skill, but endurance.\n-- crimes: a bit better than endless waves, short and sweet, but nothing special. Vehicle chases means swinging after a vehicle, then pressing some Quick Time Events to watch a few animations.\n  -- collectibles: backpacks, pidgeons etc. simply means gathering them. There isn't a skill based challenge or a gadget themed puzzle requiring you to get them. Reaching the pointer on the map and grabbing them is enough\n  -- Ubisoft towers (really dated legacy mechanic most people are tired off, interact with a tower, reveal portion of the map)\n  -- photographs landmarks (there are a few unique buildings, you just pull out the camera and snap a photo)\n- full of mundane progression minigames - if anyone remembers Bioshock's Pipe-Dream hacking minigame, well this is back, but in the form of electric circuits. I never liked minigames, I just want to play the game, but when you have to repeat the same minigame over and over it gets stale and repetitive very quickly. In contrast to Arkham, those games require you use your gadgets to interact with your environment, where as here you find detached minigames that don't at all link to Spiderman or any of his tools. \n  -- Luckily, accessibility options do allow you to skip them entirely, which I did gladly.\n- Skill trees: in the 2010s era every exclusive sandbox had to have the 3 skill trees: tap A to do this faster; take less damage;  something affects 1 more enemy etc. - quantitative checkbox updates rather than quality updates that affect how you interact with the world.\n- enemy AI is not dynamic and reactive like in Arkham, they won't start destroying perch points once they see you them. They will behave in the same manner throughout\n- The MJ and Miles sections are scripted, linear stealth sections. You cannot change how its done or pick your own route, you go from point to point as you're told and cannot deviate from this line.\n- I don't know why so many devs obsessed with cinema do this, but if you want to explain a narrative, just add a cutscene. Instead you will be stopped with many sections that require forced walking, you walk around a room, and press the action button to interact with an object, the character speaks some monologue about what you saw, then you have to repeat this several times until you have interacted with enough objects/the correct object. Again, I just want to play the real game, save these interaction sequences for cutscenes, don't force me to hold \"up\" for 5 minutes pressing \"Y\" to move the game forward.\n\nThe pluses are:\n+ lots of different suits, gadgets and suit mods to modify your play style\n+ controls and physics feel tight\n+ web slinging feels tight and controlled\n+ map is large\n+ lots of Marvel characters make an appearance\n\nOverall I really find it hard to understand how this outsold, especially so much later in the console's lifecycle, much more dynamic and innovative titles like Red Dead Redemption 2, Witcher 3 and MGS Phantom Pain. The game mostly borrows all of its mechanics from other titles, but doesn't contribute anything innovative of its own.\n\nMy recommendation is to buy this from Steam directly, that way if you don't like it and played under 2 hours, you can refund it - this will give you ample time to test it, as what you see in those 2 hours is what you will get throughout. Or try to see if you can play a demo version. \n\nIf you find yourself that you are not tired of generic open world games like Assassin's Creed and many other Ubisoft titles, then you can probably sink into this. But if you strive for quality and innovation, try the demo before buying (or buy directly from Steam, and request a refund in under 2 hours). To me a lot of this is very last gen, if it came out in 2012 it would have been top tier, but even Arkham City outclasses this game and has a more unique variety of activities in its sandbox, despite having a much smaller world. And that being said, I also think that most Ubisoft sandboxes are actually a lot more fun than this game, even AC Odyssey whose map is far too large and has literal fetch quests offers more thrills.",

      "review": "Seeing how this is: \n- the 2nd highest selling PS4 game of all time: \n  -- especially how late during the console's life-cycle it was released\n- Spider-Man 2 is the highest selling PS5 game of all time\nI thought I would have nothing to lose getting it. I bought it via a CD key and took the risk; which excludes it from Steam's refund policy. \n\nBut this goes to show, that, both mass critic and user reviews, cannot be relied upon as it is mostly generated hype and cult followings, favouring style over substance.\n\nThis game unfortunately falls into the generic Ubisoft sandbox. The map is huge, but there is little ways to interact with the world. The people walking around are nothing but cardboard NPCs, and the buildings are just blocks for you to swing off. There are no interiors and few unique charms that make exploring the city worth while. A denser, more alive open world with more content would have done this world favours.\n\nThe physics and controls are pretty tight. Spiderman has a varied move-set and the combat is somewhat similar to Batman Arkham series, where you have to perform timed dodges, deal with enemies wielding melee or ranged weapons, shields etc which means you have to spin a different combo to deal with them and not mash the same buttons. That part works, what doesn't is the overall game-loop. \n\n- the graphics are not that great, older titles like MGS Phantom Pain look far more stunning\n- there is no day and night cycle or changes to weather - they do change based on story script only, so if you are just exploring, the world feels static, not dynamic.\n- the side-quests are just generic activities:\n  -- wave fights: (personally I think this is one of the lowest forms of gameplay, to program it you just need a simple loop of enemy respawns and triggered conditions). The particular waves in this game get very tiresome, it isn't a matter of skill, but endurance.\n-- crimes: a bit better than endless waves, short and sweet, but nothing special. Vehicle chases means swinging after a vehicle, then pressing some Quick Time Events to watch a few animations.\n  -- collectibles: backpacks, pidgeons etc. simply means gathering them. There isn't a skill based challenge or a gadget themed puzzle requiring you to get them. Reaching the pointer on the map and grabbing them is enough\n  -- Ubisoft towers (really dated legacy mechanic most people are tired off, interact with a tower, reveal portion of the map)\n  -- photographs landmarks (there are a few unique buildings, you just pull out the camera and snap a photo)\n- full of mundane progression minigames - if anyone remembers Bioshock's Pipe-Dream hacking minigame, well this is back, but in the form of electric circuits. I never liked minigames, I just want to play the game, but when you have to repeat the same minigame over and over it gets stale and repetitive very quickly. In contrast to Arkham, those games require you use your gadgets to interact with your environment, where as here you find detached minigames that don't at all link to Spiderman or any of his tools. \n  -- Luckily, accessibility options do allow you to skip them entirely, which I did gladly.\n- Skill trees: in the 2010s era every exclusive sandbox had to have the 3 skill trees: tap A to do this faster; take less damage;  something affects 1 more enemy etc. - quantitative checkbox updates rather than quality updates that affect how you interact with the world.\n- enemy AI is not dynamic and reactive like in Arkham, they won't start destroying perch points once they see you them. They will behave in the same manner throughout\n- The MJ and Miles sections are scripted, linear stealth sections. You cannot change how its done or pick your own route, you go from point to point as you're told and cannot deviate from this line.\n- I don't know why so many devs obsessed with cinema do this, but if you want to explain a narrative, just add a cutscene. Instead you will be stopped with many sections that require forced walking, you walk around a room, and press the action button to interact with an object, the character speaks some monologue about what you saw, then you have to repeat this several times until you have interacted with enough objects/the correct object. Again, I just want to play the real game, save these interaction sequences for cutscenes, don't force me to hold \"up\" for 5 minutes pressing \"Y\" to move the game forward.\n\nThe pluses are:\n+ lots of different suits, gadgets and suit mods to modify your play style\n+ controls and physics feel tight\n+ web slinging feels tight and controlled\n+ map is large\n+ lots of Marvel characters make an appearance\n\nOverall I really find it hard to understand how this outsold, especially so much later in the console's lifecycle, much more dynamic and innovative titles like Red Dead Redemption 2, Witcher 3 and MGS Phantom Pain. The game mostly borrows all of its mechanics from other titles, but doesn't contribute anything innovative of its own.\n\nMy recommendation is to buy this from Steam directly, that way if you don't like it and played under 2 hours, you can refund it - this will give you ample time to test it, as what you see in those 2 hours is what you will get throughout. Or try to see if you can play a demo version. \n\nIf you find yourself that you are not tired of generic open world games like Assassin's Creed and many other Ubisoft titles, then you can probably sink into this. But if you strive for quality and innovation, try the demo before buying (or buy directly from Steam, and request a refund in under 2 hours). To me a lot of this is very last gen, if it came out in 2012 it would have been top tier, but even Arkham City outclasses this game and has a more unique variety of activities in its sandbox, despite having a much smaller world. And that being said, I also think that most Ubisoft sandboxes are actually a lot more fun than this game, even AC Odyssey whose map is far too large and has literal fetch quests offers more thrills.",
