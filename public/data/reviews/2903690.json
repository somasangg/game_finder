I consider base on my exp on playing these kind of game. I place this game below Lust goddess and dirty league in term of how much you need to spend for source materials. It does not contain real PVP. so this not torture much like Lust goddess.\n\nTo be fare the game give what you need ASAP just by opening the game. If you are teenager and easily arouse just loading screen is worth your time. And if you understand game mechanic your can consider what will you pay for.\n\nSometimes game play use too much brain your little head may turn off.

Everything in this game screams “cash grab.” Instead of focusing on gameplay or entertainment, it tries hard to sell you overpriced AI-generated NSFW content that isn’t even worth looking at.\n\nThe progression system is deliberately frustrating. The further you go, the more the game tries to squeeze money out of you. Upgrading spawners somehow makes them worse instead of better, and every step of progress feels like a punishment. The developers clearly designed this mess to push you toward microtransactions, not to provide any sense of fun or reward.\n\nYou’ll be bombarded with constant pay-to-win offers, and that’s all this game really is—pay to get girls, pay to progress, pay to do anything. If they wanted money so badly, they should have just sold the game for a set price instead of pretending it’s free. As it stands, it’s nothing more than a predatory mobile-style grind with zero payoff.\n\nThere’s no reason to even try this game.

The further you go, the more the game tries to squeeze money out of you. Upgrading spawners somehow makes them worse instead of better, and every step of progress feels like a punishment. The developers clearly designed this mess to push you toward microtransactions, not to provide any sense of fun or reward.\n\nYou’ll be bombarded with constant pay-to-win offers, and that’s all this game really is—pay to get girls, pay to progress, pay to do anything. If they wanted money so badly, they should have just sold the game for a set price instead of pretending it’s free.

They try so hard to make the progress in the game tight to squeeze some money from you, the further you go into the story the harder the game becomes to get those stars to proceed the story. Upgrading spawners just makes them worse instead of giving any benefit. I have wasted 54 hours in this game, paid 0 cent, no way I would pay anything to these kind of games and I strongly recommend that you not do it too. heck its not even worth trying this game so you do be better to stay away. this game will bombard you with mtx offers all the time and that is only thing this game is made for, not for entertainment.",

I played almost 2 hours and haven't seen no nice story, no sex scene and had no fun with it. Guess this is just a game focused on their old fan base that throws money on it without thinking too much.

Everything in this game screams “cash grab.” Instead of focusing on gameplay or entertainment, it tries hard to sell you overpriced AI-generated NSFW content that isn’t even worth looking at.\n\nThe progression system is deliberately frustrating. The further you go, the more the game tries to squeeze money out of you. Upgrading spawners somehow makes them worse instead of better, and every step of progress feels like a punishment. The developers clearly designed this mess to push you toward microtransactions, not to provide any sense of fun or reward.\n\nYou’ll be bombarded with constant pay-to-win offers, and that’s all this game really is—pay to get girls, pay to progress, pay to do anything. If they wanted money so badly, they should have just sold the game for a set price instead of pretending it’s free. As it stands, it’s nothing more than a predatory mobile-style grind with zero payoff.\n\nThere’s no reason to even try this game. It’s a waste of time, a waste of effort, and absolutely not worth a single cent. Stay away from it.\n\n[h2]Rating:[/h2] [spoiler] 2/10 [/spoiler]\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/2903690/Horny_Villa/",
