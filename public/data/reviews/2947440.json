      "review": "I wasn't expecting a return to a classic formula. From the trailer, it was clear the game would diverge from the usual. Having completed 100% of the game and explored all five endings, I found its psychological core unmistakably Silent Hill.  You'll instantly recognize the series’ essence: guilt, confusion, identity, trauma, and the slow descent into one’s own inner world. Whether or not it fits the traditional American town or earlier gameplay style, the spirit remains.\n\nThe story is much deeper and more complicated than it seems. It blends folktales and myths as context along with personal psychology in a way that only becomes clear after multiple playthroughs. The game is designed so that your first run is intentionally incomplete, confusing and disappointing because the character herself is lost, fragmented, and drowning in self-doubt. Only in NG+ runs does the narrative open up. Each ending reveals a different perspective on her identity, trauma, and relationships. The game provides fair instructions on how to unlock each at the main menu. By your fourth playthrough, the story finally clicks into place, and the emotional impact becomes much heavier.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it’s definitely the most divisive part. It’s not a traditional Silent Hill combat, and it's not meant to be a pure action system. I don' t mind a souls-like, I think it reinforces the tension: you’re fragile but capable, constantly overwhelmed and under pressure ... after all you're playing a teenage girl who fights society norms with a pipe.\n\nThe art design on the other hand is impeccable, it creates a haunting atmosphere infused with the decaying allure of spider lilies, symbolizing death and rebirth. The enemies you'll face are evocative symbols that reflect Hinako's perspective in a conservative society; hence, the enemy variety is limited. Each creature she encounters visually manifests her fears and embodies how her environment has shaped her psyche, deepening the overall impact of the game's aesthetic.\n\nI realized that f stands for the musical term forte, which made sense why I don't like this particular OST as much as earlier entries in the series. The loud notes in the soundtrack, especially during enemy presence seem to emphasize the title's meaning. While it may not be to my liking, the music plays a crucial role on Hinako's desire for peace and quiet.",

      "review": "I’m going to defend this game, because I see a lot of people unanimously claiming it’s “not a very good Silent Hill”  without really giving it a fair try.\n\nFirst, let’s talk about the price: to actually finish the game, it takes around 12 to 14 hours on your first run. And if you want to reach the true ending  the one that gives you the full understanding of the story’s depth  you’ll need to play it at least twice, with new cutscenes and different narrative stakes (just like in other Silent Hill games, by the way). So yes, I can understand the criticism about the price, because €80 is definitely excessive in general, no matter the game.\n\nThen, Silent Hill f doesn’t just copy the series’ classic formula  it reinterprets it through a deeply introspective approach centered on Hinako.\nWhere the older titles confronted the player with guilt, shame, or denial, Silent Hill f explores identity fragility and social pressure  the forces that shape a person’s psyche. The game doesn’t just aim to scare you with monsters or disturbing environments, but rather to visually and symbolically express Hinako’s emotions, fears, and inner contradictions.\n\nAnd that’s exactly where I think the game excels: it perfectly masters its atmosphere. Everything in it is designed to be replayed  a single playthrough isn’t enough to grasp all its nuances. Only by starting over, by looking differently, do you start to perceive the coherence behind the symbols, the echoes between events, and what they truly reveal about the character.\n\nIf you’re familiar with Ryūkishi07’s work, you’ll clearly see where he’s taking us. In fact, I think it’s sometimes a good thing not to be constantly guided through a story  it allows you to appreciate it on a deeper level. And that’s exactly what Ryūkishi07 achieves here.\n\nLastly, let me repeat it: Silent Hill is not just a town  it’s a concept.\nIt’s an idea, a psychological experience where each story and each protagonist becomes a mirror of human suffering. And in that sense, I don’t see how Silent Hill f is any less of a Silent Hill than the others. Sure, Kojima isn’t behind it, but this game explores  perhaps even more deeply  the psychological and symbolic dimensions that have defined the series from the very beginning.\n\nMany people are quick to judge the surface  the pacing, the art direction, or the narrative structure  but Silent Hill f is above all about the psychology of its main character.\nIt’s not a story that reveals itself easily; it asks the player to engage, to think, to interpret. It’s a work that refuses to explain everything, choosing to suggest rather than show. And that’s precisely what makes it so rich.\n\nIn my opinion, that’s where some players miss the point. Hinako’s depth as a character isn’t immediately obvious  it slowly reveals itself through details, silences, and symbols. You need to take the time to dive in, replay, and observe to fully understand what the game is saying about her  and, ultimately, about the human condition itself.\nBeyond that, Silent Hill f also touches on the conditioning of Japanese society, offering subtle yet meaningful social criticism for those who take the time to notice it.\n\nThat said, it’s true: the gameplay has never been the main focus.\nIt exists primarily to serve the story to enhance the mood and symbolism  not to stand out for its technical brilliance.\n\nStill, at least the boss fights in Silent Hill f are quite well done. Each one has its own identity and actually contributes to the narrative. Overall, though, the combat is fairly “mid”: it does its job without being particularly memorable. The game is far from perfect  but I honestly think most of the criticism out there completely misses the point.",

      "review": "Silent Hil F is a bizarre case where Steam reviews would benefit from a “Mixed Feelings” verdict. Since Steam lacks nuance I will keep this short: if you are a newcomer to the franchise, you will likely enjoy this. If you are a veteran, this will be the most divisive title since Silent Hill 4. \n\nSilent Hill F takes the series in a wildly new direction. It abandons the familiar discomfort of urban American in exchange for Shōwa era Japan. Due to it's remote setting, firearms are omitted and replaced with melee weapons. \n\nTo address the elephant in the room, Silent Hill F plays like a soulslike. While that term has been beaten to death more often than the mannequins in Silent Hill 2, all the hallmarks of the design philosophy are there. Attacks consume stamina and have long animations that are hard to cancel. Dodging is your primary defensive method. Enemies have very brief periods where you can hit them with a devastating counter. \n\nUnfortunately, the developers seem to learned all the wrong lessons as well. Your weapons bounce off walls, which is incredibly frustrating due to the game’s frequent enclosed levels. Breaking a weapon causes a nonsensical 1.5 second stun where monsters are free to hit you. Enemies repeatedly use heavily delayed attacks with absurd levels of tracking. It seems that the devs forgot that anger and frustration is an emotion that can easily overpower fear, which is a fatal issue: the game is not scary and the combat is to blame. \n\nThat being said, there are positives. The vocal performances are spectacular, especially Konatsu Kano’s labored performance as Hinako Shimizu. Visuals are fantastic and the mystery of Ebisugaoka is wrapped in a competent narrative penned by Ryukishi07. The issue is you have to go through a Nier-like experience to grasp the full story, and many players will likely be put off by the clunky parts of the game to warrant 4 full playthroughs. To Silent Hill veterans who have ample amounts of patience and tolerance for frustration, this title is for you.",

      "review": "I like this game a lot.\r\nSilent Hill f is a beautiful experience, and I really enjoy the mid-60s Japanese setting. Basically, what we have here is Silent Hill outside of Silent Hill, and it works surprisingly well. The monsters are fantastic. For me, symbolism in monster design has always been a big deal ever since I played the very first game. It helps you dive deeper into the atmosphere, and I can say for sure that the developers put real effort into that aspect again.\r\n\r\nThe story is very complicated. Be ready to understand almost nothing after your first playthrough. To get the complete picture, you really need to unlock all four endings. Each one reveals a different part of Hinako’s story so you can piece everything together at the end. Even after that, you’ll probably want to watch some explanation videos — but honestly, that’s normal for Silent Hill.\r\n\r\nThe puzzles are well-designed, especially on higher difficulties. Like in previous Silent Hill games, they are heavily symbolic and poetic. They’re all manageable if you take your time. I never had to look up a solution online, not even once. The longest I got stuck on a puzzle was about an hour, so overall I’d say the puzzles are very fair.\r\n\r\nI’ve heard a lot of complaints about the combat system, but personally I think it’s perfect for all the melee encounters in the game. The last time we had such a big focus on melee combat was in Silent Hill 4: The Room, and that was twenty years ago. What we have here feels like a great improvement. You can actually plan your strategy for each fight: sometimes it’s good to use the focus system, and sometimes dodge + counter works better. The omamori system makes it even more interesting. There’s no overpowered build — each one has pros and cons, and you can customize your omamori setup to fit your preferred playstyle.\r\n\r\nOverall, I’m very happy that the series is coming back to life. I can see that Konami is putting effort not only into remaking old titles but also into creating new ones. Big thanks to them for that — and I can’t wait to see the next Silent Hill game.",

      "review": "Sometimes, fog doesn’t just cover a place… it hides something that’s been waiting to be found.\n\nSilent Hill f takes us away from the familiar streets and into a quiet, decaying village, one that feels alive in its own way.\nIt’s the second Silent Hill I’ve played, and after reaching 100%, unlocking every ending and collectible, I can say it left a deep impression on me.\n\nThe attention to detail is remarkable: the haunting atmosphere, the melancholic soundtrack, the characters, and above all… the story. There’s something painful and beautiful about it, like memories you wish you could forget, but can’t.\nPerhaps that’s no surprise, knowing the scenario was written by 𝘙𝘺𝘶𝘬𝘪𝘴𝘩𝘪07, the mind behind 𝘏𝘪𝘨𝘶𝘳𝘢𝘴𝘩𝘪 𝘞𝘩𝘦𝘯 𝘛𝘩𝘦𝘺 𝘊𝘳𝘺. His touch is unmistakable, tragedy wrapped in humanity, horror blooming from emotion.\n\nIf I had to point out one flaw, it would be the gameplay. It can feel repetitive at times, like walking in circles through your own thoughts. Still, that repetition somehow fits the theme, being trapped in cycles you can’t escape.\n\nDepending on how much you explore, the game can feel both long and short. My first run took about 9/10 hours, but I lost track of time just wandering, searching every corner, trying to make sense of what I was seeing.\n\nThe New Game+ adds even more reasons to return. New cutscenes, new insights… new pain. To truly understand everything, you’ll need to go back at least three or four times.\n\nIn the end, I can’t say if I found answers, only more questions.\nBut that’s Silent Hill, isn’t it?\n\n\"𝘐𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘮𝘪𝘴𝘵 𝘰𝘧 𝘮𝘺 𝘳𝘦𝘨𝘳𝘦𝘵𝘴, 𝘐 𝘴𝘢𝘸 𝘴𝘰𝘮𝘦𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘣𝘭𝘰𝘰𝘮 𝘢𝘨𝘢𝘪𝘯.\"\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA volte, la nebbia non copre soltanto un luogo… ma qualcosa che stava aspettando di essere trovato.\n\nSilent Hill f ci porta lontano dalle strade familiari, dentro un villaggio silenzioso e in rovina, ma in qualche modo ancora vivo.\nÈ il secondo Silent Hill che ho giocato e, dopo averlo completato al 100%, con tutti i finali e i collezionabili, posso dire che mi ha davvero colpito.\n\nLa cura nei dettagli è straordinaria: l’atmosfera inquietante, la colonna sonora malinconica, i personaggi… e soprattutto la storia.\nC’è qualcosa di doloroso e bellissimo in tutto questo, come ricordi che vorresti dimenticare, ma che non riesci a lasciar andare.\nForse non è un caso, visto che la sceneggiatura porta la firma di 𝘙𝘺𝘶𝘬𝘪𝘴𝘩𝘪07, autore di 𝘏𝘪𝘨𝘶𝘳𝘢𝘴𝘩𝘪 𝘞𝘩𝘦𝘯 𝘛𝘩𝘦𝘺 𝘊𝘳𝘺. Il suo tocco si sente: tragedie umane raccontate con empatia, orrore che nasce dal dolore e dall’amore.\n\nSe devo trovargli un difetto, direi il gameplay: a volte diventa un po’ ripetitivo, come camminare in cerchio dentro i propri pensieri.\nEppure, in un certo senso, questo si adatta perfettamente al tema, rimanere intrappolati in cicli da cui non puoi sfuggire.\n\nLa durata varia molto: alla prima partita, se si va dritti, si può finire in circa 9/10 ore, ma esplorando ogni angolo il tempo perde importanza.\n\nIl New Game+ offre un ottimo motivo per tornare: nuove cutscenes, nuovi dettagli… e nuove ferite.\nPer cogliere davvero tutto, va rigiocato almeno tre o quattro volte.\n\nAlla fine, non so se ho trovato delle risposte… solo altre domande.\nMa dopotutto, questo è Silent Hill, no?\n\n\"𝘕𝘦𝘭𝘭𝘢 𝘯𝘦𝘣𝘣𝘪𝘢 𝘥𝘦𝘪 𝘮𝘪𝘦𝘪 𝘳𝘪𝘮𝘱𝘪𝘢𝘯𝘵𝘪, 𝘩𝘰 𝘷𝘪𝘴𝘵𝘰 𝘲𝘶𝘢𝘭𝘤𝘰𝘴𝘢 𝘳𝘪𝘧𝘪𝘰𝘳𝘪𝘳𝘦.\"",

      "review": "I'm still fairly new to the Silent Hill Franchise, with only playing the SH2 remake. Nevertheless, I understand when a game is not perfect or even flawed, despite the horror genre being one of my favs.\n \nSilent Hill f is a great game that experiments with a new direction compared to previous games in the franchise. Yes, some things are well implemented, while others are not so great. If you're looking for a compelling and rich narrative, then this game has you covered. In addition, the game's visuals capture a beautiful, yet creepy setting. One interesting thing that I enjoyed a lot was how further playthroughs (new game plus) reveal new cutscenes/or dialogue that add more to the story. Also, just reading the notes along the way kept me hooked, and I was eager to put things together. Furthermore, resource management and player progression are very satisfying/rewarding. Lastly, there are many good puzzles to solve, and playing on the higher difficulties really tests you at times until you realize the solution.\n\nNow, onto some negatives. The combat is the most controversial. There are times I liked it and others I didn't. The main issue is that it sometimes feels responsive and other times does not. In general, if you don't like souls-like combat, then I warn you before buying, since this game utilizes the combat for the majority of the game. Another big negative is the visual bugs and brief stutters you will experience when playing. Of course, it definitely is immersion-breaking, but it wasn't a big mood killer for me. On the other hand, experiencing stutters in higher difficulties can be annoying to navigate. The game generally ran a stable framerate for me, apart from a few sections of the game. If performance is a deal-breaker for you, I recommend looking for optimization videos or guides on Steam.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed playing this game and just kept wanting to discover more about the characters/or story.  I recommend this game to those who just want new SH content or horror fans, despite its flaws.",

The game takes place in 1960s Japan, so it’s not directly linked to the older Silent Hill games, but it still captures the eerie atmosphere and psychological horror the series is known for. It’s a great combination of the old and new. \nVisually, the game is stunning in a creepy, unsettling way. The environments are haunting, and the surreal imagery will keep you on edge. The story is unique and brings in new characters, so if you’re looking for something fresh, you’ll find it here. \n\nThe pacing can feel slow at times, and the horror elements may seem a bit familiar to long-time fans, but it still keeps you engaged. It’s a bit of a slow burn, but if you appreciate the atmosphere and tension that Silent Hill excels at, you’ll likely enjoy it.

      "review": "First of all Silent Hill is easily my favorite horror game to date and also my favorite horror movie. As an OG player and horror game connoisseur since age 6, this game brings a fresh and different perspective to Silent Hill. After my first play through I can honestly say.. I cant wait to really get into new game plus and continue to etch away at the MC's story. I wont give away any spoilers but for a 8-10 hour game, I completed it with mild exploration at 28.5 hours focusing more on combat and progressing than delving into every nook and cranny but I still absolutely loved the atmosphere and setting. I plan to do new game plus on casual so I can really take my time and comb through everything. Its very rare that I feel compelled to do this in games in general because I am not a completionist by any means, but the game just draws you in and makes you want to know more and understand more. \n\nWhat I will say is, the game is HARD and im glad they added casual because you can easily go from enjoying the game and being immersed to frustrated. As a young kid in the 90s, completing Silent Hill (no matter how much I died and got mad lol) was whatever because I had time, energy, and less responsibilites, but as a busy mama of 3 I cannot spend so much time being stuck on boss fights and difficult checkpoints. I loved the combat though and it definitely took me back to the old days (a good amount of jank lol) The puzzles were amazing and I did them on hard mode without any walkthroughs. The game is very impressionable, metaphorical, and nightmarish.\n\nOverall, I really loved Silent HIll f and will continue to play and uncover the alternate endings and do my best with exploration!

      "review": "Silent Hill F takes place in the 90s and explores a young girl named Shimizu Hinako who struggles to find herself in a losing situation where she has to be married off to a rich man. Since this game takes place during that time, there will be traditional aspects of how a woman and how a man should be like. While I think that is pretty obvious from the first run and the tragic ending Hinako ends herself up in, it doesn't explain everything else that's going on in her life that explains the story in a better picture. \n\nYou can tell that Hinako is a very lost girl throughout the game and doesn't have a clear mind about herself, or the future of marrying off to a man. All of that pressure building up by the needs of having to meet up to those expectations from her parents is very, very stressful and it shows from how she has viewed it and experienced it — based from her parents relationship together and how they have behaved or acted towards her. While she is very clear about what she wants for herself and what happiness is and means to her, she ends up finding herself not being able to do what she exactly wants. You may understand that she's very determined about not wanting to marry off to that man but the whole question is why she doesn't want that? That's where I believe if you want to understand the whole reason behind that is to continue the game on New Game+ and get the other endings. \n\nThere is other side characters that I haven't mentioned above and I feel like they are very much put off aside because this game mainly focuses on the main character Hinako, where her friends do play a small role into how Hinako might feel about herself or why she may act the way she does. As Shu, Rinko and Sakuko being her 3 main friends, Shu is the only guy who I think has a bigger story to him than what the game is trying to tell you. Other than knowing that he's the one who's been making the capsules for Hinako, you don't get to read any notes from him that you could of found within the game other than reading about him through Hinako's journal, or throughout some of the cutscenes. Besides him, there's also a lot of things going on about the man himself, Kotoyuki Tsuneki, who wants to marry himself to Hinako. You won't be able to understand him fully either, unless you reach the last \"true\" ending while reading more notes about him on the way there.\n\nAs I think by going through the game multiple times, it can be repeating for some people, but I believe people will miss out on the whole story of the game and what it's trying to tell you if you leave it off at the first ending. It's understandable if you were bothered about the games' combat system, because I myself did feel somewhat frustrated with it sometimes when facing off against one or multiple enemies at once. My main problem with it was when I had to face off against the last main bosses at the endings where learning their attacks took time to get used to, while some of their attacks felt impossible to dodge no matter how much distance I had and if I dodged too early or too late.\n\nI deeply and heavily relate to Hinako and find myself within her in some ways which most people probably won't be able to relate to. Either because of her age, her gender, or the whole aspect where she is stuck with having to marry. Other than that, she does have a lot of trauma and finds herself as two different people, where one is hiding within her and I find myself having the same kind of feelings and flaws as she does. Additionally, the way most of her friends seems to act towards her can seem to be pretty toxic on the outside, but after playing the whole game, I can understand why they acted the way they did.\n\nThe game is definitely worth the price if you decide to do all of the endings. Plus maybe by doing all of the achievements as well, which weren't as complicated as I thought they would be. If you do think of buying this game and not doing all of the endings, I would recommend waiting for the game to go on sale.",

Her only anchor being her friends who along with herself are dragged in these strange happenings. Happenings that become stranger and stranger indeed, as they unfold in an almost oneiric way, in true, old school Silent Hill fashion.\n\nSHf deals with the struggles of a teenager whose life is about to change drastically, if typically for the time, but in a direction that's completely opposite to her own beliefs and aspirations, and how such a thing is incredibly damaging and shocking to her persona. A parable about how lack of choice and freedom can violently impact the psyche of an individual; akin to discarding your old beloved self and becoming someone else entirely. As shocking as losing a limb, if you will.\n\nAs one would expect, SHf plays heavily on the psychological aspect of horror, where the protagonist's mind and her circumstances are more than enough capable to inflict terror and gore than actual monstrous creatures. But where also old gods, customs and folklore end up meddling with such fragile individuals.\n\nEven by not being set in the town of Silent Hill itself, f's writer Ryukishi07 shows he understand what he's working with. And in doing so, he and NeoBards created a new Silent Hill game that keeps most of its core aspects while also attaining its own identity. In other words, if I'm allowed some sass, f did its own thing instead of trying to ape beloved Silent Hill 2 as other developers might or might have not attempted to do in the past.\n\nNow, f is not devoid of issues. Combat is initially fairly strict and at times clunky and not the most responsive. The main areas are perhaps not as complex or extensive as one might have been expecting to in relation to the main games in the series, and enemy variety ends up being perhaps a bit lacking in the latter half of the game, especially considering the amount of combat the player has to engage with.\n\nYour mileage might vary, but personally I did not find these aspects to be much of a detriment to the whole experience.\n\nEven with it being a spin off of sorts (with the devs calling it a \"gaiden\" title) Silent Hill f is the strongest game in the series since the first three entries, and more generally good news for the SH franchise. The series is back, is doing well after an initial bumpy start (*cough* Ascension *cough*), and it looks like it's here to stay according to sales and reception. Well done Konami, well done.",

As these things go you don't get to spend much time with her and her friends before it all goes to hell. The game is gorgeous visually, it really makes good use of the foggy aesthetic and rural japanese setting, and this plus the game's soundscape make for an excellent horror atmosphere that keeps you hooked from start to finish. Without revealing too much about the story it's an interesting dive into Hinako's past trauma and a mystery to be pieced together, as you'll eventually realise things may not be what they seem. It makes for a really engaging narrative.\n\nIn terms of gameplay outside the quieter moments of exploration you have the puzzles and combat you might expect. The combat is entirely melee, with a familiar setup for a third person brawler: light attack, heavy attack, dodge, counter and some special attacks. It can be a bit janky but is also a big step up from the survival horror games of before (not a high bar admittedly). It has nice impactful hits, can be tense (especially above Story difficulty) but also lacks enemy variety. The puzzles usually have you doing something different each time, with the help of a riddle that subtly ties to the story as well to make them feel more interesting.\n\nOverall I can strongly recommend it to supernatural horror and mystery fans alike.",

      "review": "[h2]Dark Souls Has Done Irreversible Damage to the Gaming Industry [/h2]\n\nThat's the first thought I had when the game introduced me to the combat mechanics and how the game plays overall.\n\n[h3] Silent Hill [i]f[/i] [/h3] \n\nIts not a bad game, its also not the worst Silent Hill game either, its actually pretty solid in both of those categories! The game has a good story and tells it in a very Silent hill Fashion. You see Hinako from the start of the game confused as to what is happening and slowly loose her sanity while you progress in your journey. Notes are scattered through the town that you can find if you are a curious explorer that dive deeper into the personalities of both Hinako and other characters. Multiple endings like a true Silent Hill with different requirements for all. An interesting take on the \"other\" world and how it functions but also sticking to the theme of the game. Your character visually changing as the games progress by getting her clothe torn or getting scratches and bruises from certain actions and weapons also visually changing the more you use them are very nice touches. The combat is actually pretty ok too and I would say an improvement from the previous entries but... as you read earlier, I think they should of stuck with a different design for it or tweaked certain aspects about it. I do commend them however for trying to make it more engaging and more fun as the combat for the games were always one of the biggest flaws in the franchise since it often was either very repetitive or frustrating (in hind sigh its kind of funny because in this game it still is on many occasions).\n\nSo lets get into it, whats wrong with the combat? Well, it feels tedious, and at times I felt like it did not work properly. For starters, you have a Stamina Bar, which shouldn't be a big deal but... the game quite literally tells you that Hinako was in track and field and was a very good runner, so why the hell do we even have a stamina bar in the first place if she was already established as a person with good dexterity. On top of having a stamina bar they added Weapon durability, which would make sense if this was a survival horror but they are very clearly leaning more towards an action base souls-like combat. They also added a sanity bar which depletes if you do \"focus\" attacks or get hit by monsters which I guess plays into the psychological horror aspect. All of these different mechanics make it feel like Konami was not sure what direction they wanted to take the game at first so they tried their best to balance them all to make them work together. It's as if they were playing a constant game of tug of war between making it an action horror or a psychological Horror but also a survival horror. Ultimately what Konami created was a very tedious Horror Souls-like where you have to worry about too many things but nothing at the same time. \n\nSee the problem is that in reality, none of it really matters. Weapons Break? The game places tons of weapons throughout the town for you to collect or swap out (you can only carry 3) in case one of them is about to break or you like the other one better because depending on the weapon you use, they do different damage and act differently. If that's not enough the game also places a ton of tool-kits for you to find if you are an explorer like myself that allows you to repair a weapon a good amount. These two factors make weapon durability completely obsolete, and the point is driven more to home when you step into the \"other\" world called Dark Shrine where they give you 2 weapons types (one light and one medium) that don't break at all.\n\nThe Stamina bar made combats frustrating as if you run out of stamina, you are basically SOL, and you use stamina for both swinging your pipe and dodges because of course this game has a dodge! its a Horror souls-like after all! And yes, it also has a Parry Window for enemies which by the way, doesn't always work? or shows you when it happens and also a perfect dodge which was basically useless as attacking after a dodge can still make you miss and did not stagger enemies most times. I don't have a problem that enemies don't always do an attack you can parry because if that's all they did the game would not be very engaging and you would sit around waiting for the visual queue to press the button at the right time (which I did do in a lot of my encounters so it was still an issue). The problem Lies in the Monsters animations for their regular attacks as the game gives you almost no warning that they will be hitting you making it almost impossible to predict or react fast enough.\n\nThe sanity Bar I do not even know what the point of it was as it doesn't make you go crazy or lose health, it was purely just used for focused attacks which I did not even do at all as your regular heavy and light attacks do enough damage. I thought sanity would play more towards other aspects of the game but in reality it does not.\n\nThere is also Inventory Management which is fine but again, it doesn't seem like they were going for a Survival Horror and leaned more towards an Action horror so whats the point? it also didn't affect you much as most items were used to trade for a currency to upgrade your characters base stats.\n\nAll of these issues can be easily fixed as well if they would of just stuck to one thing instead of trying to add as many things as possible to make it engaging. Weapons don't need durability at all, just let me carry 2 different weapons and lay different types throughout the map I can swap with depending on what my play style preference is. Take away the Stamina bar, its not necessary and makes combat more annoying, I often just ignored enemies because of it and dreaded fighting others. Make my sanity bar something I actually need to worry about, its a psychological horror game and sanity was just used to do better attacks... why not make me see things that are not there or make healing items less effective. [b]Maybe always show when you can do a parry attack if you're going to include it, I had to guess for certain encounters and other times Hinako didn't even parry even though I pressed the button exactly when the animation played[/b]\n\nI also had a problem with the story around 3/4th of the way into the game, as it stopped being very Psychological horror and felt like it was getting very Resident Evil. It does \"explain\" towards the end as to why but it still felt like it was a bit too ridiculous. There is usually a balance to be stricken when creating this type of horror game and the scale definitely tipped towards one side more at a certain point.\n\nI know with everything I said it might sound like I hate things game, but in reality I don't. I did enjoy it to some extent and I think it was an interesting take on Silent Hill as it carries a lot of the things that the franchise is known for. The Game scared me and made me feel Uneasy just as the others do as well as it disturbed me with its imagery, sound and scenes. The atmosphere is most definitely there and there is a lot of highlights that I enjoyed a ton about it. With that being said though I would probably not play this game again, or at least not on hard. New Game + does seem fun but I will pursue that another time.\n\nThe game is very Action Oriented, which there is nothing wrong with that, plenty of horror games that are more Action Based than Survival Horror, but because of that, to me at least, it makes it less of a Silent Hill title and more of a Modern Horror game title, so if you are looking for a True Survival Horror game, this is not really it. It does have elements that make it feel like that at times, but overall, [b]this game is just a Horror Souls-Like.[/b]",

      "review": "I will never forgive Konami for cancelling Silent Hills (P.T.) and gutting the ending of The Phantom Pain, but I have to admit: Silent Hill F might just mark the long-awaited return to form for this cursed series. Flaws and all, the game truly manages to capture the themes and atmosphere that define Silent Hill. It doesn’t reinvent anything, but it enriches the familiar sense of dread with a narrative steeped in Japanese folklore and mixed with the fragile psyche of its young protagonist, Hinako. And here I have to praise Konatsu Kato’s outstanding performance, which practically carries the entire story on her shoulders.\n\nDuring the first playthrough, it’s genuinely difficult to grasp the full picture without searching every area for letters and documents. The game is designed for multiple runs, each unlocking one of its five endings if certain requirements are met. Unfortunately, the first ending you get might as well be a non-ending and personally, aside from rare cases (like Yoko Taro’s games), I’ve never enjoyed grinding through several playthroughs for the “true ending.” Even with small variations, it often leads to repetition, and that’s especially true here because the combat system is, sadly, terrible.\n\nThe developers doubled down on melee combat: it’s rigid, simplistic, frustrating, and at times nonsensical. I wouldn’t even call it “soulslike”; it’s just “dodge and hit,” with no real strategy or challenge (aside from wrestling with the controls and the lack of feedback). What makes things worse is that, while you can avoid most enemies early on to save resources (or your patience), the final act traps you in a series of arenas filled with the same enemy types over and over. The frustration piles up fast, and so does the urge to just finish the game and be done with it. It’s largely because of this repetitive and exhausting final act that I won’t replay the game, though the other endings I watched on YouTube do offer a deeper understanding of the story and Hinako’s “choices.” Standard enemies are very few and become stale almost immediately. The boss fights fare better (they’re more interesting in design and patterns), but Hinako’s moveset never evolves. No new abilities, no new attacks: just dodge, light hit, heavy hit, repeat. It’s disappointing.\n\nOutside of combat, though, the experience is much better. Exploration is engaging (even if interactions are minimal), and the puzzles range from simple to surprisingly intricate. Nothing groundbreaking, but the exploration + puzzle loop works far better than the forced arena combat. Toward the end, the balance is clearly lost, as if the game were stretched out artificially.\n\nVisually and artistically, the game shines, but it’s the sound design that truly excels. The ambient noises are constantly unsettling and what impressed me most was the dynamic music, which shifts and intensifies as enemies draw nearer, blending with the classic radio interference.\n\nIn conclusion, Silent Hill F is a game held up almost entirely by its narrative, and for that reason alone, I recommend playing it. Sure, it could’ve been called Forbidden Siren F and nobody would’ve noticed any difference, but I appreciate that beyond the fog, the developers kept the psychological aspect intact and weren’t afraid to tackle mature themes, especially those concerning the role of women in society (both in the depicted era and today).",

Some of the mid to late game puzzles really drag on subsequent playthroughs.\n\nThe flip side of that coin is that here’s a game that does far more with its NG+ and NG++ than a simple fresh run with your upgrades intact.

Is it perfect? No. Is the combat fun when you learn it? Hell yes.\n\nI grew up consuming Silent Hill. It is one of my autisms. I have to say that for a fact, Silent Hill f is NOT like the other mainline series games, and for that, I am actually applauding it. Silent Hill has gone stagnant, and the last few real entries (barring the 2nd game's remake, obviously) have been very confused about what good game design is. That said, Silent Hill f shakes up the formula and creates a story that is not only intriguing but also engaging. It has several small hiccups along the way in the form of obtuse roadblocks, and some... questionable enemy placement, but from what I played, I was blown away. I love the concept of the duality of self: the internal individual who is full of hatred and malice towards their life and environment, and the outward self who is part of a society where expectations keep you grounded and inhibited. The characters clearly have a deep and confusing relationship with eachother, and it's got me excited to go back in and find out more. The world feels deeply enriched like a FromSoft game, and that, at least personally, greatly increases my interest in learning everything I can about the world. I give it a SOLID 8.9/10. Good work, especially for a first foray into the Silent Hill franchise. Looking forward to perhaps a sequel one day.\n\nEDIT: -SPOILERS-\n\nI have now completed all 5 endings and am playing it for a 7th time. I GREATLY have come to appreciate this title. Time after time that I returned to it, I felt a new sense of self, a new angle to the narrative, a new complex viewpoint, and a new me, ready to tackle the game again. I have spent many hours getting very intimate with the game's combat mechanics through error, patience, and studying the way enemies move, allowing me to really respect what the game has to offer minute to minute, not just narratively. Having access to concepts like the 40 omamori and their individual nuances created an endless list of combinations that taught me to not only take advantage of the mechanics, but figure out what upgrade was most beneficial for my personal playthrough and when. The story became-- whoooo boy, SO GOOD. What a phenomenal, and RICH story! Every time I thought I understood the plot, I received new juxtaposition each run that changed how I felt... about everything, and the true ending, while somewhat lackluster in its resolution, was simply that: an ending. One of many, and a choice left up to you to determine: was that REALLY the true ending? Or maybe the Fox really did wet his tail? Perhaps the aliens were right all along! It's your choice, and it's your interpretation, just like everything else in this digital package, and for that, Silent Hill f nailed it again, 25 hours later. Fantastic work.",

      "review": "There is a lot to be said and discussed about how Silent Hill f measures up to other games of the franchise. More specifically, how it measures up to the original four numbered games. A huge bar, to be sure; one that requires more than simply being \"good\" or \"bad\". There is an underlying texture to those, an uncanniness. They are more than the sum of their parts, even if the parts are made of shining gold: the Yamaoka OST, the Ito design, the purpose behind it all. It might be lightning in a bottle.\n\nSo, is Silent Hill f a good Silent Hill game? In my opinion, very much so.\n\nIronically, I started this review with the exact same comparison I will now suggest you to avoid. Silent Hill f is different. Not just for the Japanese setting, no: I don't think it's trying to be like the Team Silent endeavours, at least not completely. It is less oppressive, less decayed, definitely less rusty. It abandons the (excellent) established aesthetic for something different, something more solemn at times. The horror in f feels deeply rooted in tradition, in the darker underlying aspects of everyday life, or in old, worn-out relationships. There is no strange town with transient, unfamiliar characters anymore. Here, you are at home, with friends and family. What is worse? As I said, it is a different type of horror, but still very effective. It feels more on the nose; less ambiguous, less mysterious, a bit more shallow, perhaps, but still Silent Hill where it matters.\n\nCombat feels great, and it is very much the bread and butter of this game, if a bit too prevalent. It's a stamina-managing scrap where you're constantly looking out for opening and counter opportunities and one mistake will probably have you expending a health item or two. It might not sound fun, but it is: you'll familiarize yourself with movesets, both enemy-wise and weapon-wise. From there, it's the joy of execution. Thankfully, the weapon durability gauge had me more wondering if my pipe could last another fight than actively breaking mid combat, and while there is unfortunately not much enemy variety, it also means you can more readily tell how a fight is gonna go.\n\nIt is a great horror game, really; and while a conversation can definitely be had about story implications and all the ways it deviates from the series old ways, I will say it's assuredly worth a playthrough.",

Також боси неймовірно огидні і водночас гарні, як би це дивно не звучало.\r\n\r\nЄдине що не сподобалось це бойова система.

There were a couple aspects of how the developers handled making combat more \"difficult\" that bothered me personally but nothing was so bothersome that I wouldn't recommend this to everyone. Even if you're inexperienced with combat you will figure it out. Just be mindful of your health and inventory. You have limited space and it should be used wisely.\n\nThe game was less jump-scary than I expected and I thought the sensitive nature of the story was told gracefully and with tact while also having some bite to it. The body horror design choices were superb. I'm not even usually great at puzzles but I played this one on hard and only had to look a couple things up. (I was so damn close to figuring them out on my own too!)\n\nWhile I am someone who generally loves replaying games I'm especially looking forward to starting a New Game +  because of how they worked new material into successive play-throughs. I really love that they reward you with a more in-depth story and different endings to work out.",

Certainly a different approach when thinking about \"Silent Hill\"\n\nCombat was a lot better than expected: What I mean is after seeing first trailers it looked like absolute dogshit. It's not GREAT but it was okay. I did play the game on highest difficulty options available at the start (Combat: Hard, Puzzles: lost in the fog). I don't think you should play it on lower settings as it wasn't THAT hard.\n\nVisuals and sound are good, felt like the game is being held back by UE5 ( I hate it)\n\nLast chapter did indeed feel like doing the same thing 5 times in a row \n\nSanity bar is lowkey useless lmao\n\nEnding wasn't satisfying, multiple walkthroughs are mandatory. I like the lengths of the game and it even could have been a little bit longer by taking away the need for multiple runs. Can't see myself playing a 10h game again \"just\" for different endings.\n\nGame has a lot of up and down moments. Some highs are very good, sometimes it's just straight up boring.\nNote here I am not interested in japanese culture so I started the game with less interest than usual I suppose. Maybe it worsened my experience, maybe it didn't.\n\nI wouldn't pay full price for the game, with a decent discount totally fine.\nOverall I enjoyed playing the game!\n\n7,5/10",

I disagree with those who say there is something wrong with the combat system or that it is tedious or that this isn't a Silent Hill game. While playing it I definitely felt like I was playing a Silent Hill game. There can be other locations. The place where the game takes place can be considered a \"silent\" \"hill\".\n\nThe only thing maybe is that some of the puzzles might need a little more work in English due to something being lost in translation, maybe, I don't know. However, I just did the mural puzzle recently and actually do get it now, when before I didn't. The Lost in Fog difficulty also seems to be fine too.\n\nJust because a game does things differently does not automatically make it not from the same franchise.

If you're a fan of Ryukishi07's work, you'll find a lot of enjoyment in it too, but bear in mind you won't get the full experience without playing it a minimum of four times - getting the four main endings paints a fuller picture. Unfortunately, that is a hard ask of someone if they're content with one playthrough of a game. If you're able and willing, it's worth it.\n\nI do appreciate the devs trying new things with the combat, but it is the weakest part of the game. I played on Hard mode my first playthrough on release and it almost deterred me from finishing. Going back through on my second playthrough on Story was too easy, so I regret my decision there. The combat was really unenjoyable. There were a lot of forced combat areas towards the end that were really unforgiving and almost killed my first run.\n\nNow there is a casual mode and I understand it's way easier now, so likely more accessible so I feel better recommending it, but keep in mind easier combat and removing some forced areas still doesn't mean the combat is fixed. It's easily the weakest part of the game and if you're willing to look past it, the game itself has a lot to offer especially on repeat playthroughs with new lore and areas to explore.",

You start off feeling clunky, scared, unsure. Just exploring on its own is fun trying to find items or items that explain the backstory of the town, the gods, the characters more. \n\nMy main complaint would be that it drags on a little at the end, and the other world temple levels can be a bit repetitive. But if you can stick through it this game is very fun and haunting.\n\nSilent Hill F requires you to play multiple endings to understand the full story which can annoy some people but I enjoyed seeing the new dialogue as I got more faith and stronger. I know these games aren't supposed to be combat oriented but man is it fun end-game to use the katana and counter, even final bosses.\n\nI'd play it alone for the atmosphere of the town and the soundtrack, the puzzles are hard but fun I wouldn't do lost in the fog difficulty puzzles until you do the normal version of it to understand it better.",

That said, from a gameplay perspective it's a little tame and I was deeply disappointed to hear they nerfed it even further with a patch. I've been playing on base difficulty and while I have died a few times from careless mistakes the game is extremely forgiving and showers you with health items. I can't speak to the Hard difficulty at launch because I hadn't touched it yet, and apparently never will now because of pandering. The combat is fine. Pretty typical if you've played any action game that has come out the last decade. Some fights are worth avoiding.

      "review": "Silent Hill f is the first new main entry since Silent Hill Downpour in 2012 and it feels great to finally have the series back. Even though the game takes place in Japan rather than the town of Silent Hill itself, it still carries the core spirit and psychological atmosphere that define the franchise.\n\nThe game excels in storytelling, atmosphere, visuals and music. It’s haunting, beautiful and emotionally heavy in all the ways a Silent Hill title should be. I genuinely loved almost everything about it. However, my experience was dragged down by the frustrating stamina system, weapon durability and the unclear direction of the combat. It feels like the game wants to be more action-oriented, throwing waves of enemies at you, yet it punishes you with limited stamina and breakable weapons. A bit of tuning, like reducing stamina cooldown or reducing encounters, even allowing players to avoid combat altogether, would have made the combat encounters much more enjoyable. With a few tweaks, I wouldn’t have many complaints.\n\nBy the end of my first playthrough, I was left unsatisfied with the default ending, which everyone gets on their initial run. I found out afterward that you need multiple New Game+ playthroughs to unlock more context, additional scenes and notes that expand the story. While I enjoyed my NG+ runs, I still wish the first playthrough offered a more complete and conclusive ending. NG+ should feel like an optional bonus and not something required to understand the full narrative.\n\nI played Silent Hill f on PC and Unreal Engine 5 definitely caused issues. My first playthrough was filled with performance problems that affected my experience. Lowering graphics settings didn’t help either and I eventually had to use a performance mod just to make the game smoother. As of writing this review, the devs have released official patches to improve stability. I have yet to test it out for myself but i am looking forward to jumping back into SH f as improvement on stamina recovery is included as part of the latest patch. \n\nOverall, Silent Hill f is a strong return for the series, even if it isn’t without flaws. I still recommend it to longtime fans. For newcomers however, I’d suggest starting with the recent Silent Hill 2 Remake for a smoother and more accessible experience before diving into the more demanding and experimental Silent Hill f.",

      "review": "Honestly one of the best games I've played since Cyberpunk 2077 or Red Dead Redemption 2. To me, it was close in feeling to Silent Hill 3 in a lot of ways, and I loved the Robbie the Rabbit nod! A lot of people seemed to be put off by this game not taking place in Silent Hill, but I knew that when I was going into the game since it's set in Japan. There are connections, but they're mostly Easter eggs. Which is nothing that Silent Hill hasn't done before, as they've had multiple self-contained stories before. SH4, for example, doesn't take place in the actual town. The story was incredible on so many levels, and I love the classic Silent Hill move of having to play through the game a couple of times to get all of the endings. I especially loved that the game changed in subtle ways after reaching each respective ending.\n\nThe combat was frustrating at first, but I've gotten so used to it now that it doesn't bother me. One of the things that makes Silent Hill what it is is the atmosphere in the game. That's one thing that SH never gets wrong, and this game is no different. It also follows along with the SH trend of the monsters being so heavily steeped in the main character's trauma and psyche, another thing that only SH can pull off quite so well. Also, like other SH games before it, it has bred an absolutely astounding amount of conversation about the game, what each monster means, and how deeply that fear can go. \n\nAll in all, I'd say it's an amazing game. Well worth the repeat plays if you can get used to the combat system. I think this is the first game I'll go out of my way to actually try to 100% in achievements.",

The symbolism, story, and characters make you stay invested and intrigued by what's happening in the game. All of this on top of an amazing soundtrack that pulls no punches, making you feel uncomfortable and uneasy at times.\n\nI gotta say that the combat in this game is far different from other Silent Hill games. Is that a bad thing? No, combat has always been something on the side in these games, and trying out something different isn't bad. The feel of it in this game is inconsistent; it just gets the job done and it's at times very unforgiving. Puzzles, on the other hand, were not the focus in this game sadly, but the ones that I got to do were cool.\n\nEventually, if you feel like trying this out, just keep in mind that it isn't like the other Silent Hill games, but that doesn't make it less than the others. It still is Silent Hill after all, and a good one at that!.",

Seeing the town get covered in flowers is hauntingly beautiful\r\n- Peak enemy design, extremely creepy and super symbolic\r\n- Boss fights were so fun, and the combat... absolutely loved it, probably my favorite of the series\r\n\r\nI didn't like:\r\n- The abundant re-use of assets\r\n- The sections with forced combat\r\n- Fleshing out characters through missable collectible documents\r\n- Having to run through the game multiple times to truly experience and understand the full story, even if you can skip some sections, I was afraid to do so to avoid missing any collectibles\r\n\r\nAdditional comments:\r\nThe first playthrough is confusing and meant to lay a ground work for New Game+, but it just left a bad first impression on me. Thankfully, I pushed through and kept playing, because I enjoyed the gameplay and the horror. After the second playthrough I was hooked. The bad ending left me intrigued. The good ending, on the other hand, felt like betrayal, but what the hell, I wanted to see the story through. The true ending, however, gracefully answered what really did it for me. I am glad I saw it through, but I'm sure most people won't.\r\n\r\nI feel like the game could have done a better job to represent the struggle of making a choice and ultimately avoid multiple playthroughs to tell the whole story. I understand this is common trope in the author's previous work. However, in a game, It just feels like a chore having to replay the game just to experience mostly the same cutscenes with a couple new lines of dialog.\r\n\r\nOverall, it is difficult to recommend a game you must play multiple times to be able to enjoy.

      "review": "As someone who thoroughly enjoyed Silent Hill 2's recent release, I was excited for Silent Hill F. Unfortunately, while the game has some strong elements, it falls short in execution across almost every aspect.\n\nMy issues began before starting. Silent Hill F only offers two difficulty options: \"Story\" and \"Hard.\" The absence of a \"Normal\" difficulty (usually the developer's intended experience) forced me into choosing between \"very easy\" or \"very difficult.\"\n\nI chose Hard, assuming it would be equivalent to Normal, since \"Story\" usually offers little to no challenge. This was a mistake that negatively impacted my entire playthrough.\n\n[h2]Combat - The Game's Biggest Problem[/h2]\n\nCombat is significantly more prominent than in Silent Hill 2, which wouldn't be an issue if well-executed. Unfortunately, the combat system is fundamentally flawed.\n\nEnemies have erratic, random attack patterns. While some attacks are telegraphed with parry indicators, many come without warning and cannot be parried. This punishes you for engaging with the mechanics the game teaches you.\n\nYou are able to \"focus\" to slow down enemies when they're about to attack... But only if the attack can be parried, which makes it unreliable.\n\nThe optimal strategy becomes staying at range, darting in for quick hits, then retreating. Staying close often results in unavoidable damage, especially against multiple enemies.\n\nOn Hard, you die in about two hits while enemies absorb massive amounts of damage. Deaths rarely feel like learning experiences; instead, they feel arbitrary because many attacks aren't properly telegraphed.\n\nThe game juggles too many systems:\n- Health\n- Stamina (shared between dodging, attacking, and blocking)\n- Sanity (used for focus attacks and \"focusing\")\n- Weapon durability\n- An excessive variety of items\n\nWhile this complexity works in some games, here it feels like unnecessary padding. The stamina system in particular is frustrating.  You can only dodge twice before running out, preventing you from attacking. It's manageable against single enemies but the game throws multiple at you constantly, forcing repeated dodges. You'll want to run around instead but the game blocks paths, forcing you into small arenas.\n\nWeapons break frequently. You can repair them but you'll usually find enough lying around for it not to matter. Several weapon types are functionally identical. I found it annoying to leave weapons behind when full, only to run out later. Interestingly, in certain sections, weapons don't have durability and combat is noticeably more enjoyable, making the return to durability feel worse.\n\n[h2]Item Management - Unnecessarily Complicated[/h2]\n\nSilent Hill 2 had a simple healing system: small heals and large heals, each assigned to a button. Silent Hill F unnecessarily complicates this.\n\nYou have a shortcut wheel with 8 slots, but the game has more than 8 item types you'll need. This means constantly pausing to swap items. Many items serve similar purposes (healing, restoring sanity/stamina), and some can be sold for omamori charms. Deciding between selling or keeping resources is great, but the constant menu navigation becomes tedious.\n\nThis happens frequently since items are sparse. You'll use a healing item, then find a different one you just removed from shortcuts.\n\nThere's no good reason to have more item types than shortcut slots, especially when multiple items do the same thing.\n\n[h2]Enemy Variety or lack thereof[/h2]\n\nThe game features few enemy types (some nearly identical), yet combat dominates gameplay. Unlike Silent Hill 2, where enemies appeared sparingly in specific environments, Silent Hill F constantly throws the same few at you.\n\nSome are particularly annoying, like those spraying goo everywhere, forcing you to wait before attacking. When you spend this much time staring at enemies, they really aren't as scary...\n\nNear the end, it becomes absurdly enemy-heavy. Two steps, fight enemies for 15 minutes, two more steps, more enemies. At the end, it was so ridiculous it made me laugh. It just felt generally very dirsruptive.\n\n[h2]Boss Fights[/h2]\n\nIronically, I enjoyed boss fights significantly more than regular combat. Unclear telegraphing largely disappears, and attacks are clear and learnable. The first boss felt fair and satisfying. I could predict when to dodge and parry, and it was rewarding to pull off.\n\nHowever, I felt like bosses were poorly tuned on hard. Some timing windows feel unnecessarily strict (like running toward one boss; Start 1 sec too late and you never make it). Fights are also far too long. After learning patterns perfectly and taking no damage, I'd still chip away at health forever. This isn't difficult, just tedious.\n\n[h2]Visuals and Atmosphere[/h2]\n\nThe game looks genuinely beautiful. The Japan setting is well-realized, character models are detailed, and environments are visually striking. However, I was disappointed at the lack of diversity. There were only 2 or 3 distinct environments and they felt somewhat empty.\n\n[h2]Story and Characters[/h2]\n\nThe story feels mysterious and has disturbing scenes and creative moments. But I found the characters uninteresting. NPCs appear briefly, act as if you're traveling together, then inexplicably disappear throughout the whole game.\n\nMy biggest disappointment is how on-the-nose the narrative becomes. Silent Hill 2 left room for interpretation and symbolism. Silent Hill F initially seems deeper, but by the end explicitly tells you what everything means. Instead of respecting your intelligence and letting you piece things together, it simply explains its themes outright.\n\n[h2]Puzzles[/h2]\n\nThe puzzles are okay. They were usually creative ones and had nice horror flair.\n\nHowever, some were frustrating, unintuitive or outright misleading (like telling you to find a smiling doll when the right one isn't smiling). I had to look up solutions for several and sometimes didn't even understand them.\n\nSome puzzles are so cryptic you wonder if you're a genius or just lucky when you solve them.\n\nOne near the end made you fight 2 tough enemies every mistake, with no escape or resources. I looked it up after wasting everything. The solution was extremely subtle with no hints.\n\n[h2]Multiple Endings and Replayability[/h2]\n\nTo get the true ending, you must complete the game multiple times. While I appreciate replays being different, I strongly dislike being [i]forced[/i] to replay. Silent Hill F's tedious combat killed any desire. I started a second playthrough and quickly stopped.\n\nGating content behind multiple runs feels like artificial padding, especially when playthroughs are mostly identical. It feels deliberate given how short the game is. Having different ending is fine... But I didn't feel like playing through it again immediately just to see the real conclusion.\n\n[h2]A Note on Criticism[/h2]\n\nMidway through, I saw people were complaining the protagonist is female or that the game addresses women's issues. This is absurdly stupid, especially when there are legitimate issues... The protagonist's gender isn't one of them.\n\n[h2]Final Thoughts[/h2]\n\nI'm happy Konami is making single-player games again and we're getting new Silent Hill content. The game has the right pieces: good visuals, an interesting setting, decent puzzles, engaging boss fights. But execution is mediocre across the board.\n\nWould Story difficulty have been better? Possibly. Though eliminating some combat frustrations probably wouldn't fix everything else. The game is also quite short, making the $90+ price tag hard to justify.\n\nIf you're craving modern Silent Hill, this is your only option. But I'd strongly recommend playing the Silent Hill 2 remake instead, or waiting on a huge discount.",

      "review": "It is not a bad game. It is visually stunning and with an intriguing story, being held back by an infuriating combat and design choices. I always thought that such a setting would fit well within a Silent Hill game, or a survival horror game like how it worked with Siren (which unfortunately suffered from bad gameplay design choices too). I started the game on hard and about 60-70% of the way through the game switched to story due to how tedious the combat became.\n\n      To start on a good note, I love the new setting and I wanted to see something like this for a long time, ever since Siren. The visuals are stunning and I really love the atmosphere, there are beautiful landscapes and places, while also being very creepy and haunting. The sound design is great and I can totally see how it can spook someone. The animation/mo-cap is done great, the characters feel alive and the cinematic parts are nice to look at. I liked the puzzles and it was fun to solve them. The story is great and intriguing, but due to the design choices to keep the player from experiencing the entire story on their first playthrough (you have to complete the game multiple times to to get different endings AND THE FULL STORY) and the tedious combat, it is really hard to experience it, and especially focus on it. The horror element personally was out of this one for me as I felt more infuriated. \n\n      The combat, while it is okay in the first part of the game, it straight up becomes tedious later on. The game took the worst part of SH2 Remake (the melee combat) and built things on top of it. The enemies kill you in two hits, and there is like 50 of them around the corner, and they respawn every time you die or use the \"bonfire\". Due to the sheer amount of them and choosing to take the wrong healing items with you can \"brick\" yourself, or better said \"stale\" yourself in a corridor of full of enemies that one hit you cause you are low and chose to keep the wrong healing items. \n      The movement itself is finnicky and very clunky where sometimes you dodge but you still get hit cause there were no I-frames. Or what bothers me a lot personally, is that you have the ability to parry attacks from enemies, but only if those attacks have a specific special effect when the enemy does them, and enemies DO NOT have special animations for those attacks so a lot of the times it's just a guess should you dodge or parry the attack.\n\n      Talking about the bad things, the items. You have a limited amount of \"inventory space\" and that is fine, for classic survival horror experience. What is not fine, is the sheer amount of types of items. Where some of them heal your health bar, other heal your sanity bar, others replenish your stamina bar. And they all do one or the other thing a little better or worse. \n      Also due to absolute diversity of these items you are forced to switch out the quick use items quite often, because at one point there is an abundance of item A, then there is an abundance of item B, then item C, etc. and that ruins the pacing by having you to constantly stop and switch them in the menu. \n     And then comes the quick use UI, which is kinda fine on keyboard, I guess (except that in action packed souls-like combat you have to use the 1-8 buttons to heal), but on controller I have to press like 3 buttons, to navigate a menu, just to start the healing action which isn't even instant, while I am \"supposedly\" being attacked by an enemy that can one shot me with low health.\n      \n      Having multiple endings is fine, and it can make the player feel like the game is bigger than it actually is. But we can safely assume that most players will not be replaying the game, at least not any time soon after their first playthrough just to get a little scoop on the full story. Especially, if there are not gonna be drastic changes in the gameplay, which is even more evident in this case, because of how tedious it is to get through those combat parts. \n\n\n      In the end, the game is really being held back by some poor design choices that are too deeply rooted to be fixed without building them from the ground up. Silent Hill was never known for a good combat system and this one will not change that, but it does offer a new original story in the Silent Hill franchise and a new setting, and that is awesome. \n      Is it worth playing? If you are ready to withstand the jankiness of the \"souls-like\" combat and are ready to play through the game multiple times to get the full story - yes. Personally, it's hard to recommend and I would be somewhere in the middle, but I would be more inclined to a NO, due to how big of a focus the combat is.",

      "review": "Don't read on if you don't want spoilers.\r\nTLDR, you're not missing much. It's a pretty huge letdown in the gameplay and story department.\r\nNow for the spoiler rant-\r\n[spoiler] Worst gameplay in any silent hill game. I mean that. It's an absolute slog at some points. She gets a devil trigger super saiyan power up halfway through the game that's charged by sucking up dead enemy souls and it's the most absurd thing I've ever seen in a Silent Hill game and it's played completely straight. In fact, its crucial to the plot our protag has a big wolf arm. Even after the \"power up\" the combat is drag. This is an action game with a horror setting and gross enemies, it is not a \"horror\" game. There is no tension, no fear. The closest I had to fear was an enemy falling out of the sky and stun locking me until death. Multiple enemies do this by the way. There are only 4 enemy types. All of which are just not fun to fight. The combat is meant for 1v1 but you constantly get locked in rooms with 4 or more and you end up fighting the camera more than the enemies. Weapon degredation, limited weapon variety, and constant forced combat made me not want to come back even when the plot piqued my intrest.\r\n\r\nOh yeah the plot. It's extremely generic adult fantasy fiction. I truly don't understand how it's getting glazed so much but as someone who's married to a huge book nerd, I've heard this story more times than I can count. Strong girl is pushed down by her family and those around her. She is lured in by a loving man  who has less than pure intentions. She falls for him and spirals down a rabbit hole while confronting her demons and eventually realizing she can make her own choices.   It's the most generic nothing burger story that every teen to adult fantasy fiction writer has repeated ad nausem. I get it's about the opression of women in Japan during that time period but I feel like it goes nowhere with it. Silent Hill has always had SOMETHING to say. Maybe not every game has the best story and I *really* hate saying it but this story just feels like \"girl strong, everyone else is evil and mean and she finds inner strength\". Nothing is said. This time period and even the topic of women's rights in Japan is criminially untouched in literature and the writer everyone has been glazing just rewrote Twilight but this time the GIRL is the wherewolf.\r\nThe characters you follow for 80% of the game are killed off-screen and do absolutly nothing for the plot. It's hinted there's more but nope, any lore is locked behind new game plus. So you get a guy friend who treats you like a guy, and a mean girl that's mean, you follow them the whole game, then they die. That's it. \r\n\r\nFinally, the ending. After a totally abrupt ending that left me baffled and confused (yes I read every note I found, desperately searching for lore or pieces that I could put together, only to never find any but descriptions of characters that, like i said before, don't matter to the story), there's a mid credits sequence that reveals it was \"all in her head\" and she was on drugs the whole time. The healing items were drugs. How original. So, all those gods and monsters and spirit world lore? Fake. None of it's real, she was just on drugs. \r\nThen the game has the absolute audacity to immediately present you with a new game plus button and ask you to do it all again to find out more. No thanks. [/spoiler]\r\n\r\n I really really wanted to love this game. I'm a Silent Hill super fan. I've played them all back to front on original hardware. I just do not understand how people are praising this as the big silent hill comeback. It's not the worst game I've ever played but it's just disappointing. Every turn I thought \"really again?\", \"oh, I guess that note didn't really mean anything\", \"wtf\". The above rant is so laced with criticism because I know it could've been better. The art is beautiful. The few monster designs we do get are awesome. The setting is unique. There's some real sauce here but it's used on old leftovers. Even the sound track sounds like \"spooky Japanese ambience #4\". A Silent Hill game with a mid soundtrack too? I'm just tired man.",

Right from the get go you're pretty much expected to fight enemies constantly and there's many areas in the game where it's simply not possible to avoid combat. There's frequently such crap as unavoidable enemies dropping on you from the ceiling taking away half of your health, or putting you in a dead end with an unlucky enemy spawn that'll set you back 15 minutes of game time if you die. Or the classic collect a key and 3 enemies and a miniboss will spawn behind your back the moment you turn around. All the excessive combat makes me more frustrated than anyhow immersed.\n\nThe game is at its best when there's LESS combat and it actually lets you explore and immerse relatively peacefully (for instance, the school area was pretty good). I've been playing it on Hard difficulty, and I think for normal enemies it's mostly manageable, but there are boss fights and certain sections that take several tries and memorization to get through. I shouldn't have to permanently lower the difficulty with no choice of putting it back as the only alternative.\n\nOther than that, it's definitely got the same Silent Hill vibes in places and some potential, but so far the combat and some bad design tropes (locked gates that could easily be went around etc) just puts me off from recommending it, but it's not completely bad either.

      "review": "Silent Hill F? More like SIREN Hill F\n\nI want to say I enjoyed this game, but honestly, I didn’t. This review simply explains what kind of game it is and why you might pick it up, with two sections below: Story and Gameplay.\n\nThe story\n\nIs it good? It’s an okay story. It isn’t a mind‑bending or truly terrifying entry compared with the existential dread in Silent Hill 1 and 3. The plot is simple to piece together and far less convoluted than the game tries to make it, but it’s undermined by poor handling of narrative devices.\nI’ll avoid spoilers, but this feels like someone’s attempt at a feminist plot without succeeding as a convincing one. Monsters presented like models in an adult magazine are repeatedly shown; I understand what the devs are aiming for, but the constant exposure renders it meaningless. I’m not sure whether these designs were created for gooners appeal so it’ll go viral with fan arts or are the writer’s otaku sensibility coming out (if you played Higurashi you’ll know what I mean), resulting in moments that make you roll your eyes and think, “Yeah, I get it. You’re the Edgelord Overlord”\nThe lack of subtlety and symbolic restraint is compounded by one core mechanic I disliked: the journal system. It spells out everything as if players were too stupid to infer meaning. Unlike typical games that let you re‑read found notes, tapes, and recordings, this game only lets you read the protagonist’s thoughts about story elements. Instead of seeing “this note said X,” you get “I think this guy meant X, and I feel like Y” which quickly becomes frustrating if you’re a completionist since there’s no reliable way to track what plot‑related items you missed.\n\nGameplay\n\nAs many others have noted, combat is poor: enemy variety is lacking, controls feel clunky and unresponsive, and sometimes the character’s counterattacks bug out and dive toward the camera rather than the enemy when locking on or attempting a soft lock.\nStill, I appreciate that the developers didn’t simply reskin Silent Hill 2, and I commend them for that. Unfortunately, there’s so much combat that the horror is diluted by the second hour. If combat were reduced or featured fewer enemies, the game would be more effective.\nI like the intention of improving combat, but at times I wasn’t sure whether I was playing Sekiro with dodging and rhythm‑timed attacks or a horror game. That focus not only weakens the horror elements but also reduces enemies’ ability to genuinely spook players. You adapt to them very quickly.\n\nOverall\n\nThis isn’t a bad game, but it often feels like a Siren game in gameplay, story, and execution. That resemblance isn’t inherently negative, but the experience could have been much better with more careful handling. It’s V for Vendetta‑level in its teenage intensity and feels foolish in adulthood. The story may feel deep, but truth be told it comes across as shallow and unsatisfying. Perhaps I expected the subtle social subtext of something like 1979’s Alien and instead got “the monsters are the friends we made along the way”",

I think it would've been better if the game was another IP that just connects to silent hill lore. \n\nI don't mind having the franchise take place in other towns or cities.

Direct connections. Giving another town a bunch of flowers that could've been used by the cult or something about divine blood/old gods which also is a maybe maybe not situation\n\nSilent Hill is all about the cult and ancient powers that manifest monsters into reality. The local \"problems\" let's say is what drives the \"adventure\" the character goes on, not the character themselves like in F. Why are we going back to what Short Message did where the fog is just imagined by somebody with trauma battling stuff in their head? That shit literally did irreparable damage to the franchise. So we're gonna ignore everything that happened in the first 4 games and chalk it down to a mental condition. Great. Thanks Konami.",

I wouldn't mind the cycling of about 5 enemy types if there weren't so many of the same sequences requiring the same strategies. By the end it felt like forced combat for its own sake, but I didn't mind the combat design on its own. My goal to finish by Halloween made me feel a bit unfair towards the end, but at a point it was more of a challenge to find the desire to continue on. The most redundant it felt was having to face a particularly tanky monster that requires loops of uninteresting fighting and evading. Even on Hard it wasn't really that much of a challenge, more of a time sink.\n\nThe setting was horrifically lovely tho; amazing environment art, VFX, and sound design/score. The character design and art of the humanoids was impressive, the enemy design wasn't as so. Good UI/UX. High production cut-scenes/virtual cinematography. The story was fine, tbh I didn't totally understand it all, but the actions of the protagonist were interesting, albeit countered what I would've liked them to do even given their circumstances",

You have a set stamina bar, much like James did in SH2, but once it runs out you become stun locked and cannot fight for a good few seconds. What is the point of having durability on weapons if they're just going to break after I hit one or two monsters with it? \r\n\r\n-The boss fights. I did NOT download SHF to fight bosses! Bosses that take ten minutes or longer to fight is not why I spent 70$ on this game! It feels like a glorified souls game, I wanted to complete puzzles and enjoy the vibes that the game offers but instead, I am stuck on a boss that I die to over and over and OVER again. This is the WORST part of the game easily.\r\n\r\n-Tedious map. This map is amazing, and it feels unsettling to play through, but dear god does it take FOREVER to finish a certain part of the map (I.E. The fox temples)\r\n\r\n-No enemy drops or any pay off for fighting mannequins or monsters. \r\n\r\nI cannot in good faith recommend this game, it is 70$ for a game that takes 15 hours to beat, or longer if you're stuck on those god awful bosses. The game has potential to be great but overall it is horrible! If you want a better experience, just buy the SH2 remake. Oh my god I wish I could get a refund on this game.",

(I got all the classic PlayStation games every single one  got a lot of collectables, even tattoo on me) this game isn't it hate to down on it. Is it fun? (yeah) Was the story good? (Yes) Was the jump scares good? (YES.) But this is not Silent Hill I'm sorry granted this would be the first origin story if we go by timeline but it's just not silent hill. everything is good about it but the [other world] is blah by the end of the game I was ready to end the game. Lost interest very fast. I did end up beating the game and the ending is WOW like impress but its just not silent hill. when It comes to the remakes now those are wonderful amazing but we are not talking about that here. this is a Silent Hill title and the thing I have told people even in my chat as I am a Live Streamer. If this didn't have a Silent Hill title this game would be  good for a Silent Hill like game the fact that this does have a Silent Hill title it bums me out that this game wasn't to impressive that I thought it would've been. don't take my word for it though I've seen a lot of people play this game and adore this game. it just to me this isn't it and I went as far as spending the 90$ package my fault but even if we don't get extra like we did back then aka ( steel book, statues, shirts, ETC) I was willing to drop the 90$ for the deluxe bundle for skins and early access for a quite let down. in my opinion again try it yourself but I wouldn't buy full price",

      "review": "I started the Silent Hill games with the recent remake, besides that, I've been a Resident Evil fan most of my life. I gotta tell y'all, when your franchise starts self describing as action horror.... it's not generally a good sign. This game was a total miss for me, combat was awkwardly paced but incredibly easy. I was playing on the games \"hard\" mode and I repeatedly had a surplus of healing items. And all item really, I frequently had to leave items behind or use the games sell mechanic. This meant I'd literally have to run back to sell items, which really broke up the gameplay. Silent Hill in my opinion is trying to feel like a dream, a crazy messed up dream. Hard to feel like a dream when 1/5 of my time is spent selling stuff. \n\nI didn't find myself interested in the story at all. It starts off generic and boring IMO (though I know some would disagree). I was willing to give it a shot, but when I'm 6 hours in and I'm in the most boring and tedious section to that point (though to be clear many of the sections were tedious and boring), I just couldn't keep going. \n\nAlso, the styles of the first boss were a fucking abomination compared to silent hill 2 and I'm so sorry y'all got done like this. \n\nI've heard a lot of people say the writing is superb, but I don't think I'm this game's intended audience in that regard, and don't think I can give a fair review. I think that gameplay matters a lot, themes and color tones and all that, they matter a lot. The writing has to be interesting enough to make up for any gameplay failure, and the writing just wasn't interesting enough.",

      "review": "Violent Kill F is a brawler that subverts your expectations by initially pretending be a survival horror game, before revealing this secret plot twist in the last third of the game. \n\nSpicy? Yes. \n\nTrue? \n\nVery yes. \n\nIt's not that I recommend against Violent Kill F. I  believe there is a lot of merit to the game, but unfortunately Steam doesn't have a \"Meh\" option and the like/dislike binary sandblasts all nuance- I'm gonna try in spite of that.  I think folks looking at negative reviews are just seeking earnest critical insight, so consider my negative review less a condemnation and more simply a warning:\n\nThe game you start with is not the game you finish with, and while a lot of folks (myself included) really like the game Violent Kill F starts as, not so many folks can say the same about the latter.\n\n\n\n\nPROS:\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n+ Despite the change of scenery, the SH aesthetic is alive and well in the remote mountain village of Ebisugaoka, complete with Akira Yamaoka bringing a wholly new yet still distinctly Silent Hill soundscape. Moody and utterly abandoned streets convey that desolation essential for fostering an introspective dread in the player, whilst also making for worryingly tight confines to fight for your life within. The details have changed, but the essence is as palpable as ever.\n\n+ Graphics are gorgeous and efficient. I can't recall a single visual bug or performance hiccup. The characters are incredibly expressive despite their comparatively muted and closely guarded personalities, you still are able to understand what they are feeling. \n\n+Their VAs are also very good. The Japanese ones, at least. \n\n+ The horror is mostly successful, so all that tension and threat built up by the presentation hits home.\n\n+ Monster designs are *largely* great, being both distinct visually and symbolically...Largely...\n\n+ Themes, subtext and narrative are all very strong, reinforcing every other element within the game... I have one very large asterisk bolted on to the end of this statement, though. More on that later.\n\n+ Gameplay is, in a vacuum, successful. The combat emulates FromSoft's formula but tries to keep one foot in the survival horror genre. This is anchored in the decision to make your painfully finite stamina the lifeline Hinako depends upon, and as it rapidly depletes, you're left wide open, forced to rely on footsies to evade attackers (to borrow  fighting game parlance) \n\nThe twist is that if you perform a perfectly timed dodge you not only clear the danger but get all your stamina back. Similar to Bloodborne's feature where you can regain lost health with immediate retaliation, this design choice was clearly to push the player to embrace the fear in deliberately rolling into the attacks of your tormentors so you can maintain pressure in combat. \n\nI actually quite like this design, as it makes for great one-on-one encounters and boss fights.\n\nThe key phrase is \"one-on-One\"\n\nThat's going to sour, and it's going to sour quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\nMEH:\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n+/-  Puzzles are extremely hit-or-miss, ranging from blatantly-not-a-puzzle stuff akin to Doom's \"find the blue key-card for the blue door\" to so deviously nuanced that most folks complain about having to brute force it. I'M LOOKING AT YOU, CORN FIELD. More than that, they're repetitious- puzzle difficulty here simply means tacking on extra reiterations of the same puzzle, ranging from merely tedious to flat out exhausting. I'M LOOKING AT YOU, CORN FIELD. \n\n+/-  Pointless trigger warnings really oversell the harshness of the horror and the game's themes. Despite the heaps of creeping, rusty meat, it's not that graphic nor is it particularly upsetting- not in any visceral fashion, at least. The themes touched upon on are real and heavy, but it also lacks the scope or ability to delve into those topics... Only allude to it. \n\nThere's one, theoretical exception: \nRyukishi07 loves torture porn, after all... I still argue it pulls it's punches because it's:\n1) mostly off-screen \n2) The victim in question doesn't react at all like a human, so it's just odd, not visceral. You can argue it's symbolic, and it is- but I still think that's a flimsy get-out. I watched Dagon (2001), dammit- this version is baby-mode!\n\nI'm not being edgy, either- I'm queasy AF if anything... But it lacks conviction. It doesn't commit to portraying this as horrendous as it should be, despite supposedly being a pivotal moment meant to drive home the story's message. \n\nWhy do it, then? Here's why:  \"Quick, we need a shocking talking point!\"\n\nHorror is subjective, granted, so I'm not putting too much stock in this as far as objective criticisms. Just know that the game talks up a big forewarning in one hand and then pulls all it's punches with the other.\n\n\n\n\nCONS:\n------------------------------------------------\n\n- Remember the combat system being good for duels? Violent Kill F runs out of ideas for escalation at the 2/3rds mark, gives up, and starts hurling clown cars full of monsters at you. You can't just run away, either- It's officially a brawler now.  You HAVE to kill all the monsters to progress, magic invisible walls and all.\n\nIt's a bad brawler, too. The variety of enemies is measly, so you will fight the same stupid 5 or 6 monsters dozens upon dozens upon dozens of times. They try to trick you by slapping flowers and jam on them in later levels, but it's just the same dolls you've been braining from the start.\n\nYou'll fight them almost exclusively in cramped corridors. Your main weapon is a nagitana, so your main charge attack used for tackling multiple enemies will just catch on said corridor walls and cancel out, leaving you open for every whiff punish imaginable. It's trying to emphasize spacing, but it fails. \n\nAND THEN they introduce the pregnant tanky Damage-Sponges that constantly crap out new monsters and clog the combat arena with fatass, And then copypaste them ad infinitum. They are simply and truly the worst.\n\n- Weapon durability. Fuck off. \n\n- Instead of making one really good, condensed narrative where you understand what's happening start to finish, they decided to chop it up into a million breadcrumb story-beats spread out over 4 or 5 separate NG+ playthroughs. Playing once is already a chore thanks to the preggerpillars, and the first time around it gives you -nothing- to work with besides cryptic dialogue and constant, aggravating vagaries.\n\nIf you want any closure, you must endure this lukewarm brawler another 4 or 5 times... It sacrifices an otherwise strong story in the name of a gimmick, meant to pad out the engagement statistics.\n\n- Instead of focusing on one or two subjects, it tries to juggle 4: \n\n1) The trials of being a woman in the 60s when all of culture was just one giant drunk dad.\n2) Hinako's dysfunctional-ass family.\n3) High school girls are the most vicious apex predators to walk the earth.\n4) Yokai space opera (Kabuki?).\n\nNone of it is bad in abstract, but it's incredibly unfocused in it's execution. \n\n\n\n\nTL;DR:\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIt's better for a flawed game to start off weak and end strong. Unfortunately, Violent Kill F pulls the inverse.  It's by no means \"bad\" or \"awful\"- it actually does a lot of things very well- but that just makes the overall execution all the more frustrating. It mismanages a lot and asks far too much of the player for what it gives in return.\n\n At 70$ admission and another 40+ hours play time for the full narrative experience as intended, I just can't recommend it- not at this price. Having said all that, it's still much better than all the western developed SH titles (Is BlooberTeam western?)- if that's the only criteria your choice hinges upon, then go for it. \n\nOtherwise, I -strongly- urge you to wait until a sale much later down the line.",

Even though the opening felt a bit slow, it quickly became engaging. The story drew me in, and Hinako herself was a character I genuinely liked.

Personally, they felt like they were created just to check a box. After everything the game built up — all the emotion, tension, and suspense — the resolution boiled down to choosing between:\r\n\r\n-> marrying the mysterious fox guy,\r\n-> going back to our best friend, or\r\n-> living with our other self.\r\n\r\nIt felt anticlimactic. Honestly, what a shame… this game had everything it needed to be a banger if only the endings weren’t all trash.\r\nFor me, the only remotely “good” ending was the UFO one — and that says a lot.

      "review": "I was really hyped about the revival of the Silent Hill franchise. Especially after the remake of Silent Hill 2, which in many aspects surpasses the original. Sadly... Silent Hill F is not made by the same team that made SH2R and it shows.\n\nLet me start by sayint this... The game is short. Quite short in fact. A typical run is about 8 hours. This is offset by the fact that, if you want to see the full story apart from the endings, you have to play it at least 3 times. But even with that in mind, it's only a maximum of 30 hours to see all important endings. In spite of that, after more than a month since release only about 10% of players have got one of the \"second endings\". Even less than that have bothered to play a third time to see the good/true ending. That alone should tell you how invested players are in the game. But why do people quit the game after 8-15 hours if the game is at most 30? Because there are many issues with this game. Ignore all those that say that the game sucks because it is \"woke\", the game could have been the most antiwoke media in existence and it still would have sucked ass.\n\nBeing (suppossedly) a psychological horror game like SH2R, it is quite striking that the game is not scary at all. While the story overall is good, it touches a lot of themes about the life in Japan 70 years ago, especially from the perspective of women. However, the depth given to it is quite shallow and doesn't know the concept of subtlety. The scenes between Hinako and her friends are the most overacted cringe ones I've seen in a long time.\n\nThe gameplay is even worse. Remember how clunky old school horror games were? Those were controlling the main character felt like driving a car? Well you'll wish those controls were back. The devs suppossedly got inspiration from Dark Souls (how original) and implemented a half-assed imitation of them. The combat has way too many different mechanics and combat requires you to \"git gud\" dark souls style. But here's the thing... If I want a challenging game to \"git gud\" I'll just play Silksong, Sekiro, Elden Ring or what have you. This kind of combat has no place in a survival horror game and it takes away whatever little \"fear\" was left in it. Speaking of combat, you can't just run and save resources like what you'd expect in RE or SH. The devs were so proud of their system that they put several enemies that outrun you to the end of the earth and unskippable arenas where you have to fight waves of enemies. The last part of the game in specially glaring, forcing you through like 5 of them in a row. By that point you're just wishing for it to be over.\n\nThe inventory/journal system is also quite a mess. You'll be constantly entering the inventory mid combat because there's so many different healing items with unclear names that you won't remember what each of them does. It's also quite funny that in order to get omamoris (equipment for better stats) you have to pray in an altar to spend faith and get a random one. Like a Pachinko, very much in line with Konami's recent business.\n\nBut... does it relate to the main Silent Hill series at all? Do you miss anything of the franchise story/lore with this game? Not really. There is a connection to the original Silent Hill that explains what happens in this one (although some might argue that it breaks the lore) but is very very very tangential. So you can skip this one and save 80 bucks.",

And it's a shame because the beginning of the game sets it all up quite well, and the setting of the game (60s Japan) would have been perfect.\nI think a lot of that is because of the game's emphasis on the \"beauty\". Which isn't a bad thing, but it doesn't feel very silent hill. Take the otherworld for example. It isn't some creepy warped alternate version of the main world, it's a very beautiful spiritual temple world.

I’m sorry, but let’s call it what it is.\nInteresting ideas, terrible execution.\nYou fight the same enemy over and over until you start bargaining with God.

Amazing.\nShrine? 50/50.\nThe setting could have been incredible… but there’s barely any worldbuilding. We’re in “[i]1960s rural Japan,[/i]” but it feels more like “[i] Generic Horror Town #7.[/i]”\n\nHinako’s diary doesn’t sound like an actual 16-year-old girl at all... 🙄 more like a disjointed AI trying its best. Breaks immersion every time. 😓\n\n[u][b]Horror[/b][/u]\n\nWhere is it?\nWhere’s the tension?\nWhere’s the dread?\n\nMonsters show up politely from around corners, never surprise you, and are wasted by the clunky combat. Jump scares get spammed like a cheap haunted house. Resources are so plentiful you could open a convenience store. lol \n\n[u][b]Monsters & Design[/b][/u]\n\nCool ideas, zero symbolism.\nSilent Hill’s creatures used to drip metaphor.\nThese drip… [i]nothing.[/i]\n\n[u][b]Puzzles[/b][/u]\n\nBaby’s First Puzzle Book.\nCompletely uninspired.\nWhere are the unnerving riddles? Where’s the brain-melting weirdness?\n\n[u][b]Exploration[/b][/u]\n\nNo houses.\nNo shops.\nNo meaningful backtracking.\nJust locked doors and hallways pretending to be streets.

Longer than it has any right to be. Filled with a tremendous amount of symbolism. So much symbolism that it just became a running joke with me that everything I picked up i muttered things like \n\"This soda must be symbolism of my nations decline into capitalism\"\n\"This monster must be symbolism for the female beauty industry\"\n\"The sheer amount of doors must be symbolism to transitioning into the chaotic life of being an adult!\"\nThat's of course, when you aren't watching a cinematic of a ritual taking place or when you are just flat out being ignored by the world around you. \nI think it suffers from the \"Its not creepy because its too creepy\"\n\nIt was a slog. I didn't enjoy anything here and I hate that. 1 because it was 70$!!! 2 because I like silent hill. This was just a waste of my time though... what a shame.",

But there are some areas that I feel are very lacking, and the combat tends to drag especially in the later half.\r\nOn top of that, in order to get the true ending to the game, you have to beat the game 3 separate times. I'd understand if maybe it were 2 times, but 3 seems just a bit too much for me. I have worked on getting the second ending, but at this point, it feels almost too much of a slog to bother getting the rest.

      "review": "i love the Silent Hill franchise. It's probably my most favorite franchise out of everything I've played and experienced. I just think this game felt more frustrating in a negative way and not a tense horror helpless kind of way. The combat in the earlier titles imposed this sense of helplessness on you while navigating through the town and solving puzzles. The combat is easy in execution, but difficult and annoying in tedium with unnecessary repetition. Having unique enemy types, a series of interesting combat mechanics and interactions, followed by highly tense environmental situations can be engaging and exhilarating, but when met with immediate frustration from ceaseless enemy after enemy the overall immersion just implodes on itself and fizzles out. One moment I'm following along with the story and taking in the atmosphere, then soon after I'm bombarded with forced fight after forced fight and I'm quickly taken out of the moment. A lot of the time I just felt like I needed to rush through moments and just grab the items and go without taking my time and enjoying what the developers created. \n\nWonderful music and sound design, fantastic art direction and atmosphere, and an engaging story that's original and unique to the setting at play. I just can't get past the combat and wouldn't find myself going back for a second play through. I plan on finishing the game all the way through, but only because of my personal passion and love for the franchise. The last half of the game just felt like a forced slog of tedium and I lose my immersion. Pick this game up on sale or play it through Steam share from a friend.",

      "review": "I love Silent Hill and I really enjoyed Silent Hill 2 Remake it was a great game but this is very disappointing... Lets start off with the good, it has decent graphics and an interesting story. Now onto the bad, This game is up there on the most unoptimized UE5 games I have played, I average 55-60 fps on max settings 1440p, this is made worse by the fact that the game ships with an outdated version of DLSS and no DLSS FG or FSR FG. Comparing to other UE5 games that look better, and run at double the framerate. Now the combat is awful and really makes you wonder what they were thinking when they designed it, the counter mechanic is completely busted on most enemies making you just swing your weapon at them doing nothing despite swinging within the counter window, Dodging attacks can be really funny at time because you can dodge it and take no damage then take damage when your i-frame ends despite not being in collision with any attacks. This is very bad because the game relies HEAVILY on i-frames which are also very unreliable compared to most other games with similar combat. For some reason there is no way to cycle targets while in target lock unless I just cannot find the keybind. Not sure about late game but early game the player character is an absolute asthmatic and after dodging enemy movesets you are left open to many attacks due to lack of stamina, this is made worse a little later into the game when the game throws groups of enemies at you. I would like to mention the fact I am playing on Hard \"Action\" difficulty although the game isn't necessarily difficult the combat is just annoying at times due to the clunky nature. Voice-over is okay nothing special, enemy variation is once again nothing too special and most of the enemies look like something out of Silent Hill 2 which is probably what they were going for in the first place. If they fixed the performance issues with the game I would be satisfied because it would make the combat less of a pain in the ass.",

      "review": "Edit: the Voice actors KILLED it however. Made it very engaging! Am just saddened overal that the endings you wanna get through to first or second time, is locked behind 3 differend endings you are forced to get before getting to the true ending. And the price tag.\n\nI think the story overal is great and I love that the setting is finally in Japan. You know, being made by a Japanese corperation and such. I wanted to see the silent hill premise on their grounds and it delivered.\n\nCombat: was good for me personally, I liked the fluidity but locking on targets was on the bad side. The camera would for some reason just not work in your favor if you fight while the enemy is locked on. Sometimes the camera looks up or at their feet so you gotta manually adjust it. When it comes to items they all serve their purposes well and are scattered relatively nicely across the map, maybe too much. I finished the game on my first play through on hardmode and I was just stacked with healing items and felt not scared or anxious going through the game. Same when it came to repair kits and a weapon laying about for too long. Doing a certain combo in hardmode where you hold in your heavy hit to stun and then light attack serves enough for most enemies. Combining the right omamories makes it even easier. Dissappointed for \"hard\" being \"normal\" mode except for when you take a hit which is a lot of damage. That's about it.\n\nStory: I liked the story but am again, a little disappointed. I'm a freak for otherwordly stuff or post apocaliptic settings. In your first playthrough no matter how much you collect or scourge the entire map (which I did but some how still missed files) your first ending will always be \"Coming Home to Roost\".\nDoesn't matter what you find or what you miss. On your first playthrough you can never reach the true ending or the good ending. (coming home to roost is a terrible ending imo). Now why did I paraphrase \"I'm a freak for otherwordly\" because that's what draw me in. The forced first ending feels like an ending where nothing was real, it's in her Head.\n\nToo short: The game is too God damn short. 10 hours. My steam says 23 because i left the game open. In game files it shows 10 hours. I played on hard mode with lost in the fog difficulty for puzzles. It felt like the game was long but whenever I saved, I saw the true time. It's dragged out for no reason and very short at the same time. How they did this is a miracle. The price pool of 80 euros is not worth it, let alone 50 if it drops for sales to that price. Wait till it is 30 or lower. It is NOT worth it. Looking at the achievement and it shows. There are seperate achievements of beating the game in ANY difficulty which means playing through the game multiple times if you want to get them. Which makes you think \"this is worth the money\" no it's not. Other games are longer and still have the default setting that if you beat the game on the highest difficulty, beating the game on the easier difficulties would automatically give you said achievement.\n\nReplayability: Aren't you satisfied with the forced ending that looks like the supernatural is just a psychological thing and nothing was real? Start a new game plus BUT there is a catch...\nYou can't immediately go for the ending you want to go... You're forced to get 2 different endings before the game allowes you for your forth playthrough to achieve the true ending. Yes, the true ending, where the supernatural is real... Locking this away behind a barrier just goes to show that the players should make the most out of the overpriced price tag the game has. But for a short game like this which is apparently also not good optimized (didn't have much problem with my rig but it was noticable) just shows the excuse that the price is \"right\" when it is TOTALLY not! The opener of the game is sooooo captivating and good! It fumbles near the end of it.\n\nMy first silent hill game: I barely touched SH2 remake so this is my first game. As I mentioned above, I went hard mode and almost always do for any game I play. I like a challenge. This game's hard mode isn't for me personally and the tools I was giving in that mode wasn't limited, felt like I was getting item prizes left and right. As I stated this previously, it never made me anxious or scared playing through this. Felt like a camping trip but with monsters and a-hole friends to boot.\nIt's unfortunate because I do wanna play more of this game and go for the true ending. I would've immediately in my second playthrough but locking it behind 2 other different endings, doesn't matter which, to finally be allowed to get the true ending after another 10 hours of dragged gameplay is torturing. I couldn't sleep properly when I finished it by the morning playing through it all night, so I looked it up what you fight in the true ending. Got no time for that, sorry not sorry.\n\nDo I recommend this game: yes.\nDo I recommend you pay the full price: absolutely NOT.\n\nWhen the most basic things are locked behind stuff because the game is too short is no excuse. I can argue yes it is short so i would not have a problem. For the price tag of the game, I'd argue back that infact, it is not a good excuse. \n\nWait till it's lower than 40 euros, or even free on humble, or other trusted websites where you can get it for lower. I personally paid 50 and it it still too damn much for this game.\n\nI like the franchise because I'd watch videos of it on youtube ever since highschool and the live action movies and this is the first game I tried because I well, love the Japanese culture and their horror style since they know what's up. But had to leave with a disappointment.\n\nStory: Good\nOveral Execution: Bad\nForced: Pills",

Constant juggle of assigning items to hotkey slots 1-8 after certain items run out.\r\n\r\nCombat mechanics (focus ability): double charge? Hold CTRL to charge focus and then use a charged weapon attack? In the meanwhile the enemy slices you 3 times while you keep charging.\r\n\r\nPuzzles: I chose the hardest level for puzzles. Clues make little sense and not helpful.\r\n\r\nHealing item limit: how many can you carry? confusing due to the ability of stacking items (with limits per stack), available slots in the bag, which can be greater than the limit of 8 hotkey slots.\r\n\r\nDie from insanity: health bar goes to 0 - you die. Sanity bar goes to 0 - you die. I'm surprised they didn't add dying from exhaustion.\r\n\r\nControl issues:\r\n- SHIFT toggles running but only you start moving, and then resets.\r\n- If you hold movement buttons during a cutscene to prepare to run or fight, they won't work. You need to press buttons after a cutscene is over to control the character.\r\n\r\nUI is a joke:\r\n- two back buttons - Escape and C, which serve different purpose.\r\n- different buttons for different screens - why can't I switch to inventory from the map view?\r\n- can't change graphics resolution at all regardless of the mode.\r\n- occasional Japanese text (no English translation).",

Even when they tuned down the enemies the amount of forced combat did not make this feel like silent hill. That's not even dealing with the fact this has nothing to do with the Americana aspect of all other Silent Hills. \n\nI felt the story was OK at best. After one playthrough, i disliked the combat enough to decide that a second playthrough wasn't for me despite the game really requiring three to get the full context. I did watch all of the endings, and felt them a bit contrived. It is hard to empathize with the character and even when you do, it doesn't feel really deserved. The best endings of the games are neutral at best and the ones that should be good are left with hints of despair. Perhaps this was the most silent hill aspect of all, but, as a fan of SH 1-3, I really just didn't like it.\n\nThe only way I would recommend this is if you feel comfortable carving out 11 hours for one playthrough (perahps 20+ to complete the whole thing) and enjoy punishing souls-like combat with poorly telegraphed attacks with a very dark and mysterious vibe. Bonus points if you identify as a woman being railroaded by society.\n\nSadly, despite having an affinity for 1900s japan and silent hill, this just wasn't my vibe.\n\n5.5/10",

But ultimately, if taking everything into account, I guess my feelings are, overall, just mixed.\n\nTo note: I beat the game once, then read up on the game's other/'true' endings. I had the combat difficulty set on [b]story[/b], the puzzles difficulty set on [b]hard[/b].\n\n- [b]OST/Sound design:[/b] excellent!\n- [b]Art direction:[/b] very good, though some designs left me puzzled (because of the way the story largely fails to integrate, or weave, its supernatural and more psychological aspects together).\n- [b]Combat:[/b] hot flaming garbage! I cannot stress how much I loathed the combat, and I can't imagine what it must be like on hard, omg. The very fact this is an action horror game, not a survival horror game, was also definitely not to my personal preference and initial expectations.\n\n- [b]Story:[/b] okay, so, on its own, and if only taking the first ending into account, I'd say it was... decent. I'm really not a fan of the [spoiler]\"it was all a dream/psychosis\"[/spoiler] formula as a general rule, but this iteration of it was alright (I've seen better, I've definitely seen worse) – most of the symbolism pertaining to the non-supernatural aspect of the story made sense to me. That being said, if taking the story's subsequent endings into account, it becomes mediocre-to-bad in my book. The supernatural elements feel uninspired, and again don't actually mesh well, in my opinion, with the more mundane and psychological aspects of the plot. I'm left frustrated as a mythology nerd and fantasy fan with something that has [i]no real taste[/i], and I'm frustrated more generally as a good storytelling fan with something that doesn't feel committed enough to its psychological premise. Ironically, [spoiler]just like Hinako herself[/spoiler], the story's different parts suffer from a lack of organic integration. Then, well... this isn't really a Silent Hill game, is it? As such, it was also very disappointing. Finally, the very fact the story's full scope is locked behind not one, but multiple additional playthroughs p*sses me off to no end. It is a storytelling design philosophy I hate with a burning passion, be it in gaming, cinema or literature!\n\n- [b]Theming:[/b] and so yeah, the theming was... okay. For me, it was all rather 'beginner' type stuff, that felt [b]too superficial[/b] in terms of content (with, again, wasted potential with regards to the mythological stuff), and [b]too convoluted[/b] in terms of narrative execution. I appreciate a male writer trying here, but the thing is I can tell it was done by a male writer, [b][i]trying[/i][/b], which just betrays an issue with the actual writing itself (i.e.: I've seen male authors write about gynocentric issues, or do \"feminist\" theming, so much better). [b]Silent Hill f[/b] almost feels like '[i]Man Bad Horror[/i]', which isn't the worst it could've been by any means, but still. Heart largely in the right place, but over-compensating, or rather 'over-showing' too much, is the gist of it.\n\n- [b]Emotional engagement:[/b] there was next-to-none for me, whereas Silent Hill 2R made me cry (even triggered me) in places. [spoiler]Angela's story, and James', were infinitely more resonating to me, as a victim of past CSA and emotional abuse, than anything that happens in Silent Hill f, for instance.[/spoiler]\n- [b]Horror factor:[/b] good overall, especially in the most Silent Hill-esque sections, but the over-reliance on combat-related jump scares really p*ssed me off after a while.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] I can't say I regret playing it, as such, but I would absolutely not recommend anyone buy this game at full price. My final rating? Right now, it's still kinda bouncing [b]between a 4.5 and 6/10[/b] – because of all those different endings and how I feel they impact the quality of the story as a whole.",

Liked the work of Ryukishi with Higurashi but here he doesn't deliver.\nThe combat is to slow and there is to much of it between exploration and puzzles. The hit stop animations are annoying. The stamina bar is in the beginning of the game to small. The durabillity of weapons is allright. The puzzles didn't engage me and some like the field with the puppets are annoying.\n\nI enjoyed the atmosphere of the town, school and mountain. They did a great job with this.

      "review": "I'd give it a rating that's between \"good\" and \"bad\" if there was. Unfortunately, my overall experience is leaning towards giving it a bad review. TLDR at the bottom.\n\n[h2]OPTIMIZATION/PERFORMANCE:[/h2]\nThis has been the worst performance I have ever seen in a game. SH2R performed great on my machine, both game uses the same engine, yet SHf is just outrageous. I have to download other person's \".ini\" configuration file to optimize the game just to make it even playable. There are moments where the game just suddenly drops to 5-10 fps, and the only way to fix it is to return to the title screen and load it again.\n\n[h2]VISUALS:[/h2]\nHands down, SHf visuals are superb. Eerie and unsettling atmosphere. Monster design is also great. Nothing bad I could say about SHf's visuals.\n\n[h2]GAMEPLAY:[/h2]\nThis is the first time an area has felt tedious on my first playthrough; normally that only happens on the second. [spoiler]Parts where Hinako goes to \"the underworld,\" felt very tiring and unscary in later stages. These are the parts that makes you say \"Just get this over with.\" Where further exploration of these parts only rewards you with boring items, and a little bit of lore. [/spoiler]\n\nPuzzles are also boring even on \"Hard\" difficulty. Most of them boil down to \"find 3 items, insert them, proceed.\" or \"go here, flip a switch, go back, flip it again, then go back again.\" Some puzzles are great and interesting, but the problem is, there's not much of them. [spoiler] The only puzzles that I found interesting were the locker and box in the school, and the scarecrow. [/spoiler] \n\nCombat could be better. You can find more weapons if you explore, but you’ll usually ignore them if all of your equipped weapons are still in good condition. The major problem is that, weapon degredation is so fast that you would rather run from the enemy than to fight it. Otherwise, you might face a strong enemy later with a nearly broken weapon. It only takes 4 enemies, maybe even less, to fully destroy your weapon because of how tanky they are, and you encounter one almost every 5 minutes, and at times, even 3 of them at once. \n\nFacing an enemy also felt very tedious. Countering them is fun, but you only get few opportunities to do so. The counter indicator is very hard to see, if not, super quick. Adding to that, enemy attack patterns are not telegraphed very well for you to know what the enemy is going to do. Some attacks are slow, then some would be instant. Using focus mode or maintaining your distance is mostly the strategy, and that felt very 'cheesy'. \n\nEnemy grab also feels stupid at times, they are undodgeable especially if its supposed to be a jumpscare. You're just sitting there helplessly watching your character go through an 8 second animation as you take big unnecessary damage, it would be better if we can somehow mash a certain button to push the enemy away.\n\nEnemy types, having 5 or more type of enemy to fight is great and all, it reduces the \"repetitive\" aspect of the game. However, some enemies are actually annoying to deal with. Aside from the fact that they are tanky, [spoiler] one would spit goo, and hold you down in place while the other enemy stabs you in the back. All of this happening in one tight space.[/spoiler] Other than that, common enemy placement doesn't make sense for me, at least, story-wise. SH2 has less enemy variety, however, common enemies are placed where they are supposed to be and everything feels in place. SHf on the other hand, feels like they're just throwing enemies at you to slow you down.\n\n[h2]STORY:[/h2]\n[spoiler]Its just a generic highschool girl story made scary and complicated.[/spoiler] The story felt like it was dumbed down. What made the previous Silent Hill stories wonderful is that they relied on \"player interpretation\", while SHf just straight-up told the entire story and left nothing for the player to think about. There's no mystery.\n\n[h2]POSITIVES:[/h2]\nThis is not a rant but a critic take on SHf. Though, I felt like most of what I've written are focused on the negative aspect of the game, here's what I actually found interesting and good about the game.\n\nSilent Hill set on Japan is a breath of fresh air. I love the new scenery far from the usual \"small and abandoned american town\". The rotten flesh and flowers that blooms to symbolize corruption instead of the usual rust and decay feels right for the story. Not only did it fit, it worked aesthetically wonderful.\n\nAddition of Omamori items were interesting. It's not something we usually find in a horror game, but it's nice to have for combat and survival.\n\nBoss fights are great especially the few at the end. Their patterns are readable which makes boss fights actually fun. Made me feel like I'm playing a souls game.\n\nSH2R's combat feels modern and refreshed, SHf retained that and added new mechanics which makes it fun.\n\n[h2]TLDR:[/h2]\nI don't regret buying it, I love Silent Hill games, and I love that Konami is now pouring their love at the Silent Hill franchise again after neglecting it for so long. But this one, specifically, is not for me. The game started strong, but fell apart hard along the way.",

With the success it had, along with how successful the Resident Evil remakes have been, it really felt like the horror genre was headed in the right direction again. Why this game decided to try to merge Dark Souls combat into it is something I cannot wrap my head around. \n\nThe story is true to the Silent Hill Franchise: It relies on staying eerie, body gore, and it's confusing until that last puzzle piece clicks and makes the entire thing fall into place. The characters have an undeniable mood about them that I can only describe as \"Y2K-ish.\" The game makes you care about Hinako, however, the supporting cast falls pretty flat. (This aspect gets a pass from me seeing as a main part of this games story is that the characters are meant to not care about your feelings)\n\nThe combat is really what ruins this game for me. I have played enough souls-like games to last until the day I die. I will continue to replay Fromsofts games, remakes or not, until I die. I do not need to go into a horror game with the ability to realm shift and critical strike enemies. I do not need to manage my HP and Stamina while using 10 different items to boost my power. \n\nI am totally cool with the boss fights sprinkling in some variety with the combat. Silent Hill 2 did this perfectly - I can remember all of the boss encounters, and the leather daddy will be burned into my memory forever. The main issue I have with Silent Hill F, is yet another fromsoft classic: Copy and Past the same enemies over and over again. My friends and I audibly groaned every time another birthing monster blocked my path. Just lazy, boring, and meant to suck up time. \n\nI wont stay long on this last subject: Westerners are suckers for Japanese culture. This alone clouds peoples judgement heavily on this game. Fun fact: Cherry Blossoms are not the only tree that grows in Japan.\n\nIf we've learned anything from Resident Evil 6, this is not the path forward in the horror genre.",

It started off really promising, with a sekiro-like fighting with parrying system, but very quickly devolves into the game throwing 10 enemies at you at once to mimic difficulty without having actual well designed fights to add true difficulty. By the end of the game bosses you fought earlier are common enemies, and they will throw like 4 of them at you at once. It just isn't fun! It took me so long to beat this god awful game and NONE of it was fun. \r\n\r\nThe story is laughably predictable and corny. Silent hill 1-4 definitely have a lot of camp elements, but they don't feel corny. This game's story and characters however, is so laughably bad and the metaphors feel like theyre hitting you on the head with a blunt hammer.\r\n\r\nI cannot reccomend this game to anyone.

Sluggish, janky, imprecise hit-and-dodge combat with sponge enemies and the most tedious stamina management you can imagine. I'm talking about a stamina system that would make dark souls II look as fast-paced as Bayonetta in comparison. Weapon degradation is there for the same purpose it serves in every other game it's presented: to annoy the player. Another aggravating are the enemies with infinite respawns tied to a late-game upgrade, mainly present in puzzle areas that are turned into a bigger slog. They tried the souls route and ended up with something that couldn't please neither souls fans nor the OG SH fans.\n\nThis game only has cheap jumpscares to back up its atmosphere, with the enemies (a variety of probably 5 in total for the entire game) repeating the same ceiling and behind the doors pattern throughout the entire game. The rest of the atmosphere is ruined by the constant stuttering issue that persists to the date of this review, since the pre-compilation step barely works.\n\nInventory management is also terrible, with many items with the same effect (but different amounts) making you need to pause the game and do inventory management to map a new pickup to two radial menus, just because you either ran out of the previous item or picked a better version.\n\nThe story is the only redeemable part of this whole mess, but it's not worth going through the game and the multiple endings from the artifical inflated ng+ playtime just for that.",

      "review": "I have no idea how this game has “Very Positive” reviews. People are praising everything for the sake of it these days, I guess.\n\nLet’s break it down:\n\nThey went with Souls-like gameplay, but enemy attack telegraphs are either bad or non-existent. Some players might be okay with this only because they play on casual mode and lose almost no HP from these attacks.\n\nWeapons have durability, which is a strange choice for a Souls-like game.\n\nXP is tied to items you find randomly in the world, not the enemies you kill, which makes little sense.\n\nThe attribute and boon system is weird. You can boost attributes, but boons are random and you cannot choose what you get from the shrines.\n\nStory-wise, the first two hours feel nothing like a Silent Hill game. Apart from the fog, the creatures and setting do not capture the series’ feel.\n\nYes, the graphics are impressive, and the environment is nicely detailed with a small Japanese town. But I cannot praise a game that feels broken and disconnected. The mechanics feel like they were added without purpose.\n\nWhat does weapon durability even add? Why are boons randomized? Why isn’t XP tied to enemies slain instead of exploration and shrine offerings?\n\nDoes any of this actually feel like a Silent Hill game?\n\nNo, it doesn't. It feels like a lazy and bad Souls-like clone with weird, random mechanics and a slapped-on IP name to get attention. If you really want to give it a try, wait for a sale.",
