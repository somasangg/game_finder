It has months of content, without introducing layers so complex it's impossible to understand without guides.\n\nIt is genuinely free to play, I never felt limited by not spending money.\n\nThe game becomes somewhat of a puzzle game, trying to figure out what setup you need for challenges and how to push progression in certain places, which I find really cool, but this puzzle-like nature also led to the only major flaw I can think of.\n\nIn some of the challenges and parts of late game progression, you can go in with an incorrect setup, and only find out hours later, when your progression plateaus falling short the goal, so it essentially costs hours to check if your \"solution to the current puzzle\" is correct. Looking at guides becomes an obvious escape hatch, but I generally believe games should be solvable without a wiki. It's definitely solvable, but it can get very frustrating, I personally ended up using a guide for a lot of the late game progression, but it still ended up feeling very satisfying.\n\n\nStill, it's definitely in the pantheon if incremental games, pretty much spawning it's own sub genre of \"AD-like\" games, with none of them managing to dethrone it as far as I'm concerned.\n[b]If you are into idle / incremental games at all, you should definitely try this.[/b]",

A play between manual work and automation upgrades that makes it easier as things gets more complex but always relevant for tinkering or in later states of progression subverted.\n\nBig con is eventually realising some complex number mechanics was not always intuitive, as in its hard to compare what makes numbers go up the best in the stack of complex interleaving functions; and thus going to a guide for reasonable progression (x10 - x100 gains, or even progress locks if you dont do exactly what is wanted) which takes away from the experience. \nThis is combined with a bad GUI layout which you have to click around many different tabs and drop-downs to get a stat you need to remember in the moment to make a decision in a later tab too buy or tweak automations; making AD also a memory game when reviewing what changed or needs to change next.\n\nThis \"numbers goes up\" game picks up a story after a few 100's hours. Was curious, at this point its became a long story unlocked with strategy and puzzles. \n\nSo make sure you get concepts like infinities down (not infinity points), and resetting prestige correctly for best gains, and knowing how the eventual talent tree (time studies) interact and knowing how to solve eternity challenges correctly, because its going to pickup in a new form later and you'll likely get progression stalled there.\n\nWorth it. The END is a great feeling and freedom to just stop clicker games for a while.",

      "review": "Spoilers below:\n\nThe best incremental game I've played despite many of its quirks and minor flaws. Many elements of the game are puzzle-like from certain challenges to some of the bosses in the game (especially The Nameless Ones). Things like the time studies tree is fun to play around with and master as you progress from the moment you unlock it. The added story elements after you unlock RM with actual dialog snippets adds a nice touch. Really makes you feel like this emerging force of nature. The destroyer. The credit music adds a nice layer to it as well, both alluding to the possibility that you'll restart the game and also giving a somber send off to the celestials.\n\nIt's also the only incremental game I know where at some point it simply hands you a rudimentary programming language and has you make your *own* automation. Really, the game gives you a lot of freedom to explore, and while the game may be an 'idle' game, there's often plenty of reason to be actively involved with it. If you need help, generally the discord has good resources (pre-made scripts, step-by-step guides), though I think for the best experience, one really should do at least some of the game on their own/blind.\n\nOverall a great time. For a free game, one can get a lot of mileage out of it.  Highly recommended for anyone looking for something that's more art/puzzle than raw entertainment.",
