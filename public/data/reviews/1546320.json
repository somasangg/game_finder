Probably will need to retire from this game without ever beating it once (multiple endings by taking specific actions). I think it's a good game, but I don't have the patience to get through it. It's free, and I think there's people out there who love idlers and may love this game. So I'll recommend it for those fellow nutcases.",

Bluntly, you have to know EXACTLY how to Progress at certain points or you will sit there grinding forever and making no headway. It's frustrating to have to check the forums over and over to learn something that the game didn't communicate in the first place. The numbers are all right there, it's true, but that also means you have to know what they mean and how they actually impact gameplay, not to mention what you'll need to beat certain bosses. It's also annoying because the game implies a certain freedom of choice at points - branching paths to the same destination - but it's hard to feel like that matters when I really have to do things a certain way to get anywhere.\n\nThat DOES lighten up after you beat the Orc, for what it's worth, but after a point just opening the game feels more like work than play for me.

As you advance, more automation and systems unlock, giving you tools to streamline your adventure or dive deeper into strategy.\nThe narrative hooks you immediately: starting from a small village, a father’s plea sets your quest in motion. You battle monsters, tackle quests, and form bonds with companions, all while your decisions influence the multiple possible endings.\nText Idle RPG is an idle game that never feels passive—you’re shaping a story, leveling your monsters, and making meaningful choices every step of the way. 10/10 for a satisfying blend of narrative depth and idle mechanics.",
