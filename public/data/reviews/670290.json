Отлично смотрится в портретной ориентации, однако на телефоне может быть неудобно. Небольшие недостатки: реклама в бесплатной версии и сложность для новичков. Тем не менее, это отличный выбор для поклонников настольных игр. Рекомендую!",

It's a lifestyle. A digital dive bar where dreams are made, friendships are tested, and occasionally, someone rage-quits after scratching on the 8-ball for the fifth time in a row (yes, that was me).\n\n[h3]Graphics:[/h3]\nShockingly decent for a game that feels like it was coded during a Red Bull-fueled weekend in 2009. The balls are round, the table is green, and I’ve yet to fall through the floor. 10/10 realism.\n\n[h3]Gameplay:[/h3]\nEver wanted to miss a simple shot while a guy in Romania hits a five-rail combo like he’s auditioning for Fast & Furious: Cue Drift? Now’s your chance. The physics are suspiciously good, which means you have no excuses for your bad shots, and I hate that.\n\n[h3]Community:[/h3]\nEqual parts friendly, terrifying, and probably full of retired pool sharks looking to relive their glory days between bingo nights. Someone called me a \"cue clown\" last night and I’m still emotionally recovering.\n\n[h3]Pros:[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]It’s free\n[*]Surprisingly competitive\n[*]That satisfying click when the balls hit\n[*]Lets you pretend you're good at geometry\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Cons:[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]Your ego will be shattered by a 12-year-old with anime profile pic\n[*]No actual beer served\n[*]I am no longer on speaking terms with my mouse\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Final Verdict:[/h3]\nI installed it as a joke.\nI now own three virtual cues, wear sunglasses indoors, and refer to myself as “The Pocket Whisperer.”",

      "review": "Real Pool 3D, better known to many as Poolians, has been nothing short of a gem in my gaming journey. It’s rare to find a game that blends realism, accessibility, and community so seamlessly, yet Poolians manages to deliver all of that and more. What might look on the surface like “just another pool game” is, in reality, one of the most polished and rewarding virtual billiards experiences I’ve ever played.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment I launched it, I was struck by how immersive the physics are. Every shot, every spin, and every rebound feels authentic, as though I were holding a real cue stick in my hands. The ball movement is smooth and natural, and the attention to detail in how spin affects trajectory sets Poolians apart from countless other pool simulators. It really feels like the developers went above and beyond to capture the essence of real-life billiards and bring it into a digital space.\r\n\r\nThe graphics are simple yet elegant—clean enough to keep you focused on the game, but detailed enough to give you that satisfying sense of realism. The 3D perspective is excellent, letting you line up shots with precision while still feeling like you’re standing over a real pool table. The controls are intuitive, giving you just the right balance between ease-of-use for newcomers and depth for players who want to master angles, spins, and trick shots.\r\n\r\nWhat truly makes Poolians stand out for me, though, is the impact it’s had on my life. At first, I treated it as a casual game, something to pick up and play during short breaks. But over time, it became so much more. Playing regularly sharpened my sense of geometry and angles in ways I didn’t expect. I started noticing how my patience improved, as I learned to carefully plan out my shots instead of rushing. It even carried over into real life—my ability to focus, strategize, and stay calm under pressure has improved thanks to this game. It’s strange to say, but a digital pool game has genuinely helped me grow.\r\n\r\nAnother highlight is the multiplayer aspect. The community around Poolians is surprisingly warm and competitive in the best way possible. It’s not just about winning or losing, but about sharing a love for the game of pool. I’ve met people from all over the world, exchanged tips, and even made friends who I regularly play with. That sense of connection—of sitting “around the table” with others despite the distance—has been invaluable.\r\n\r\nWhat started as a simple download turned into a hobby that I now truly look forward to. Poolians has become part of my routine, something I can rely on whether I want a few minutes of relaxation or an intense competitive match. It’s amazing how a game like this can brighten your day, bring people together, and help you feel a sense of accomplishment in even the smallest victories.\r\n\r\nIn short, Real Pool 3D (Poolians) is more than just a pool simulator—it’s an experience that combines realism, skill-building, and social connection in a way very few games manage. It has given me not only entertainment but also personal growth and new friendships, which is why I hold it in such high regard. If anyone is looking for a pool game that truly captures the magic of billiards while also enriching your life, this is the one to play.\r\n\r\nRating: 10/10",

The background looks like a mix between a retirement home and a sketchy bar — but hey, who said grandparents don’t throw wild parties with fifty identical bottles lying around?\n\nThe cues feel great to hold, the balls are big and perfectly round, and they make that beautiful clack sound when the cue hits them. Sometimes they even end up in holes.\nIf you’re into holes, this one’s for you.\n\nYou can even change the color of the table — I recommend red if you’re going for a more... romantic vibe.\nAnd the balls? Some are full, some are not, and they come in all kinds of colors. Truly a diverse experience.\n\nNow, the soundtrack… how do I say this nicely?\nIt’s like a McDonald’s burger without the bun, the meat, the sauce, the lettuce, the onions, or the pickles — basically the soundtrack of the void. The music is about as present as people outside in 2020, if you catch my drift.\n\nAnyway, highly recommend downloading it.\nAlso, the file size is probably as massive as GTA 6 — a whole 50 MB.",

You start getting nonstop errors like “Game login timeout1, please try again.” The client freezes, the servers block login, and the experience falls apart. It genuinely feels intentional, as if free users are being forced into buying VIP.\n\nIf this is done on purpose, it violates the very terms under which the game is offered as “free.” A game advertised as free shouldn’t quietly sabotage access to push players into paying.\n\nThey are not honest.
