It is a real masterpiece, it is such a shame that it was turned into a GACHA game HOWEVER the antidote is using the WeMod trainer to be able to complete all content of this game FOR FREE.\n\nDo not play this if you haven't played the original Final Fantasy VII yet, the classic old one. This should be the game you play right after and focus on the Crisis Core campaign to learn about Zack and Aerith's life before Cloud who have some of the most beautiful characters and relationships. The archetypical forms of evil in this universe are applicable to our real world, serpent-like corperations combined with evil scientists conspiring to overthrow the old divine world energies to manipulate and engineer it to their liking. The protagonists are extreme anti-shira members who blow up their reactors and they give up their entire lives to stop evil. Zack arguably has the most heroic story of them all.\n\nEver Crisis tells the story of FF VII in the way it was intended, they remastered the RPG platformer gameplay, lots of text dialogue and top-down perspective so the real intricate details of each character's personality is up to your own imagination like the original book effect with many movies that butchered the personalities with their acting. \nAerith and Zack's personalities are experienced the best through Ever Crisis as they leave lots up to interpretation. \n\nThe main menu of this game is beautiful, the main menu themes is one of the best I've run into.\nThis game is free and you can complete all content with WeMod for free.

      "review": "As a long-time Final Fantasy fan, I went into Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis with cautious optimism, hoping for a nostalgic yet engaging experience. Unfortunately, what I found instead was one of the most blatant “pay to win” titles I’ve ever played, wrapped in a convoluted system that feels designed to frustrate rather than entertain.\n\nFirst and foremost, there’s barely any gameplay to speak of. Most missions are short, shallow encounters with minimal strategy required, leaving the whole experience feeling more like a series of automated cutscenes than an actual RPG. Worse, the storyline is practically impossible to follow, since missions constantly jump around the timeline without explanation. Anyone coming in for a cohesive retelling of the Final Fantasy 7 saga will walk away confused and disappointed.\n\nThe constant stream of “rewards” is another glaring problem. Instead of feeling satisfying, they come across like the psychological bait of a slot machine. Everything in the game, from unlocking equipment to powering up characters, is tied to gacha pulls and random drops, creating the atmosphere of a gambling addict’s dream rather than a true RPG progression system.\n\nSpeaking of progression, the user interface is a nightmare. Overly complicated menus and poorly explained mechanics make it nearly impossible to engage with equipment upgrades in any meaningful way. Half the time you’re left wondering what you’re supposed to be doing, unless of course, you’re willing to spend money.\n\nAnd that’s really the heart of it: this game is a cash grab through and through. You’re constantly encouraged (and in some cases practically forced) to purchase premium currency just to progress. There’s little explanation for how one is supposed to advance without spending money, leaving free-to-play players completely out of the loop.\n\nIn the end, Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis is a shallow, confusing, pay-to-win mess that relies on nostalgia and the Final Fantasy brand name to lure players into its monetization trap. For fans hoping to relive the magic of Final Fantasy 7, this isn’t it, it’s just another gacha treadmill dressed in familiar clothing.\n\nVerdict: 2/10 – A hollow experience, more interested in your wallet than your enjoyment.",

It is very noticable designed to make your life revolve around it and spend money because skill is a joke to these devs. Honestly this is the most life-less husk of a game I had the misfortune to ever be somewhat addicted to. This is more toxic than my relationship to Apex Legends or CS or any other franchise. It is just so so sad to see this IP and the potential (the art style, combat, ...) be exploited so shamelessly. You truly have 0 Chance to clear much of the content if you don't drop a lot of money on it. When I first was addicted to this I dished at over 100€ before I came back to my senses; this last week I spend like 15 or so and I feel ashamed. I don't know how I can't turn this off. It's probably because it's that good in creating FOMO and on a positive note, I like the strategizing for clearing content but yeah, all the positives are drown in a disgraceful design that revolves about making you spend more and more money. It's a disgrace of a \"game\" and much more closely resembles a glorified slot machine! Stay away if you know what's good for you. If you're interested in the story (First Soldier) watch the videos of \"Sector 6\". I can recommend those :3",

On a side-note, I notice Steam sells a similar version of the game for a \"pay once\" price tag and without the pay2win aspects.\n- Occasional free rewards: Early progression gives some free summons and weapons to get started.\n\nCons\n- Excessive load screens: Constant loading between menus, missions, and even basic actions — all slow and disruptive to gameplay.\n- Clunky interface: Too many taps and nested menus for simple tasks like upgrading or equipping gear. Areas like skill trees should have an \"upgrade all\" fucntion but somehow miss this feature turning a tree upgrade into a very long sequence of mouse moves and clicks.\n- Severe Pay-to-Win mechanics: Many powerful weapons, outfits, and upgrades locked behind premium currency or gacha draws.\n- Grinding or paying required: Sharp power spikes force players to either grind excessively or spend money to progress.\n- Slow story-line pacing: Content is drip-fed; story missions are brief and often gated behind resource requirements.\n- Repetitive game-play: Battle structure becomes monotonous, emphasising auto-combat and farming.\n- Performance issues: Lag, long downloads, and memory bloat.\n\nVerdict\nFinal Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis looks and sounds like a love letter to fans, but plays like a sluggish, monetisation driven grind. Its nostalgic charm and impressive visuals can’t make up for the constant loading screens, painfully slow pacing, and aggressive Pay-to-Win systems.\n\nUnless you’re a die-hard FF7 fan willing to tolerate frustration for the sake of nostalgia, this one’s hard to recommend.\n\nScore: 5/10 (for fans - give it a try) or 3/10 (for everyone else - avoid as it's a waste of time)",

      "review": "As a long-time Final Fantasy fan, I went into Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis with cautious optimism, hoping for a nostalgic yet engaging experience. Unfortunately, what I found instead was one of the most blatant “pay to win” titles I’ve ever played, wrapped in a convoluted system that feels designed to frustrate rather than entertain.\n\nFirst and foremost, there’s barely any gameplay to speak of. Most missions are short, shallow encounters with minimal strategy required, leaving the whole experience feeling more like a series of automated cutscenes than an actual RPG. Worse, the storyline is practically impossible to follow, since missions constantly jump around the timeline without explanation. Anyone coming in for a cohesive retelling of the Final Fantasy 7 saga will walk away confused and disappointed.\n\nThe constant stream of “rewards” is another glaring problem. Instead of feeling satisfying, they come across like the psychological bait of a slot machine. Everything in the game, from unlocking equipment to powering up characters, is tied to gacha pulls and random drops, creating the atmosphere of a gambling addict’s dream rather than a true RPG progression system.\n\nSpeaking of progression, the user interface is a nightmare. Overly complicated menus and poorly explained mechanics make it nearly impossible to engage with equipment upgrades in any meaningful way. Half the time you’re left wondering what you’re supposed to be doing, unless of course, you’re willing to spend money.\n\nAnd that’s really the heart of it: this game is a cash grab through and through. You’re constantly encouraged (and in some cases practically forced) to purchase premium currency just to progress. There’s little explanation for how one is supposed to advance without spending money, leaving free-to-play players completely out of the loop.\n\nIn the end, Final Fantasy 7: Ever Crisis is a shallow, confusing, pay-to-win mess that relies on nostalgia and the Final Fantasy brand name to lure players into its monetization trap. For fans hoping to relive the magic of Final Fantasy 7, this isn’t it, it’s just another gacha treadmill dressed in familiar clothing.\n\nVerdict: 2/10 – A hollow experience, more interested in your wallet than your enjoyment.",

It is very noticable designed to make your life revolve around it and spend money because skill is a joke to these devs. Honestly this is the most life-less husk of a game I had the misfortune to ever be somewhat addicted to. This is more toxic than my relationship to Apex Legends or CS or any other franchise. It is just so so sad to see this IP and the potential (the art style, combat, ...) be exploited so shamelessly. You truly have 0 Chance to clear much of the content if you don't drop a lot of money on it. When I first was addicted to this I dished at over 100€ before I came back to my senses; this last week I spend like 15 or so and I feel ashamed. I don't know how I can't turn this off. It's probably because it's that good in creating FOMO and on a positive note, I like the strategizing for clearing content but yeah, all the positives are drown in a disgraceful design that revolves about making you spend more and more money. It's a disgrace of a \"game\" and much more closely resembles a glorified slot machine! Stay away if you know what's good for you. If you're interested in the story (First Soldier) watch the videos of \"Sector 6\". I can recommend those :3",

      "review": "384 hours, what a waste. If you aren't into Gacha then this isn't for you. If you are into Gacha, avoid this at all costs, it's a horrible gacha game. If you're into FF7, avoid at all costs, it's a lazy cash grab. If any of the very minor story beats for First Soldier actually become relevant for the Remake series I'll eat my hat, so don't go in expecting that. The latest update, the 2 year anniversary where they \"Added\" Advent Children, is a joke. Cutscenes pulled directly from the movie and played at a horrible frame rate, interspersed by only a single battle with Bahamut Sin played multiple times. I'm done with it, by the way it's going it looks like it's in its end of life anyway.",

      "review": "Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis is initally addictive but quickly becomes painful.\n\nPros:\n- Nostalgic presentation: Faithfully revisits the Final Fantasy VII universe with updated visuals and familiar characters.\n- Strong visuals: Polished character models and cinematic cutscenes capture the spirit of the original.\n- Decent music: Classic FF7 themes and sound design are recreated beautifully.\n- Ambitious scope: Combines multiple FF7 titles (Crisis Core, Before Crisis, The First SOLDIER, etc.) into one overarching mobile package. On a side-note, I notice Steam sells a similar version of the game for a \"pay once\" price tag and without the pay2win aspects.\n- Occasional free rewards: Early progression gives some free summons and weapons to get started.\n\nCons\n- Excessive load screens: Constant loading between menus, missions, and even basic actions — all slow and disruptive to gameplay.\n- Clunky interface: Too many taps and nested menus for simple tasks like upgrading or equipping gear. Areas like skill trees should have an \"upgrade all\" fucntion but somehow miss this feature turning a tree upgrade into a very long sequence of mouse moves and clicks.\n- Severe Pay-to-Win mechanics: Many powerful weapons, outfits, and upgrades locked behind premium currency or gacha draws.\n- Grinding or paying required: Sharp power spikes force players to either grind excessively or spend money to progress.\n- Slow story-line pacing: Content is drip-fed; story missions are brief and often gated behind resource requirements.\n- Repetitive game-play: Battle structure becomes monotonous, emphasising auto-combat and farming.\n- Performance issues: Lag, long downloads, and memory bloat.\n\nVerdict\nFinal Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis looks and sounds like a love letter to fans, but plays like a sluggish, monetisation driven grind. Its nostalgic charm and impressive visuals can’t make up for the constant loading screens, painfully slow pacing, and aggressive Pay-to-Win systems.\n\nUnless you’re a die-hard FF7 fan willing to tolerate frustration for the sake of nostalgia, this one’s hard to recommend.\n\nScore: 5/10 (for fans - give it a try) or 3/10 (for everyone else - avoid as it's a waste of time)",
