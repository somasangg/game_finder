      "review": "Dragon’s Dogma 2 isn’t a Soulslike, and it isn’t Monster Hunter either. Its closest relative might actually be Dragon Age, but without rows of hotkey skills cluttering the UI. Instead, combat uses button + direction combinations for \"aiming\" at the enemy, no auto-lock here, very Capcom-esque, and the interface stays clean and immersive without MMO-style hotbars. You feel like you’re fighting, not managing a control panel.\n\nWhat truly sets Dragon’s Dogma apart (both 1 and 2) is that there’s still no other game that plays exactly like it. Other titles may imitate fragments of the experience, but nothing replaces the feeling of climbing a giant monster in real time while your AI companions scream advices and join into the brawl. The sequel expands everything the first game proved was already fun.\n\nTechnically, it runs on the RE Engine, which has already been refined by multiple Resident Evil remakes. So the game itself isn’t held back by some experimental tech. If you hit performance issues, enable DLSS (it’s OFF by default), update your driver, and maybe blame Denuvo for minor frame dips. The engine first version itself wasn't really meant for open world and lots of AI characters, so bring a beefy CPU cause this game is hungry for X3D.\n\nStory-wise: don’t expect a Baldur’s Gate–level branching narrative. Expect a linear adventure with possible different endings, focused more on the journey and the vibe than on complex plot branches. I watched the Netflix adaptation ages ago and platinumthe first game, the narrative wasn’t jaw-dropping, but it wasn’t bad either. The game’s strength isn’t its plot, it’s the freedom to explore, experiment, and cause chaos.\n\nMusic and voice acting? It’s Capcom. Worrying about that is pointless ! you’ll probably end up searching for the OST later.\n\nA few tips from experience:\n\nThe pawn system replaces multiplayer, and the AI companions are legitimately competent.\n\nIf you don’t like getting punched in the face, play Mage or Archer, the lock-on system is better than in the first game (and better than Monster Hunter’s).\n\nThe game is much easier than Elden Ring or Souls games so you don't need to “get good,” just explore and experiment.\n\nHowever, this is a single-player adventure. If you only enjoy Monster Hunter or Elden Ring because of multiplayer, think twice. This is a world to explore alone (with AI buddies), at your own pace.\n\n[b]“He who fights monsters becomes the monster”[/b]\n\n\nFinal thought:\nIf you like Elden Ring exploration, combat that feels grounded and physical, or Dragon Age–style adventuring, buy it without hesitation. Just don’t ruin it with cheats, the game’s magic lies in overcoming the journey yourself.",

The story is decent enough, combat is absolutely phenomenal, the graphics are absolutely beautiful, exploration is amazing, and all the extra little minor details you will learn throughout the game make the world seem more alive. Certain things you wouldn't even imagine being able to do in other games, this game let's you do those.\n\nI understand this game had a rough start and performance was an issue and could still be an issue for some people, but I have had zero issues with performance currently on a higher end PC so your mileage may vary.\n\nThe microtransactions are NOT needed and I promise you can get everything just as easily in-game if you are willing to put in a little time and effort. These transactions are just a convenience thing for people who want to buy them. Don't let this ruin a great experience that this game has to offer.\n\nOverall, Capcom has made a banger of a game and I love this game just as much as the first Dragon's Dogma. I 100% recommend this game to anyone looking for a solid action RPG with some of the best combat and beautiful graphics that come together. Great job Devs!

      "review": "My Thoughts on Dragon's Dogma 2\n\nThe first Dragon's Dogma was this weird cult classic everyone loved for what it could've been as much as what it was. Now, over a decade later, Capcom finally dropped the sequel. It's a mixed bag—better in some ways, frustrating in others.\n\nThe Good: Beauty, Combat, and World Design\n\nThe game is incredibly beautiful—it might genuinely be one of the best-looking game for me. The lighting is amazing, and the visual sharpness showcases how effective Capcom’s game engine is.\n\nOn PC, the combat and controls are vastly improved over the first game, feeling much smoother and more satisfying. The core gameplay loop is phenomenal: the combat is weighty, strategic, and mechanically satisfying. I love the exploration and the vocation system, which lets you freely unlock and switch classes on a whim, keeping every playthrough fresh.\n\nA Masterclass in Open-World Design\n\nDragon's Dogma 2’s open-world design is a masterclass and what truly sets it apart. The world feels real in a way most RPGs don't attempt. It has genuine geography, where shortcuts loop back to main roads and caves open into unexpected valleys—everything connects. You navigate by landmarks, not by a minimap, forcing you to remember the structure of the world.\n\nThe atmosphere is thick, and the night is a threat, not just a visual filter. You must plan journeys, bring lanterns, and avoid certain areas after dark, adding a crucial layer of immersion.\n\nThe Pawn System\n\nThe Pawn system remains one of the series' purest strokes of genius. It creates a powerful sense of community and is essentially a brilliant multiplayer element without the usual hassle. Your AI companions are noticeably smarter and more helpful, learning enemy weaknesses, sharing knowledge, and even guiding you to hidden locations. Their chatter also has more variety, adding to their personality.\n\nAnd yeah, character creation actually matters mechanically—your size and gender affect gameplay. More RPGs should do this.\n\nThe Problems\n\nDespite all the brilliance, Dragon's Dogma 2 launched with major bugs and performance hiccups. If your PC isn't a \"beast,\" you might need to upgrade or grab a console, as the game will humble it. I am personally playing at 30fps and genuinely hope an optimization patch arrives soon.\n\nThe game also initially faced criticism for its microtransactions. However, my advice is to avoid them completely. The world is rich enough that if you explore thoroughly, you can find all the necessary items in the open world, making purchases unnecessary.\n\nThankfully, updates have fixed most of the major issues. The game's in much better shape now than it was at release.\n\nWorth the Wait\n\nHaving waited 5 years and having loved the original Dark Arisen for its dynamic combat and deep vocation system back in 2018, I can confidently say the wait for Dragon's Dogma 2 has been worth it.",

It can make the adventure exciting in a different way. Also can be a major inconvenience.\n\nBut as the sequel of one of my favorite game... oof....\nThe disappointing selection of vocations, the pawns still not being able to be mixed class, lack of everfall/bitter black style end game dungeon, etc etc\nThe story being a strange reboot? remake? remix? of the original is a strange choice\nAs I realized that when reaching the end when the dragon is holding my beloved, the feeling sinks in.\nThis, as a sequel to Dragons Dogma Dark Arisen, is kinda ass.\nI still recommend it if you want some open world adventure.

      "review": "This game has a lot of potential, and I wish Capcom could see that and do more with it. \r\n\r\nAt it's core, it's a pretty good game. The combat is, from a technical perspective, truly impressive, with the way you can dynamically climb enemies, and the way physical mass and momentum are important factors. The pawn system is a really cool concept, my only gripe being that I feel like it wasn't used to its full potential.\r\n\r\nThe game world is pretty interesting, with a variety of different locations, most of which are pretty well hidden. I still remember one time, stumbling upon an elf village after running for my life from a minotaur, and going \"I didn't even know elves were a thing in this game\". Or the time I fought a griffin, climbed on top of it, and it decided to flee while I was on it's back, so I had to barely hang on while it flew back to it's nest. And when I'd finally dealt with it, realised the only way back to civilisation was through a creepy swamp filled with undead, that was dark enough to look like night time while you travelled though it, and that I doubt I would have found if the griffin hadn't basically kidnapped me.\r\n\r\nOverall, yeah the game can be a little repetitive at times, or the pawns can be VERY annoying with their habit of repeating the same tips you've heard a million times, but the game is pretty good as a whole. Also, I haven't mentioned the story much, since I pulled a Skyrim and got distracted, and only did little bits here and there, the end result being that I didn't know what was going on half the time. It didn't seem like something that was award winning, but it wasn't too bad either. Overall, definitely a 7/10, though if they added multiplayer Co-op, it could easily be an 8/10.",

      "review": "So, let's get this out of the way at the start: if you expect DD2 to be better in every aspect as a sequel you will be disappointed because it's not. Some things are better than the first one, some things are worse.\n\n I played DD:DA for hundreds of hours on my Xbox and my Playstation, the number of my runs is probably close to the three digits and, still, I find this game to be a more than valid sequel. Also, played DD2 on XboxSX.\n\n[h3] What it does better [/h3]\n\n+Graphically wise it's very good, a phenomenal upgrade on the first one.\n+Weapons, especially the heavier ones, express their weight beautifully in every fight. You will frequently send goblins flying with your greatswords (or ''hunks of metal''...).\n+Exploring was already fun in DD:DA, this time around it's even better, I felt like there was a bit more verticality in the world.\n+The beast climbing mechanic has been revamped to be more responsive.\n+One of the best, if not the actual best, character creators up to date (Dragon Age WokeGuard should learn a thing or two...).\n+Your harem of female pawns will look great.\n+Your harem of male pawns will look great.\n\n[h3] What it does worse [/h3]\n\n-less enemy variety.\n-less armor and weapons variety, also no more double layering for armors.\n-the main quest, at the start, feels a bit sluggish and at the end seems a little rushed.\n-in DDDA you could employ 8 skills for each class, in DD2, for some reason, this got halved to 4, 3 if you take the Warfarer class and put ''Rearmament'' as a quick skill (very bad decision, I must say, but probably mods can work around this issue).\n \n As I said, it's not better in every way but other reviews have been too harsh in my opinion. It's still Dragon's Dogma and whether you like it or not, there's no other game quite like it so I for one was happy with it, even with its shortcomings. \n\n Story wise it's not that Blockbuster narrative pearl to behold, but DDDA wasn't either. You play this game for its feeling of living an odyssey, the story and quests are just an alibi to take the next step out of the city and its adventures.\n\n Also, people whined about ''microtransactions''. Nobody has to pay a cent more than the entry ticket if they don't want to since all the extras you can buy are items you can get in the base game, just later on. These extras were made available for the guy that doesn't have all the time in the world to play but wants to finish the game and enjoy it at his own pace, without having to run back and forth for each and every quest This way they can use teleportation more frequently.\n\n Having said that, if you played the first one you can buy it and accept that it's not a perfect product but more than capable to engage you for many hours and at least a couple more runs because, at the end of the day, you either go back to the first DD or play this. No other game, at the moment, does what DD does.\n\n If you're new to the game, and you're in doubt, get this game eyes closed and if you happen to enjoy it give the first one a try. The 2 hours refund time limit is enough for you to understand if it's your cup of tea or not.\n\nI must say that I agree with others have said: this game needs DLC and Capcom has to do an actual modernized remake of DD:DA.\n\nPERFORMANCE WISE: Played this game on an RTX5070 Ti, no stuttering, no lagging, no issues. Maxed out graphics, RTon, 120fps, HD Textures from Nexus.",

      "review": "[h2] Dragon’s Dogma 2 — The King of Untapped Potential [/h2]\n\nI've poured an unholy amount of time in a game that is so close to greatness it hurts. Be that as it may, 'tis a game that invites you to lose yourself in it.\n\nSo many things to talk about. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\n[b] The Good Stuff [/b]\n\n• Impactful combat\nModern games wish they felt this good. Everything has weight—your blows, the monsters’ roar rustling the leaves and grass, even your panic when a griffin suddenly scoops you up for an unexpected flight. If airborne combat were added, the game would be legendary. On that note, some vocations are better than the rest. Speaking of vocations, not all are created equal. Some skills are high situational, with a few handful work best on pawns, and some are designed for you, the Arisen.\n\n• Exploration that feels like adventure\nThe world is MASSIVE. It's very medieval-like with unfinished quests, and grounded storylines. You would be hard-pressed to find a game with much room for epic fantasy elements like DD2. Vermund alone consumed 200+ hours of my life, and I regret none of it. It is the kind of game that scratches my itch for an epic adventure. One thing to note is that, the game has no real dynamic weather systems for the regions, which is unfortunate.\n\n• Pawns\nYour little guys are smarter than they have any right to be. They learn from you, have actual bestiary knowledge and will help you in ways you didn’t expect. And yes, you can also romance them, in a way.\n\n[b] The “Why Are You Like This?” Stuff [/b]\n\n• Loot is… well… trash. Sometimes literally.\nHunting for treasure and you get rewarded with rotten grapes should be a crime.\n\n• The Soundtrack took a nap\nThe music lacks the punch and soul of DD1. No Cassardis warmth. No Gransys nostalgia. No escalating boss themes that make your heart go wild with rush and adrenaline (except One Swing for Victory) and End of a Struggle being a wet blanket in DD2 hurts so bad. So yeah, they mostly have a softer tune and forgettable tracks.\n\n• Character creator glow-up… but also glow-down\nMore tools, but more cursed face shapes. The character creator gives you 38 base heads to make a variety of swamp goblins before it lets you make anyone attractive. You can make beauties—you just have to fight the system to do it. And some face shapes will always look the same no matter how much you tweak them. Compared to something like Monster Hunter Wilds Character Creation, which offers finer control and more appealing presets, DD2’s Character Creation system feels like a step sideways rather than forward.\n\n• Voice acting that feels mid\nServiceable, but the original had more charm and memorable lines. DD2’s voices feel toned down, less flavorful in a sense. Nothing sticks with you.\n\n• No airborne combat (WHY CAPCOM)\nYou get climbing system but not airborne combat? That should be illegal. Imagine soaring high-up and performing midair combos with aerial grabs.\n\nOverall: 8/10 vanilla, 10/10 with mods\n\nDragon’s Dogma 2 is a flawed gem, a masterpiece trapped inside a well-polished turd. But if you love immersion, felling big monsters, and adventuring to your heart's content? Then this is the game for you. With mods, this game goes from potentially great to absolutely phenomenal.

I found it just as exciting to play as the first one, with a very interesting plot twist at the end which actually kind of servers like Dark Arisen as it feels like a boss rush. \nI felt even more at home with how confusing the story was, it is not a game to take the story super seriously, more like a power fantasy in which you just enjoy the ride while you decimate huge foes with your party of side characters that will give their life for you. \nCombat is amazing, It can be repetitive if you dont switch it up yourself and try new classes, and i look forward to coming back to the game and trying to complete everytown, as in my first playthrough I took to heart whenever they told me a quest was urgent so i finished it quite fast. I think the \"urgency\" doesn't mean that I need to be there right now and i could afford to go questing and leaving that on pause, so my recommendation to new players is to take their time even if the game is pushing them with \"urgent\" quests.",

It wasn't forced. There are many points in the game where you slowly got more and more about the storyline and it all meshed nicely together. This is clunky, uninspired and the characters are boring. It felt like it had rough edges right off the bat of places you just couldn't go. This was more directed. Hand holding. When Dark Arisen the DLC for DD1 came out it turned the combat system into a gauntlet system. Now you had an insane dungeon to tackle with keys and huge monster fights. Special weapons, a maze. There was a massive upgrade system to each weapon class, new abilities. They did everything. Now here we are what 2 years later. All they have done is optimize the graphics (WHICH ALMOST NEVER MATTER FOR THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE). DD1 was playstation 3/Xbox 360 graphics and it was amazing to play. I'm frustrated, because they never use what worked. Just elements of the base game and slap a sticker on it like it's the same. Never learned from the past. Just got a different team and teased a new, better, faster system that was going to be different and add value. I wanted more. A extended dungeon, a bottomless pit of enemies to destroy with weapons that took months to obtain and set of armor that made you god and then just kept punishing you like the old game did. Sadly, and this is most cases now. Concept has taken a backseat to graphics and shitty characters. I have 200 hours on this game on ps5 I got it on pc too to test the mods and see if I could make it shine. Yet...here we are.",

They are very easy to fail, they don't give you nearly enough clues to figure them out, and are pretty uninteresting. \n- Poor optimization EVERYWHERE, if you are like me and bought this game with a 4GB card when it came out, you probably got EXTREMELY low FPS, especially in cities. This has not been corrected, if you have less than 6GB of VRAM, I do NOT recommend that you get this game, you will struggle a lot.\n- Map is wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too big, wouldn't be necessarily bad if transport wasn't REALLY bad. Walking everywhere isn't nice, and oxcarts are usually required, but it'd be nice if there was an easier way of travel\n\nOverall I gave it a good review because I believe behind all the roughness there's a good game, it just needed a few months to a year of polishing and it would've had way more positive reception.",

I have once again done the classic “Deviate from the main story and get distracted exploring”, but I suppose that is what they want to happen in an open world game such as this. As for mechanics, it improves on the first game by a lot, feeling smoother, some vocations are clearly op, but all the ones I have played (apart from Trickster and Warfarer which still need to be unlocked) are fun. \nYou will walk a lot at first, which may be a turnoff for some, but there is plenty to find and discover. Furthermore, the hp reduction mechanic stings a little in the early game, but as you get comfortable, and improve your vocation it’s not as bad. Overall, I am really enjoying the game, and I haven’t encountered any bugs or had any crashes. The story for me is fine, as I don’t need a Baldur’s gate 3 narrative for every game I play. Do note that it is the same lore as the first game, you are an Arisen and you are destined to fight the dragon that made you so, with a couple of twists.\nI wish I started sooner when the player base was at its peak, to experience the absolute madness and profit with pawn interactions. However, if you liked the first Dragon’s Dogma, you would like this game.\nThat’s all from me 😊",

Capcom (at least as of December 2025) seems to have just given up and buried it. It’s a shame, because while I enjoyed the experience a lot, the story feels patchy. You’re put in the role of a sort of messiah that no one really wants, and several parallel stories are happening around you, but none of them feel like *your* story—you’re just intervening without feeling truly important, which creates a sense of confusion.\n\nThe game has its own language, a very specific way of seeing itself and telling its story, which personally I find wonderful.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h2]✨ The Great ✨[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*]The game’s aesthetic and atmosphere are stunning, and it has a unique identity that’s immediately recognizable.  \n[*]Combat and core mechanics are solid and fun, true to the Dragon’s Dogma legacy.  \n[*]Exploration is enjoyable the first time, with lots of secrets and events that make the world feel alive.  \n[*]The story and lore, while disjointed, have moments that are genuinely captivating.  \n[/list]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h2]⚠️ The Not So Great ⚠️[/h2]\n\n[list]\n[*]Compared to DDDA, it feels lacking—less enemy variety and fewer spontaneous world events.  \n[*]Exploration becomes repetitive after a while because events start feeling similar and predictable.  \n[*]The story feels fragmented and sometimes puts you in a passive role rather than making you the central character.  \n[*]Capcom launched the game with a massive amount of microDLCs.

My hours on the Dark Arisen might seem little on the steam version but I assure you it was 3x of that in other platforms which to say, I am absolutely enamored by this franchise despite the many flaw it has. I feel like what this series have to offer is far too unique for all it's flaw to outweighs.\n\nBut I can say that this may not qualify as a sequel. This feels more like a Redo, a retry at the first game. Because If you did play the first, you definitely feel at home in this one, even with the changes here and there. For maximum enjoyment tho, I suggest you don't treat this like a regular RPG where you focus on quest and grand story or the likes. Just treat this as a sandbox and let yourself feel the world of this games comes alive. You may come to enjoy those seemingly boring journey from a city to another but with how many things that could happen, and the shenanigans of the pawn. It'll felt like you're travelling with your friends and every travel brings it's own stories.\n\nYou can walk the same path, fights the same enemies, yet it feels different. either because You're trying out new vocation, new playstyle, or just a change of party member because the last one fell to the river after being flung by an ogre.\n\nI'm not trying to change anyne's mind with this, merely expressing what I feel and what I love about this franchise that made me love it more than other franchise that most other would call to be better.\n\n'twas to say, Capcom.

The world is beautiful and feels alive, and the exploration is rewarding and meaningful. The combat is excellent and enemies diverse enough. The story is decent, though 'mayhaps' a bit thin. However, I find the certain vagueness of the lore intriguing. It also makes the game easy to jump into as well, as it is not as overwhelming as some other titles.

      "review": "I actually liked the game. It ran well (for me), the combat was fun. The story managed to keep my interest. Climbing all over giants to stab them in the eye is exhilarating. It is for all intents and purposes a good game.\n\nHOWEVER. I can't help but laugh at this because it's such a comically bad decision. I am sure you can read it in other reviews as well but I'm going to mention it here too. \n\nThere is a mechanic in the game, which almost feels like it happens without warning or provocation, that can completely nuke your save. I say almost because there are supposed \"Signs\" to give you a heads up that one of your pawns is about to explode. Yes. Explode. and take the ENTIRE TOWN YOU ARE IN with them. Quest will fail; people will die. \n\nWhen this happened to me, I remember thinking. \"Huh...I didn't make her eyes red.\" \"Must be a bug.\" Woke up the next morning and the entire town was dead and THEN the game goes. \"Oh yea, keep an eye on your pawns.\"  To which I had no response. Literally left me just going, \"Huh?\" \"ha-ha\" ... \"Uh....\" \"Ah...\" So, I leave right? Just fast travel out and back and EVERYONE RETURNED! so either THAT was a bug OR THE GAME HAS A SYSTEM TO KILL EVERYONE AND GO \"HAHA, JK, YOU ARE FINE!\"\n\nI don't know if this mechanic is just for shock value and really does nothing, I don't know if my game was bugged or not but with this mechanic ONE of two things is true. It exists purely for shock value and does nothing. In which case. Why? Right? The other is that this mechanic exists to RUIN your run if you don't micromanage your pawns. In which case. Why? This isn't a mechanic that just comes down to skill, this isn't a mechanic you can ignore, it just seems so Anti-Player I literally don't know what else to say about it. \n\nThis also means if you happen to have a fairly popular pawn, The odds of it returning to you OR someone else ready to explode are infinitely INCREASED. So, if you have a popular pawn, you are constantly going to have to \"reset\" them. When I played the \"reset\" for this was throwing you pawn into the Brine a silly yet inconvenient \"fix\". Yea. This mechanic is either goofy or toxic either way it just seems pointless. \n\nTLDR: Sure, Game is ok if you can overlook an unavoidable goofy or toxic mechanic. You will probably have more fun with Dark Arisen.",

But this sequence of events hasnt happened to me with 80+ hours on ps5.....\r\n\r\nIts a huge wolf ! \r\n\r\nHe smashes the cart, i couldnt kite him away and his health drops sloooooooow.\r\nRessing pawns left and right while trying to tip the big wolf off balance and i noticed the cart guards are dealing with goblins that prob heard the ruccus.\r\n...and some lizard dudes also entered the fray...\r\n\r\nThe wolf not even half health...\r\n\r\nWe managed to deal with the goblins, chug a potion here and there in the nick of time. The scaly fellows done in the meantime and i reckon we can focus the wolf down !\r\n\r\nNope.\r\n\r\nA griffon swoops down and lovetaps my mage pawn into an early grave. \r\nNow the wolf and the griffon get it on in a very chaotic aoe fight and im trying to ress folks all over.\r\n\r\nWe barely manage to get the wolf to his last health bar....the griffon is nigh untouched though.\r\nAfter alot of fire attacks thanks to ele boon i burn his feathery butt down to 1 bar.\r\n\r\nHe swoops outta there and we turn to the wolf whos on his last legs.\r\n\r\nhmmm\r\n\r\nGotta turn on the lantarn, its dark....\r\n\r\nSome skeletons and a whole goblin army appear out of the bushes, along with some ghosts that pop up because im trying to kite back as to not be surrounded. The skeletons have that lil double tap requirement which is gnarly when trying to not get blown up by goblin bomb chuckers/shield chargers/regular stabby guys.\r\n\r\nBy the break of dawn there is death all around me. I leveled several times and my vocation took some upgrades from the morning till morning random series of events.\r\n\r\nAfterwards i enjoyed a brisk short walk to the city as i was very close to the oxen grazing grounds.\r\n\r\nI love having that random stuff happen while wandering around, i love discovering new caves and chests.

If you have more than 1 pawn in your team, or even just one, they will engage in random coonversations about rumors, stories or advice at random, and they can also give you a fist bump or high five after a fight. they are also very responsive. the story isin't that good, but i was personally interested with the idea. however, i would reccomend to wait for a sale, as i dont think 70 dollars is worth it, for any game in general, and it does drop to a low price sometimes.

Though a bit less min/maxy since you don't gain stats according to class upon level up, but instead they are distributed according to you current class, but also that means you can just play whatever class without fomo. The combat is so refined, its exceptional, I've yet to play anything that feels this refined, that allows you to feel so specialized and yet so useful, and for your chosen companions to fill such important roles. \n\nThe story mimics the first one, but with some additions such as the neighboring kingdom, and the opportunity to explore it and it's seemingly meticulously and purposefully crafted landscapes. The cart system feels both useful, and interesting with the possible random encounters, the crafting system is immense, much as the first was. There's quiet a bit of content that isn't made apparent, and must either be found by meticulous combing, or by wiki searching, but is rewarding to find, with some feeling more rewarding than others to complete.\n\nAll this said I really, really like this type of game, and it is alone in the world of video games, I know of no others like this, and this unique experience is a fun and engaging experience throughout, on that rewards you for your forethought and ingenuity! \n\nMy only complaint? It appears that it will forever be the only of it's kind, it must not have sold well enough, or not have enough of a following, in the years since it's release it has had less and less updates and support, and finally appears to be without revival, content, or future plans, which is too bad because I'd be willing to pay for more. \n\nAgain, and overall: definitely reccomend if you are into fantasy medieval settings and class based and rewarding combat with rpg mechanics and excellent exploration mechanics sprinkled in.",

When you reach the 2nd area it gets 10X worse with the horrible terrain and no wagons around to use for quick transportation and even worse, the amount of enemy checkpoints is more than doubled. And if you dont want to run past them you will have to fight 50 lizards, 30 goblins, 20 bandits and a boss or two just to complete your fetch quest. What makes this even worse is that you will be max level at this point unless you decide to switch class so its pointless to fight them unless you love fighting the same 6-7 mobs over and over which I can name all off the top of my head: wolf, eagle, goblin, lizard, Bandit, skeleton, bat.\n\nThe quests are good at the beginning, they start small and slowly get more intense until you reach the capital which is in the first 2 hours of the game, after that point the quest quality drops drastically over time and it slow turns into, go there and talk to him then come back and tell me what he says. By the time you reach the 2nd area that will be all you do, circling between 2 different locations and with the previous point about the poor travel system in this game and the constant enemies sniffing down your neck every 2 steps it is absolutely miserable.\n\nEven the main story of this game is bad and it reminds me of god of war in the way its constantly on the brink of getting interesting just for it to turn out to be nothing and another fetch quest.\n\nWhat I hate about this game the most is that it had so much potential and would have been great if they put another year or so into development, there are so many great mechanics like the grabbing, pawns and abilities and yet all of these mechanics also feel unfinished.\n\n4/10",

Even getting 60 FPS on the lowest settings is hard to achieve, even with DLSS upscaling, and with upscaling on the game looks horrible. Out of the 20+ hours I played, possibly 5-10 of those hours were just trying to find the proper settings to make the game not run horribly slowly, dropping into the 30s in cities and dipping into the 40s in the wilderness. I legitimately do not own a game that runs worse than this one, and many of those games look significantly better - I'm pretty used to games like Helldivers 2 running on Ultra with 100+ frames or Medium/High at 144-165 frames, no problem. So basically if you are willing to play it at 30 fps, more power to you, enjoy. But to me this seems like a really bad console port and I can't recommend it even at a sales price sadly. \r\n\r\nAs far as gameplay goes. It is Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen, again, without the Dark Arisen part. There are changes. Some of the changes matter more than others. This is not a sequel. At this level of quality it should've been marketed as a remake of Dragon's Dogma and sold for maybe $20. It's genuinely that unacceptable to release at this optimization level to me and the original is frankly superior in almost every way with the only exceptions being things like graphics which you can't enjoy due to performance, or audio stuff like foley effects which you can't enjoy because you'll uninstall from frustration before immersion ever kicks in.

      "review": "Dragon’s Dogma 2 starts strong. For the first 10–15 hours, the game feels good — even promising. But the longer you play, the more its huge flaws begin to surface, and eventually they become impossible to ignore.\n\nThe main story is extremely boring. It’s stretched across just a few major quests, with almost no meaningful explanation of what is happening in the world. There’s no proper world-building, no clear lore, and no metaphysics behind the main plot. You simply move from point A to point B without any real context or emotional drive.\n\nSide quests are just as forgettable. You won’t remember the characters’ names, their motivations, or anything they said. There is zero emotional attachment — you just don’t care about them. They feel like filler tasks thrown together without effort.\n\nGameplay also suffers from major issues. The world map is massive, but almost completely empty. You only fight the same four or five enemy types over and over, with slight regional variations. Traveling anywhere takes 20 minutes because you must constantly fight the same goblins, wolves, and harpies. By the twentieth time, it becomes unbearably annoying. You want to skip the fights, but you still have to run through the exact same paths you’ve already crossed dozens of times.\n\nThe classes are also a downgrade compared to Dark Arisen. Strider and Magic Archer lost the ability to use daggers, which forces you into using only bows. Several cool classes from the previous game are simply gone, and the new ones feel dull, badly designed, and unfun to play.\n\nArmor being locked behind specific classes is another huge problem, especially for players who enjoy making stylish builds. The only workaround is to play Wayfarer, who can use any weapon and armor — but that comes at the cost of losing the powerful ultimate abilities that regular classes have. It’s a compromise that shouldn’t exist.\n\nAs mentioned before, the world is big but empty. Occasionally you’ll find ruins worth exploring, but the game never explains who built them, why they exist, or what their history is. Narratively, the world feels like a sandbox with no soul and no identity.\n\nThe graphics are decent — sometimes you’ll see gorgeous landscapes and vistas — and the music is okay. But visuals alone can’t save a game that feels this unfinished.\n\nAnd that’s the real issue: Dragon’s Dogma 2 feels incomplete. Almost like an alpha version with good graphics but lacking content, world-building, and polish. It’s hard not to feel like Capcom dumped the budget into Monster Hunter Wilds and left barely anything for the team working on this game.\n\nIn the end, Dragon’s Dogma 2 offers a vast map that is almost completely empty, repetitive encounters, shallow storytelling, and downgraded class design. It could have been great — but instead, it feels like a rushed, unfinished game.",

Had some good fun with the combat, which especially shines when fighting large monsters, however it quickly became more annoying than fun, when every 10 seconds of walking to a destination another group of creatures interrupted the scenery or exploration. \n\nThe quests were also a bit vague in hinting at what the player had to do next, although that did help to add another layer of complexity. I enjoyed some of the quests and how they built the world and made it feel more alive, especially quests that required fast action, or there was a possibility of failure. Another nitpick about quests that I would have is that they either threw you halfway across the map, or required you to run back and forth within the main city a couple times to complete the entire thing.\n\nMy main issue with the game lies in its core gameplay loop and saving system. The game pushes for exploration, however it is much too punishing in its design. And I don't mean in the combat being especially difficult or complex, because in its core the combat is quite simple and there is not much you can do as a warrior when facing 15+ enemies at a quarter health, which happens quite often. The reason being, the game doesn't allow you to fully regain health. After damage taken, your max health pool is lessened until you rest at an inn or a bed. To make things worse the Inns cost far too much money early game. And as I mentioned previously you are constantly being forced into combat that is near impossible to run away from, as your party's A.I does not always want to listen to your commands to follow, and once they die, unless you want to lose them permanently, you must return to fight and revive them. \n\nEven that gameplay loop, for me would have been fine. But what really put the nail in the coffin for me, was the save system. The game allows you to return to two types of saves, a random autosave that may lead to immediate death or an in-escable area, or your last place of rest... I played for 3 hours completing side quests, and travelling to a new location. Once in that location, I quickly realized that I was majorly underleved, and countinued to die while atttempting to leave, with a group of 3 pawns that decide to do as they please and get themselves killed. After dying numerous times, my health pool was at sliver as what it once was. I decided to spawn at my last place of rest at my next death, and to my suprise all of my progress since resting at my bed was lost. I have no urge to replay the missions I completed or even remember what or where the valubles I had gotten were so now I think I am done.",

Low enemy variety, useless vocations, and worst of all, the same story retold but significantly worse. I can't begin to say how disappointed I was with this title when it came out, only for zero additional content to release for the game. Do yourself a favor and just play DDDA, and if you already have, just replay it again. This game does not deserve your money, even for morbid curiosity's sake which hurts me to say as a massive DDDA fan. There are very unique ideas in this game, but they're executed so poorly that they're wasted. I gave this game plenty of time to do literally anything to change my mind, but nope, just a few QOL updates back when the game originally dropped. Bottom line, it's not worth $70+ and they clearly do not care about the player experience.",

      "review": "TL;DR: If Steam had a \"mid\" rating I'd give DD2 that, but if you have to choose then go play the first one instead. Yes the oxcart mission at the beginning is possibly one of the worst introductions to any game ever but I promise you'll have a better time there than here. If you do decide to get this then go in with the understanding that the combat is quite literally the thing propping the entire game up.\r\n\r\nI'm going to get the good out of the way first, because there is good here:\r\n-Combat! Fighting is the core of the game, and fighting feels really good! Hits are meaty, combos are flashy, every class gets to be OP, overall fighting things is good fun and that's good because you'll be doing a lot of it. I'd go so far as to say that the combat is good enough that it propped the entire game up all on it's own. I'm gonna do a fair bit of griping in a minute so let that be a testament to how good fighting things feels, that despite my growing misgivings I played all the way through to keep messing around with the combat.\r\n-Character and pawn customization! It was very fun making a pair of freakshows to wander around the map and murder everything that dared to move!\r\n-The pawn system as a whole is still very fun, and you can't help but get attached to your personal buddy as you travel around.\r\n-Much better early game than the first game, you can kinda just get right into it the moment the tutorial is over.\r\n-If you're into it, there's plenty of ways to do challenge runs or even speed runs of the game once you know it's ins and outs a little better, for that little bit of replay value.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the cons:\r\n-Oh my god the optimization is bad. Every review saying that the optimization is bad is somehow underselling it.\r\n-You get too strong too fast. Like, in DD1 you definitely get to a point where you're blitzing through health bars and treating larger enemies like mild inconveniences, but it takes a little bit to get there. I was at that point here well before I ever saw the second half of the map. Now, granted, this may have been partly my own fault for going slightly out of my way to rank up the various classes to get augments I wanted, but hitting those extremes of power so early on still feels really weird when you wind up doing it on accident.\r\n-Way, WAY less enemy variety than the first game. Do you enjoy fighting goblins, saurians, and harpies? You'd better because that's the majority of what you'll be dealing with. Every once in a while you'll be treated to a cyclops. If you've been really good maybe an ogre or a griffon will show up to get absolutely demolished. Golems exist too I guess, sometimes. Chimeras are so rare I think I can count on one hand how many I dealt with (4). Minotaurs, zombies and skeletons are so sparse I'd often get surprised because I would forget they exist (despite being more common than chimeras). Oh yeah there's also the Medusa from the beginning of the game as well. I literally never fought her again but she's around apparently. It's genuinely frustrating when the combat feels so good but the enemies don't change in any meaningful way for the whole game. \r\n-In a brave and absolutely flabbergasting decision, the game does not have a single good quest. Not one. Not a single one. No good rewards either, before you get ahead of yourself. \"But the ones that unlock Dwarven Smithing!\" I hear some of you say, and to that I say: didn't need it. Didn't upgrade a single piece of gear even once for the whole game. It was still a curbstomp. \"But the Sphinx quests!\" others may reply. A series of fetch quests with rewards ranging from \"I might use this once or twice\" to \"literally forgot it existed within seconds of getting it\". The quests, be they main or side, are stunningly boring. It's genuinely impressive actually, that they managed to make an entire action RPG and not one worthwhile quest.\r\n-The fight with the dragon is LAME compared to the first game. Don't get me wrong, by the time you fight the dragon in the first game you're geared and ready to thrash it, but there's a gravitas and a spectacle to it. You've been working all the way up to that point and by god you got a fight that reflected that. The dragon fight here comes across as an afterthought, so not only is it easy, it's also anticlimactic.\r\n-Speaking of anticlimactic, fights with most large enemies quickly become anticlimactic. The first time you fight a chimera in the first game (outside of the prologue), it's like a whole boss battle. It gets it's own arena and everything. The first time I fought a chimera in this it literally died off screen. I was busy culling the local goblin population and my pawns beat the snot out of it around the corner while I wasn't looking. Don't get me wrong, the change of pace in having to deal with a large enemy is always welcome, but there's very little fanfare and often equally little threat. \r\n\r\nAnd lastly the mid:\r\n-Exploration is there. Sometimes you'll come across some decent gear and save yourself some money, or maybe you'll find a Seeker's Token (the collectible doodad of the game). Most of the time it's just more healing items and crafting materials you'll stash away for that rainy day that never comes.\r\n-All the classes get to be OP but not every class gets to be OP in a way that's fun. The easiest example of this is the Trickster class. If you're playing Trickster correctly, you and your pawns are functionally immortal and should be able to beat every encounter. Unfortunately, as Trickster doesn't get to do damage themselves, this usually means relying on the pawns to eventually come to the correct decision of how to go about beating said encounters. Depending on your chosen pawns (which should all be damage dealers because you're playing Trickster correctly), this can either take twice as long as doing it yourself as a different class or up to six times as long as doing it yourself as a different class. Yeah, it works, and it's powerful, but it's also really really boring. Thief and Magick Archer are also both a touch overtuned to the point of making them boring to play as imo, but at least with those classes you still get to do things other than wait for the game to finish playing itself.\r\n-It doesn't take too long to start seeing how static the encounters are out on the map. You can use this to your advantage if you decide you really want to grind out a specific monster material or just want to fight a specific thing for the sake of it, but generally it just means you know exactly how many goblin/saurian/harpy fights are between Point A and Point B instead of having the hope of fighting literally anything else.\r\n\r\nIf the first game was a sneaky 8/10 this is a dissapointing 6/10. It's not BAD, I can't in good conscience say it's bad when I played all the way through and mostly had a good time. Unfortunately the lack of enemy variety, challenge, and ANY good quests at all really just kneecaps the whole experience.",

The game actively punishes players for not knowing arbitrary \"rules\" that are never explained.\r\nHere are the critical flaws that made my playthrough a miserable experience:\r\n[h3] Permanent Quest Failure Without Warning[/h3]\r\nMajor quests, including those that unlock the best skills and items (like the Sorcerer's Maelstrom), can be permanently failed or locked out if you miss an obscure trigger, talk to the wrong NPC first, or simply progress the main story at the intended pace. There are no clear quest markers or \"failure\" warnings; things just disappear from your log or become permanently discontinued.\r\n[h3] Arbitrary NPC Behavior[/h3]\r\nNPCs follow rigid routines that can be easily disrupted by random events (like a monster killing a crucial merchant) or bugs (like an attendant never spawning for a main romance quest), making complex quests impossible to complete. The game offers no reliable way to fix this other than a single, punishing save file.\r\n[h3] Zero Handholding[/h3]\r\nThe game intends for you to figure things out, but provides zero indication of what to do next. You are forced to rely on external guides or stumble around hoping for a random event to trigger, which wastes hours of time.\r\n[h3] Unforgiving Save System[/h3]\r\nThe single-save system means one mistake (like an infected pawn or a bad quest decision) can ruin an entire playthrough, forcing a restart or living with the permanent, negative consequences.\r\nDragon's Dogma 2 is a game that values \"fun over function,\" but the fun is quickly lost when a single uncommunicated rule permanently locks you out of the experience you paid for.

I ended up returning it for a refund because of performance and stability issues, which I'll touch on at the end of the review.\n\nI love, love, LOVE the original Dragon's Dogma and Dark Arisen games! But my initial impressions is that Dragon Dogma 2 is a game based on Dragon's Dogma (pawn system, lore, etc), but it's [u]not[/u] Dragon's Dogma. What I mean is, it feels very clunky and \"wooden\" compared to the fun and fluid game that is original DD. Combat feels way more clunky to me, and the world feels \"dull\". I can't fully put my finger on why, but it just doesn't feel like DD. I've been playing another game called Enshrouded, and it feels more like original Dragon's Dogma from a combat and \"colorful world\" perspect than this official Capcom game.\n\nI bought the game on sale for $30, and while the main reason I refunded it was due to technical issues, had this game engaged me in the first two hours of play, I might have kept it with the hope of fixing those issues. But first impressions matter, and I'm not so sure I would have gotten $30 of enjoyment out of this game even if I could play it for more than 10 minutes at a time without it crashing.\n\nNow let's talk about those issues - the graphic quality of this game does NOT justify the low framerates and high system requirements! It just doesn't look that good. I've got other games in my library that look WAY better than this, that run fluidly at 60 fps on my gaming rig. Obviously it looks better than DD1, but that was originally a PS3 game with bare-minimum requirements. Now I could have easily forgiven the lackluster graphics of DD2 if it was rock-stable at 60+ fps, but what we have is \"okayish\" graphics with horrible performance and crazy system requirements. I'm not impressed with this at all. Again, I've got dozens of other titles that do way more with way less.\n\nAs someone who loves DD and DD:DA, I'm disappointed that I couldn't get into DD2. Maybe I'll try again someday when I have a top-tier gaming rig and this title is on sale for $20 or less, and maybe, after hours of gameplay, it'll grow on me. I'll update this review if that happens. But until then, I can't recommend it.",

TLDR there have been no improvements.\r\n\r\nMy main gripes were the difficulty of the game which native is insultingly easy and still is with no hardmode. And its performance which in the cities specifically drops to low 30-40 fps as was the case in March 24 no options improve the fps, even turning on frame gen...does not increase the fps.  The overly flowery language is grating, the main story is nonsensical, the controls even for what is clearly designed as a console game are severely clunky. On top of the natural clunkyness you will be locked into high fiving your pawn after killing a goblin if you wander too close. A quite frankly bizarre healing system where you must rest at a camp site to recover any lost hp which is lost from both damage and dying as far as i am aware/can recall there is no other way of restoring lost hp %.  While camping you can cook food which will then play an actual video file of cooking meat because they were too lazy or incompetent to make one in game.  \r\nEven installing mods cannot alleviate the short comings due to base game design. In my recent play through I have installed difficulty mods which leads to longer fights/harder fights. This in turn leads to either an army of ambient pawns helping me since so many wander the roads or each fight chaining into another 30 min fight because there are so many enemy spawns by default. \r\n\r\nIts £55 currently with a bunch of £2.50 in game items \"DLC\" don't be tempted it will never get improved over what it is.

On an immersion note, there is no real difference between the humans and cat-people, nor the people of the two regions: they all have the same anachronistic speech patterns devoid of personality, which makes them seem like cardboard cutouts of middle-school children doing their best Shakespeare impression from memory. \r\n\r\nGAMEPLAY\r\nThe combat is noticeably more clunky than the first game, with the player's vision obscured much more frequently. I constantly found my character stuck in animations that I couldn't even see through smoke, fire, or a monster's big hairy arse. \r\nThe fast travel is needlessly convoluted, with ox carts ONLY departing at certain times of day and getting interrupted by monster attacks quite often. Exiting and thrilling the first time, considerably less so when you just want to get to the next town to get a quest done. Ferrystones are still in limited supply, and I didn't play far enough to know whether an Eternal Ferrystone like in the first game is unlocked at some point. Capcom clearly did not learn enough lessons from the first title, and this game somehow manages to disrespect your time even more than the first one. \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nThis game has its good points, but I have to admit I'm struggling to remember any of them. Multiple times during this game I thought to myself 'I miss the first Dragon's Dogma'. Or, even worse, 'I miss Skyrim'. That is damning for a game released in 2024, to make someone nostalgic for games released in 2012 and 2011 respectively. \r\nIn the highly unlikely event that anyone from Capcom is reading this: I know you put a lot of work into this game, and I feel bad being so negative about such a grand effort. \r\nBut you didn't succeed: this game is not as good as the first one.",

The armor in the game is also sick with tons of ways to make your character really your own. My main problems stem from the games whole idea of fast travel or lack there of. Even though I usually don't bother with fast travel the game seems to really want you to. With it lowering your max health every fight until you're forced to go to an inn, which will probably be quite the trek. The only alternative is making a campsite which requires you to allocate a large portion of your carrying capacity to just having a camping set on you. Not to mention both options cost 2k gold for some reason, the in game economy is really weird with prices of different things. All of these problems CAPCOM conveniently resolves with lame micro transactions. \n\nIf you can ignore the previously stated problems than this can be a great game, otherwise its alright i guess.",

I have no way to avoid damage. I die in 5 hits. I do not want to cheese enemies by standing on some rocks they can't climb and I do not want to avoid combat encounters. What I assume the game wants me to do is to stack up on pawns and just outspam the enemies. But... does it sound fun?\n- Terrible optimization with frame drops and weird texture glitching\n- Microtransactions\n\nI've been wanting to try Dragon's Dogma 2 for a while and now that I got a better PC i decided to play it and I must say I am dissapointed.

The cold mechanics of the game are kinda good, but that's about it.\n\n[h3][b]> First, Microtransactions and obtuse design[/b][/h3]  Yeah, they had to start by going there... I don't care if those are \"not really useful in game\". Poop stains and stinks. This is poop. Greedy poop. Poop that I'm pretty sure interfered in the game's design to give it space to \"shine\". Since there's a lot of obtuse design here, the \"make things really boring and inconvenient so people think that buying microtransactions is a good idea\" kind of poop.\n\n[h3]> [b]Interesting Combat, but it's too rigid[/b][/h3]  There's a really good base here, but it was heavily brought down for, or because of, other systems, like the pawn system, since the pawns can not only take the enemy off of you, but also can get you out of control effects like waking you up. The constraints are really heavy, so you're forced to play with a party.\n- ie. you only have a dodge if you play thief. If you don't? You are a sitting duck for enemy attacks and combos. It's easy to get staggered and every animation is very slow. It's surreal how combat in this feel rigid and static, like you are inside a bog.\n\n[h3]> [b]The pawn system[/b][/h3] is the worst idea I've seen in a RPG. They are your party for adventures, but they are soulless AI husks that spoils the game for you. For exemple, if you hired the pawn of another player and they know a secret, they may just tell you about it, go find it and loot it before you can say \"oh there is a treasure there?\". Their whole story is \"we are a soulless race of servants under your command\". They are named, as a whole race, \"Pawns\", for God's sake...\n\n[h3]> [b]And the story?[/b][/h3] It's generic chosen one storyline with [u]very little[/u] to offer.\n\n[h3]> [b]Magic is cool[/b][/h3]  Yeah, mage spells are cool, but sorcerer spells are really big and flashy, so much so that it deserves a topic reserved for itself. But you have to make peace with being a sitting duck casting big spells. It's cool though... just there're better classes that deal more damage without being a sitting duck. But calling a meteor storm is really cool lol.\n\n[h3]> [b]The world and enemies are boring[/b][/h3]\nBy now I'm pretty sure you noticed the pattern, the common theme of basically every facet of this game. It's soulless, boring, not memorable, and to top it off the enemy variety is low.\n\n[h3]> [b]Performance and Optimization is really bad in general[/b][/h3]\nThat is about it. The recommended fix is to play locked at 30 fps, while not being much pretty, the game will draw out all the strength in your cpu lmao.\n\n[h3]> [b]Conclusion[/b][/h3]\nGood base and foundation, but bad execution. Playing this game feels like you are \"alone in a crowd\". Soulless companions, soulless world, soulless npcs. The interesting part of team based RPG is the personality, story and character arcs of the companions, like in Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy, Expedition 33 and many others. Yet, in this game you don't have that. But you also don't have the \"alone against the world\" kind of feeling of Souls-likes either.\n\n[b]Finishing words[/b]\nTo sum it up, a game that has potential dragged down by a lot of bad decisions (and some of mobile influence in the pawn system specially, I think). But I think there's some good in here. So I'm interested to see if there's more to it, specially magic spells... but I'm modding this thing to be less dull, I guess.",

The price is totally unreasonable for the quality of the game, and I'm not talking about its technical part. \n\nI'd say, Dragon's Dogma 2 has similar scamming structure as Elden Ring. At first you see a huge map covered in war fog and you're looking forward to find a lot of encounters, quests, and dungeons. However, the actual map size is extremely smaller than it looks like. Besides, the amount and quality of content is deteriorating drastically with each region. After you realize it, you won't be able to refund the game. Imo, it feels like a new trend among Japanese devs.\n\nOverall, the game has A LOT of problems. Some of them weren't solved since the first game. Even though storytelling got a bit better in comparing with DDDA, it's still not enough to be called at least \"okay\". Some good ideas have extremely lazy realisation and you can feel it. Like, cmon, Capcom made a whole new race of elves, added them a language that you need to learn in order to freely interact with them (though it's quite useless), and all of that just for a few quests and one small location on the map?

Spell AOE is now useless, cast time is much much faster, but it somehow still feels worse. Spell selection is unappealing and the big spells are quest gated and missable.\n\nThe atmosphere and sense of wonder DDDA still has on the 100th time around is nonexistent.\n\nThis game is a monkey's paw wish, the embodiment of \"can i copy your homework\", the pinnacle of corporate greed and a slap in the face for a fanbase which has waited and asked for over a decade.\n\nDo not buy this game unless it's 80% off or less, you probably won't play it twice. Let's pray for a BBI level of repair, otherwise this game is doomed to exist as a skidmark on Dragon's Dogmas' tidy whities.",

Too many performance issues and oversights that a sequel near ten years later should not have had. I would not recommend buying unless it was a crazy discount and your just that curious. \r\nJust hold out for some \"Dark Arisen\" coated deluxe edition will get later with the care and concern this game truly deserves.",

This game had so much potential but everything is so half arsed in this game with barely anything new added compared to 1 that after 13 hours right now i can barely bring myself to boot up this game if at all.\n\nThe running between places is a drag rather than an adventure. I understand the philosophy behind it, and if done well I can see the fun in it, but this game implemented it so poorly, its basically 50% of the reason why im not really motivated to play. On top of the performance being bad, and the AI Pawns not really being all that impressive. They definitely have some new things going on for them in comparison to dragons dogma 1, but as I said this doesnt feel like a sequel but more like a slightly bigger update to 1. \n\nIts a shame, I was so looking forward to the game..",

      "review": "Movement was made intentionally worse than the first game, moving around the map is tedious. Melee attacks feel better, but getting hit feels a hundred times worse than the last game. The camping backpack lets you rest at campsites, but weighs almost as much as my entire suit of metal armor, I'm essentially running around with two sets of armor just so I can actually rest while out in the wilderness. The story falls apart immediately after you reach the first major city, what's the point of starting with a mystery if you're just going to tell the player everything in the very next quest. I'd also argue Cassardis in DD was a better starting hub than the encampment in DD2.  It feels like most of the development went to making the game impossible to run on older hardware, than making the game enjoyable to play. Game is a scam at $75.76 final price.",
