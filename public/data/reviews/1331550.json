Click View More.\n\nI have a toxic trait of loving simulation games and in depth economy games, but the learning curve always dissuades me, as after not playing for a couple months I forget how to play it and hate the idea of having to go back through tutorials. \n\nThere is a lot to this game and I see that as a good thing. The name is Big Ambitions and I get the feeling the devs chose that name based on their own ambitions for it. Which so far they seem to be hitting their goals with great success.\n\nIt's an early access and I've played simulation games that have been full releases, from AAA Companies with not even 10% of the care and innovation that has been put into this. *Cough* Cities: Skylines 2 *Cough*\n\nDevelopers have seemed to take on a lot of community feedback for this and they in the last year expanded their team but for a small team of only like 10 people now I think I read somewhere. They are killing it. How this game isn't more well known is beyond me. \n\nFor the game. You start off broke with an uncles guidance and a dream of being rich. How you achieve that is your choice. Do it all yourself, hire a bunch of staff, your choice. You can automate a lot of things. Design your spaces. Have car accidents. Run out of fuel. There's really just a lot to it, too much to list. Game is great to get lost in for hours on end or to just have up on the side while you're watching something on a second monitor.\n\nMy only GRIPES with the game is two things.\n\n1. The happiness system is a bit meh in my opinion and could be more impactful on the game. E,g employees could work slower if you're on premises with them due to your mood, reducing productivity.\n \n2. And this is more of my own fault and can't really be address as it is as I previously mentioned my own toxic trait. If you like to play a variety of games and find yourself coming back to it after a few months you will need to teach yourself how to play it all over again, which is quite tedious.\n\nTL;DR - Great game, Developers are delivering what they are promising each update and listening to feedback. Great Price for how many different gameplay mechanics there is and the aesthetic is pleasing. The ambition of the developers is to deliver a FULL Entrepreneural simulation game with great economy gameplay, this is as immersive as it gets. You can tell it's a real passion for Hovgaard Games developing this. \n\nQuick Rating System.\n\n---{Graphics}---\n☐ You forget what reality is\n☐ Beautiful\n☑ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Bad\n☐ Don‘t look too long at it\n☐ Paint.exe\n\n---{Gameplay}---\n☑ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ It‘s just gameplay\n☐ Mehh\n☐ Starring at walls is better\n☐ Just don‘t\n\n---{Audio}---\n☐ Eargasm\n☐ Very good\n☑ Good\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ Earrape\n\n\n---{PC Requirements}---\n☐ Check if you can run paint\n☐ Potato\n☑ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boiiiiii\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{Difficulity}---\n☐ Just press ‚A‘\n☐ Easy\n☑ Significant brain usage\n☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{Grind}---\n☐ Nothing to grind\n☐ Only if u care about leaderBoards/ranks\n☐ Isn't necessary to progress\n☑ Average grind level\n☐ Too much grind\n☐ You‘ll need a second live for grinding\n\n---{Story}---\n☐ Story?\n☐ Text or Audio floating around\n☑ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☐ It‘ll replace your life\n\n---{Game Time}---\n☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee\n☐ Short\n☑ Average\n☑ Long\n☑ To infinity and beyond\n\n---{Price}---\n☐ It’s free!\n☑ Worth the price\n☐ If u have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☐ You could also just burn your money\n\n---{Bugs}---\n☐ Never heard of\n☑ Minor bugs\n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ ARK: Survival Evolved\n☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs",

Like it can be big as the Sims franchise if more content is added. Almost everyone here would love to support the devs further. So, please consider releasing an expansion pass for DLCs like Paradox Games or SEGA does with their games. Just make sure to add enough content in each DLC and we will buy it. \n\nThree DLC suggestions, so please add them:\n\n1) Add Venture Capital content. Go in detail like convertible notes, SAFE notes and so on. Maybe even allow us to be VCs at some point. Pre-seed to IPO. Also, look into adding support for Family offices and how we can start one at some point. They are basically LPs for VC funds. It's good to have multiple family offices, VC funds and even consider adding startup accelerators.\n2) Please add support for co-founders. If you add it now, you can expand it later and add co-op support.\n3) Add the Stock Market. Maybe use Coffee Inc 2 for inspiration.",

I'm still not at a point where I can be completely hands off and I've dedicated a decent bit of hours to the game. It's very immersive.

So you can go off script if you want to. I added my own store logos which is great. What I would like is to be able to display the company/store name with an image as well. At this point I can only type in the name and change the background color, but some of the NPC stores have a nice image like name. So maybe the devs can add a \"banner image box\" in the future or something like that. Overall, I am very satisfied with the game so far and look forward to the future developing of the game.",

If you are a new player like myself and wanted to make something other than a gift shop, it almost tells you nothing on what to do if you DO NOT pick the gift shop. I was sent on a wild huge goose chase through google on each step on what to do, because I didn't follow the exact tutorial requests. I wanted to sell cigars and booze. \n\nEvery time I thought my steps were done, there were 16 more of not knowing wtf I was doing. \n\nLong story short after hours of frustration I ended up restarting to see if I missed something and picked the gift shop as my main store and the tutorial went from a huge pain in my ass to the smoothest ever. \n\nSo seriously, save yourself a headache if you're a new player and just pick the Gift shop first.

      "review": "Big Ambitions - A Deep Dive Into Strategic Growth with Room for Expansion\n\nIf you're a fan of games that emphasize strategic planning, time management, and long-term progression, Big Ambitions delivers exactly that. The game’s core strength lies in its depth—taking the time to meticulously grow your wealth over the course of 800-1000 in-game days feels rewarding. Watching your empire expand, piece by piece, is a satisfying experience, especially as you earn more money and make smarter, more strategic decisions along the way.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where Big Ambitions could really take the experience to the next level. While the overall progression system is solid, the profit margins in certain areas feel a bit tight. It would be great to see more profitability across the board, as it would give a stronger sense of achievement and make the grind even more rewarding.\n\nAnother point worth mentioning is the game’s memory handling. As you progress past the 800-1000 in-game days mark, the performance tends to struggle a bit. If the game could optimize its memory management to handle longer play sessions more smoothly, it would ensure that the pacing remains consistent throughout the entire journey.\n\nA big wish I have for the game is more development on its features. While the current mechanics are enjoyable, there’s room to expand on them—whether through deeper customization, more in-depth businesses, or even richer NPC interactions. And speaking of expansion, an online mode could really elevate the experience, but rather than focusing on global leaderboards, a more personal, self-contained online mode could give players a chance to share their progress, interact with friends, or compete in a more low-pressure environment.\n\nIn conclusion, Big Ambitions is a game that offers an engaging and rewarding experience for those who love building from the ground up. The game’s depth and progression system are fantastic, but with a few tweaks in profit margins, memory handling, and a bit more development in online features, it could easily become a must-play for fans of management and strategy games.",

For me I got the game thinking it would be good to make YouTube videos for it, but it has copyrighted music and it lacks features many other games have to make YouTube content easier like a option to hide the UI elements to take screenshots. For this I can't say it's good for my intended reason to buy the game, I have given them feedback about the issue as there is pretty much no way to get around the copyrighted thing, as businesses play music so do some cars and there is really no way to fully disable it. Screenshot wise, though feasible it still would be nice to have a way to take screenshots maybe even close up.\n\nThe game is really good, I love it, but I honestly wish it would be something I could share with my community. Back to the question do I recommend it yes, but not for making content for YouTube, it's a good game and the devs put a lot of time into working on it but it's limited what I would be able to do with YouTube and would be a pain to record for videos for YouTube due to the copyrighted music.\n\nI hope this review helps some and honestly if the devs fix these two issues I would be more than happy to update the review not that I am not saying no to recommending but I like to keep my reviews updated based on my views.",

I could read balance sheets like sacred texts, forecast trends in my sleep… but for what? My days were empty cells on a spreadsheet that never balanced.\r\n\r\nI was alive, yes, but not living.\r\n\r\nAnd then... [i] Big Ambitions.[/i]\r\n\r\nIt began as a casual click, a moment of boredom disguised as curiosity. Another business simulator, I thought. But within hours, I wasn’t just playing, I was calculating, analyzing, strategizing. My dormant skills flared to life like forgotten embers suddenly fed oxygen.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, my education had a heartbeat. My accounting background wasn’t just numbers on a résumé, it was the pulse behind my empire. My analytics training wasn’t theoretical anymore, it was survival, success, strategy incarnate.\r\n\r\nEvery profit margin was a small victory. Every lease signed, every market captured — a testament to the version of me that once believed numbers could mean something. And now, they finally did.\r\n\r\nIn Big Ambitions, I wasn’t just a player. I was a CEO, a visionary, a reborn soul in a city of neon and opportunity.\r\nThe lifeless fog of my routine lifted, replaced by the electric buzz of purpose.\r\n\r\nSo here I am the accountant who found life in a ledger, the analyst who discovered meaning in a simulation.\r\nSome play games to escape reality.\r\nI played Big Ambitions to finally build one.",

      "review": "I have found another game to be addicted to. I have logged 50 hours of play in the first 4 days of having it. For an early access game it is very well polished. I don't know what else to say or compare it to so I thought I would share my experience with this game.\r\n\r\nI started out with a humble gift shop. Eventually I opened a fresh food shop right up the road from it. Followed the tutorials some. I like how its done. Its like oh you need to open a business. It doesn't tell you what to do it lets you make the decision. I can be an impulsive person which can be great in a game like this or it can be terrible. I was sick of constantly restocking my fruit store. It ran out fast. I rented a larger location up the road and took out a 400k loan. I couldn't even barely afford the payment on the loan and was too broke to give a hoot how much more broke I got. Well I opened up this gym and got it manned 24-7 and suddenly it was printing money. I went from being broke to making 15k to 20k in a day.  I quickly paid off my loan and took out another for 800k. Lawyers make stupid money in real life so....to hell with it I will open a law firm. Rented some massive building that was pretty much next door to the bank. Struggled to get it online for a bit but once it was I was making 150k to 200k daily. This opened a lot of doors for me. I could just throw down businesses wherever I wanted to. Well the law firm is making stupid amounts of cash so I will open another. It was not making any money though. Come to find out my rival was messing with it. \r\n\r\nI decided I got something for you. I rented every building in Hells Kitchen that was open. Then I picked out a few of her businesses and went after them by opening my own with insanely low prices. She was making 2 million a week and now shes down to making only 1 million per week. If I was her I  would be mad that I got taken down by a guy whos only making 500k to 700k a week. Anyways success in this game feels really good. We will see where I go from here. I have almost every major property in hells kitchen. \r\n\r\nI whole heartedly recommend this game. I bought it on an impulse thinking the concept was cool I will probably get hundreds of hours out of this. Its an awesome gameplay loop and on top of that the music in it is pretty good.",

With free roam open world, dozens of rentable buildings you can turn into many different types of shops or other bussineses, the options are nearly endless on how you wish to build your empire. While there are a bunch of things you need to keep in mind and manage, the game itself is simple enough and explains everything well, meaning that you don't need a degree in economics to understand what the hell you're doing. And hey, watching green number go up is always satisfying.\n\nThe game also features lite life sim elements. I never found them to be too bothersome or annoying, as you really only need to eat and sleep. On the contrary, it allows you to have something you can dump money into besides more bussines. Buy a luxury car, get a penthouse and spend thousands upon thousands of dollars furnishing it, buy a yacht, just live the life of a successful bussinesman.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this game, it's shockingly addictive, where launching the game always leads to multiple hour sessions before you realize the sun is already down and you should probably go to sleep.",

I would like to see some quality of life improvements: camera angling, more customization options for both your character and employees, more things to do at home to increase happiness (maybe add some minigames for things your character does), more interior design options and detailed customization, maybe even dialogue/chat interactions with NPC's (not just texting or phone calls). I also notice that there are a lot of frame drops/skips - so maybe there's some improvement to be had with graphics and loading things in, asset wise in the world and map in general. (There is a lot, so it makes sense but it would be cool if the FPS can push high with a higher end pc like I have.)\n\nThere's a lot already in the game as is, but you add these details and really enhance the stability of the game and I'm sure that I will probably never stop playing this game. Just as long as I can constantly keep developing businesses and there is never nothing to do and always rivals to compete with. They become dynamic so you'll always be in some kind of self-paced competition.\n\nFun. Really really fun. Hovgaard, you're killin it with how this game is already.

So, please consider releasing an expansion pass for DLCs like Paradox Games or SEGA does with their games. Just make sure to add enough content in each DLC and we will buy it. \n\nThree DLC suggestions, so please add them:\n\n1) Add Venture Capital content. Go in detail like convertible notes, SAFE notes and so on. Maybe even allow us to be VCs at some point. Pre-seed to IPO. Also, look into adding support for Family offices and how we can start one at some point. They are basically LPs for VC funds. It's good to have multiple family offices, VC funds and even consider adding startup accelerators.\n2) Please add support for co-founders. If you add it now, you can expand it later and add co-op support.\n3) Add the Stock Market. Maybe use Coffee Inc 2 for inspiration.",

To avoid it, it's best to save the game before you start making changes to interiors and so on.\r\n- The personal life of your player is lacking, currently. There is only one activity on one day of the week. As the game is very similar to Sims in it's atmosphere, some relations boosts from hosting dinners and gatherings and so on would be an amazing addition. This would also create actual relationships between your employees, until they become the size of ants and it's only CEO's that you hang out with.\r\n- Some additional aspects of expenses would be a nice addition, like bills for power and so on. More details is always better in a simulation. The investing system ought to also be investing in actual companies at some point in development.\r\n\r\nThe game goes through different aspects of running businesses or making money.

Order too few and your factory is not working for a week and you don't get products to sell.\n\nLet me import the items and those that want to deal with manufacturing can do that.",

The amount of stupid that goes on is mind numbing. example....you need a purchasing agent to buy specific things, like expensive gifts and expensive flowers, which come from 2 different importers. ok....explain why i need an agent? i don't need an agent to pick up a phone or go online to order these things from these ppl irl. so why do i need this agent again then in yer game? i mean it's me going to the importers place to set up the phone call to the agent with the importer, but yet can't make the actual order myself? why the H would i go down there to begin with then? clearly that would be all up to this agent. zero sense. oh and this agent will work with ONLY ONE importer you say? you can't be serious. why on earth would i hire such a lazy useless person? and why would i need them for 40 hrs a week to make a single phone call for the 1 order you get per week? that's a 10 minute per week job. i'd 'need' them for no more than 10 minutes on a thursday to have my order show on the monday you've got set.  makes zero sense to hire for what you've got goin on there ppl. comical. so now i need 2 of these useless ppl just to get those 2 products that i'd be able to get without needing them irl.  and by the end..i'd need a good 6-7 agents just to get all the stuff i'd need. sorry but those HQ workers need to be working with no less than 10 per.  what a joke.  and that's just 1 thing out of about 10 that are just straight up dumb. there's logistic's managers, couple other roles that need to be filled with i'm guessing more lazy useless workers who work 5 mins a week but have to pay em for 40 to do what any business owner could do without em. . it's comical.  \n\nwhat's that? oh i DID run a DJ Company back in the 90's till i got bored and walked away from taking over my city in that field.  so .... eat it.\n\nJust pass, trust me, i've been gaming since 1980...pass...\n\nDon't buy this",

So basically no clothing, no electronics.\n\nThe factory system isn't explained or the tutorial is broken as it told me to buy things for the factory but not how many. Even in the help menu I can see what I have to purchase but it doesn't give specifics, do I need multiple? will only one do? how much product do I need to use? how many products will it produce? The how many items you need to make your product is important as you have to import those and the imports only happen once a week now. Order too few and your factory is not working for a week and you don't get products to sell.\n\nLet me import the items and those that want to deal with manufacturing can do that.",
