Few shooters manage to blend personality, humor, and competitive intensity the way TF2 does.\n\nBut what truly elevates TF2 is its community. The game has long outgrown its status as “just a shooter” and has become a creative ecosystem of its own. Countless talented animators have taken the game’s iconic characters and turned them into high-quality animations, short films, and even creative taunts. Some of these community creations reach a surprisingly high level of quality, making TF2 feel alive far beyond the matches themselves (I’m thinking of The Winglet’s videos).\n\nAnother unique charm of TF2 is its social atmosphere. It’s one of the few multiplayer shooters where, if you want, you can try being friendly with your own enemies; whether it’s dancing with a Spy, taunting beside a Pyro, or forming spontaneous “peace zones” mid-match. These small moments of camaraderie and absurdity are part of what makes TF2 timeless: it’s not just a game, but a shared playground where anything can happen if you want it to.\n\nEven today, TF2 stands as an exceptional title: rich in character and sustained by one of the most passionate communities in gaming. It remains a true classic that continues to thrive, evolve, and inspire.",

      "review": "Honestly, I have to wonder what the hype was like in the leadup to Team Fortress 2's release back in 2007. Imagine being a fan of the original Quake mod and Team Fortress Classic, anticipating the release of the new game, and then it releasing on the same day as Portal and Half-Life 2: Episode Two, aw it must have been glorious.\n\nAnyways, Team Fortress 2, always been a great game, you just never get enough of the crazy mercenaries we all know and love. Plus, having the nine different classes gives the game a lot of replayability. If you've grown tired of playing the same class all the time, you've got 8 other dudes to wake that tire. Plus the game is chock full of different game modes to duke it out in.\n\nBut sometimes the game can match you up with people way above your level. There's nothing more frustrating than going into a game, and getting killed by the same person over, and over, and over. (That's probably why domination was implemented.) So I'd like to give a mention to Mann vs. Machine, which is basically you as a team of six taking on a huge horde of AI-controller enemies. It can be a nice breather from PvP, if you just want to feel awesome and kill a ton of enemies.\n\nAnd huge shoutout to the community servers, because TF2 is known for having a ton of community-made content, like FreakFortress, or LazyPurple's servers that are either a silly friendly server with silly maps that you don't fight each other in, or a CRAZY 20-player MvM server, which I find myself hopping into every now and then. And some community-made maps are really well-made, shoutout to Ethosaur and his maps like the Ennui Box, and Lethargy Pools.\n\nIf there's ONE thing I wish the game did have though, it's a campaign mode, that delves into the background story of Team Fortress, such as what's seen in the comics. I doubt we'll ever get that, but it's something I've always wanted.\n\nBut if there's one thing I just CANNOT stand about the game, it's players who go \"Valve, give us more updates!\" \"What 8 years of no updates does to a man.\" Um, guys, I think this game has enough content in it to be considered a complete game. And also, there are entire maps and entire game modes in this game that ZERO people play. If you want something new, why don't you give Mannpower and Pass Time a try if you want new content so bad. And again, community servers, always buzzing with community-made content.\n\nOh and regarding the bot epidemic that happened a while back, I'm glad it's fixed, but keep in mind Valve took almost 5 years to fix it, that doesn't exactly make them saints...",

All you have to do is buy any one item in TF2, some costing as little as a dollar, and you'll gain access to voice chat and be able to communicate with other players. I'd encourage any players who want to get good at the game to either buy some weapons they want to try out or grind the achievements and unlock a few weapons that way. The main thing about TF2 is that there are multiple ways you can play. What I mean is that there are 9 characters, or \"classes\" you can play as. I recommend trying them all out and seeing which ones you like playing the best. Me personally, I think that the Engineer, Spy, and Soldier are my three favorite classes to play. However, other players might like to play other classes like Scout, Demoman, Medic, or Heavy. It all really depends on YOUR playstyle what classes suit you best, So here's what I recommend to people just looking at this game and reading the reviews before downloading: Spend some time (preferably equal amounts) on each class and find out what playstyle you like best. There are stock weapons for each class, but I'd recommend trying out some weapons in the shop (There's a free trial option for those who aren't sure about a weapon they want to try that gives a 25% discount on them during the trial that you can do once a week) to try to optimize your playstyle. My default spy loadout, for example, has the \"Deadringer\" watch, the \"Your Eternal Reward\" knife, and the \"L'etranger\" pistol because they work so well together when going behind enemy lines and killing off the enemy team wile staying hidden.\n\nTLDR: Try everything. Throw shit at the wall and see what sticks. Learn your playstyle. Once you do what you love, you'll love what you do. That's what makes TF2 so fun in the end.",

It gets quite boring very quickly;\nHeavy does as well, except he suffers much more than Pyro, you'll never see anyone who mains him genuinely;\nSniper really aged badly. With an item to counter any class that dares to try directly countering it, and very unpolished mechanics in general that shows the game age. You might not even know a Sniper exists before you die and wait another 25 secs to respawn.\n\nMost weapons are unbalanced, that is, are worse than any other option the game offers. Getting weapons for free is a pain in the arse in this game, as although there's a leveling system, it's only visual, with the weapons appearing in your inventory randomly.\n\nFor pretty much a decade Free 2 Play players couldn't use the text chat nor the voice chat. It was updated recently... Just after a decade of pain.\n\nThe game is infested with \"corn\", coming from sprays (which are turned off by default) to weapons that let you put custom images on them; that thing is illegal and punishable in the game, but i've never seen it be done by myself. There's no banning, no kicking; they're showing \"\"\"\"CORN\"\"\"\" to underage teens and not getting punished at all. Some people JOKE about these, and there's no way to censor them.

Casual mode (and by extension Competitive mode) are horribly buggy messes that should have never been introduced into the game.

The game is fun! but certain characters such as Pyro and Medic feel like they need unlocks to be at their most interesting or fun. So how do you do that? simple, go achievement hunting or wait for a long ass time until a random item is dropped at your feet. if you already have that item, tough shit.\nThird, lack of tutorials or guides makes finding information a pain sometimes.

They introduced a change to the casual matchmaking system in 2016 with the Meat Your Match update, which killed the vast majority of community servers and made the official casual matchmaking suck ass. Then they left this casual matchmaking be overriden by cheating auto-aiming sniper bots for years (a consequence of the new queue system which allow them to take over whole lobbies with ease). They finally got rid of the bots at some point... but recently, they've been back again.\n\nThe only way to play properly is going on community servers, and there aren't many of those since new players aren't getting funneled to them, instead they have to deal with Valve's crappy casual matchmaking and presumably quit the game because the experience there is shit even when there's no cheating bots.\n\nYes the game is old but Valve is still adding new cosmetics and profiting from it, the least they could do is make it playable without having to jump through hoops. Last Halloween update broke matchmaking... each update something breaks, this is just unacceptable and sad really.",
