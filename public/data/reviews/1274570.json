The maps are creepy, the progression of the demon keeps the pressure high, and playing with friends is chaotic fun. It’s simple, replayable, and absolutely terrifying in the best way. If you enjoy shouting at your friends while running for your life, this one’s a must-try.",

It looks simple at first but once the demon girl starts running at you full speed, bro your heart just drops. Playing with friends is hilarious and scary at the same time. It does get a bit repetitive sometimes, but it still keeps you on edge.\r\n\r\nFor the price, totally worth it. I screamed way more than I wanna admit. 8/10",

Definitely best in this genre.\r\n\r\nRight now this game has 7 maps, hopefully more to come, with 4 difficulties ranging from easy to nightmare. So there is something for everyone. Each map has similar gameplay which is burn/sacrifice 10 specific items but different enough for each map so the gameplay isn't stale or boring. Also it has a bunch of achievements to grind after you completed all of the maps if you're into that. I've seen some people complaining about jumpscare sound being too loud and I wish there is an option to lower just that sound a bit but you can also turn it off completely if it's bothering you.\r\n\r\nIt's best to play with friends since people come and go on this game with most players coming back to play the game again around new map release. Sometimes it's hard to find public lobbies, their official discord is decent place to find people to play with but not the best.\r\n\r\nOverall 10/10 game. Definitely would recommend it to all co-op horror fans.",

      "review": "Absolutely Essential Co-op Horror - A Must-Buy with Friends!Hours Played: [Your Hours Here]Verdict: Highly RecommendedIf you're looking for a horror game that perfectly balances genuine scares with chaotic, laugh-out-loud co-op moments, stop scrolling and buy DEVOUR. This game is an absolute must-have for any group of friends craving a high-stakes, deeply replayable survival experience.Why You Need to Play It:1. The True Co-op Experience:DEVOUR is meant to be played with friends. The randomized objectives, item placements, and the escalating speed of the entity force you to communicate, coordinate, and often, scream together. The positional voice chat adds so much to the atmosphere—hearing a friend's terrified yelp fade into the distance as they get dragged away is priceless. It’s an exercise in teamwork that quickly devolves into delightful, panicked chaos.2. Brilliant Escalating Difficulty:The game mechanics are simple to grasp—find items, complete the ritual, and banish the demon—but the execution is brutal. With every sacrifice you make, the difficulty ramps up. The main entity gets faster and more aggressive, and more fiends spawn. This creates an incredible sense of tension where the final moments of a run become a true test of nerve and coordination. Failure always feels earned, never cheap.3. Exceptional Developer Support:One of the best things about DEVOUR is the small but mighty team at Straight Back Games. The dedication to supporting this game years after launch is genuinely commendable. They don't just add simple updates; they release entirely new, fully realized maps (like The Inn, The Town, and The Manor) that each introduce unique entities, mechanics, and visual themes. Their consistency ensures the game always feels fresh, offering incredible value and longevity.Final Verdict:DEVOUR is easily one of the best co-op horror titles on Steam. Whether you're a seasoned horror veteran looking for a difficult challenge (hello, Nightmare mode!) or a casual player just wanting a few hours of hilarious terror with your squad, this game delivers. It's cheap, constantly updated, and provides some of the most memorable gaming nights you'll ever have.Buy it, grab your friends, and get ready to scream!",

      "review": "DEVOUR — Chaotic Co-Op Horror With Heart-Pounding Tension\n\nDEVOUR plunges players into a frantic co-op horror experience where teamwork, panic, and quick thinking are the only things standing between your group and a terrifying cult entity. Each map feels like a self-contained nightmare, requiring coordination and courage as the tension escalates with every ritual item you collect.\n\nThe game shines in its simple yet effective co-op design. Working together to find items, manage resources, and dodge the ever-growing aggression of the possessed leader turns every match into a chaotic thrill ride. Communication is key—splitting up can mean faster progress, but also guarantees hilariously horrifying moments as someone gets dragged into the dark.\n\nAtmosphere and pacing are major strengths. Each location—from haunted farmhouses to burning asylums—offers distinct threats, secrets, and environmental storytelling. The sound design ramps up fear at all the right moments, building suspense as the demon’s behavior evolves and the stakes rise.\n\nProgression and replayability keep players coming back. Difficulty settings, unlockable cosmetics, and new maps with unique mechanics ensure that each run stays fresh. The unpredictability of enemy behavior and the frantic scramble near the end of each round make DEVOUR consistently exciting with friends.\n\n[h3]Final Verdict:[/h3]\nDEVOUR is a fast, frightening, and wildly entertaining co-op horror experience. Its escalating tension, distinct maps, and teamwork-focused gameplay make it a must-play for fans of multiplayer scares and chaos-filled sessions with friends.\n\n“Terrifying, frantic, and endlessly fun—horror co-op at its most chaotic.”\n\nOverall Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐☆☆ 8/10",

Every map feels unique, every run feels different, and the jump scares never get old — even when you think you’re ready.\r\n\r\nThe game rewards teamwork, communication, and strategy. When things go wrong (and they will), the chaos is actually the fun part. Whether you’re running from demons, collecting objectives, or reviving teammates in panic, the adrenaline rush is unmatched.\r\n\r\nThe developers keep the game fresh with updates, new maps, and challenges, making it a title you can return to again and again. Smooth performance, creepy sound design, and smart difficulty scaling make Devour stand out from other indie horror games.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy horror, teamwork, and intense moments that make your heart race, Devour is absolutely the best co-op horror game to pick up.\r\n\r\nHighly recommended.",

However I am surprised at the variety in this game. You look at this game and think, \"So I do this one thing over and over with new coats of paint?\" Well, no. Weirdly enough while the goal and basic, Find X and use on specific spot 10 times never changes, but the \"how to\" changes and it can get pretty enjoyable. \r\nThe maps are really fun and different. The maps shift from open to tight hallways really well. There is also really fun spots to jump railings and evade the monster. The maps are also really well designed and I like how not one map looks or feels like another.\r\nSolid multiplayer game, play it with your friends for a fun time.",

      "review": "[h1] Good game in theory, bad game in practice [/h1]\r\n\r\nGameplay wise, it's similar to Dead By Daylight but without a real person controlling the killer. You collect items, try not to die using them, help others who have died trying and finally defeat the killer (demon, in this case) by completing your tasks. The fact that the demon is controlled by the CPU allows for the killer to get better, as the players progress, making each step more frightening than the last. So far so good.\r\n\r\n[b] Here is the big catch though [/b]\r\n\r\nYou can play with up to 4 people at once and if you do exactly that, the game will likely be fun. However, if you dare to not have 3 friends who all happen to be free at the same time as you, the game becomes [b] heavily unbalanced. [/b] You need to make 10 sacrifices in a round to win and at around sacrifice 7, the demon begins acting like it's on super fentanyl and winning becomes practically impossible. You need to use all of your luck for the entire year at once just for a win:\r\n\r\n- The demon becomes way too fast. Even when you have the speed perc enabled, it will eventually be faster than you. Combine that with the next thing, and you're doomed:\r\n\r\n- Red eyes of invincibility. The demon becomes invincible right after you stun it the first time. All you can do at this point is run away. Due to how fast the demon recovers, though, the demon will likely not only catch up to you, it will do so with such accuracy, you'll think Mossad themselves gave him your coordinates. This is also an issue:\r\n\r\n- The demon sometimes knows where you are, even when it's not supposed to. Just now, a friend of mine, who has hiding behind a solid object in a room the demon usually doesn't just stumble into the entire time, got killed by exactly that. Either Mossad gave him his coordinates, or the demon spontaneously mutated to be able to smell where players are but, without seeing either of us running into the room, he burst in, walked up to our hiding spot like a guided missile, and slimed my friend in front of me.\r\n\r\nThe \"best way\" to win a round without having 3 other people playing with you at once is by collecting all of the items prior to the demon being mad at you (at the beginning, when no progress has been made yet, the demon walks around without hunting you. still might kill you, though), stacking them at the altar and then just using all of the items in bulk, where possible, minimizing the time you have to spend looking for items while the demon is active and therefore lowering your chance of impending doom. Be honest, [i] does this sound fun to you? [/i] To me, that sounds like a collecting items simulator. No fun there.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, the developers definitely have some work to do. Fix the AI of the demon and make the game more balanced, based on the player count. Once they fix that, awesome game that is fun to play. Currently, collecting items and dying without it being your fault simulator.\r\n\r\nBeware, buyer, of the Redditors in the comment section here glazing the game. There is definitely an imbalance and everyone who says otherwise is underhating.",

Some places you jump from can be janky and get you stuck at times.\n\nPlaying with Arachnophobia mode on is asking to lose on the Inn map, the spiders turn into black blobs that are harder to see and tell boss from the others.\nBosses don't feel scary, game doesn't really have much of a horror vibe. Having your headphones blasted for being grabbed I wouldn't consider a fun jump scare, it's just cheap\nA gamma option would have been nice, as the game is too dark on some maps for my screen.\n\nThe highlight of this game will be uninstalling it til Halloween next year",

Even if the description states \"not every round feels the same\" .. it pretty much does. If you don't switch between the maps, the only difference is - that the items/offering points are at slightly other spawnpoints, depending on the map. Which doesn't really change how the gameplay feels.\n\nThe game still has a lot of potential, if some stuff gets changed/added and if it would be more balanced.\nWill change the review, if the game gets more diversity in gameplay and more casual-friendly in terms of the difficulty.\n\n(Some last note in terms of difficulty and balancing, it also could be a great option and solution if the game would get some kind of difficulty sliders, so we as the players can change \"every\" aspect (which would influence how much XP we get too) to our liking. This way hardcore-players could also change the difficulty to how they wanna play. As some example, it could get inspired by how the game \"Phasmophobia\" handles this kind of stuff.)",

The premise is intriguing: a group of players trying to stop a demonic cult while being hunted by a possessed entity, but the supposed horror quickly fades once you realize most of the game revolves around completing objectives and managing resources efficiently.\n\nFor the majority of the time, you’re not scared: you’re busy collecting items, burning or purifying objects, and coordinating with teammates. The gameplay focuses heavily on timing, organization, and communication rather than actual fear or atmosphere. Jump scares do happen, but they quickly lose impact once you understand that everything follows a predictable pattern.\n\nAfter a few rounds, the game’s formula becomes painfully repetitive. The entity stops being terrifying and instead turns into an annoying obstacle disrupting your checklist. Devour might offer brief moments of tension or adrenaline, but it’s far from what you’d expect from a true horror experience. In the end, it’s a game that demands tryharding more than courage, and once the illusion of fear fades, what remains is a repetitive, mechanical loop with little to no genuine terror.",

Also, game has elements of death, religion and cults so if you are sensitive to this it may not be a game for you.)\n\n(General)\n1. This is a co-op horror game, where you can play with up to 4 players including yourself.\n2. The characters, locations, adds, and gameplay has different types of horror elements making it eerie and tense.\n\n(Positive)\n1. The playable cultist characters have diversity giving a decent amount of playable choices both male and female.\n2. Not all cosmetic items have to be bought some can be collected throughout the maps by getting all of a certain collectable.\n3. All the main antogonists per map have are unique and the concept art for them are done well. \n4. I enjoy that they tied this game to The Watchers through the first locations Antagonist as-well-as the content they chose to expand links to The Watchers.\n5. Not to fan girl, but the Cowboy antagonist on the one map is really cool and his concept ,even though it is difficult as he has range, was just so cool that it was hard to get frustrated when being dropped.\n6. The adds, also, had diversity and work put into them, which made them interesting.\n7. The games non-playable characters and atmospehere really adde to the horror feel.\n6. The game connects well with other players and doesn't drop connection while hosting, or being on the hosted server.\n\n(Negative)\n1. The game does become repetive and tedious even when playing co-op.\n2. The game becomes tense rather than scary as the Antagonists can get frustarting, or you can get overpowered by adds and dropped due to the UV running out and not recharging fast enough  even with the perk.\n3. For them being cultists, the storyline of it going bad because they are being themselves and performing kinda doesn't make sense as that is what they are suppose to be doing, etc.\n4. The achievements were unrealisticall lengthy, which I am sure even the devs noticed with the one achievements wordplay being \"This is Starting to Getting Boaring\".\n5. The satanic elements are overplayed and overused to hammer on cultism, but I am not sure there is any knowledge from the creator on cultism other than word of mouth making the whole premis fall flat as that being the horror element.\n6. All in all I think if the game was just thought about a bit more and not just cool characters and horror elements it has potential. It being repetitive and semi-nonsensical just kinda makes it fall flat. (I am not saying I want an authentic cultist experience, but it would be cool not to just smack rituals, the number 666 and confuse Azazel with Baphomet, smooth out that you know what you are talking about, and add some eerie vibes from that perspective.)",

We did the Asylum to start, none of the doors opened but one, and we passed 8 fuses as the only pickup option, which we discovered we needed 1, singular, fuse. We encountered a few enemies and successfully defeated them using the UV light, which it told us would work on the 3rd enemy (super helpful   /s)... We then encountered another entity and assumed it was an enemy, but the UV light doesn't work and once again... no information. So we assumed we had to interact with it, only for it to shriek, drag us across the map and clip through walls and leave us as a crouched, moaning character, with grayscale view on a gray background and highlighted the items around the map. Are we dead? Do we need to revive? Can we continue? Nothing. \n\nSeems like a Wish/Temu version of The Outlast Trials.\n1/10 for potential if the devs ever address issues of what should be the basics to starting their game.\nWould not recommend.\nBut what can you expect from a game that is listed for $5",

      "review": "[h1] Good game in theory, bad game in practice [/h1]\r\n\r\nGameplay wise, it's similar to Dead By Daylight but without a real person controlling the killer. You collect items, try not to die using them, help others who have died trying and finally defeat the killer (demon, in this case) by completing your tasks. The fact that the demon is controlled by the CPU allows for the killer to get better, as the players progress, making each step more frightening than the last. So far so good.\r\n\r\n[b] Here is the big catch though [/b]\r\n\r\nYou can play with up to 4 people at once and if you do exactly that, the game will likely be fun. However, if you dare to not have 3 friends who all happen to be free at the same time as you, the game becomes [b] heavily unbalanced. [/b] You need to make 10 sacrifices in a round to win and at around sacrifice 7, the demon begins acting like it's on super fentanyl and winning becomes practically impossible. You need to use all of your luck for the entire year at once just for a win:\r\n\r\n- The demon becomes way too fast. Even when you have the speed perc enabled, it will eventually be faster than you. Combine that with the next thing, and you're doomed:\r\n\r\n- Red eyes of invincibility. The demon becomes invincible right after you stun it the first time. All you can do at this point is run away. Due to how fast the demon recovers, though, the demon will likely not only catch up to you, it will do so with such accuracy, you'll think Mossad themselves gave him your coordinates. This is also an issue:\r\n\r\n- The demon sometimes knows where you are, even when it's not supposed to. Just now, a friend of mine, who has hiding behind a solid object in a room the demon usually doesn't just stumble into the entire time, got killed by exactly that. Either Mossad gave him his coordinates, or the demon spontaneously mutated to be able to smell where players are but, without seeing either of us running into the room, he burst in, walked up to our hiding spot like a guided missile, and slimed my friend in front of me.\r\n\r\nThe \"best way\" to win a round without having 3 other people playing with you at once is by collecting all of the items prior to the demon being mad at you (at the beginning, when no progress has been made yet, the demon walks around without hunting you. still might kill you, though), stacking them at the altar and then just using all of the items in bulk, where possible, minimizing the time you have to spend looking for items while the demon is active and therefore lowering your chance of impending doom. Be honest, [i] does this sound fun to you? [/i] To me, that sounds like a collecting items simulator. No fun there.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, the developers definitely have some work to do. Fix the AI of the demon and make the game more balanced, based on the player count. Once they fix that, awesome game that is fun to play. Currently, collecting items and dying without it being your fault simulator.\r\n\r\nBeware, buyer, of the Redditors in the comment section here glazing the game. There is definitely an imbalance and everyone who says otherwise is underhating.",
