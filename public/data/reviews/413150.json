This was one of the first games I bought with my own money at the ripe ole age of 12. At first, I didn't enjoy it, I didn't understand it. Then I revisited about a year or two later and became obsessed. The consistent loop of farming, mining, and monster killing drew me in. The pleasureful grind sucked me into pure unbridled obsession. The multiple ways of approaching this game kept me coming. When I finally got a PC, the options just opened up. The amount of versatility in modding and creativity is captivating.\r\nThe romantic interests are all unique and have wonderful story lines. Each character you meet in this game has their own unique charm that anyone would keep coming back to. Not to mention the update support, with ConcernedApe consistently coming back despite working on another banger of a video game. This game fundamentally changed my life, it carried me through the quarantine, and I wouldn't have it any other way. If you have the spare 15 bucks, please buy this game, trust me it's worth it. You can get hundreds of hours out of this game, even without going full completionist with the achievement and perfection. 10/10 love this game would recommend to anyone listening. \r\n\r\n(Haley my wonderful wife btw)",

      "review": "Stardew Valley is a very relaxing and therapeutic game. In it, you play as a farmer, primarily farming, fishing, raising animals, and gathering resources. You work from sunrise to sunset, without modern high-tech drones or automated farms; everything is primitive and simple, just like its pixelated art style.\r\n\r\n星露谷物语是一款非常治愈放松的游戏，在游戏里，作为一位农夫，主要是耕种、钓鱼、养殖与收集，日出而作，日落而息，没有现代高科技的无人机和自动化农场，一切都原始而简朴，正如这像素风的美术。\r\n\r\nThrough countless days and nights in the game, I built friendships and even love with the townspeople. I respect and cherish every NPC in the game, talking to them, listening to their dreams and secrets, just as if they were my friends in real life.\r\n\r\n在无数个游戏里的日夜里，我跟小镇的居民们建立了友谊与爱情，我尊重并珍惜游戏里的每个NPC，跟他们交谈，倾听他们的梦想与秘密，就好像他们是我现实中的朋友一样。\r\n\r\nRumors of an affair between the mayor and Maggie circulate in town. Malone attends the annual festival, but Maggie, whom he admires, never glances at him. A mysterious great wizard, who cheated and divorced, still harbors the witch's rage, and Abigail suspects she is a descendant of a wizard. The dwarves in the caves and the shadow people in the sewers have an age-old feud. Vincent tells you a secret: he wants to marry Penny when he grows up…\r\n\r\n镇上流传着镇长和玛姬的桃色新闻，马龙每年节日的时候都会出席，但他欣赏的玛姬从未看向他一眼；神秘的大魔法师曾经出轨并离婚，女巫的愤怒至今仍未平息，阿比盖尔怀疑自己是巫师的后裔；山洞里的矮人与下水道里的暗影人有着自古以来的纷争；文森特告诉你一个秘密，他长大以后想娶潘妮为妻子……\r\n\r\nThese familiar storylines feel like a real, gossip-filled town, and I used to be there.\r\n\r\n这些耳熟能详的剧情，就像是现实生活中真的有这么一个八卦满天飞的小镇，而我曾经在那里。\r\n\r\nEvery now and then, I'd turn on my computer, return to Stardew Valley, and spend a whole day on the island, fishing, sunbathing, feeling the sea breeze, just like I would on a real beach.\r\n\r\n时不时就会打开电脑，回归星露谷，然后在岛上发呆一整天，钓钓鱼，晒晒太阳，吹吹海风，就像我在现实中的海滩上一样。\r\n\r\nLife is so beautiful. \r\n\r\n生活是如此的美丽。",

      "review": "Stardew Valley has been my favorite farming game for a good five years now. Having played through a new save on Steam and almost reaching perfection again at the time of writing this review, it's just as calming, fun, and open-ended as I remembered. As a gamer with the attention span and general gameplay interests of a caveman, it's pretty crazy that something that appears so mundane and simple at a surface level is one of the most addicting things I've ever played.\n\nThis game has been around long enough that the best it has to offer has already been parroted by tons of people, so I'll try to keep the things I love most pretty brief. Progression is perfect and moves at a pace that's simultaneously slow enough that the game always always feels relaxing, yet fast enough that all of the seasonal content the game has to offer returns semi-frequently and it's not quite as agonizing if you accidentally forget to/run out of time to do something during a certain season. NPC townsfolk are designed great, having unique schedules and interests and pretty engaging storylines for the most part. There's a ton of ways you can make money, and with the right setup any of them can be extremely profitable, which makes the gameplay fundamentally super open-ended. That paired with the sheer diversity of things you can do in a single year cycle and the (SPOILER FOR ENDGAME AREA) [spoiler]giant distant island with a colossal amount of unique content you can access late in the game[/spoiler] gives this game a pretty insane longevity that provides hundreds of hours of engagement, and ensures that there's a dozen other projects you can focus on if you can't finish something season-specific.\n\nIt's been said by many already, but I can concur that this game has something for everyone. Tons of avenues of farming and ranching for whatever playstyle you have the most fun with, well-designed and fun combat that can be challenging but rarely feels like you're unfairly screwed over, open-ended building and different farm layouts that can allow for breathtakingly beautiful farms, tons of varied NPCs of different age groups you can choose to make friends with or pursue romantically (or not, you can be a sigma lone wolf too, with zero consequences), cross-platform co-op if you'd like to play with a friend or partner, Steam Deck compatibility (which I can't comment further on as I don't have one), and some fun lore that you by no means need to care about at all to enjoy the game but also adds some very welcome charm and mystique to the world if it does interest you, all for the frankly stupid price of only $15 USD. There are very few games that provide this level of content and quality with an indie pricetag, and it's fantastic that we have a charming and relaxing life sim in that boat, as a majority of them tend to lean towards being fast, fun, and high-octane action/adventure/platformer titles. \n\nThere's a million other things to gush about, but I'll leave it at that so as to not spoil anything for anyone. It's worth mentioning I don't play with mods apart from a few small quality-of-life things, but a single browse through Nexus will make it obvious there's a pretty wild modding community working diligently to enhance the game even further. This game is an unbelievably good value for $15, even going on sale occasionally, and comes packaged with so much varied content it's highly unlikely you wouldn't enjoy the game (though I think it also does a good job playing enough of its cards in the first two hours that you'll know very well if this game simply isn't for you and you want to refund it). I can't do anything but strongly recommend giving Stardew a try. The amount of positive reception it continues to get almost a decade after release and its stagnant Overwhelmingly Positive rating on this platform says enough; this game is WELL worth your money. Thank you for helping me through some of the hardest times of my life with your funny little farming game, Mr. Ape.",

For me, it began as a simple farm simulator with friendly neighbors welcoming me into their community. Before long, I was leveling up skills to fight monsters like in an RPG and puzzling over what to do with the mayor’s pants.\n\nCountless hours later and a month after quitting cold turkey, I’m happy to report that it IS possible to detox from it. At least until the next update, since the developer tends to drop new quests every now and then. Good luck to all of us trying to do anything else when that happens.",

It's effortless to get into, hundreds of hours of content, easy multiplayer, lots of flavor of your choosing, great on the Steamdeck, will run on anemic hardware, appropriate for all ages etc... The fact that it was made by one man with a passion is incredible. In terms of digital entertainment, there are few things that could provide better value for the money. \n\nMy only critiques are 1) lack of Steam workshop support and 2) the inability to change the pace of a day without mods (see critique 1). If you don't mind 3rd party mod sites, these are a non-issue for you and the game will open up even further to you in terms of what you can do with it. I do wish ConcernedApe would at least add pace-of-time options to the base game. Sometimes I really just want to manage my affairs without worrying about the clock.\n\nA couple minutes of looking into the game will let you know if it's for you or not. It does exactly what it says on the tin.",

This cave gameplay is fairly different from rest of the game which made it stand out to me.)\r\nThere were other gameplay loops like the incredibly challenging arcade minigames but I just didn’t consider them being a big enough part to include as a reason to play the game \r\nBut yeah if you end up not liking any of these in the context of the time management element + the interactions with npc then you have no reason to like the game\r\nBut you will more likely end up enjoying one or more and enjoy this game!",

Your brain needs a hug. What you need, my friend, is Stardew Valley.\n\nForget everything you know about farming sims being \"boring.\" This game is a masterpiece of pure, unadulterated dopamine. It's the video game equivalent of a warm blanket and a cup of hot chocolate.\n\nThe Grind is... Actually Fun?\n\nThe core loop is genius. You start with a dump of a farm, overrun with trees and rocks. It looks like a scene from a post-apocalyptic movie. But then you get your rusty tools, and the magic begins. \"Just one more day\" becomes your mantra. You'll find yourself saying, \"Okay, just gonna water my crops, pet my chickens, maybe go fishing... wait, it's 2 AM in-game and I'm risking passing out to catch one more carp.\"\n\nBefore you know it, you're not just a farmer. You're a artisanal mayonnaise tycoon, a master angler, a legendary monster slayer in the mines, and the town's #1 matchmaker. The skill progression is so satisfying it should be illegal.\n\nContent for Decades\n\nThe amount of stuff to do is absolutely bonkers. This isn't just a farming game. It's a:\n\n· Dating Sim: Can you woo the goth elf boy or the moody writer? You betcha.\n· Dungeon Crawler: The mines are no joke! Pack some snacks and a good sword.\n· Town Restoration Project: Rebuild the community center and stick it to the corporate Joja Mart. Feels good, man.\n· Fishing RPG: The fishing minigame is a whole vibe and I will fight anyone who says otherwise.\n\nThe Verdict: 10/10, A Perfect Comfort Game\n\nStardew Valley is a legendary indie gem, the kind of game you'll still have installed years from now. It's a world that feels alive, thanks to its charming characters and their own little stories. ConcernedApe, the solo dev behind this masterpiece, is an absolute GOAT for creating this and supporting it for so long.\n\nTL;DR:\nIf you have even a single chill bone in your body,BUY THIS GAME. It's the ultimate palate cleanser, a time-sink you'll never regret, and honestly, cheaper than therapy. Just be warned: you'll start playing, look up at the clock, and realize you've been optimizing your crop layout for three real-life hours. Totally worth it.\n\nSee you at the Stardrop Saloon!

I started the farm for myself, but it became something much bigger once my friends joined me. We watered crops half-asleep at dawn, sprinted into the mines together, got lost in the forest at night, and laughed over the most ridiculous mistakes. None of it was dramatic, yet every moment felt warm.\r\n\r\nWhat Stardew teaches you is that happiness is often found in routine—planting seeds, tending animals, watching the seasons change—but the joy doubles when someone shares those small moments with you. When we built our first barn together, or sat by the beach during the in-game summer festival, it didn’t feel like pixels. It felt like a memory.\r\n\r\nThe game never pushes you. It simply gives you a place to breathe, to slow down, and to appreciate the people beside you—both on the farm and in real life. Stardew Valley isn’t just relaxing; it’s a reminder that comfort can be grown, just like a crop, as long as you have good friends to grow it with.",

      "review": "Lately, I’ve realized that scrolling through memes doesn’t help anymore. Shocking, I know. Who would’ve thought that endlessly staring at recycled jokes and low-effort edits wouldn’t magically fix the crushing silence of my room? For years, I really believed that the internet’s finest “relatable content” could patch up the loneliness—but apparently, laughing at a raccoon holding a slice of pizza isn’t equivalent to emotional stability. So I stopped relying on that cheap dopamine and went searching for something that resembled peace. Somehow, against all logic, I found it in Stardew Valley.\r\n\r\nThe game begins with a fantasy I wish HR departments would normalize: quitting your soul-sucking job through a nostalgic letter from your dead grandpa. Honestly, if real life offered such convenient escape routes, I would’ve packed my imaginary bags ages ago. But since it doesn’t, I settle for the Valley, where I can pretend I’m a functional human being by watering digital plants.\r\n\r\nAnd it’s strange because while the real world feels like a chaotic puzzle missing half the pieces, the Valley runs on the kind of common sense I wish society would try sometimes. Plant a seed, water it, and—miracle of miracles—it actually grows. No existential dread, no sudden plot twist. Just simple, peaceful logic. It gives me a sense of control, which is wild because in real life I can barely control my sleep schedule.\r\n\r\nThe loneliness is still there, of course, but somehow it feels lighter when I’m talking to NPCs who have more emotional depth than half the people I know. Shane confesses his depression, Linus opens up about being an outcast, and there I am thinking, “Wow, code is emotionally available—imagine that.” Walking into festivals where everyone pretends to like me—even though they’re programmed to—still feels better than awkwardly navigating real gatherings where no one is sure where to stand.\r\n\r\nCall it escapism if you want, but at this point, it feels more like self-preservation. The gentle music, the pixelated leaves, the passing seasons—everything works together like a digital therapy session that won’t send me an invoice afterward. Stardew Valley doesn’t judge me, doesn’t rush me, and doesn’t remind me to “go outside more.” It just lets me exist, which is honestly more than most spaces in my real life do.\r\n\r\nSo yes, maybe I’m hiding in a tiny pixel farm. Maybe I’m finding comfort in fake villagers and imaginary crops. But in a world that constantly feels too loud, too heavy, and too lonely, this little game lets me breathe, go at my own pace, and believe—even sarcastically—that maybe, just maybe, everything might be okay.",

      "review": "(Played on Steam Deck)\n\nI tried. I really did. But this one just didn’t steep right.\n\nOkay, confession time: I jumped into Stardew Valley because of the hype. It felt like everyone was talking about it - the cosy community’s ride-or-die farm sim. So I gave it a proper go. In fact, I played 35 hours. I kept dipping back in, hoping for the moment it would “click.” But honestly? That moment never came.\n\nThe core gameplay loop just didn’t land. I found myself stuck in a grind that felt more repetitive than rewarding. And while I normally enjoy slower, sim-style games, something about Stardew felt off. The farming was fine - but it never sparked joy. The rhythm of the days turned into a bit of a chore… and not the comforting kind.\n\nI struggled to connect with the characters. Their storylines felt generic, and I couldn’t get invested in the town’s social side the way so many others seem to. I know the heart of this game lies in its relationships, but I just didn’t feel much of a reason to care what anyone was up to.\n\nAs for the visuals - I get the nostalgic appeal of the retro pixel art. But personally, I found the world a little gloomy and lifeless. That’s totally a taste thing, and I respect the creative choice. It just didn’t do much for me.\n\nI really did try to find positives. If nothing else, Stardew Valley helped pave the way for other life sims to build on the formula and evolve it. I’ve definitely seen this idea pulled off in ways that resonated with me more. That said, the community around the game is lovely. I met some genuinely kind people who encouraged me to keep going when I was struggling to stay interested.\n\nMy biggest frustration? That nagging feeling like I should be enjoying it. Like I was missing something magical everyone else could see. But the truth is - sometimes even the most beloved games just don’t click. And that’s okay.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nI fully respect how much this game means to others. It clearly struck a chord with thousands of players - and that’s great. But if you’re after something more emotionally engaging, visually vibrant, or relaxing without the grind, there are plenty of other cosy games that might be a better fit.\n\n🌱 Rating: 5/10 (personally)\nNot a bad game - just not my game. I wanted to love it, but it never quite brewed the right cup.",

To make matters worse, relationship levels decay over time so anyone wanting to keep them high is forced to spend hours running through town throughout a playthrough just finding each one of them and talking to them to hear the same lines of dialogue over and over and over again.\n\nCombat is also shallow and a horrible experience that feels extremely inprecise. Brain-dead easy at times and needlessly punative at others. There seems to be little regard for balance.\n\nI normally love fishing in games. It really sucks in this. Players are foced to spend hours leveling their fishing skill because some fish are quite literally impossible to catch at lower levels. And even when you fully level it, have fun fishing up garbage (literal garbage) much of the time anyway. Just baffling that the dev though this would be satisfying in the least.\n\nMany of the things you can do on the farm are there just to be there. There doesn't really seem to be a need to engage with them beyond busywork and to say that you did it. Keeping the farm free of constantly spawning debris is an insanely tedious chore which would have been enough to make me quit any other game if I wasn't trying to find what people loved to much about this one.\n\nGenuinely one of the most overrated pieces of media ever created, in my opinion, and many of the subsequent games it has inspired (and there are MANY) are superior in virtually every way. I'm still continually baffled and the amount of hype this gets. There's not need to play it over countless other games out there that just do it all better.\n\nThe only exceptional thing about this game is that it was made by one person. There is credit due for that, at least.",

Whether it's having to switch game versions, to not being able to see each other on co-op because of long standing known issues that the community has found work arounds for, to it just straight up black screening and crashing when we try to play. Absolute awful game. No idea how it has all the critical acclaim that it does, I would not reccommend this game to my worst enemy, There is nothing more frustrating than having a game that could run on an old Atari crashing and being unplayable. It is 2025. If your cozy couch co-op game isn't actually co-op.... what is the point? 0/10 unplayable garbage.",
