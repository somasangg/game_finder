The skill tree is deep enough to make you feel like a master strategist, even though 90% of the time you’re just button-mashing your way to victory. Customization is insane—you can make your hero look fabulous while utterly destroying everything in sight. 10/10, I’ve never looked cooler while murdering pixels.",

Concerns that if not fixed, will make you lose your player base.\nHere are some, enjoy!\n\n- They only updated the UI but with added bugs as if KOG is telling players that they just patched this game straight from the basement to get some cash.\n- Only 4 of the 20 characters at release. Why? So you use up your character slots, so when they release new characters you want, you will be forced to use VP to buy more character slots.\n- It's missing the tree-house feature at the moment even though again it's clearly based on Season 5.\n- There's also no dodge(evade) skill by using the Left-Alt Button, making the game phase much much slower and a lot harder in the process.\n- Not enough options to create weapons and armor at the forge.\n- Drop rates for equipment and materials are so low that it forces players to use low-level items. Why? So people will buy VP equipment only, the same idea with the forge.\n- Character skills have been nerfed. 3 bar skills now do very little damage and you can't buy MP potions with GP anymore to use lots of skills plus, dungeon pets don't really give MP anymore, only Gatcha ones I guess. Why? So you buy VP of course! 😉\n- Job level requirements have been changed from 20, 30, and 40 to 20, 40, and 60. Why? So you buy VP missions.\n- Another classic marketing strategy, 1000 VP to reset 1 skill, but 1500 VP to reset the whole skill tree? Who is going to buy the 1000 VP one? Nice try KOG, nice try.\n- 3rd job and 4th job missions both have false requirements. For example, it says finish Partusay Champion mode 5 times, but it really doesn't need to be in CM, etc.\n- There is no shared inventory and shared gatcha pets. Even GC club is not shared across characters and the warehouse has very fewer slots than the original release. Why? EZ, so you'll buy more VP\n- Gacha isn't split into armor, accessory, and weapon anymore. It's all together. Why? So you don't have the option to choose what you want and have less luck getting the things you want.\n- Game's resolution is still 4:3. They didn't even try fixing it. It really is classic I guess¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ (Good for your Windows XP!).\n- Laggy connection with laggy menus.\n- We used to get daily champion mode tickets and event dungeon tickets after every dungeon or just buy them with 100,000 GP or coins in the Heroic Shop. Now, the only way is thru 1000 attendance points (2 days) or, of course, through \"VP\".\n- At the first official re-release, players can only play up to Ascencion (Thanatos). It feels like an early access game although it's a game released a decade ago with only 4 starting characters\nwith the plan to slowly release them as if it might get people excited about what's coming. (People already know the game and all the characters; they'll get annoyed or get bored if it takes too long).\n\n*These concerns can also be seen from a lot of reviews by other players who love the game and there are a lot more to be discussed, but I think I got my message across, KOG ripping people off harder this time than its first release.*\n\nConclusion:\nMost players are only playing this because of nostalgia and it won't hold them for long. When nostalgia runs out\npeople will realize how sad the current state of the game is.\nMost of all, people know when they're being ripped off, do yourself a favor, and learn from your past mistakes.\nKOG thought that people are coming back just because of how fun the game is because of dedicated players\nfrom the private servers, sadly, they don't get the point.

Concerns that if not fixed, will make you lose your player base.\nHere are some, enjoy!\n\n- They only updated the UI but with added bugs as if KOG is telling players that they just patched this game straight from the basement to get some cash.\n- Only 4 of the 20 characters at release. Why? So you use up your character slots, so when they release new characters you want, you will be forced to use VP to buy more character slots.\n- It's missing the tree-house feature at the moment even though again it's clearly based on Season 5.\n- There's also no dodge(evade) skill by using the Left-Alt Button, making the game phase much much slower and a lot harder in the process.\n- Not enough options to create weapons and armor at the forge.\n- Drop rates for equipment and materials are so low that it forces players to use low-level items. Why? So people will buy VP equipment only, the same idea with the forge.\n- Character skills have been nerfed. 3 bar skills now do very little damage and you can't buy MP potions with GP anymore to use lots of skills plus, dungeon pets don't really give MP anymore, only Gatcha ones I guess. Why? So you buy VP of course! 😉\n- Job level requirements have been changed from 20, 30, and 40 to 20, 40, and 60. Why? So you buy VP missions.\n- Another classic marketing strategy, 1000 VP to reset 1 skill, but 1500 VP to reset the whole skill tree? Who is going to buy the 1000 VP one? Nice try KOG, nice try.\n- 3rd job and 4th job missions both have false requirements. For example, it says finish Partusay Champion mode 5 times, but it really doesn't need to be in CM, etc.\n- There is no shared inventory and shared gatcha pets. Even GC club is not shared across characters and the warehouse has very fewer slots than the original release. Why? EZ, so you'll buy more VP\n- Gacha isn't split into armor, accessory, and weapon anymore. It's all together. Why? So you don't have the option to choose what you want and have less luck getting the things you want.\n- Game's resolution is still 4:3. They didn't even try fixing it. It really is classic I guess¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ (Good for your Windows XP!).\n- Laggy connection with laggy menus.\n- We used to get daily champion mode tickets and event dungeon tickets after every dungeon or just buy them with 100,000 GP or coins in the Heroic Shop. Now, the only way is thru 1000 attendance points (2 days) or, of course, through \"VP\".\n- At the first official re-release, players can only play up to Ascencion (Thanatos). It feels like an early access game although it's a game released a decade ago with only 4 starting characters\nwith the plan to slowly release them as if it might get people excited about what's coming. (People already know the game and all the characters; they'll get annoyed or get bored if it takes too long).\n\n*These concerns can also be seen from a lot of reviews by other players who love the game and there are a lot more to be discussed, but I think I got my message across, KOG ripping people off harder this time than its first release.*\n\nConclusion:\nMost players are only playing this because of nostalgia and it won't hold them for long.

      "review": "Wassup KOG!\n\nHear thy concerns of your cash-cows, I mean players. Concerns that if not fixed, will make you lose your player base.\nHere are some, enjoy!\n\n- They only updated the UI but with added bugs as if KOG is telling players that they just patched this game straight from the basement to get some cash.\n- Only 4 of the 20 characters at release. Why? So you use up your character slots, so when they release new characters you want, you will be forced to use VP to buy more character slots.\n- It's missing the tree-house feature at the moment even though again it's clearly based on Season 5.\n- There's also no dodge(evade) skill by using the Left-Alt Button, making the game phase much much slower and a lot harder in the process.\n- Not enough options to create weapons and armor at the forge.\n- Drop rates for equipment and materials are so low that it forces players to use low-level items. Why? So people will buy VP equipment only, the same idea with the forge.\n- Character skills have been nerfed. 3 bar skills now do very little damage and you can't buy MP potions with GP anymore to use lots of skills plus, dungeon pets don't really give MP anymore, only Gatcha ones I guess. Why? So you buy VP of course! 😉\n- Job level requirements have been changed from 20, 30, and 40 to 20, 40, and 60. Why? So you buy VP missions.\n- Another classic marketing strategy, 1000 VP to reset 1 skill, but 1500 VP to reset the whole skill tree? Who is going to buy the 1000 VP one? Nice try KOG, nice try.\n- 3rd job and 4th job missions both have false requirements. For example, it says finish Partusay Champion mode 5 times, but it really doesn't need to be in CM, etc.\n- There is no shared inventory and shared gatcha pets. Even GC club is not shared across characters and the warehouse has very fewer slots than the original release. Why? EZ, so you'll buy more VP\n- Gacha isn't split into armor, accessory, and weapon anymore. It's all together. Why? So you don't have the option to choose what you want and have less luck getting the things you want.\n- Game's resolution is still 4:3. They didn't even try fixing it. It really is classic I guess¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ (Good for your Windows XP!).\n- Laggy connection with laggy menus.\n- We used to get daily champion mode tickets and event dungeon tickets after every dungeon or just buy them with 100,000 GP or coins in the Heroic Shop. Now, the only way is thru 1000 attendance points (2 days) or, of course, through \"VP\".\n- At the first official re-release, players can only play up to Ascencion (Thanatos). It feels like an early access game although it's a game released a decade ago with only 4 starting characters\nwith the plan to slowly release them as if it might get people excited about what's coming. (People already know the game and all the characters; they'll get annoyed or get bored if it takes too long).\n\n*These concerns can also be seen from a lot of reviews by other players who love the game and there are a lot more to be discussed, but I think I got my message across, KOG ripping people off harder this time than its first release.*\n\nConclusion:\nMost players are only playing this because of nostalgia and it won't hold them for long. When nostalgia runs out\npeople will realize how sad the current state of the game is.\nMost of all, people know when they're being ripped off, do yourself a favor, and learn from your past mistakes.\nKOG thought that people are coming back just because of how fun the game is because of dedicated players\nfrom the private servers, sadly, they don't get the point. People love the game due to private servers owners who also love\nthe game themselves and are not out just to milk their cash cows.\nIt's kinda sad that you're willing to shut them off, especially for those communities who really love the game and not just helping them at all coz you're only after peoples' money.\nThey shut down this game once before and I'm sure if they aren't happy with the amount of revenue generated by the game they'll do it again.\nWP KOG, WP.\n\nSincerely,\nYour loving cash-cows community",

My account was nothing crazy but it was pretty decent, I tried my best to collect everything from all events and just slowly build my characters up.\n\nIt was all for nothing. This week I was banned out of the blue, permanently. Upon appealing, they said there was evidence of \"abnormal gameplay\". The problem is, I never cheated. Not once. I have never done anything against the TOS. I barely even did any dungeons at this point, just a few to finish event milestones. All my years of play were thrown out the window because this company can't even fix their garbage detection system.\n\nIf you think I'm lying and making this up, just last week they also banned one of the biggest GC youtubers unfairly too. They even said the same thing to him, but eventually gave his account back, probably because he has countless hours of videos and livestreams, but I unfortunately don't have that luxury.\n\nGo play something else, hopefully where you don't risk getting banned for nothing.",

Its a bad game with over 10 hours of dailies, weeklies before you can even grind the things you want.\n\nDrop rates are very abysmal, you need to utilize all characters to try and even grind materials due to limited daily runs. \n\nGacha rates and prices are very predatory. No regional pricing. It's a requirement as well as it has stats that elevate the character's damage and overall performance.\n\nMaterial drops from the store as well are very expensive, only buying bundles on sale make it really ever worth unless you're a giga whale or from the US where it feels affordable.",
