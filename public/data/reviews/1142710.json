      "review": "This game is probably my favorite strategy game since the old Command & Conquer games. There's an absurd amount of content, even without buying any DLCs (which you should only buy on sale since they go on heavy sale several times a year - same goes for the base game). If you own the first or second game (and/or their DLCs), you can play all those factions in this game and they don't feel just shoehorned in at all. Every campaign feels different, even if you play the same faction twice. There are lots of great difficulty settings and a very active mod community. Lots of stuff to do on every turn and it feels very rewarding to learn how the world and intricate politics of the different factions work, and to leverage game systems to your advantage. Your faction leader, race/faction mechanics, start position, political standing, and most of all your actions every turn have a huge impact on how the campaign will play out, and there are 200+ factions on the map that also impact everything. The map is also huge (if you are playing on Immortal Empires, which you should be as soon as you've learned the game basics), you could be 100 turns deep and just about to conquer your entire continent, meanwhile on the other side of the map, some faction you haven't even encountered has gotten even bigger than you. \n\nSound design and music is good, graphics are good, UI is mostly good but not perfect. Achievements are pretty fun to go for with the exception of the trials of Tzeentch ones, those are such a slog (but at least not that hard). \n\nThe game is also great to play with a friend, you can play any campaign alongside a friend who is playing another campaign in the same world. You could be on other sides of the world, fighting back to back, or going against each other, and it makes politics even more interesting because your allies and enemies probably won't line up with your friend's.  \n\nThe game runs well, but load times are really bad if you use a hard drive or an old SSD, so save yourself a lot of time and use a new-ish SSD if you have that option. There are some bugs, but I would be shocked if there were no bugs in a game where this much stuff happens every turn. The game-breaking bugs do get patched out by the devs usually pretty quickly, which unfortunately happens instead of them developing new content. CA's PR team is horrendous and Sega has a skeleton crew working on the game for some reason (seems really weird since this is CA's biggest source of revenue) so meaningful content updates come out less and less frequently, and often with delays. I'm sure this is the main reason this game is getting review-bombed right now, which is pretty valid, but I wanted to put my review here because even though the current trajectory of the game's future looks pretty bad, the game as it is is great, no if ands or buts. I too am unhappy with the bad PR and lack of work going into content updates, but I have almost 1000 hours between this game and Warhammer 2, and could easily milk out a few hundred more with just what is currently available, and that's without addressing mods, of which there are many that add quite a lot of high-quality content.\n\nIf you like Warhammer, I feel pretty confident in saying this game is richer in lore than any other Warhammer game, and it interested me enough to get me into the tabletop game and other video games. The lore is very interesting and the world always feels coherent. Most campaigns end up feeling like you're roleplaying a character or telling a story of your own making within the rich world of Warhammer fantasy. \n\nOverall, this game is just really good and provides a bevy of highly varied experiences. If you like complex strategy games and feeling like you're building a fantasy empire, you'll love this game. I hope CA gets its stuff together and gets more people working on the game's updates, but I doubt that will happen, but even though that makes me sad I'm still glad the game exists and is as fun as it is.",

      "review": "Do not be dissuaded by the negative reviews. There is literally no other game that compares. If you like Total War strategy and Tolkienesque D&D-like fantasy, you should remove all doubt and just dive right in. Whatever the shortcomings of Creative Assembly, they've made the world and all its characters come to life in a remarkable way, with great animations and outstanding voice casting. \n\nWhat I highly recommend you do, however, is to play it with Venris's SFO: Grimhammer III and Hecleas AI Overhaul mods. They will greatly improve the length and challenge of your campaigns, combined with whatever QoL mods to suit your fancy. There are literally hundreds of mods that pick up the ball where CA dropped it or that add additional content.\n\nI warn you though, that, if you get into it, you may have to pull out your purse more often than you expected, not because the game has micro-transactions, but because there are over a 100 unique Legendary Lords / factions to play with (and more to come), many whom will need to be unlocked by purchasing their respective game (Warhammer I or II) or DLC they came with. But even without them, you'll have many options to get you going for hundreds of hours. You will have access to 10 or 12 factions if you only buy Warhammer 3. \n\nPeople can complain about the price tag, and since Warhammer III, it's not without reason. Warhammer 1 & 2 offered DLCs which added 2 new factions for 7,49€; Warhammer 3's DLCs generally offered 3 new factions for 25€, now 23€, a steep incline. Although you can choose to pay only for one faction at a third of the price. \n\nBut even if I have spent approximately 440 bucks in total on all the games + DLCs since 2016 (you should be able to get all for less than half of that during sales), it's given me over 5,000 hours of game time. Even at full price, that's more than 12 hours of return per euro / dollar spent. Where else can you get a full day of fun for 1 euro?\n\nEver seen a T-Rex fight a Black Dragon? A giant War Mammoth vs a Treeman? An army of undead against a dwarven shieldwall? Ever marched through Chaos-infested wastelands filled with devils and demons with a bunch of spearmen and bear riders? \n\nNo? Then what are you waiting for?",

The game itself?  Good.  The people who have played 1000 hours and have nothing but bad things to say?  Comical, if a bit embarrassing.\n\nIf you've enjoyed Total War in the past and want it to be more bonkers, you might be interested.  If you like the setting and want to simulate a campaign in Warhammer Fantasy, you might be interested.  If you are looking at the dozens of DLC and offended that you have the option to pay more for more content: take a deep breath.  Understand that none of them are required and each can provide you with dozens of hours of playtime if you like it.  Find a faction or lord that appeals to you and pick that one up.  Only buy one at a time--there is no value in a DLC you don't play.  The base game has a variety of factions and lords that will keep you going for a good long time.  If you don't find fun there, you don't need to worry about the DLC.\n\nOh, and play Immortal Empires.  The base scenario is the less fun option.\n\nHave a nice time.

It’s just a cool game. I love playing vampire clans, because I’m a vampire dork. Other races are great as well. One thing I recommend is to look into mods, some of them are just A+ and improve all the things. \n\nSo don’t expect anything with navel battles, that smacks in a bad way, CA kind of gave up on it when they were making headway with the Revolutionary War TW, such a loss. I wish we had the option for duels like in Three Kingdoms, not a big deal but could have been cool. \n\nRegardless, this game is outstanding. They are still updating it all the time as the time of this review. It’s weird they’re that invested, but that’s a good thing.

      "review": "Even though I haven’t played the first two Warhammer titles, my experience with other Total War games made the transition into Total War: Warhammer III surprisingly smooth. The biggest difference, of course, is the shift from historical settings to a fully fantastical universe. Instead of grounded realism, the game immerses you in a world filled with magic, demons, and larger-than-life factions, which instantly makes the overall experience feel more dynamic and unpredictable.\n\nWhat truly stands out is the Warhammer universe itself. It’s an incredibly rich and captivating setting, and Warhammer III embraces that depth more confidently than any previous Total War game I’ve played. The Chaos realms, in particular, offer a unique tone and style that you don’t get in historical entries. The Chaos factions feel like they belong to a completely different genre, and that’s part of what makes them so exciting. Khorne and Tzeentch especially caught my attention—each having such distinct personalities, aesthetics, and playstyles that they feel like fully realized creations on their own.\n\nOn the mechanical side, Total War: Warhammer III stays true to the core formula of the series while expanding it with systems that fit the Warhammer setting. The campaign map feels more dynamic thanks to faction-specific mechanics, randomized rifts, and unique progression paths that push you into constant decision-making. Battles are fast-paced and visually intense, especially when commanding massive daemonic units or powerful legendary lords. Each faction plays dramatically differently—whether it’s Khorne’s aggressive melee-focused armies or Tzeentch’s magic-driven, manipulation-heavy style—which gives the game a level of replay value far beyond traditional historical Total War titles.\n\nOverall, Total War: Warhammer III blends the strategic depth of the series with a universe that’s bold, imaginative, and constantly surprising. Even without playing the earlier entries, it’s easy to appreciate how much care went into bringing this world to life. For someone who already enjoys Total War but wants a fresher, more fantastical experience, this game is absolutely worth diving into.",

The story was been told backwards by CA which makes a lot of sense.\n\nOverall though, the Urson Campaign ain't better, in my opinion than The Vortex Campaign. It has cool factions and Chaos Dwarves mirrors the uniqueness of \"tomb kings\" but the campaign per se feels more rushed. In only a few turns most of the factions gets eaten up or confederation happens a lot. It happened each of my playthroughs so far in only 3 hours you will have like 20 factions from which they will mostly be 4 in truth (Humans - Kislev / empire and maybe Norsca) Chaos Factions and Chatay factions.  - Therefore it feels smaller than WH2 and even 1.\n\nSome dlcs have broken AI's and unless they are played by a human they just disappear so no room for diversity.\n\nTEH bad - Mortal Empires is a Scam.\n\nI was really disappointed about the Immortal Empires campaign as I felt scammed to be honest. The maps from 1 and 2 and even 3 have ALL ben cut. Everything is x3 smaller and compacted. You jump from a city to another there is literally no room to walk which makes everything faster I guess but I don't like it at all. I was used with The Old World Map and The Vortex Map, I know they did something similar in Mortal Empires as well but now its REALLY BAD, they exaggerated with compacting the world soo much ( Yes, I am aware it's a big feat to put everything in one map but it's still a fact that the world looks so weird being compacted so much and so many parts of it it's just..GONE.\n\nThey massacred Lustria, it's so small it makes no sense. You have a nice map of Kislev in Urson Campaign but in Mortal Empires it's compacted as hell. They Massacred the Eye of the Vortex Island as well! as well, As I said everything it's x3 or maybe x2.5 SMALLER.  \n\n\nBut hey, I paid 15$ for this game and 5$ dlc's and respectively 12$ Chaos Dwarves sooo for this price the quality is too good. Would I pay full price for WH3? NO. \n\nI would (and did) for WH 1 though.",

For all my friends that has played Empire Total War or Rome 2, Empire has 137 settlements and Rome 2 has 183 settlements. \r\n\r\nOnly downside of the game and also the last few games is all the factions thats locked and that you need to buy separately. I understand that it cost money to develop but the base game is already expensive. There is a big amount of factions that is unlocked in the base game.\r\n\r\nDont buy this game at full price.

The AI sometimes feels unstable; not always going in the way you'd expect or plainly not doing anything at times. Autocombat still has issues; the AI can't manage cavalry for instance which is problematic with a faction like Bretonnia. The story campaign is interesting to play at least once, but after that you'd probably play the Immortal Empires game mode most of the time.

      "review": "This game is dope. There's a learning curve for sure if you're just starting. Once you get over that hump, oh boy. Get ready to lose a couple weeks of your life every time you start a campaign. Every faction has unique mechanics, units to play around with, and a different set of objectives for you to win. While yes, ultimately it boils down to make big army, big money, and control the map, every faction has it's own unique way of doing so. Find a faction or two you like and drop 100 hours just playing them. In terms of bang for your buck this is the game. \n\nCouple things to address. First the DLC. The DLC does not lock you out of actual gameplay mechanics or parts of the map. Every unpurchased lord or race is available to play against so you see them on the map when you play them. The base game has plenty of races. How this game works is if you buy 3, you have access to the immortal empires, which is the huge campaign with every single race involved, however you are limited to play as only the factions in immortal empires. If you buy 1 and/or 2 you have access to the factions in those games. Then you can buy the DLC for factions and Lords for factions you find are interesting. It looks like a lot, but genuinely just buy the DLC for the faction you think looks the coolest. You don't have to buy it all at once, so don't let that complete package price daunt you. \n\nSecondly, there's a lot of drama with the company and youtubers. Creative Assembly is a greedy video game company, simple as that, and there's a popular total war youtuber who basically quit because of them. They also tend to do things like have bugs that come out while they ship DLC that doesn't work. Welcome to gaming in 2025 unfortunately. \n\nBarring those two things, this game is an absolute gem and if you are remotely interested in warhammer or strategy games I highly recommend giving this game a shot.",

The fact that if you kept up with all the DLC in the old games they throw them all in to this one, makes it feel even better that you decided to spend that money. \n\nThe only downside to so many factions, is it can take a little while between turns as the computer is deciding what everyone is doing, more so when you actually start to discover the factions as well, but that's solved by murder or confederating. \n\nEach character having their own little missions and each faction having somewhat a different and unique sport of feel and mechanic really enhances the game if you're like me and like to spread the love across all the different lords and ladies the game has to offer.\n\nAll in all, another stand up Total War game from Creative.",

We know they've been working on a new engine, we know they keep pushing out fixes for bugs, we know that this game will continue to remain one of the most ambitious projects out there. There are a number of great features this game has. \n\nFirst, a massive combined three part map that can keep single campaigns going for hours. \n\nSecond, real time turns that allow a large party of people taking their turns simultaneously. \n\nThird, huge variety of units, animations, stats, and play style to accomadate and enrich your experience. \n\nFourth, beautiful maps and battles that can challenge players and strategists alike. \n\nThe only thing I wish for is more more more. If you read the negative reviews that's what you'll see: a demand for more. More content, more fixes, more updates, more graphics, more changes, more games, more styles, more more more. The people have spoken, and we have an insatiable need for total war. \n\nWe want a new engine, easier mod support, more community driven direction, and yes, more games. The masses are so in demand for Medieval 3, Empire 2, and Rome 3 that they went and built them some new overhauls of these games in right in the Steam Workshop (ie Rome 3 = Divide Et Impera, Empire 2 = Empire 2 Mod). It's only a matter of time before one day the devs stop publishing updates about even Warhammer 3 and then modders will go back and give me the total war I've been waiting for my whole life: Battle for Middle Earth. \n\nAnd while the recent reviews for now have won the day and kept this game at a mixed review status, I know that this game is a hallmark to any RTS player. It's so grand and all encompassing that everybody who is repeatedly drawn to RTS games will inevitably stumble upon even this title. I got my money's worth out of this game a long time ago.

There is a lot of hate directed at this game for multiple reasons. I understand the community's reasons to be upset. But seeing all these people with hundreds to thousands of hours of game time... The game has to be pretty good despite all those negative reasons, right? In my opinion, yes. I've not played any table top Warhammer, but I think they did a really great job at putting the setting into this type of game. The models, animations, map, voice acting, etc. They all look fantastic. Each faction's mechanics are unique (for the most part) and fun (for the most part). With 1400 hours, I'm still in the process of playing each legendary lord at least once. This is the type of game where time will slip by you without your notice. Hours will go by. \n\nThere are downsides to getting into this series however. Most notably, the DLC's. If you want every single piece of content, you will need to purchase the first two base games in addition to all the DLC's from each game. Waiting for a sale is the best approach because it'll get... expensive. But playing just the base game is fine too because there's still a decent amount of content to start you off.\n\nRegarding multiplayer, I've played both co-op and PvP. I'm a fan of both. Co-op is definitely fun with friends, helping each other out in the overworld and in battle, assigning individual units to your friends to micro in your stead is very fun (like using cavalry/chariots). PvP is an acquired taste. With friends, you gotta have willing PvP enthusiasts. Through matchmaking or mingling with the competitive community, it can hit or miss. I found it refreshing after having OP armies in the campaign. It can humble you. \n\nOverall, the game is fun and I'll continue to sink another 1400 hours I'm sure. I'm no fanboy of the devs, but I'm not a hater either. Creative Assembly has their flaws, but they've also addressed community gripes over the years and tweaked/fixed them... albeit a bit slow to the trigger. Give credit where credit is due. I do love the game and I have always had a very positive view on it, looking beyond what people tend to complain about. I own all the content, and with how many hours I've sunk into it, I feel like I used my money well. My only real gripe is not having any friends who want to PvP spar with me lol...",

I bought the Warhammer trilogy in the month of July of 2025 and I love it (I love fantasy with elves and dwarfs and I love strategy games).\n\nThe game has a large variety, though I met some bugs at the beginning, like for example the Lizardmen were idle. After finishing the tutorial campaign of Kislev I finished he Chaos Rift campaign, then moved on to the Immortal Empires campaign. The map is huge. I started with Tyrion from the High Elves. Unfortunately the Lizardmen were idle and got defeated early by the southern Skaven faction called Clan Pestilens. Then of course this Skaven faction had to invade my lands. I was playing on Very Hard difficulty and this Skaven faction caused me a lot of headaches. If the Lizardmen would have been active, they could have been my allies and they could have protected me from the Skaven, probably. Doesn't matter, the game received an update (6.3.4) that fixed this bug, or at least I think it is fixed as there are no more Lizardmen around my territories.\n\nOverall I enjoy playing this game, it is a mix between Total War and high fantasy (elves, orcs/orks, dwarfs), exactly what I love. This game also made me get interested in the Warhammer franchise and so I bought a few books about Warhammer Fantasy and Warhammer 40k. \n\nCurrently I have 162 hours in the Immortal Empires with the Tyrion faction (on turn 220+). I explored like 80% of the american continent and probably 30% of the european continent (as I see it the whole Immortal Empire map is based on the real world). This game is huge, and I love it. A few bugs here and there will not stop me from enjoying this game.\n\nOne negative aspect that I can say is that the deployment lines are flickering from time to time, but I read online that it is due to my NVidia 5070 GPU, so I don't know if it is the game or my GPU. Hope this will be fixed. The flickering happens especially when I fight against Dark Elf Black Arks. All I do in this situation is restart the game after the battle and the flickering dissapears.\n\nOther than that the gameplay is fun, pulling off hammer and anvil tactics is fun, the units look good, the factions are varied, units are varied, there are even tanks on the Empire factions, which I never though I would see in a Total War game. The whole trilogy is a bit expensive and I wish there would be a physical copy of all of the three games as I like collecting physical discs (grew up in the 90's with owning physical copies of NES and PC games), but overall I am happy with my purchase, the game is challenging (for me), I can spend time on thinking of the optimal strategy for my empire, it's a fun experience playing this game.",

I hear the next in the series is ancient empires, which I would love. Overall, I love the franchise and I love what they've done with Warhammer. I hear the next total war will be ancient empires of earth and I would totally eat that up. So I'm sending them all positive energy.",

I've sunk a LOT of money into this game franchise. I can find enjoyment in the gameplay and seeing lovely models & warhammer characters brought to life. Dispite this, I would not recommend this game, or supporting creative assembly. \n\nMy boy, Nakai, the kroxigor, spent the good half of a year unable to recruit kroxigors. Now his race, the lizardmen, along with other races, are completely broken. Their AI is bugged and will not do much of anything. The AI in general has been awful in this game, being overly cowardly & oppritunistic and just constantly running away. I and many other have to chase the AI down to get a good fight. \n\nWhen it comes down to it, SFO has and continues to be the main reason I keep coming back. Because they make consistent updates and add new & interesting things to the game. It's been near bone dry for content updates for warhammer 3, and the dlc cost have risen. The quality has lowered. Many times new content by creative assembly comes in either broken, or unbalanced, or breaks something unrelated to the dlc. This newest dlc, tides of torment, has been pushed back, yet I have zero confidence in CA to actually deliver something worth any money given their constant and continual neglect of the 'base' game. The reason I say 'base' is because many of the issues are for races and campaigns WE have to pay them for!\n\n Save your money or out-right pirate this game. They left it to rot over and over just to release failed project after failed project with the cash they got from warhammer 3. Hyenas, egypt, so on... All that time and man power, nearly non of it to their money maker. Then the layoffs. more drama from CA, and so on. and so on. I'm tired chief. I just want to play a functioning game I poured hundreds of hours and dollars into. \n\nLike... try playing the demon prince, the posterboy for chaos in all the trailers for warhammer 3, and tell me CA has care for this game.\n\nGood luck.

      "review": "This is one of those games where I wish steam reviews weren't just a simple Yes or No recommendation.\n\nAt its core, TW:Warhammer III is a good game that stands out from games in other Total War series due to its variety and uniqueness of factions, units, and playstyles. Even if you're not into the Warhammer franchise, you can enjoy this game if you're into strategy, big battles, and fantasy. The sound is good, the visuals are good, the voice acting is great. The battles can be very entertaining.\n\nI like the game, I really do. However, I just can't RECOMMEND buying the game for people new to the series.\n\nLet's get this out of the way first. The DLC situation with this game is particularly egregious. Even if you paid full price for this game, you only get a fraction of the factions unlocked. And even those unlocked factions in the base game aren't fully unlocked, portions of it, legendary lords (which determine your starting point and playstyle) and even some upper tier units, are locked behind DLC. The DLCs combined for Warhammer III can cost you way more than twice as much as the base game. But let's say you like the game, you decide to buy all the DLCs for the WH3... and yet, you still don't have everything unlocked. Why? Because not only do you need to buy all the DLCS for WH3, [u]you need to buy Warhammer 1 AND Warhammer 2 AND all their respective DLCs in order unlock everything[/u]. In addition, they don't support cross platform, so if you have WH2 on epic and WH3 on steam, guess what? You gotta rebuy WH2 on steam just to unlock the stuff for WH3.\n\nBut let's say you're mister/missus money bags and you don't mind spending a couple hundred dollars to unlock things in the game. There are many minor (not game crashing) bugs and bad design choices that aren't terrible on their own but are horrible when they all come together. Not all factions are equal, and understandably so, as it's difficult to perfectly balance a game around all these factions and legendary lords that can completely change how you play a faction, but those are not the bad design choices I'm talking about. For example, in the previous games, minor settlements can gain walls if you built the correct building and upgraded it. Certain factions were unable to do this but gained other advantages to make up for their lack of walls. In WH3, they've completely done away with gaining walls in minor settlements for every faction without making up for it. As another design choice, they've nerfed the garrisons defending your settlements. By design, the AI, to compensate for not playing as smart as a human, gets more resources and have less upkeep, which allows them to field more armies than you (and the higher the difficulty, the more resources and less upkeep). This results in the AI generally being in more places and able to just steamroll your minor settlements, regardless of your defensive buildings, if you don't have an army babysitting it (and most factions can't support having an army babysitting every settlement). In the previous games, the walls forced them to siege your minor settlements buying you time to get an army over to save the settlement, but in WH3, it's like playing Whack a Mole with all their armies running around going for your undefended bits, which quickly gets very tedious. It wouldn't even be so bad if your major walled settlements were choke points or something, but no, the AI just waltzes on by. Just a bunch of bad design choices coming together to make a horrible (and very common) situation.\n\nThere's also all these weird (but not game crashing) bugs that just ruin things sometimes. The more commonly noticeable one is when the AI gathers several armies around a town and... just sits there doing nothing (for possibly the entire game). And this is a VERY common occurrence. The other more commonly noticeable (well, if you play with a faction with ranged units) is that sometimes your ranged units just stop firing at will. They'll shoot if you manually tell them to attack a target but that defeats the purpose of firing at will. They could have clear line of sight to the target, no obstacles, on a flat plain, with ammo, in range, and they just won't fire at will. This makes things particularly unpleasant if you're playing a range heavy faction and downright cost you some battles if you're in a big battle and you don't notice your ranged units doing absolutely nothing because you were busy micromanaging another part of the battle. Even melee units will have brain farts at times where you order them to engage/chase an enemy unit and they just walk in and stare while the enemy is busy whacking away at them or just follow (and not attack) the enemy that's running away even though your unit is faster and should be cutting them down while running.\n\nI could go on but this review is long enough as it is. I like the game but I just can't quite recommend it buying it especially if you're new to the series. I understand companies need to make money, but it just doesn't feel like the value is worth how much they're charging. Some people can argue that just the base game alone is worth it but you definitely feel the difference when you play a base game faction and find out some of your unit roster is locked behind DLC. And if you're expecting people to spend hundreds of dollars, at least try to keep it as bug free as possible.",

I bought this game about 2 years ago and imagine the dismay on my face when i go to select a faction and it is DLC locked. Its not 1 or 2 factions DLC locked. ITS DAMN NEAR EVERY ONE! you barely get any factions to play as in the base game and the factions you can play as have HALF THE UNITS ARE LOCKED BEHIND DLC! And thats not an exaggeration. i really liked the style of the game so i decided to say screw it and bought all the DLC because I'd like to play the game i payed for. Then i go into campaign and some of the campaigns i looked forward to playing YOU HAVE THE BUY THE PREVIOUS GAMES ($60 dollars each) so i by those games as well (i regret it) fast forward to me getting into multiplayer, the competitive scene is skewed by unbalanced factions, and the biggest issue, animation bugs. you can have your units chasing and contacting an enemy unit and they won't play any combat animations and won't hit the enemy. There are mods you can install to somewhat fix the issue but those mods arent used in any multiplayer events, and you cant use mods on the ranked ladder which makes sense but then those animation bugs make multiplayer so dumb. even the campaign is super bugged as of right now. The devs are also currently working on the next total war game while this game (the current most popular game in the series) is buggy and horribly balanced just a janky animated mess. Thats not to say there's not good parts about the game. The units and art looks so cool (despite some models having low quality texture issues) and the campaign map isn't horrible. in the end to be able to play every faction with every unit. All the game costs and dlc added up comes to $500 USD exact. I regret i looked past the issues and bought the dlc and got so invested in it. overall game is 2.5/10 for me.

      "review": "Before the qualities (or lack thereof) of this videogame can even be discussed, it is important to bring up the cost. I am writing this on the evening of the 25th of November, 2025; in a little over a week, on the 4th of December, the next DLC \"Tides of Torment\" will be released. To access everything in this game, you need to buy [b]3 STILL RETAIL PRICE games[/b] (that are 9, 7, and 3 years old respectively), for a total of $179.97. Once the base games are accounted for, if you scroll up the page a bit, you will see they have conveniently consolidated all 3 games DLC on this store page (minus Blood for the Blood God I and II which you don't [i]need[/i] unless you want to go back and play the previous 2 games with blood effects), for a total of $319.22. This puts the total cost of Total War: Warhammer III at [u]$499.19[/u], before any online sales taxes, and not accounting for the previous two blood packs.\n\nWhen Tides of Torment releases on the 4th of December, Warhammer III will breach the $500 threshold, coming in at [u]$526.16[/u]. It should be common sense that [b]NO[/b] videogame that has ever been released, or ever will be released, is worth $500. There may be other grand strategy game players, simulator game players, and gacha game players that would argue that this is okay because some of their games can end up more expensive than this one. To them I would say, it is wrong when developers/publishers do it to you and your communities, and it is wrong when they do it to Total War players as well. Additionally, actual tabletop wargamers that play these Games Workshop produced miniature games (Warhammer Fantasy Battles, Warhammer the Old World, Warhammer Age of Sigmar, and Warhammer 40,000) will frequently claim that this game is a \"value pack\" considering the amount of factions contained within that $500, compared to the cost of a singular army of actual tabletop miniatures and materials to assemble/paint them. To them I would say, GW has led you around by the nose for [b]42 YEARS[/b] now, and your perspectives of both time and value are completely irreparably damaged.\n\n[h1]Now with that out of the way, how is the game?[/h1]\n\n[b]It's bad.[/b]\n\nMore specifically, it might very well be the greatest Warhammer: Fantasy Battles videogame ever released (low bar). However as a [b]Total War[/b] game, it is marinated in the bile of Total War: Rome II, and suffers many similar problems due to that. I will list off several things that come to mind, however there are more valid complaints than can be typed in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n[h3]Terrible AI[/h3]\nThis is primarily a single player game (I will touch on multiplayer aspects later), most of your time will be spent engaging with AI opponents of two different flavors. The [b]Battle AI[/b] is absolutely feckless. On offense it forms a long single line and runs straight at you with no regard to the terrain, nor their opponents or their own army composition. This results in it forming giant blobs of its own units which are easily blasted into paste with ranged fire and spells. On defense it forms a long single line and sits there doing nothing until the player either weighs a flank (which causes the AI to pivot its whole force), or it takes enough damage from projectiles of any variety to cause it to flip into its offense mode detailed above. The [b]Campaign AI[/b] is absolutely craven. It spends its time sitting in walled settlements, sitting on units it recruited in the first 5 turns of the campaign because it can't disband them. It does this until it is in a state of war, where it decides to actively avoid enemy armies on the field, and go hit undefended, unwalled, minor settlements instead. It will only ever engage in a pitched battle if it perceives the autoresolve value to be in their favor before the armies actually make contact (the AI doesn't have fog of war and can see everything that isn't in ambush stance at all times, so it doesn't need any reconnaissance). The only time you will ever face it on the field is if you bait it with an ambush, or it has formed a big blob of armies and is moving them all together.\n\n[h3]Cramped Campaign Map[/h3]\nDespite being \"the biggest Total War map ever\", the Immortal Empires map (the only singleplayer mode anyone will play, I am not even going to discuss Realms of Chaos in this review) is so [b]condensed[/b] that it doesn't feel very big at all. Unless you are in a Jungle biome (which lowers armies movement by default), most settlements in the game are only 1 turn of movement away from each other. If you combine the AI's craven, avoidant behavior with the density of settlements, it results in [b]the[/b] problem that everyone complains about more than anything else.\n\n[h3]Sieges[/h3]\nThe siege battle situation in this game is unacceptable. The frequency of these sieges are caused by the reasons I listed above. This wouldn't be as much of an issue if this battle type was actually fun; but the battle AI's passivity plus its terrible pathfinding, settlement layouts, stupid building and capture point mechanics, and bugs (primarily with the gatehouses and getting on and off wall segments) do everything in their power to make that not the case. The other problem is that the player is on offense 95% of these battles because the cowardly AI refuses to attack the player's hardpoints unless they have 4 stacks rolling together. I don't think that the solution to this problem is \"remove sieges\" as so many like to say, I think CA needs to take a hard look at Total War: Shogun II, and Total War: Medieval II, and use those two game's sieges as a baseline to build from.\n\n[h2]Multiplayer[/h2]\nDespite the singleplayer focus of the game, it [i]has[/i] multiplayer. On paper, a game like this should be a wonderful multiplayer experience, but once again there is a factor in play to prevent this from being the case. The main issue is the [b]complete lack of servers[/b]. All of the connections in this game are done peer to peer, and as a result whenever ping is involved, the game quickly turns into [i]Warhammer III the interactive slideshow[/i]. The way the game handles latency hasn't changed since [b]Total War: Rome from 2004[/b], it [i]sloooooows[/i] down, and depending on how bad the latency is, it will just stop.\n\n[h3]Multiplayer Campaigns[/h3]\nYou can do multiplayer campaigns, which could be fun if you aren't playing with somebody from another country, or somebody who has poor quality internet. The more players you add to one of these campaigns (it goes up to 8) the worse it gets, as everybody is directly connecting to each other, rather than a server to sync the gamestate. In the previous titles, the maximum was 2 players in a multiplayer campaign, so the additional players is cool in theory. They also made it to where you can do your turns simultaneously, which is awesome until two players go to war with each other, and then it becomes a frantic clicking match as a [b]TURN BASED CAMPAIGN MAP[/b] goes realtime.\n\n[h3]Competitive Multiplayer[/h3]\nThis community is split in 3 ways. The first split is between those who use the games built in matchmaking, and those who join insular Discord communities based around the tournament scene. The second split is between those Discord communities, between the newer Domination game mode, and the traditional land battle game mode (which is now doing Conquest mode instead). There is no siege battle focused community like there was in the heyday of Medieval II, this is because siege battles are terrible. The same latency problems are in play here, and on top of that now you're picking to play with either: automatch scumbags who spend their time abusing the lack of rules, or Discord eSports people who want to regulate you to death.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\nIf you don't have ANY of this games content, don't buy in. If you disregard that advice, buy in on sale. I am stuck in the sunk cost fallacy, be warned.",

      "review": "I’ve had a ton of fun with Total War: Warhammer 3, which is exactly why it hurts to say I can’t fully recommend it. The foundation of the series is built on layer after layer of old code, WH3 sits on WH2, which sat on WH1, and it shows. The game’s systems feel tangled, and meaningful improvements often require CA to fight their own engine. This slows updates, limits innovation, and lets long-standing issues linger.\n\nBut the deal-breaker for me is the siege design. It’s simply bad. Traditional siege tactics don’t work, defending walls is a trap, and the optimal play is usually to hide deep in the settlement and cheese the enemy through attrition. Making it worse, around 80% of battles end up being sieges anyway, because AI lords almost always run and hide into their settlements the moment you have the strength advantage. You’re forced into the worst part of the game again and again.\n\nOn top of that, the community has long agreed that the campaign has become bloated with too many systems that don’t meaningfully interact, and the battle AI still struggles with basic pathing, flanking, and decision-making (especially in siege battles). There’s also a widespread feeling in the community that CA has prioritized monetization over maintaining or improving core gameplay, with frequent DLC and slow responses to major issues making players feel ignored and undervalued. $400 total for all games and DLC, call me crazy. These issues pile up and drag down what could be a masterpiece.\n\nThere’s greatness here, but until these core problems are addressed, it’s hard to give a wholehearted recommendation.",

They are a horrific company and do not deserve your money or support. If this game was free, then I'd say play the hell out of it. But unfortunately, this game, to have the full experience, requires a hefty amount to put down. The fact that the game is so expensive wouldn't bother me too much (since I collect actual Warhammer minis), but it's how horrific the bugs can get. For months, Creative Assembly ignored the Lizardmen issue where their AI would freeze. The fanbase screaming from the top of their lungs is the only way that Creative Assembly pulls their thumb out and manages to \"fix\" things.\n\nOnly after the community cried out did they bother to reveal their Tides of Torment DLC. Amazing. This game SHOULD be great, but Creative Assembly keeps trying to mine for copper whilst ignoring their goldmine.\n\nI want to say that this is one of my favourite games, but if it wasn't for the fact that I'm a Warhammer fan then I wouldn't even consider it.",

I checked them throughout the campaign. Everything was there. Until suddenly… it wasn’t.\n\nAfter a battle loss, I went to reload — and the game looked me dead in the eyes and said:\n“Manual saves?

CA seems to follow a pattern of promising communication, followed by months of barely sharing their plans, only changing their course once the player and content creator community backlash becomes loud enough to force them to speak with us. It has been several years of this immature, lazy pattern. The recent episode from fall of 2025 when CA responded to backlash by fixing the AI of two factions that had ceased to work (and were the straw that broke the dam of anger) is a good example of this. While CA responded to this episode by working on the game and communicating with us, that is only an action fixing an issue that they created. \nWhat we need is for CA to act consistently as if they are paying attention to the game and to what their player base thinks about the game. There are many quality of life improvements that could be made. Many small changes (such as making High Elf heroes available at one tier earlier) like those suggested and explained well by content creators on youtube would do wonders for replayability. \nDLC like Tides of Torment seems to have focused on a mix of new units and new lords with unique mechanics. That's great! However, I think I speak for many, many players when I say that CA should not neglect other Legendary Lords as they currently do. For example, it's been explained by the Total War playthrough on youtube that Tyrion and Teclis both have had useful changes to their campaigns to make them more interesting. While there are plenty of things that could still be done to improve each (like victory conditions and terrain compatibility for each), neglecting Alith Anar, Alarielle, Imrik and Eltharion is a massive missed opportunity since this is likely the only time High Elves will be looked at again (and first time since Eltharion's DLC years ago). An important part of any DLC is race updates (to all lords). \nPlease pay attention to quality of life improvements that make gameplay more fun. For instance, unit variety in the early game and greater challenge in the mid-late game. For too long it has seemed apparent that CA does not pay attention to how the game feels to play. Please don't be afraid to explain why things are happening. Please earn back our trust by working on this and by communicating more effectively.",

It is Total War, not Total Daycare where I have to keep reminding my units to finish the orders I give em. Non pausable battles are pretty damn hard, if your flankers just stop for no reason. Target not lost, no contact with an enemy unit, no spell hit em, no obstacle .. they just stop.\n 2.  The fact that a defender can open their gate and let one of my unit through and then putting up a force field or something to block any other unit to enter ... I know it's  a fantasy game, but this is bullshit.\n3. Allies are mostly useless. They r a source of money, but goddamn if it takes 15 turns for an ally or vassal to begin their attack on a target I gave em. Even worse was when I allied Vlad, he then moved his 8 armies to an insignificant province, while both Sylvanias got looted and occupied by dwarves. \n4. Path finding and army movement points.   Just make the game show u how much movement points I really have. Ambush stance takes 25 points to activate - then why I can't always change to it at 4 or even 7 points over the required amount? \n\n   I love the series.  I have thousands of hours and hundreds of euros invested in this. But I honestly can't recommend the game as it is. I didn't even mention the math on skills giving %-amount of buff.

      "review": "For full transparency, I have played Total War games at least since Shogun 2, and went back to play Rome I (best Total War) and Medieval 2 afterwards: They are cornerstones of my taste in games; which makes reviewing this game that much harder.\n\nTotal Warhammer 3 is an uneven offering, with many glaring errors, lackluster mechanics and outright atrocious player freedom. For every neat thing in the game, two to three basic failures pop up. It gets to a point, where you wonder how a studio with so many years of notes from prior games to learn from could keep falling over themselves.\n\nI originally intended to include the Realm of Chaos campaign into the review, but realized quickly in doing so that the main appeal of the game is Immortal Empires, so I will be focusing on that.\n\nKey points:\n\nThe voice acting, map stylization from the lore and general presentation is outstanding. It is frankly one of the best realizations of the Fantasy setting I have ever seen, brimming with life and character. From the small things, such as flavored tech and character traits, to the grand stylings of the factions and their visual details. Looking at the factions, their units and the game itself is a visual feast. The sound must also be mentioned. Though there are shortcomings, especially from old content that is legacy from TWW1, the sound design broadly brings the warhammer setting to life, especially with its use of audio cues that makes busy battles easier to parse. There is also a world of magical items, which add a level of flavor that would have been entirely acceptable to see the studio cheap out on, but they did not, and deserve props for their inclusion.\n\nWhat I cannot be so glowing on is everything else.\n\nThe map looks like ass. Instead of an easily parsible map, or an ability to simplify the terrain and give commands, TWW insists upon itself; you will look at its spanning, pointless eyesores and baubles when you just want to move a unit from one mountain range to the next, it's a genuine eyesore to keep track of units on the map.\n\nThen again, you won't be keeping track of many units at a time, becaue Total Warhammer insists on using Rome 2 as its skeleton, meaning you only get to have units run around with generals, who will emerge from nowhere, with no family trees to speak of; which works for some factions, but for human and elven factions, is absolutely ridiculous. It heavily deincentivizes building smaller units and moving them around the map, because anything short of a full stack of units is going to be chowed down by a 20-stack ai unit and its 4 companion stacks coming out of the mist (looking at you, Vampire Counts).\n\nDespite the studios' \"best efforts\" to bring legacy factions into the newer games with revised mechanics and improved gameplay experiences, they still come up painfully short. The Empire, the face of the series, has a pathetic tech \"tree\", which rivals Bretonnia for brief but painfully bad. Comparing these to newer factions is genuinely an effort in futility.\n\nAnd these tech trees are shared amongst factions, which makes for an even worse experience. To alleviate this, each lord has a faction mechanic, which are supposed to individualize them, and in that matter, some of them are excellent: Balthasar Gelt is a fan favorite for a reason, and his colleges mechanic is a lot of fun; but then you have him go to the Empire, and you end up having to fight Nuln and Reikland to unit the EMPIRE, because Gelt doesn't get the mechanic that allows him to interact with the Prestige system; or Bordeleuax, a faction who starts flanked by the newer (see: better) faction Skulltaker with no rites to help his expansion, forcing a turtle playstyle to build up the numbers to auto resolve him to death.\n\nOn that note, auto resolve is thoroughly confused. It has never been great, but it is frankly baffling how it's supposed to take things into account, with factions such as Beastmen and Slaanesh always getting the short end of the stick, yet in battles, they rip units to shreds. It gets to the point, where in particularly annoying sessions, I have resorted to stacking trash armies to stack the auto resolve in my favor; a strategy which is near unbeatable, with the exception of the likes of the Skaven and Beastmen, who can ambush you with attacks (and ambushes are extremely fair and balanced, with units running away the moment the enemy makes contact :D) \n\nBattles are not that much better, with thoroughly confusing statistics like Anti-large, which counts against cavalry, but doesn't actually do well against cavalry, unless it has armour piercing, because armour is the king of stats in the game; especially in Auto-Resolve (hello Dwarves; hate you). Though it is a visual feast to see Imperial gunners rain hell on an enemy, it is thoroughly annoying to play, because the AI will do utterly foolish moves, like archers attempting to go past the defensive line to get closer to an enemy well within range (With bows, mind), or archers turning 30 degrees to the right to hit a unit on the right side of their vision cones; you can't even see the accuracy of units, with some units supposedly having poor accuracy, but nailing an opposing, accurate artillery battery with pinpoint precision. This, coupled with the ATTROCIOUS MORALE SYSTEM, which devolves into running your general in circles to keep your troops in the fight, or having your troops surround your fleeing general, it makes for an extremely unintuitive experience, and makes TWW one of the worst battle experiences in the series.\n\nMost obvious shortcoming in battles however, is the utter lack of decent music. I have tried to find good tracks for this game; it is beyond my grasp on how you can go from Rome, Medieval and Shogun 2 to TWW, where no track stands out to me. The trailer music is more memorable, and it's not even in the game.\n\nThe game is, to be quite honest, massive, and there is a bunch of stuff I could mention, such as the map just ending in an ugly, glaringly empty world, or how the game is thoroughly unstable, requiring an SSD to even run at any acceptable rate, but any actual issues, mechanically, visually or gameplay wise, is usually (And sadly) forgiven by the fanbase at large, because no one else delivers the same style of games. The core issue at large, is that even this mediocre experience is consistently knee-capped by Creative Assembly, and their inept QA, stubborn HR, and INFLEXIBLE core team, who think themselves above us mere peasants, who dare play their darlings without their consent (talking about the game is a privilege, not a right).\n\nFor more than a decade, they have been doing the routine \"we messed up; we're sorry, here's some mediocre content (you need to pay for) to make up for it\". It took a youtuber calling them out (and a month's wait time) to resolve basic issues, like the AI sitting on their ass around their castles, not doing anything, whilst some AI's, such as the ogres, Beastmen, Lizardmen and Tomb Kings just decided to stop working. All the while, they want to charge INSANE prices for the same tech tree you burned through before, but this time, the reskinned hero with a different mount and one (1) unique line of powers can do something the other ones in their faction can do, but slightly better! Truly, what would we do without these ground breaking visionaries.\n\nEven with such obvious antagonism, it would be forgivable, if the studio wasn't riding high off their own farts, whilst bullying anyone that steps out of line, to the point of studio whistleblowers having to come out to speak up on how bad the internal state of the studio is, how they actively reuse assets to sell back to the community to keep up their one (1) source of consistent income. They are so reliant on this game's DLC, they (according to rumors) cancelled internal game projects over the failure of Shadows of Change DLC.\n\nTL;DR: Game's mediocre and the studio is cringe.

The locking of an entire game mode behind the purchase of two other full games, the splitting of DLCs into individual Legendary Lords each needing to be purchased independently, and the seemingly complete disregard for a consistent DLC release schedule while ignoring game breaking bugs and code, awful optimization, and what feels like disdain for the very players supporting CA are just the tip of the iceberg of issues I have with Creative Assembly and Warhammer II & III. \n\nAs of writing this and to my current knowledge, two entire factions, not just two lords, but two entire factions are completely broken where they will do absolutely nothing. Lizardmen and Tomb Kings do not survive past turn 20 in every game I've tried to play so far. They don't even attempt to capture a second settlement or recruit units to play defensive. They literally do nothing and then just die. You may think \"Oh well, I don't really care about Tomb Kings or Lizardmen, who cares if they get wiped out? I want to fight against the waves of Chaos from the North/Defend Order and the forces of good against the Chaos invasion\" but for people like me who enjoy playing Lizards, it's not just frustrating, it's infuriating to the Nth degree. You have basically zero possibility of being able to Confederate other Lizard factions. These are the only factions I know of off the top of my head but I do seem to recall others posting about certain Lords, or other factions, specifically Beastmen IIRC, being just as equally broken as Tomb Kings and Lizardmen. These factions have been broken for three updates, at the very least. I can't remember whether TK or Lizards were broken first but the patch that was supposed to fix the first faction that was broken not only didn't fix the faction's AI, it broke the other faction's AI. \n\nCreative Assembly keeps telling us time and time again that they're listening, that they hear our feedback, that they're working on the issues, that if we just give them time, be understanding, and do our part by reporting bugs and problems with details so that they can diagnosis the problem. All of these statements, promises, and outreach attempts are just lies and damage control to pacify those of us who have already sunk hundreds of dollars into three full games and almost two dozen DLCs so that we stick around and get milked for more cash.\n\nSpeak with your wallet, email CA's customer service, mail them a strongly worded letter outlining how they should have the common courtesy to grease you up before absolutely fvcking you into the dirt.
