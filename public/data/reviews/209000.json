      "review": "Hot take incoming, this game has my favourite story in the series thus far, granted this may be due to my bias of early year Batman stories but I love character driven plots and more than the others so far, this one really gives Batman time to shine and grow in this game. Granted this game is very unpolished, I didn't have most of the issues that a lot of people had with the PC port of this game but I was playing with the Community Patch so that's likely why. The game was really fun, had some fun side missions even if a fair lot of them were just copy-pasted from City (as well as a lot of this game) they were great and housed some really good boss fights. Speaking of, yeah the boss fights in this game are absolutely the best in the series so far, these characters got so much love in this game, Deathstroke was such a great first impression on how the bosses would be in this game (not counting Killer Croc as the first boss but he was pretty good for the tutorial). The open world though I probably the least memorable so far due to this game fully taking place in Winter (literally Christmas Eve) and the top half of the map literally being Arkham City's map but covered in snow and not partially submerged. The voice acting of this game is stellar, special Highlights to Batman (Roger Craig Smith), Joker (Troy Baker) and Alfred (Martin Javis) especially with the former two replacing Kevin Conroy as Batman and Mark Hamill as Joker in order to portray younger versions of these characters and they, as mentioned before, killed it in their roles, they need to be cast as those characters more often. Highly recommended but get the Community Patch for it.",

      "review": "Arkham Origins is a very atmospheric game. In fact, it's probably one of the best in the series when it comes to mood and setting. The Christmas theme, the soundtrack, the dialogue, and the overall tone make this entry stand out. It does a great job of portraying an authentic Gotham...quiet and snow-covered, yet crawling with scum and villainy.\r\n\r\nThe story, however, is just fine. It's not terrible, but it's far from impressive. There was a lot of potential with the villains, yet most of it falls short. The writers clearly tried, but the execution doesn't quite land. The only truly memorable sequence is The Joker realizing his connection to Batman. Even then, parts of that scene don't add up and leave the overall narrative feeling confusing and unfinished...\r\n\r\nContent-wise, the game has plenty to do: missions, unlockables, and side activities. The grind is enjoyable thanks to the strong atmosphere and solid gameplay. But a game like this needs a strong story to tie everything together, and Origins doesn's deliver. Many characters are introduced but never given satisfying payoffs. Deathstroke is the clearest example as his boss fight is one of the best in the game, yet afterward he completely disappears, wasted potential at its finest. Batman doesn't build meaningful alliances (aside from Gordon, which isn't much of a spoiler), and relationships between characters feel flat. Everything is acted and voiced well, but it doesn't lead anywhere. It't like a race track with no finish line. Villains show up as obstacles, then vanish without consequence.\r\n\r\nGameplay itself is solid, and the graphics still hold up today. But as a whole, it's hard to recommend. It doesn't feel like a strong entry point into the franchise...more like filler before the real experience begins with Arkham Asylum.\r\n\r\nThat said, if you're a Batman fan, this game will scratch the itch. If you're into the Christmas spirit and moody atmosphere, it's worth playing for that alone.\r\n\r\nOverall, Arkham Origins isn't a bad game.It's just not a complete package. It hits the minimum in every department without ever exceeding it with the exception of the atmosphere where it's the only area where it truly shines.\r\n\r\nScore: 6/10",

      "review": "Despite being the weakest game in the mainline Arkham series (being developed on a rushed timeline; and not being from Rocksteady) this game is still very fun. And if this game is on sale, pick it up.\r\n\r\nThe story is serious enough to be invested in, yet campy enough for batman. Although that cannot be said for the entire story. The music fit the holiday X batman vibes well, with crunchy soundFX to boot. And for being a PS3/360 gen game, the graphics (mostly) hold up well.  Easy to use menus and out of the way hud. Overall presentation of the game is top notch on most regards.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is as good as Arkham City, which is to say excellent. The flowing combat of the Arkham series is without fault, and the minor additions made in this game serve as a substantial building of challenge for new and old players alike. Stealth missions/sequences are just as fun as before; allowing for diverse solutions to enemy AI patterns. Outside of combat, Batman's gadgets are fun to use for puzzle solving throughout the world, and while completing other side-quests.\r\n\r\nThe main faults with this game come in the open-world and the polish. The open world, while the largest in the series at that point, doesn't have a whole lot going on in it. Thankfully fast travel is included, but it doesn't take away the void of meaningful thing to do or see in Arkham. Buildings are routinely lacking textures/details to make one stand out from another; and while landmarks are present, the scale of the world prevents easy memorization of the world unlike previous entries. Lastly, even years later this game still has many bugs/slow downs present. This is most glaring during combat, in which spamming counter is often needed to ensure you don't get hit, taking away from the overall flow of the game. Sometime the game needs to load more of the world, pausing gameplay, just after loading from a fast travel to a location. These issues aren't enough to overcome a largely fun and entertaining game.",

The incredibly easy to get into but difficult to master combat, traversal, boss fights, gadget variety, codex, completely optional paths that you could take \"your\" Batman through, etc made the experience worth.\r\n\r\nI would like to warn the user, though. The port is not perfect.\r\n- There were around 5 crashes that happened till I beat the game (Three of them were on Steam Deck) \r\n- The particle effects caused some lag or stuttering. \r\n- There were plenty of cases of hostile enemies phasing into objects, Batman interrogating the air, etc.\r\n\r\nBut I would still recommend trying it out.",

Even though it wasn’t made by Rocksteady, it captures the same dark tone, fluid combat, and detective atmosphere that makes these games so fun. The early-career version of Batman is great to experience, and the story with Black Mask, Joker, and the assassins gives the game a strong edge. The boss fights are one of the best parts Deathstroke especially stands out. The world feels alive with Gotham’s snowy Christmas setting, and the soundtrack fits perfectly. While the game has a few rough edges and some bugs here and there, it’s still absolutely worth playing for any Batman or action-adventure fan.

O jogo é sensacional e a história, na minha opinião, é melhor que a de Arkham Knight. A jogabilidade também é muito divertida.\nInfelizmente, um dos pontos negativos desse jogo são os bugs. Quando zerei pela primeira vez, aconteceu um bug na boss fight contra o Vagalume, no qual eu não conseguia atacar e os inimigos também não. Quando rejoguei recentemente, tive dois bugs: um deles fazia o botão “Y” do controle não funcionar no jogo. Mas nesses casos eu resolvi fácil, apenas voltando para o checkpoint.\n\nTirando esses detalhes, é um jogo incrível que vale muito a pena comprar. 9,5/10.",

While this prequel isn't topping anyone's 'best of' list, it definitely belongs in the family, and it nails the classic Arkham DNA. Where it genuinely surprised me was the side content. The villain missions here are miles more interesting than in any other game in the series so far.\r\n\r\nThe main story started off strong but seriously lost the plot and just spiraled out. However, you won't have to endure hours of brain-numbing Riddler trophy grind, which is a massive win. It’s got a few nice twists, but nothing special or groundbreaking.

      "review": "SPOILERS AHEAD\r\n\r\nArkham Origins trades the psychological tension of the first two games for a stronger focus on crime and detective work. About half the map is a reworked version of Arkham City, and that’s fine. It’s interesting to see how the city changed between Origins and City.\r\n\r\nThat said, Gotham feels blander without the chaotic gang-controlled zones that gave City its personality. The combat system is nearly identical to the previous entries, smooth, rhythmic, and satisfying, and the post-fight scoreboards are a nice touch.\r\n\r\nBatman’s characterization is one of the game’s biggest strengths. He’s a true loner here, reluctant to accept help but eventually learning to trust. His relationship with Alfred is especially well-written and gives the story some emotional weight.\r\n\r\nWhile some players complained about the Joker returning as the main villain, I think he’s handled well. He’s not the sole focus, and the transitions between him, Penguin, and Bane keep things fresh. Riddler is also well-balanced this time: clever without being unbearable, though his collectibles and challenges are easier than before.\r\n\r\nArkham Origins isn’t a lesser game, just a different one. It’s more grounded, more procedural, and still captures what makes Batman compelling.",

Batman in Origins is young, obessive and aggressive, which personally was a more enjoyable version of Batman to play.\n\nI also liked this game more because of the boss fights. It's not just the Joker, there are other villains like Deathstroke for instance, and the boss fights felt harder as well (not all of them though), which made fighting them rewarding on average.\n\nThe story was very cool. Joker's ascension and Batman's efforts to bring him down reminded me of The Dark Knight film. Side quests had interesting stories as well and they were fun to play too.\n\nGame mechanics wise, it's the same with City. Gadgets are slightly different (most of them are same, a couple are different/new). Graphics wise, this to me was slightly on the lower end, not as good as City's, but it's acceptable.\n\nThis game was quite glitchy and buggy sometimes. E.g., when interacting with a door to enter a room, the sound plays but the animation doesn't work, stopping me from entering the room. I had to exit and start the game again to fix issues like this. Sometimes, restarting a checkpoint fixed it too. There were small bugs like that, which did hinder game-play, but none were game breaking enough to prevent me from finishing the story or mission.\n\nAll in all, great game and worth the play.",

      "review": "First off, I'll say that Arkham Origins is a good game and I agree with everyone who claims it's underrated. But there are definitely caveats to that.\n\nI didn't think much of it when I first played it. It hadn't been all that long since I'd played Arkham City and I think that is something definitely worth noting: it is VERY similar to Arkham City, both in gameplay, and aesthetics (another winter-themed adventure). So playing them back-to-back may not put Origins in the best light.\n\nFunny thing is, I actually think Origins has a better story than City, overall. Black Mask has put out a bounty on the young Batman and assassins from all over have come to collect. There are several twists and turns and mysteries that arise and play out through the course of the game. This is all handled really well and without giving anything away, some interesting and creative choices were made by the writers. There is some really cool introspection and study that happens for more than one of the characters and it's a delight. Not all of the sub-plots were followed through as thoroughly as I excepted or hoped for them to be but for the most part, I greatly enjoyed the narrative.\n\nThe gameplay is mechanically fine, as it continues refining the spectacular formula started in Asylum. Traversal around the city is more or less the same as it was in City and still as enjoyable. But beyond that, this is also where the game falls a bit short compared to the other entries in the series. Other than punching up on bad guys and collecting the obligatory Riddler trophies (presented as \"datapacks,\" this time around), Origins just doesn't put much effort into giving you a whole lot else to do. The Riddler challenges are reduced exclusively to figuring out how to get the datapacks (whether by using some particular gadget, figuring out how to access A by doing something at B, or by performing some feat of finger dexterity)... as well as locating/beating up informants to locate said datapacks. Completely absent are the actual riddles (no looking for scenes in the environment to solve anything) along with the \"assemble the question mark\" challenges. I have always enjoyed both of those better than the trophy collection so I was left feeling very uninspired to engage much with the Riddler side-quest. And I've watched the culmination of the Riddler quest on Youtube and while it is a fun \"wink wink,\" for those who've played the other games, it's nowhere near worth the effort and frustration of what all you have to do to get to it.\n\nThe other side-quests are pretty lackluster as well. At first, I really liked the crime-scene reconstruction feature of Arkham Origins (and I think it is the best realization of Batman being a detective of any of the games) but after doing several of them, they began to feel pretty samey. And as for the rest of the side-quests, they all mostly just boiled down to finding a group of bad guys or a particular assassin and... you guessed it: beating them up. While I do think Arkham City threw way too much at you all at once, to the point where the numerous side-quests started stepping on each other's narrative toes, they were generally much more interesting and had way better overall fan-service. Origins feels pretty small and sparse in comparison.\n\nGraphically the game is actually really impressive (as are all the Arkham games). For a PS3-era game, it looks remarkably good today. There are certainly some mods out there to make it look even better but they honestly don't do a ton and the game looks great even in its vanilla form. \n\nWhile Arkham Origins never quite matches the scale of City or the atmosphere of Asylum, it's still a pretty fun game in and of itself. Very good story and the same fun mechanics you're used to. It's not super long and if you play it with a good buffer from having played any of the other games in the franchise, there is plenty of genuine fun to be had.",

You play a younger and upcoming version of Batman. He isn't as experienced as the Batman in Asylum/City. He is sloppy, angry, fights like a brawler rather than an expert martial artist. This game has some of the best boss fights in the entire franchise. different voice actors this time around, but no drop in performance whatsoever. The open world is a lot more restrictive than Asylum and City. The graphics are not bad but definitely not an upgrade to the previous ones. Since this belongs to a different studio, it is often excluded from the Arkham franchise in articles and store listings. They call it the Arkham trilogy instead of the tetralogy. However, it is still a very good game and serves as the origins story of the Batman and other characters we see in Asylum and City.",

      "review": "Batman: Arkham Origins is a third-person action game developed by WB Games Montréal and released in 2013. It serves as a prequel to Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, focusing on a younger, less-experienced Batman early in his crime-fighting career. While it follows the same core formula as Rocksteady’s titles, it introduces new narrative elements and minor mechanical refinements rather than major innovation.\n\nThe story takes place on Christmas Eve, when the crime lord Black Mask places a bounty on Batman’s head, attracting eight assassins to Gotham City. The narrative explores Batman’s developing relationships with characters like Alfred, Gordon, and the Joker, offering a more personal and formative look at his evolution. The writing is solid, though it lacks the sharp pacing and polish of Rocksteady’s storytelling.\n\nGameplay mirrors the Freeflow combat and stealth systems from Arkham City. Combat is fast, responsive, and fluid, rewarding timing and counterattacks. Predator encounters encourage use of gadgets and silent takedowns. While the mechanics remain satisfying, the game’s main issue lies in its familiarity—it feels more like an expansion of Arkham City than a true evolution.\n\nThe open world is larger than before, spanning both North and South Gotham. However, exploration is less dynamic, with repetitive side activities and limited environmental variety. Fast travel via the Batwing adds convenience but reduces the sense of organic discovery. The game’s structure still benefits from solid mission design and atmospheric cityscapes.\n\nNew elements include the “Crime Scene Reconstruction” mechanic, which uses detective vision to piece together visual holograms of past events. This system adds a welcome investigative layer, making Batman’s role as a detective more tangible. The inclusion of the Shock Gloves also diversifies combat by breaking defenses and increasing combo variety.\n\nVisually, Arkham Origins maintains the series’ dark, detailed aesthetic. Snow-covered streets, neon lights, and festive decor give the world a distinct tone. The sound design and voice acting are strong, with Roger Craig Smith and Troy Baker delivering commendable performances as Batman and Joker, though longtime fans may miss Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill.\n\nIn summary, Batman: Arkham Origins is a competent and engaging entry that delivers familiar mechanics with solid execution. It lacks the innovation and refinement of Rocksteady’s games but succeeds as a character-focused prequel with strong atmosphere and satisfying combat. For players who want more Arkham-style gameplay and a look at Batman’s early years, it remains a worthy—if conservative—addition to the series.",

However, a game that's just good instead of amazing is still worth playing.\n\nHere's the thing: if you go into this expecting a whole new, totally original Arkham game, you'll be disappointed. There are some unique things, but nothing grand. If you come at it with the intent to take it as it is, essentially a DLC that happens to be the length of a full game, then you'll have a decent time. Story is good, it looks fine, $20 isn't a bad price for a 20 hour game, overall it's good. Not a great one, but good.\n\nWhat's extremely unfortunate is that this game's multiplayer, the servers for which were taken down almost 10 years ago now, was what truly set it apart from the other games. If you never got a chance to play, you missed a genuinely fun time. You played as Joker or Bane gang members which you could customize with clothes and weapons, or as Batman and Robin who had to take them out. You really learn what it's like to be an NPC thug when you're minding your business and suddenly Batman swoops down from nowhere, punches your lights out, and grapples away. It's never going to happen, but I genuinely wish they'd bring the servers back. If they did, I'd download this again in an instant. I'd *pay* to get access to multiplayer again.\n\nAnd no, Warner Bros., that is not an invitation to bring it back and charge for it. \n\nUnless...?\n\nAnyway, play it. Especially if it goes on sale. Don't expect it to be on the level of Asylum or City, but as long as you keep that in mind, you'll enjoy it.",

Over the course of 12 years this game had fallen into the most broken state I have ever seen a videogame fall into. Here are the most major bugs / glitches I consistently ran into over the course of a 20 hour playthrough:\n\n- Enemies (mainly during stealth sections) will just teleport wherever they please after the 1st initial body is found. I have almost failed a decent amount of these sections based off this alone.\n- The grappling hook is terribly implemented, whereas in Arkham City or Arkham Asylum, Batman grapples to a point that is in your field of view and the game usually finds the perfect spot for you to grapple. In Origins, any rooftop is free game for the grappling hook. Most times you'll look at a ledge and Batman will grapple the complete opposite direction and not just once, but countless times in a playthrough.\n- Quite possibly the strangest bug I've ever encountered, specifically on contoller opening the menu to do anything (levelling up, opening the map, checking challenges etc etc) has a 75% chance of just black screening your monitor and when it is really bad, crash your game entirely. The only fix I found was to click any button on my keyboard, it fixed this issue maybe 7 times out of 10.\n- The geometry on some props on the ground act as invisible walls so to speak. The most glaring were the rolled up carpets in the Gotham Royal Hotel hallways. You could not jump over them, you could not walk or run over them and in most instances brute forcing it by spam jumping your way into it just didn't work. Happens in the sewers as well. \n- Occasionally the world map would not update my side missions and actually spawn vital NPCs (like the escaped Blackgate prisoners), forcing a restart. Not really sure why this kept happening.\n\nArkham Origins is a fun game but is a colossal failure technical wise. I've heard of major bugs (not even anything listed here) happening for a decade now. No attempt was made to fix any of these glaring issues, showcasing the utter foolishness of WB Games and by extension Rocksteady. Even when you brute force your way through this game like I did, it's barely even worth the pain. Without a doubt one of the worst maintained games of all time, stay cautious if you were to buy.",

      "review": "Batman: Arkham Origins is a fantastic game but in its current state it is utterly unplayable. Over the course of 12 years this game had fallen into the most broken state I have ever seen a videogame fall into. Here are the most major bugs / glitches I consistently ran into over the course of a 20 hour playthrough:\n\n- Enemies (mainly during stealth sections) will just teleport wherever they please after the 1st initial body is found. I have almost failed a decent amount of these sections based off this alone.\n- The grappling hook is terribly implemented, whereas in Arkham City or Arkham Asylum, Batman grapples to a point that is in your field of view and the game usually finds the perfect spot for you to grapple. In Origins, any rooftop is free game for the grappling hook. Most times you'll look at a ledge and Batman will grapple the complete opposite direction and not just once, but countless times in a playthrough.\n- Quite possibly the strangest bug I've ever encountered, specifically on contoller opening the menu to do anything (levelling up, opening the map, checking challenges etc etc) has a 75% chance of just black screening your monitor and when it is really bad, crash your game entirely. The only fix I found was to click any button on my keyboard, it fixed this issue maybe 7 times out of 10.\n- The geometry on some props on the ground act as invisible walls so to speak. The most glaring were the rolled up carpets in the Gotham Royal Hotel hallways. You could not jump over them, you could not walk or run over them and in most instances brute forcing it by spam jumping your way into it just didn't work. Happens in the sewers as well. \n- Occasionally the world map would not update my side missions and actually spawn vital NPCs (like the escaped Blackgate prisoners), forcing a restart. Not really sure why this kept happening.\n\nArkham Origins is a fun game but is a colossal failure technical wise. I've heard of major bugs (not even anything listed here) happening for a decade now. No attempt was made to fix any of these glaring issues, showcasing the utter foolishness of WB Games and by extension Rocksteady. Even when you brute force your way through this game like I did, it's barely even worth the pain. Without a doubt one of the worst maintained games of all time, stay cautious if you were to buy.",

It's combat doesn't always work, and it has some issues with its NPCs getting themselves stuck from time to time, but it's not unplayable. If you play it after playing any of the other games, however, it becomes very clear that it wasn't made by the same developers. It also has the issue of using different voice actors and character modeling to give the impression of youth--this game being a prequel to the Arkham games--however it becomes uncanny with how different some of the characters look or sound. Not like they are younger versions of the ones from Asylum or City, but like this game was created as a fanfiction mod to City. It does, after all, reuse parts of the map of Arkham City. Its story also relies too much on the Joker as the villain, rather than taking this opportunity in Batman's early career to focus on other villains. The combat is also inferior, because the team was entirely different and had to recreate Rocksteady's formula. If it's on sale, why not, but you'd be better off getting any of the other Arkham games and even skipping this one.",
