Everything feels so much more smooth, and i especially love the automatic mode. its honestly a game changer, it makes the whole experience so much more relaxing and satisfying.\n\nI cant recommend it enough if you enjoyed the first game, or if youre just craving something wholesome and relaxing. Its perfect for unwinding after a long day, zoning out with some chill music, or farming with friends while talking nonsense. \n\nI really hope there will be more DLC in the future with cute items and outfits. 🌷",

Out of almost 3000 hours between games, I've never stumbled upon a bug personally.  New content is regularly pushed as free updates and then themed DLCs are released with generally the same things like a new flower, crop, tree, building to build and decor. Absolutely enjoy zoning out or redesigning my farm.",

      "review": "Cute, enjoyable game........................when you don't look at the cost of everything and your harvest.  \nONE apple tree gives ONE apple per season.  Some trees don't produce every season, so you'll get ONE APPLE ONCE PER YEAR!  The regular apple tree will give you 4 apples per year. One horse eats 4 apples per day. Think about that. It takes 4 seasons to get enough apples to feed a horse each day!  So, you do the math. That horse will cost you 22,000 to 84,000 depending upon which horse you buy.   That apple tree will cost you 100 to 13,650 depending upon the type tree.  So, you'll have to plant 4 trees costing 400 to get 4 apples per year to feed one horse per day.  But wait, a season is only (?) 17 minutes long.  So you have to wait 68 minutes to get enough apples to feed one horse per day.  The horses only produce every TWO days though.  You'll get one horseshoe (yes, this game has horses producing horseshoes instead of you producing horseshoes for the horses to wear) and 13,354 - 24,642 money.  You'll be doing a lot of math in this game, so you'll know how much of what crop to plant to feed the amount of animals you have.\n\nThen there's the farmhands. With 25 farmhands, YOU will still be harvesting 75% of the map.  IRL, if my farmhands did only 25% of the work, I'd fire them all!  LOL!  IF you don't pay them, they won't work, too, but who would?  Imagine, 25 people only harvesting 1/4 of the crops while you harvest 3/4!  What owner does that?  They aren't worth having, are they?  They cost one \"medal\" per hour.  For 90 apples and 100 yellow cherry tomatoes you can get 9 medals. Or, for 260 hyacinth beans and 40 coral trout you can get 12 medals. Then, for 90 white sardines you can get 8 medals. Wait, you can get 20 medals for 70 pacific sardinella and 80 girolando cows. That is, harvesting all those items.\n\nThere's more: go to town and see what happens to you and your finances. Upgrading those tiny little shops in that tiny town will cost you millions!  If you want to build a house, it will cost you more than money. You'll have to pay some of it with your crops.  \n\nSorry, but I just can't get past one tree or plant producing one item!  You can see 4 apples falling off the tree when harvested, but you only get ONE apple per tree.  What kind of nonsense is this?  Why do the developers torment the player so badly?  Here's what real life pros say, You can expect an apple tree to yield between 50 to 300 apples per year once it reaches maturity.  Well-maintained mature trees can produce 400 to 800 apples annually under ideal conditions.  But, we only get ONE!  Then, they drive you crazy with seasonal production. You have to figure out which plant/tree/animal produces in which season.  Some produce every fall. Some produce every fall and spring. Some produce summer and winter. Some produce every season, but not many. \n\nJust look at the cost of plants and animals!   One more thing, the devs punish you if you give the fish a good sized pond. To shout animal cruelty, I made 90% of the map FISH, lol.  I never could understand  how people keep a poor little bird in a tiny cage or a poor fish in a tiny bowl. Out in the wild, the birds have the whole sky to fly in and the fish have steams, rivers, lakes and oceans to swim in. \n\nOnce you have  your crops/trees planted, you'll \"enjoy\" long periods of time merely watching the little Jeep (tractor) drive ever so slowly across the map harvesting. Sometimes, I'm so bored that I fall alseep, lol.  I like the building of the farm; the rest is very boring.",
