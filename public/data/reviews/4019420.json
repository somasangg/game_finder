Theres no question that this game is amazing and I'm already obsessed.\nI hope in the full game it allows you to pick between the girl and boy in single player.\nNot to nit-pick but...I do feel like the NPC in singleplayer isnt very immersive. In LN2, six would sometimes react whenever mono died, acting shocked or running away. Or sometimes 'help out', like in the hospital chapter in the X-ray sequence she shows you various toys, I want to see more of that. In REANIMAL the girl just kind of stood there whenever you got snapped in half.\nI also do wish there was the option to hold hands again.\nI feel like this game is gonna be huge.\n\nBut when I found out that Tarsier Studios actually didn’t make it, it was too late. And when I searched for their name on Steam, I found this , and when I installed the demo, from the very first second when the kid wakes up on the boat in the middle of the sea, I felt CHILLS, I SWEAR TO GOD. I felt like my soul came back to me. All that rage and disappointment I had from the so-called LN3 was turned into hope, over-excitement, and happiness. I can’t belieeeevvvve it — I want to scream! Only now I feel like life is fair again.\n\nif your passing by you can pet this cat.\n정말 위대합니다, 선생!!\n内容很新颖 和电影 移动迷宫 很像，demo体量算不错了，\n　　　　 　 　 _ _\n　　　 　　／＞　　フ\n　　　 　　| 　_　 _ l\n　 　　 　／` ミ＿xノ\n　　 　 /　　　 　 |\n　　　 /　 ヽ　　 ﾉ\n　 　 │　　|　|　|\n　／￣|　　 |　|　|\n　| (￣ヽ＿_ヽ_)__)\n　＼二つ",

From the very first minutes, you can feel that silent and unsettling feeling that only games made with soul can convey. The girl with the white mask frightens and fascinates, adorably unsettling, like a lost soul in a distorted world. \nThere are a lot of questions I won’t have answers to until I see the full game, but as soon as I started playing I asked myself some questions, why does the boy have a noose around his neck? How did they end up in this place? Why are there several suitcases on the beach and inside one of them there’s a key? \nCould be a spoiler and maybe, they were looking for something in this place from the very beginning and the suitcases on the beach represent a shipwreck, maybe their ship was sunk by something and the motorboat driven by the boy at the beginning of the demo is the lifeboat, but I’m sure that before how the demo begins, there was another catastrophic event.

All told it's a wonderful demo, however I experienced a pretty terrible lighting/graphical glitch through the experience that looked like bright flashing/glowing orbs along the right side of my screen (ultrawide monitor, perhaps that affected it?) They consistently appeared throughout the entire play whenever a light source was on screen, even after completely closing down the sever and games on both ends and starting up play again. I'm glad I was the one who got this glitch rather than my partner, because they are photosensitive and epileptic. I hope bugs like these are able to be ironed out before the final release, because it's an incredible experience otherwise.",

(I have an NVIDIA RTX 3070, so I should be able to play a 2D game at the highest settings no problem.) This game was developed on Unreal Engine 5, so it's not really their fault, and I'd definitely rather have a poorly-optimized game than no game, but still.\n\nVery cinematic, and the 2.5-D perspective opens up many new puzzle possibilities. I also liked the grotesque monsters and generally disgusting setting (though I couldn't work out how to remove a hat I found in an in-game toilet and so wound up playing most of the game with a pile of intestines on my character's head). I hope Playdead (the studio behind Limbo and Inside) is watching and taking notes for their own third game!",

While i liked the LN III demo and i will probably get the game someday, it didn't really feel like the other ones (much brighter which instantly takes away from the horror atmosphere and tension), probably due to the fact that it wasn't made by Tasier, as they've been developing this one. What can i say, this is only a demo for now too, but i've been extremely hyped for this game ever since it was announced, and this short demo convinced me even more that this is most likely gonna be the best, darkest and most intense out of any Tasier games.

But your game? It turned that joy into a soul-crushing cycle of frustration—all because you decided to reinvent the wheel on a control scheme so basic, it’s been universal since the dawn of 3D gaming.\nFor hours, I died. Over and over and over. Not because the boss was too hard. Not because I lacked skill. Because your game refuses to use Shift for running. Let that sink in. Every single major game—from RPGs to shooters, platformers to open-world epics—has trained players for decades that Shift = sprint. It’s not just a convention; it’s muscle memory. It’s the kind of control that feels as natural as breathing when you’re in the heat of the moment. But you? You thought, “Hey, let’s make players fumble around for 45 minutes straight, dying to enemies they can’t outrun, because we’re edgy or lazy or just don’t care about user experience.”\nI wasn’t just annoyed—I was baffled. How do you mess up something so fundamental? Did none of you test this with actual players? Did you sit in a meeting room and go, “Forget what everyone else does; let’s make running a different key just because we can”? Spoiler: That’s not innovation. That’s arrogance. You’re forcing players to unlearn years of gaming instincts for no good reason, and it ruins the entire opening experience. By the time I finally gave up and searched for a 攻略 (walkthrough)—something I never do unless a game is actively hostile to its players—I was so drained, I almost quit entirely.\nHere’s a newsflash: Good game design isn’t about being “unique” at the cost of usability. It’s about meeting players where they are. It’s about not making them fight the controls while they’re trying to fight the game’s challenges. You want to stand out? Do it with story, with gameplay mechanics, with art—not by breaking a control scheme that’s worked for 20 years.\nTo whoever made this call: I hope you’re proud. You turned a potentially great game into a source of frustration, all because you thought your “creative vision” was more important than player comfort. Next time, maybe ask yourself: Is making players Google basic controls really the first impression you want to leave? Spoiler two: It’s not.",

This means nearly an hour has to be redone. It's not hard, and it's not a lot of progress, but it also shouldn't be an issue in the first place.\n\nThe controller also has a tendency to just stop working in the menu. Both my partner and I had to immediately reboot the game, as the menu instantly stopped working with controller. After managing to get Remote Play to work, there were more issues. The controller problem carried over into the game, so I had to reboot another time and try to get things to work all over again. When we got that working, characters kept switching at random. This is a real problem when you're being chased, since you start running into a wall and find yourself stuck.\n\nThe game is gorgeous, and plays exactly as you'd expect if you enjoyed LIttle Nightmares. But it borders on unplayable right now. I guess most people aren't having this issue, but that's really bad. This demo has been out for days, but what is essentially the first level is unpassable. \n\nAs for optimization, it runs well enough, but it does stutter everytime a new zone loads.

But your game? It turned that joy into a soul-crushing cycle of frustration—all because you decided to reinvent the wheel on a control scheme so basic, it’s been universal since the dawn of 3D gaming.\nFor hours, I died. Over and over and over. Not because the boss was too hard. Not because I lacked skill. Because your game refuses to use Shift for running. Let that sink in. Every single major game—from RPGs to shooters, platformers to open-world epics—has trained players for decades that Shift = sprint. It’s not just a convention; it’s muscle memory. It’s the kind of control that feels as natural as breathing when you’re in the heat of the moment. But you? You thought, “Hey, let’s make players fumble around for 45 minutes straight, dying to enemies they can’t outrun, because we’re edgy or lazy or just don’t care about user experience.”\nI wasn’t just annoyed—I was baffled. How do you mess up something so fundamental? Did none of you test this with actual players? Did you sit in a meeting room and go, “Forget what everyone else does; let’s make running a different key just because we can”? Spoiler: That’s not innovation. That’s arrogance. You’re forcing players to unlearn years of gaming instincts for no good reason, and it ruins the entire opening experience. By the time I finally gave up and searched for a 攻略 (walkthrough)—something I never do unless a game is actively hostile to its players—I was so drained, I almost quit entirely.\nHere’s a newsflash: Good game design isn’t about being “unique” at the cost of usability. It’s about meeting players where they are. It’s about not making them fight the controls while they’re trying to fight the game’s challenges. You want to stand out? Do it with story, with gameplay mechanics, with art—not by breaking a control scheme that’s worked for 20 years.\nTo whoever made this call: I hope you’re proud. You turned a potentially great game into a source of frustration, all because you thought your “creative vision” was more important than player comfort. Next time, maybe ask yourself: Is making players Google basic controls really the first impression you want to leave? Spoiler two: It’s not.",

This means nearly an hour has to be redone. It's not hard, and it's not a lot of progress, but it also shouldn't be an issue in the first place.\n\nThe controller also has a tendency to just stop working in the menu. Both my partner and I had to immediately reboot the game, as the menu instantly stopped working with controller. After managing to get Remote Play to work, there were more issues. The controller problem carried over into the game, so I had to reboot another time and try to get things to work all over again. When we got that working, characters kept switching at random. This is a real problem when you're being chased, since you start running into a wall and find yourself stuck.\n\nThe game is gorgeous, and plays exactly as you'd expect if you enjoyed LIttle Nightmares. But it borders on unplayable right now. I guess most people aren't having this issue, but that's really bad. This demo has been out for days, but what is essentially the first level is unpassable. \n\nAs for optimization, it runs well enough, but it does stutter everytime a new zone loads.

The feel and mood of Little Nightmares is really back, and I'm so glad about it.\nThat said, I'm writing a negative review to address the ONLY little issue i found while playing the demo and to make it stand out, hoping it will be solved in the final release, spoiler ahead :D\nDuring the last chase of the demo, after getting out of the train, i found it impossible to get up those stairs, the monster kept grabbing me, I tried a lot, really, but I think that time frame just has to be a little more wide, I had to see how the demo ended on a youtube video. Apart from that, I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY THIS :D",

      "review": "Let me start by saying this: I love games. I live for the thrill of exploration, the satisfaction of overcoming challenges, and the immersion of stepping into new worlds. But your game? It turned that joy into a soul-crushing cycle of frustration—all because you decided to reinvent the wheel on a control scheme so basic, it’s been universal since the dawn of 3D gaming.\nFor hours, I died. Over and over and over. Not because the boss was too hard. Not because I lacked skill. Because your game refuses to use Shift for running. Let that sink in. Every single major game—from RPGs to shooters, platformers to open-world epics—has trained players for decades that Shift = sprint. It’s not just a convention; it’s muscle memory. It’s the kind of control that feels as natural as breathing when you’re in the heat of the moment. But you? You thought, “Hey, let’s make players fumble around for 45 minutes straight, dying to enemies they can’t outrun, because we’re edgy or lazy or just don’t care about user experience.”\nI wasn’t just annoyed—I was baffled. How do you mess up something so fundamental? Did none of you test this with actual players? Did you sit in a meeting room and go, “Forget what everyone else does; let’s make running a different key just because we can”? Spoiler: That’s not innovation. That’s arrogance. You’re forcing players to unlearn years of gaming instincts for no good reason, and it ruins the entire opening experience. By the time I finally gave up and searched for a 攻略 (walkthrough)—something I never do unless a game is actively hostile to its players—I was so drained, I almost quit entirely.\nHere’s a newsflash: Good game design isn’t about being “unique” at the cost of usability. It’s about meeting players where they are. It’s about not making them fight the controls while they’re trying to fight the game’s challenges. You want to stand out? Do it with story, with gameplay mechanics, with art—not by breaking a control scheme that’s worked for 20 years.\nTo whoever made this call: I hope you’re proud. You turned a potentially great game into a source of frustration, all because you thought your “creative vision” was more important than player comfort. Next time, maybe ask yourself: Is making players Google basic controls really the first impression you want to leave? Spoiler two: It’s not.",

Hopefully I wrong and Tarsier fully commits to something truly scary and diferent this time but their previous games were more about the stopmotion feel than anything else. Think of it like Tim Burton movies but without the charismatic characters. I can see how people might like the atmosphere but I personally think that something like Tool music videos are way more eerie and unique than these games, for example.",

      "review": "I'm genuinely baffled this has overwhelmingly positive. It's nearly unplayable for my partner and I. Maybe it's just bad luck, but the level involving a minecart entirely breaks the game. I desync entirely on the same staircase and there is no fixing it. Rebooting fixes until the moment I reach that same staircase, then it breaks. Easily replicated and without falter. This wouldn't be an issue if progress was saved between players, but it's not. This means nearly an hour has to be redone. It's not hard, and it's not a lot of progress, but it also shouldn't be an issue in the first place.\n\nThe controller also has a tendency to just stop working in the menu. Both my partner and I had to immediately reboot the game, as the menu instantly stopped working with controller. After managing to get Remote Play to work, there were more issues. The controller problem carried over into the game, so I had to reboot another time and try to get things to work all over again. When we got that working, characters kept switching at random. This is a real problem when you're being chased, since you start running into a wall and find yourself stuck.\n\nThe game is gorgeous, and plays exactly as you'd expect if you enjoyed LIttle Nightmares. But it borders on unplayable right now. I guess most people aren't having this issue, but that's really bad. This demo has been out for days, but what is essentially the first level is unpassable. \n\nAs for optimization, it runs well enough, but it does stutter everytime a new zone loads. Stairs, doors, everything. This is just not in a good place if you're seemingly unlucky. It was such a headache to play this incredibly short demo with my wife, and very much sucked the fun out of the experience.",
