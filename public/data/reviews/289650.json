      "review": "[h1]Assassin’s Creed Unity Review[/h1]\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Overview[/h1]\nUnity had a rough launch, but today it stands out as one of the most memorable AC entries. Paris looks gorgeous, crowds are insanely dense for its time, parkour finally feels smooth and flowy, and the co-op missions are still a blast. It is not perfect, yet it is a very good, very replayable Assassin’s Creed.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Story Overview[/h1]\nYou play Arno Dorian in Paris during the French Revolution. A personal loss puts him on an Assassin path that collides with Templar plots and shifting loyalties, with Elise at the center of it. It is a grounded, city-focused tale that fits the period and keeps momentum through the main sequence.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]World and Atmosphere[/h1]\nParis is big, dense, and beautiful. Landmarks, districts, interiors, rooftops, and crowded streets all feel alive. The architecture is the star. There are tons of viewpoints and side activities, plus a separate map if you own the Dead Kings DLC that takes you to Franciade. I loved just roaming and taking in the city.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Parkour and Traversal[/h1]\nBest classic AC parkour in the series for me. Up and Down inputs make climbing and controlled descent click. Movement has a good pace and becomes buttery once you get the rhythm. Free-running across balconies, windows, and spires is consistently satisfying.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Combat and Tools[/h1]\nCombat is simple but serviceable. Parries, ripostes, pistols, smoke, berserk blades, and bombs give enough options to keep encounters engaging. Stealth feels solid with crowd blending and line-of-sight breaks, especially in co-op where planning actually matters.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Co-op[/h1]\nThe co-op missions are the highlight. Sneaking with friends, syncing takedowns, or improvising when things go loud is still great. Netcode held up fine for me and matchmaking can still find partners at peak times. If you want a social AC experience, Unity does it best.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Collectibles and Side Stuff[/h1]\nThere is a mountain of collectibles. Some are neat like murder mysteries and Paris Stories. Others, like hundreds of chests and cockades, are pure checklist. If you chase 100 percent, expect a long grind opening every last chest.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Performance and Stability[/h1]\nOn modern hardware the game runs well and I hit no crashes. Crowds and interiors are still impressive. Your mileage may vary on older rigs, but the infamous launch wobble is not what you get today.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]What Works[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Stunning Paris with dense crowds and lots of interiors\n[*] Flowing parkour that finally feels great up and down\n[*] Co-op missions that are genuinely fun and replayable\n[*] Solid stealth tools and infiltration setups\n[*] Period vibe and architecture that still hold up visually\n[/list]\n\n[hr]\n[h1]What Falls Short[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Collectible spam, especially the chest achievement grind\n[*] Gear economy and Helix store items make progression feel a bit grindy if you avoid the store\n[*] AI can be inconsistent and sometimes goofy\n[*] Occasional traversal hiccups where Arno sticks to the wrong ledge\n[/list]\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nBig thumbs up. If you can live with the collectible bloat and some AI quirks, Unity gives you a gorgeous Paris, excellent parkour, and the best co-op the series has seen. For fans of city-centric AC with strong stealth infiltration, this is still absolutely worth playing.",

      "review": "AC Unity development started in 2011 after AC Revelations was released and was launched in 2014 (one of the longest developments ubisoft had for an AC game).\n\nTo be honest, I think that this game is very underestimated, It had a very \"problematic\" launch, of course, and it still has some bugs (I've encountered just one that really pissed me off, the others are like NPCs flickering, some standing side by side with the same clothes and weird object physics like the torches and flags they're waving), but you can see that Ubisoft really tried to make a dynamic and living world for the game, each part of Paris is very detailed and polished, and loads of buildings you can actually get inside. \n\nThe parkour and combat gameplay are by far the best in the series and some side missions like those where you have to solve a murder are really interesting; but as with almost all other AC games, it starts to get a bit repetitive and boring at some point. \n\nThe worst aspects for me are the soundtrack (jesus... that's such a downgrade compared to AC2 and AC Black Flag) and the main story; the characters have an arrogant aura (maybe because they're french lol) with some \"cliche\" dialogues, like if they're always trying to sound like a badass, especially Elise (oh god, how glad I was when I saw her dying at the end... don't mind the spoiler, the story's bad anyway).\n\nthat was a good experience overall, not the best AC game but it's far from being the worst (shout-out to all the post-2017 AC games, they're really good at being bad).",

Syndicate had cool ideas that were never truly fleshed out and the tone that we ended up with didn't fit Victorian London & the rest of the games up to Shadows haven't felt like assassins creed games, besides Mirage which I didn't like. Overall the best parkour in the franchise and a huge step up from the previous game Black flag & Rogue, even though those were great games. After playing the new games and coming back to Unity I realize how much we were spoiled and of a staple this is in the series and even if you're someone who doesn't invest themselves in Assassins creed much, I'm sure you've stilled played this game and probably for a good chunk of hours.",

It’s one of those “old-school” Assassin’s Creed titles, and everyone always talks about how fluid the parkour system was supposed to be.\r\n\r\nThe truth is the story feels pretty cliché, and by the end it almost seems like they rushed it just to wrap things up. The parkour isn’t quite as smooth as we imagine it, Arno constantly tries to climb on things when you don’t want him to, which can get frustrating fast. Enemy AI is annoying too, getting detected almost instantly forces you into open combat, which kind of breaks the stealth vibe that older AC games used to nail.\r\nCo-op is nice and surprisingly in 2025 you can still find people playing online.\r\n\r\nIn the end, it’s still an Assassin’s Creed game through and through. Not the best, but not the worst. It’s flawed, but there’s a certain charm in coming back to it years later, a reminder of a time when Ubisoft was still experimenting and trying new ideas in the old formula, even if they didn’t all work perfectly.",

      "review": "[h1]Assassin’s Creed Unity[/h1]\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/289650\n\n[hr]\n\n[h2]🗡️ Introduction[/h2]\n[i]Assassin’s Creed Unity[/i] remains one of the most controversial entries in Ubisoft’s long-running series a title born from ambition, yet scarred by its troubled launch. A decade later, in 2025, the game has aged remarkably well. What was once dismissed for its instability now stands as one of the franchise’s most beautiful and mechanically refined experiences.\n\n[hr]\n\n[h2]🏰 Setting – [b]90/100[/b][/h2]\nRevolutionary Paris is recreated with astonishing detail. The scale of its architecture, the density of its crowds, and the texture of its atmosphere make it one of the most immersive historical cities ever built in gaming. From Notre-Dame’s spires to the cobblestones of Le Marais, the world feels alive, monumental, and deeply evocative of the era.\n\n[hr]\n\n[h2]🧭 Exploration & World Design – [b]90/100[/b][/h2]\nExploration is elegant and rewarding. Parkour has never felt so fluid, with improved verticality and precision that elevate free-running to an art form. Collectibles and side missions blend naturally into the setting, creating a sense of living history rather than checklist design. Unity captures the feeling of inhabiting a revolutionary city in motion.\n\n[hr]\n\n[h2]⚔️ Combat & Gameplay – [b]85/100[/b][/h2]\nUnity introduced a combat system grounded in timing and precision rather than button mashing. It’s one of the most satisfying in the series, offering weight, risk, and depth. However, the inclusion of light RPG mechanics skill trees, gear levels, and progression feels somewhat misplaced in the classic Assassin’s Creed formula. Fortunately, these elements remain peripheral, leaving the core stealth-action identity intact.\n\n[hr]\n\n[h2]📜 Story & Characters – [b]65/100[/b][/h2]\nNarratively, Unity struggles to find its voice. Arno Dorian’s story lacks cohesion, and his arc feels truncated a faint echo of the elegance that once defined Ezio Auditore. The political backdrop of the French Revolution offers enormous potential, but the narrative rarely capitalizes on it. Supporting characters come and go without development, leaving the story emotionally hollow despite its promising premise.\n\n[hr]\n\n[h2]⚙️ Performance & Technical Quality – [b]90/100[/b][/h2]\nAt launch, Unity was synonymous with instability. Today, after years of patches and hardware improvements, it performs admirably. Frame rates are smooth, textures crisp, and glitches largely extinct. It’s a testament to how post-launch support and time can redeem even the most maligned releases. The game now runs as it was always meant to stunningly and reliably.\n\n[hr]\n\n[h2]🎯 Final Verdict[/h2]\n[i]Assassin’s Creed Unity[/i] is a story of redemption. Beneath its rocky history lies a deeply ambitious game that pushed the boundaries of world design and realism. Paris remains one of the most breathtaking locations ever created in the series, and its refined parkour and combat mechanics still stand out today.\n\nWhile its narrative falters, Unity deserves recognition as a bold, forward-looking chapter in Assassin’s Creed’s evolution flawed, yes, but undeniably visionary.\n\n[hr]\n\n[h2]🏆 Final Scores[/h2]\n• [b]Setting:[/b] 90/100\n• [b]Exploration & World Design:[/b] 90/100\n• [b]Combat & Gameplay:[/b] 85/100\n• [b]Story & Characters:[/b] 65/100\n• [b]Performance & Technical Quality:[/b] 90/100\n\n[b]⚖️ Overall Score: 81/100[/b]\n[i]A beautifully crafted and mechanically rich Assassin’s Creed, burdened by a shallow narrative but redeemed by its artistry and ambition.[/i]",

No matter what you try, adjust, or even concoct out of pure desperation, the game freezes at random intervals and often locks up the entire PC. This issue clearly has nothing to do with hardware.\r\n\r\nI am running a high-end gaming PC, yet the experience remains a constant barrage of stutters and full system freezes. It turns what should be an immersive adventure into an exercise in frustration, and at times it becomes nearly unplayable.",

      "review": "This is a guilty pleasure, a mediocre, almost bad game, I enjoy. The visuals are staggering, the audio is overall well done, parkour animations look beautiful and, when the game works, mainly on the free from main missions, this game is fun. Sadly, that's where the positives end.\n\nThe French Revolution is completely sidelined for the love story, which is also underdeveloped and gets its footing 2/3 of the game. Characters barely have anything to say or do in the plot, with Arno losing any resemblance of personality after he wears the hood. The two main parent figure die one after the other, to the point that both lose their meaning after they pass.\n\nBut again, this game has wasted potential that only mods that try to fix the game will show you. The controls are a bit unreliable and there's input delay/dropping, which makes movement inconsistent. Stealth is broken, with enemies either being too stupid to react on time, going straight into a danger zone, or pinpoint accuracy on where you are exactly (even when they aren't seeing you). That last point is mainly for enemies that react to you being seen by others, so they feel unpolished.\n\nLots of side missions are too simple/shallow (kill this one soldier, get this item) with no presentation or narrative hook to boost them. Literally any other RPG AC game, or even AC3, have better side content than this. The investigations are really good, though. Those are fun palette cleansers.\n\nCrowds appear and disappear like liquid, with little to no way of influencing them. You can't whistle to lure enemies, you can't move bodies, item refiling becomes tedious by the end, the endgame gear is too expensive to the point it incentivizes grinding coop missions, combat feels floaty and weigthless, and much more. I could go on. \n\nAgain, this is a guilty pleasure, an ideal AC game that looks cool on YouTube, but feels too unpolished to play. Maybe when mods get better, this could be a fun game to revisit, but mods don't make a game good, and AC deserves better games than this. Buy it for the mods and the pretty visuals. Or better yet, try other AC titles (like AC2, Black Flag, Origins or Odyssey) and skip this one. If you miss this gameplay style, then try Syndicate.",

If you play this on Windows 11 your entire PC will freeze. Not just the game. There's no alt+F4, no alt tab, no ctrl + shift + escape to open task manager. The entire pc bricks and you have to hold the power button to power it down, and power it back on. \r\nAt the time of writing I found no fix for this and many others are just left in the dust. Ubisoft being who they are will probably never patch this so this game is just going to remain unplayable for those with newer hardware/any hardware running Windows 11. Windows 10, and Linux users, are able to experience this without a hitch as far as I'm aware. And I do again need to praise the Steam Deck for actually running this game phenomenally well the whole way through.

But, I cant recommend this game to even my worst enemy because Its STILL plagued with glitches. Bruh Its 2025 and you're telling me you cant roll out a patch fixing all these random glitches? In 2025 there should be no reason why Arno randomly does the mannequin challenge during the middle of a mission or why the game randomly decides to freeze during the middle of an intense fight.

But also deciding that every game after this game would force you to level up like an rpg just to be able to assassinate the basic enemies.

      "review": "Firstly, let’s spend a little time talking about what is good about the game. Unity takes place during the French Revolution, and it’s an amazing world to explore. The amount of NPC’s in the city is impressive, and I enjoyed that it’s not just for show. A feature of the gameplay is to take advantage of the stealth mechanics, by quietly moving through crowded areas without being seen, or causing chaos by throwing money on the ground for the NPC's to clamour over.\n\nThe controls for the combat are fun and quite fluid. It took a little while to get used to the sword fighting, but parrying and dodging is satisfying when you pull it off.\n\nNow for the frustrating part.\n\nThe controls for freerunning can be downright awful. This works so well in Syndicate, so I had expected it to be “more or less” the same in the previous game, not “much less.” There are buttons to climb up or drop down while in freerun mode, but even if I don’t press them the game will insist on jumping and grabbing hold of walls and surfaces, just because I’m “kind of near them.”\n\nIf I’m running along a field, why in the world would I want to suddenly jump up onto a clothesline instead of continuing to run underneath the middle of it? If I’m running from enemies, why would I want to magnetically attach myself to a nearby chair and come to a complete stop?\n\nFor whatever reason, this was particularly challenging in Sequence 11 Memory 2. Perhaps revolutionary France was experiencing a magnetic anomaly which caused Assassins to stick to nearby objects, and made the camera swing wildly with only a small movement of the analog stick.\n\nAnd trying to climb? If you’ve come from the pretty decent experience of Syndicate to this, you’d think Arno gets stage fright and performance anxiety as he just decides not to climb up. You need to repeatedly press and depress the up and jump buttons while shifting left or right, trying to find the magic combination to coax and encourage him to climb the very obvious path upwards.\n\nThe crouch mechanic also seems to introduce a certain jankiness to Arno’s movements, and the camera isn’t always as free as it should be. Often it gets stuck focussing on nothing in particular. This is especially noticeable when crouching in stealth mode. \n\nThe game also suffers freezing. Sometimes during gameplay, but also not-at-all-ironically during the Ubisoft logo video when launching the game. They wanted you to know right away what kind of experience you were in for.\n\nIf you want everything that’s good about Unity, but without the annoying controls, and the game freezing, then go play Syndicate instead. I think the only reason to play Unity is if you want an assassination game specifically set during the French Revolution. I bought it because I wanted to chase the feeling I got from Syndicate. Unfortunately having to fight with the controls made it very difficult to enjoy.",

Not even external Vsync fixes this. Off works fine (but hey, screen tearing!)\n- Showstopping hard-freezes that require full PC reboot to fix. These seem to happen randomly at specific points (right after the assassination cutscenes).\n \nAnd after you power through all that and set to basically ultra settings, you get...a plasticky graphical look. The assets are higher polycount, but the lesser texture/LOD work just makes this look worse than Black Flag did, despite being a newer gen game.\n \n \n[strike]I'll still try powering through the rest of the game, but the crashes already makes this a no-rec from me,so...[/strike]\n \n \nEdit: Powered through, but uh....seems disabling fullscreen optimizations on the main exe might fix all the crashes.

Out of all the people employed by Ubisoft no one ever said \"Hey...:?\nTower sync takes too long. Massive zoom out then pans around forever to show you what? A bunch of boring ass building that the textures haven't loaded for? \nWit this being the eighth entry into the series that they would have the parkour ironed out but nope.\nCan't reach some ledges even tough I just reached a ledge the same height of a different building but it's because there is a specific way to get up there. okay...\nGlitching all over the place when climbing.\nCan't go down a simple ladder. Just keep hoping over the hole. Not frustrating at all.\nIS there an AC game that isn't broken at this point?",

      "review": "This is a guilty pleasure, a mediocre, almost bad game, I enjoy. The visuals are staggering, the audio is overall well done, parkour animations look beautiful and, when the game works, mainly on the free from main missions, this game is fun. Sadly, that's where the positives end.\n\nThe French Revolution is completely sidelined for the love story, which is also underdeveloped and gets its footing 2/3 of the game. Characters barely have anything to say or do in the plot, with Arno losing any resemblance of personality after he wears the hood. The two main parent figure die one after the other, to the point that both lose their meaning after they pass.\n\nBut again, this game has wasted potential that only mods that try to fix the game will show you. The controls are a bit unreliable and there's input delay/dropping, which makes movement inconsistent. Stealth is broken, with enemies either being too stupid to react on time, going straight into a danger zone, or pinpoint accuracy on where you are exactly (even when they aren't seeing you). That last point is mainly for enemies that react to you being seen by others, so they feel unpolished.\n\nLots of side missions are too simple/shallow (kill this one soldier, get this item) with no presentation or narrative hook to boost them. Literally any other RPG AC game, or even AC3, have better side content than this. The investigations are really good, though. Those are fun palette cleansers.\n\nCrowds appear and disappear like liquid, with little to no way of influencing them. You can't whistle to lure enemies, you can't move bodies, item refiling becomes tedious by the end, the endgame gear is too expensive to the point it incentivizes grinding coop missions, combat feels floaty and weigthless, and much more. I could go on. \n\nAgain, this is a guilty pleasure, an ideal AC game that looks cool on YouTube, but feels too unpolished to play. Maybe when mods get better, this could be a fun game to revisit, but mods don't make a game good, and AC deserves better games than this. Buy it for the mods and the pretty visuals. Or better yet, try other AC titles (like AC2, Black Flag, Origins or Odyssey) and skip this one. If you miss this gameplay style, then try Syndicate.",

I'm not usually the type to tear something down so ruthlessly, but I got maybe a dozen hours in and uninstalled.",
