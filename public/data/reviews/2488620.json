For me, the revamped Driver Career mode is the heart of this. I found myself plunged into the role of a driver managing not just on-track rivalries but also secret contract negotiations and a specialist R&D team, which makes car development a critical long-term strategy. This depth extends right onto the track, where I learned my success hinges on more than just the racing line; I have to actively manage the new ERS modes and a more comprehensive tire wear model, turning each Grand Prix into a dynamic puzzle of resource management. The game perfectly strikes that difficult-to-achieve balance between arcade and realism. While I know some sim racers find the new Dynamic Handling a bit forgiving, I found this accessibility is precisely what makes the game so enjoyable.

Fast corners especially feel very weird, and instead of learning the car, I always felt like I was just trying to survive it.\n\nPhysics feel inconsistent.\nTyre wear, traction, even aerodynamics — none of it seems to behave logically. One lap I feel planted, the next I'm sliding everywhere, even when I drove the same way. It made me feel like I wasn’t racing, but gambling.\n\nAI behavior is erratic.\nSometimes too aggressive, punting me off in corners, other times so slow it felt like easy mode. Probably the worst AI I have ever seen in an F1 game.\n\nThe game's just rushed and shallow. \nI haven't played F1 23, but compared to other ones (2018, 2019, 2022), there weren’t any big new features — just changes to handling and physics that honestly made the game worse. It didn’t feel like a full new release, more like an experimental patch that got sold as a full game.\n\nHowever, it does looks amazing.\n The cars and tracks are gorgeous, and the replays make it feel like you’re watching a real F1 broadcast. Sometimes I’d finish a race, watch the highlights, and think “wow, this game is stunning”… before remembering how awful the handling felt getting there.\n\nI should've waited for F1 25\n4/10",

It was ok when it was released in 2024 but now you should just get the newer ones and not waste time on this one. The only reason I'd tell you to get this game is to play as Ricciardo </3 he is the only reason you should get this game, if you want the game for gameplay or whatever, dont get it, go for the newer F1 game. You can still have lots of fun tho and its not bad by any means.\n\n7/10",

Game-play wise this is decent game but you complete a race and boom the game crashes when loading the results. Your whole progress of that race is gone ! Its frustrating, that's why I stopped playing only after couple of races, get F1 2025 which is better than this in every aspect like game-play wise, controls wise everything is better in that game and don't crashes that much.",

Fast corners especially feel very weird, and instead of learning the car, I always felt like I was just trying to survive it.\n\nPhysics feel inconsistent.\nTyre wear, traction, even aerodynamics — none of it seems to behave logically. One lap I feel planted, the next I'm sliding everywhere, even when I drove the same way. It made me feel like I wasn’t racing, but gambling.\n\nAI behavior is erratic.\nSometimes too aggressive, punting me off in corners, other times so slow it felt like easy mode. Probably the worst AI I have ever seen in an F1 game.\n\nThe game's just rushed and shallow. \nI haven't played F1 23, but compared to other ones (2018, 2019, 2022), there weren’t any big new features — just changes to handling and physics that honestly made the game worse. It didn’t feel like a full new release, more like an experimental patch that got sold as a full game.\n\nHowever, it does looks amazing.\n The cars and tracks are gorgeous, and the replays make it feel like you’re watching a real F1 broadcast. Sometimes I’d finish a race, watch the highlights, and think “wow, this game is stunning”… before remembering how awful the handling felt getting there.\n\nI should've waited for F1 25\n4/10",

F1 22 had a shockingly bad handling model but with custom setups and even adjusting my own driving style I could find some rhythm, not bad but not good either. F1 23 was a good step in the right direction as the cars felt less prone to spinning and so I could find a rhythm, so moving in the right direction. Now, F1 24 is the most arcade feeling F1 game ever, I use a wheel and have absolutely no idea what the car is doing, in situations where the car feels like its spinning, the game will correct the car and straighten it up causing me to over react and turn into a wall, i've spent enough time in the game now to realise it's not my driving (107% AI on F1 23) and it must be the game.\r\n\r\nWould only recommend for controller players, I hear the handling is good for it.",

It's like I was back in F1 22 (probably the worst physics in the series). The car is constantly on the edge. The slightest movement of the gas pedal sends car into a spin.
