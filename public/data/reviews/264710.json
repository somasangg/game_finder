I went into this game completely blind with no spoilers so as the game went on I just kept getting more and more impressed. Originally I thought this was just an underwater survival game and then it became a full on story rich experience. If you had told me at the start of this game that at the end [spoiler] you were actually on a quarantined planet that used to be run by aliens who are 10x smarter then us who were also working on a Leviathan class prototype that can speak [/spoiler] I would think you were crazy. Game play in general was also super fun, I love the physics of the game and all the different vehicles you can use through your play through. The sea creature designs were also super creative and you can tell each of them a part pretty easily. The fear factor of this game was off the charts, I'm already scared of the ocean and this game honestly made it worse, ESPECIALLY because of the Leviathans. I would highly recommend this game if you haven't been able to tell already, there are many things to do even after you've beaten the game, the game isn't super hard to 100% and it's just an overall very fun game to play.",

There are some quirks with the creatures’ pathfinding AI, and there are a handful of graphics glitches, with the environment rendering in too slowly or sometimes not at all. It doesn’t happen often, but it does pull you out of the immersion a little. Other than that, this game is definitely one of, if not the most, memorable underwater games I have played. Definitely my favorite game.",

      "review": "Oh well, where do I even start?\nThis game is actually one of a kind. Usually in survival games you conquer, you tame, you kill. Subnautica offers you a possibility of learning to love planet 4546B. You experience the unknown (which is scary), you learn how to coexist with your new neighbours, you learn about the planet. Views are mesmerizing, some creatures are scary, some are like puppies, some are beautiful. \nWith all that said there is also a point of critique, but it doesn't change the experience - play it for sure.\nHowever there is some bugs. You build your habitat and fishes bug through the wall and swim in your base. Sea dragon swims through walls. Also my Sea Emperor got stuck and the game just skipped a sequence for me. [spoiler]Sea Emperor just died off screen because of it and her children didn't go through portal, because they couldn't hug her?????[/spoiler]\nI really appreciate that Subnautica doesn't force you to any special tempo, your character doesn't talk so you get immersed in the world - you play on your own, you discover on your own, you learn to swim deeper and deeper on your own. However it could guide a bit more, which makes it a tiny bit frustrating - had to google some things to progress. You can literally never go to some of the regions, because you don't need them to progress and game doesn't guide you to them. \nAlso from getting your first prawn suit, nothing is scary anymore, beacuse you can survive literally anything, which is too op. I wish it was balanced better. \nAchievements are really easy, you do them while progressing with the game and they actually help you to progress in the game - you can always check it and get an info what to do now. However I feel like there has been wasted opportunity for some achievements - for example scanning achievements. Maybe something like \"scan ghost leviathan\" or \"scan Sea Dragon\". This kind of achievements would be thrilling, scary, a bit more difficult but also fun.\nAlso the equipment in PDA could be done a bit better. For me even one more slot for fast changing could be enough. \nNontheless with all of the downsides, this game is absolutely a must play and worth it for sure. \nIf you doubt yourself - should I buy it? The answer is yes. Just buy it and play it. Experience it for youself.",

      "review": "Subnautica A Deep Dive into Atmosphere and Tension\r\n\r\nSubnautica is one of those rare survival games that doesn’t just drop you into a world—it swallows you whole. From the moment your escape pod hits the ocean, the game establishes an atmosphere that’s as breathtaking as it is unnerving. The alien sea is vibrant, beautiful, and constantly alive, creating a sense of immersion that few games can match. Every biome feels distinct, from the serene shallows with their pastel corals to the pitch-black depths where your lights barely cut through the water and every sound makes you tense up.\r\n\r\nWhat truly defines Subnautica is its ability to balance wonder with dread. Exploration is always rewarding, but never comfortable. You’re constantly aware of your dwindling oxygen, the unfamiliar noises echoing in the dark, and the lurking threats that could emerge from the shadows at any moment. This creates a persistent tension—even routine resource gathering can spark a spike of adrenaline.\r\n\r\nThe game’s progression feels natural and satisfying. As you expand your base, craft new tools, and build vehicles, the world opens up in meaningful ways, allowing you to push deeper into the ocean’s mysteries. But even with better equipment, the sense of vulnerability never fully disappears—and that’s a good thing. It keeps the experience grounded and gripping.\r\n\r\nOverall, Subnautica is a masterclass in atmosphere-driven gameplay. Its combination of immersive worldbuilding, tense exploration, and organic storytelling makes it an unforgettable journey beneath the waves. Whether you’re drawn in by the beauty of the ocean or the thrill of surviving its dangers, Subnautica delivers a uniquely compelling experience.\r\n\r\nRating 4/5",

The game’s atmosphere is unmatched as quiet, alien, and profoundly lonely in a way that feels both comforting and unsettling. The deep ocean becomes a character in itself, and every descent into the darker biomes carries that perfect blend of awe and tension that few games ever reach.\n\nThe creature design is extraordinary. Everything feels biologically plausible yet otherworldly, and the ecosystem reacts as though it existed long before you arrived. The survival loop is simple but deeply satisfying: gathering fragments, expanding your base, and slowly pushing into more dangerous areas. Each upgrade feels earned.\n\nWhat once made the experience special was the constant evolution of the original game as it grew and refined itself. That history is part of why I’m disappointed in the direction Subnautica 2 seems to be heading now. The studio changes and loss of the original team have stripped away the soul that made the world feel alive.\n\nEven so, the first Subnautica remains one of the most immersive, atmospheric games I’ve ever played.

It drops you into an alien ocean with nothing but fear, curiosity, and the sound of your breathing — and from that moment, the game owns you. At first, everything is peaceful: colorful coral reefs, harmless fish, sunlight shimmering through the water. You gather resources, craft better tools, build your first little base, and start exploring deeper.\n\nThen the ocean reminds you who's in charge.\n\nThe deeper you go, the darker and more mysterious everything becomes. New biomes feel both breathtaking and terrifying, and every dive feels like a balance between fascination and pure anxiety. Subnautica nails the feeling of wonder mixed with primal fear — especially when you hear something massive moving in the pitch-black water and you’re not sure whether to run or freeze.\n\nThe base building and crafting progression feel natural and rewarding, and every upgrade opens new possibilities. The Seamoth, Prawn Suit, Cyclops — each milestone feels huge, and you never forget the first time you leave safety behind and head into the truly dangerous depths.\n\nThe story unfolds slowly but beautifully, with mystery, lore, and a surprising emotional payoff. And the soundtrack? Calm, eerie, and perfect — it makes the world feel alive.\n\nSubnautica isn’t just a survival game. It’s exploration, fear, creativity, and discovery blended into one unforgettable experience. It proves a game doesn’t need guns or constant combat to feel intense — sometimes the ocean itself is enough.\n\nIf you want a game that stays in your head long after you finish it, Subnautica is absolutely worth playing.",

Beautiful game that's a lot of fun with tons of content with a lot of freedom for how you wanna play. Didn't feel like I had to do anything particular after the beginning section of the game.\n\nIf you're like me and thought the same thing and are hesitant because of those systems, I promise this game handles it very well and even to those that don't like the genre or some of the mechanics will like it. The mechanics are extremely well implemented and fairly forgiving for the most part making even those inexperienced able to enjoy and explore the game.",

      "review": "Subnautica — A Deep Dive into Adventure and Discovery\n\nSubnautica isn’t just a survival game; it’s a masterclass in exploration, tension, and wonder beneath the waves. From lush coral reefs to pitch-black ocean trenches, every environment is teeming with life, mystery, and danger that keeps players fully immersed.\n\nExploration is both thrilling and rewarding. Swimming through vibrant underwater landscapes, piloting vehicles, and discovering hidden caves gives a constant sense of discovery and awe. The procedurally inspired ecosystems feel alive, encouraging curiosity and careful observation at every turn.\n\nSurvival and crafting are intuitive and satisfying. Gathering resources, building habitats, and managing oxygen and health create a tense but deeply rewarding gameplay loop. Every tool, vehicle, and upgrade expands your freedom and allows you to tackle deeper, more dangerous areas of the ocean.\n\nThe sense of progression and discovery is addictive. Unlocking new blueprints, encountering rare creatures, and uncovering the story of the planet gives long-term goals, while hidden secrets and abandoned bases reward careful exploration and attention to detail.\n\nVisually, Subnautica is stunning. Lush underwater environments, detailed fauna, and dynamic lighting make every dive feel immersive and alive. Combined with an atmospheric, haunting soundtrack, every encounter, dive, and discovery becomes a memorable adventure.\n\n[h3]Final Verdict:[/h3]\nSubnautica is a breathtaking survival adventure that blends exploration, creativity, and tension into a seamless underwater experience. Immersive, beautiful, and endlessly engaging, it’s a must-play for fans of discovery and adventure.\n\n“An unforgettable underwater adventure filled with mystery, danger, and wonder.”\n\nOverall Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 10/10",

Here's my situation, i was grinding materials and looking for new ones, i was dehydrated and had costume that gives you water time to time, i had somewhat 50 hp from before( i got hurt like 1 hour ago and still didnt regenerated) so i started to lose hp, in desperate attempts i tried to go out and catch some fish to get at least 3-6 water(originally i was going to biom where you can eat plants), i couldnt manage to get a fish and the moment i die, i see that water is getting added in my inventory...i ALT+F4 and load the game again just to find that around 2-3 hours of my progress, grind and building was gone due to either autosave not working, or game fucking with my save files.

While I understand the concept of exploration but there was not much to explore, there are like a few cool places and everything else are just sunken crap.\r\nThe story is okish/niche there is nothing too special about it but nothing to pull you up as well.\r\n\r\nTLDR - I feel the game is incomplete, the sea world feels too empty and the objectives are dull.

This game is really not beginner friendly..\r\nAfter that I played several base building games (for example Satisfactory and Planet Crafter) and watched several videos about how to play and what you are supposed to do. I lasted 6 hours this time. It was fun for ~4 hours, but then all kind of bad quality of life things started piling up. \r\nWith all that feedback and so many years of development the game lacks basic things that many other games have.. For example, why can I deconstruct only certain items? Why one menu closes with one button, but the other menu with another? Usually it's pressing the same button again or exit, but not here... Stupid.\r\nI like enjoying my gaming time, the perfect scenario is when it's fun, interesting, chill and entertaining... obviously.

Collecting materials is really tidious and annoying, 99% of times game doesnt tell you where and how you're suppose to get certain materials, and 70% of playing you'll spend just going from point A to point B thus from base to biom to gather resources.\nAbout bugs, it has really clumgy save system. Game can and sometimes will autosave but randomly. Here's my situation, i was grinding materials and looking for new ones, i was dehydrated and had costume that gives you water time to time, i had somewhat 50 hp from before( i got hurt like 1 hour ago and still didnt regenerated) so i started to lose hp, in desperate attempts i tried to go out and catch some fish to get at least 3-6 water(originally i was going to biom where you can eat plants), i couldnt manage to get a fish and the moment i die, i see that water is getting added in my inventory...i ALT+F4 and load the game again just to find that around 2-3 hours of my progress, grind and building was gone due to either autosave not working, or game fucking with my save files. I tried doing something with console commands but apparently they turn off achievements on your save file permanently once you save(which guess what, this time game had 0 problems with it). So i didnt bother with even finishing the game and deleted it. My advice, play raft, much nicer, less water exploration but i dont know any other replacement.",
