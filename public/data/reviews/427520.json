I know that today there are other factory building games, but for me, Factorio is the definitive one. There is literally no wrong way to play the game: you could, in theory, beat the base game by handcrafting every item! Obviously, it would take thousands of hours to do that, and this is why you automate. And automation is why this game is so challenging, addictive and satisfying. I played over a dozens of factories, and even with the blueprints from previous saved games, you always manage to build something new, find a better way to setup production, create more aesthetically pleasing blocks, and the list goes on. And because the world is basically infinite, you can keep scaling your factory to produce more and more (unfortunately I have never been able to build a mega factory, but a lot of people on Youtube have and there are some insane builds and factories). It's base building in its best.\n\nThe soundtrack is incredible. One of the best I have ever heard in videogames. The music is beautifully created and it fits so well with the world, which is visually very appealing and the best part is that it runs very well on low end PCs.\n\nFactorio is one of the best games ever made.

At its core, it’s a game about building a factory — you start on an alien planet with nothing but your hands, and from those humble beginnings you end up constructing vast, fully automated production systems capable of manufacturing rockets, trains, and everything in between. But what makes Factorio special isn’t just what you build, it’s how you build it, and the satisfaction that comes from watching your intricate network of belts, inserters, and machines work in perfect synchronization.\r\n\r\nWhat begins as a small operation quickly evolves into a sprawling industrial empire. The sense of progression is intoxicating — each new technology unlocks not just another piece of machinery, but also new possibilities for optimization. The deeper you go, the more you realize that there’s always a better, faster, or more elegant way to organize your production lines. Players often describe the experience as “addictive” in the best way possible. One community member famously wrote, “I have 750 hours in Factorio and still haven’t touched the most popular mods.” That’s the kind of long-term engagement this game inspires.",

After more than four thousand hours, I still find myself saying “just one more improvement” at 3 a.m. — and somehow the game always finds another way to pull me deeper in.\r\n\r\nThe core gameplay loop is absolutely brilliant. Designing factories, optimizing layouts, solving logistical puzzles, managing power, and building ever-larger production lines feels endlessly satisfying. Every improvement you make ripples through the whole system, and watching your base grow from a tiny burner setup into a planet-spanning industrial machine never gets old.\r\n\r\nThen there’s the defense. Biters might be the best uninvited guests in gaming — always pushing you to adapt, upgrade, and reinforce your perimeter. Balancing expansion with defense keeps every run engaging.\r\n\r\nI’ve always loved designing train networks, logistic systems, and custom blueprints, and Factorio delivers in a way no other game does. Creating a perfectly timed, perfectly routed train system is practically an art form.\r\n\r\nAnd now? The Space Age expansion took all of that and added even more fun. New worlds, exploration, new challenges to overcome on every planet — it expands Factorio in exactly the right way. Your factory doesn’t just grow outward anymore; it grows upward and outward across an entire solar system.\r\n\r\nEvery time I think I’ve seen it all, Factorio proves me wrong.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy building, problem-solving, logistics, automation, trains, or just want to lose yourself in the most satisfying “one more thing” cycle ever created, you owe it to yourself to play Factorio — and Space Age makes it even better.\r\n\r\n11/10.
