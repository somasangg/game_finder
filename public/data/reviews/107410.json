It's not suitable for players who simply enjoy fast-paced shooting. Arma 3 is a true [u]military simulation[/u], a [u]war simulation[/u], definitely not just a few guns clashing. 👊👊👊",

      "review": "While the game didn't meet my personal expectations, this is a great game. While I personally did not enjoy the game as much as expected due to reasons I will soon explain, I can 100% see why people have thousands of hours on this game. Now, I will state the pros and cons of this game from my perspective. \r\n\r\nPros: The Eden sandbox system, which at least for me, was relatively intuitive and very fun to mess with, but requires a strange order of steps to get the ai to function. The gameplay, which is unlike most other FPS games, requires deliberate thought process and execution with a squad to be successful. Mods, which are probably the primary attraction to most people, allow you to customize the game to your desire. The community and players of the game, which are some of the best of any game I have played, are super cool and almost everyone knows their stuff and has a mic.\r\n\r\nCons: THE DLCs!!! The DLCs are infuriating to me, it is almost like an EA game. You want to use an RPG-7, an AKM, or a tank? Too bad, your $30 was not enough to buy that and now you need to spend ANOTHER $25+ just to be able to play normally. The lack of players in vanilla servers is another drawback, and as a new player, modding the game can be a bit confusing or scary if you are not already familiar with the process. I know it is an old game, so I really should not need to explain that the graphics are not exactly high quality, but that is a given for the age. \r\n\r\nConclusion: This is a great game, and I would not hesitate to recommend it to someone, but the mods and the learning curve can be difficult to understand for new players. Also, the DLCs are a major disappointment since you can not play how you want to without them (although mods may be able to fix that, but I have not played with them too much).",

At the end of the day, you can't go wrong with either. The sheer volume of content in 2 is something that cannot be topped, but there is something that just feels better when you're playing 3. Just that little bit of modernity goes a long way. I also feel that the editor is much quicker and easier to use as well. Jumping into these titles without prior knowledge would be an absolute culture shock and nightmare lol. It's clunky, janky, and riddled with bugs and issues. But my god once you get a grip on it, once it starts to click and you begin to form some modicum of control, it's an experience like no other. You can truly lose yourself here. I'm an immersion based rpg player at heart and these games completely scratch that itch. There's really no sense in attempting to go into details like an actual thoughtful review because this is something that you just have to play, you just have to engross yourself in it and at the end of that path lies one of my top favorite games of all time- a game like no other. 2 or 3, it doesn't matter, get whichever is cheaper.",

Arma 3 (with mod support) is the most comprehensive war simulator money can buy. This is one of my most played on Steam and that is no mistake. \n\nEven though coming out 12 years ago, it has aged very well, with the ever present workshop support this game has become an evolution supporting hundreds of different comprehensive scenarios. Some of my favourite are capture the island ones. It seems the engine supports a great array of detail and scope for customising. The main map 'Altis' is huge and is pretty detailed with once again a vast array of workshop maps.\n\nAll in all , if you want a great co-op or single player experience with infinite replay value then your money is well spent.

When it works though, you can do almost anything you want to within the grounds of a tactical shooter.\n\nThe game does include singleplayer content that is generally enjoyable, but the real meat of the game is starting a server with friends to play a variety of game modes, or cooperating with a unit of players for larger scale action. Most of these you can download, but you can also build and script your own missions with the in-game mission editor, which can be fun if you're into that sort of design work. Whether you've just got an afternoon to kill or want to play an epic game taking place over many multi-hour sessions, Arma has something you'll enjoy.\n\nThe game has a lot of useful guides and info on how to play, but it is pretty in depth. You're going to want to keep a list of default keybinds handy, and maybe watch some videos online on how to handle gameplay using the more widely-used mods like ACE.\n\nPretty much all the content people like to use is easily downloaded either through Steam Workshop or a number of 3rd party sites.

Oh sweet summer child.\r\nARMA 3 runs like it was coded on a calculator submerged in yogurt.\r\nYou can have a NASA supercomputer powered by the heart of a dying star — doesn’t matter.\r\nARMA 3 will STILL find a way to give you 27 FPS in an empty field at sunrise.\r\n\r\n🤖 AI – Artificial Idiocy\r\n\r\nImagine commanding a squad of highly trained soldiers.\r\nNow replace them with eight lobotomized pigeons wearing helmets.\r\nCongratulations, you now understand ARMA 3’s squad behavior.\r\n\r\n“Go prone!”\r\nThey stand.\r\n“Hold fire!”\r\nThey nuke an entire village.\r\n“Regroup!”\r\nThey wander into a minefield because the voices told them to.\r\n\r\n🧍♂️ Physics: A Comedy Special\r\n\r\nGet shot once and your character performs a 2008 YouTube ragdoll montage.\r\nVehicles flip over because a leaf brushed the tire.\r\nHelicopters crash if you breathe too loudly.\r\n\r\nIt’s like playing a military simulator designed by chaos-driven goblins.\r\n\r\n🕳️ Bugs\r\n\r\nARMA 3 doesn’t have bugs.\r\nARMA 3 is a bug with some game accidentally attached to it.\r\nGlitches so old they should be paying taxes.\r\nAnimations so stiff they make Minecraft villagers look like ballet dancers.\r\n\r\n🗺️ The World\r\n\r\nHuge map, endless possibilities, beautiful landscapes — all of which you can stare at while waiting 14 minutes for your buddy to slowly crawl 6 meters because he got stuck on a pebble.\r\n\r\n🎭 Final Verdict\r\n\r\nARMA 3 is a tragic masterpiece, a disgusting miracle, a monument to jank, and a reminder that sometimes suffering builds character.\r\n\r\nWould I recommend it?\r\nNo. Absolutely not.

But the idea was more then 10 years ago that BI would use the shitload of money they got from DayZ mods popularity (increasing Arma 2 sales) and later increased Arma 3 sales into much more development.\r\nArma 3 truly sucks in almost any and every way. It is very, very much an infantry simulator from 2003 that has been released a decade after that. \r\nVehicle physics don't make any sense and in my opinion were sometimes better in Arma 2. Planes and helicopters are a total nightmare and most of all, the GODAWFUL performance issues and lack of optimization is really what drives me up a wall. No way in hell that I will ever bother with any other BI game ever again. \r\nDCS, MS Flight sim, maybe even a whole list of other games have got flight controls and modeling down. Not Arma. Not in the slightest.\r\nWorld of Tanks, or any other game will be able to simulate armored vehicles a million times better.\r\nArma also does not explore the use of a navy or naval assets, they are somehow irrelevant. Again, god knows how many other games do this better.\r\nThe only upside to Arma 3 many, many years ago was that you could modify it. But the quality of the mods is mostly, absolute, definitive, garbage. Outdated, incomplete, not working, awful performance issues, no physics or correct damage simulation, incompatibility issues with other mods, you name it.\r\nThis is very much NOT like e.g. Skyrim or whatever other games do modding a billion times better.\r\nIt is very much like Arma 3 itself. Very underwhelming and not worth your time. Do not bother playing or buying this game. Please get something else, but don't ask me what to get. DCS rains supreme in flight simming, but is very difficult to get into and doesn't do anything else at all or well.\r\nBattlefield is just Call of Duty at this point and has become more obscene and Just Cause 2 like with even more over the top explosions, spastic 10-year olds on ritalin cheating and exploiting the game like no tomorrow and way too expensive.\r\nSave your money for a game that actually doesn't take the piss out of its customers and has a real dedicated team of game developers that actually know how to program and how to make games.

But the idea was more then 10 years ago that BI would use the shitload of money they got from DayZ mods popularity (increasing Arma 2 sales) and later increased Arma 3 sales into much more development.\r\nArma 3 truly sucks in almost any and every way. It is very, very much an infantry simulator from 2003 that has been released a decade after that. \r\nVehicle physics don't make any sense and in my opinion were sometimes better in Arma 2. Planes and helicopters are a total nightmare and most of all, the GODAWFUL performance issues and lack of optimization is really what drives me up a wall. No way in hell that I will ever bother with any other BI game ever again. \r\nDCS, MS Flight sim, maybe even a whole list of other games have got flight controls and modeling down. Not Arma. Not in the slightest.\r\nWorld of Tanks, or any other game will be able to simulate armored vehicles a million times better.\r\nArma also does not explore the use of a navy or naval assets, they are somehow irrelevant. Again, god knows how many other games do this better.\r\nThe only upside to Arma 3 many, many years ago was that you could modify it. But the quality of the mods is mostly, absolute, definitive, garbage. Outdated, incomplete, not working, awful performance issues, no physics or correct damage simulation, incompatibility issues with other mods, you name it.\r\nThis is very much NOT like e.g. Skyrim or whatever other games do modding a billion times better.\r\nIt is very much like Arma 3 itself. Very underwhelming and not worth your time. Do not bother playing or buying this game. Please get something else, but don't ask me what to get. DCS rains supreme in flight simming, but is very difficult to get into and doesn't do anything else at all or well.\r\nBattlefield is just Call of Duty at this point and has become more obscene and Just Cause 2 like with even more over the top explosions, spastic 10-year olds on ritalin cheating and exploiting the game like no tomorrow and way too expensive.\r\nSave your money for a game that actually doesn't take the piss out of its customers and has a real dedicated team of game developers that actually know how to program and how to make games.

No way in hell that I will ever bother with any other BI game ever again. \r\nDCS, MS Flight sim, maybe even a whole list of other games have got flight controls and modeling down. Not Arma. Not in the slightest.\r\nWorld of Tanks, or any other game will be able to simulate armored vehicles a million times better.\r\nArma also does not explore the use of a navy or naval assets, they are somehow irrelevant. Again, god knows how many other games do this better.\r\nThe only upside to Arma 3 many, many years ago was that you could modify it. But the quality of the mods is mostly, absolute, definitive, garbage. Outdated, incomplete, not working, awful performance issues, no physics or correct damage simulation, incompatibility issues with other mods, you name it.\r\nThis is very much NOT like e.g. Skyrim or whatever other games do modding a billion times better.\r\nIt is very much like Arma 3 itself. Very underwhelming and not worth your time. Do not bother playing or buying this game. Please get something else, but don't ask me what to get. DCS rains supreme in flight simming, but is very difficult to get into and doesn't do anything else at all or well.\r\nBattlefield is just Call of Duty at this point and has become more obscene and Just Cause 2 like with even more over the top explosions, spastic 10-year olds on ritalin cheating and exploiting the game like no tomorrow and way too expensive.\r\nSave your money for a game that actually doesn't take the piss out of its customers and has a real dedicated team of game developers that actually know how to program and how to make games. This game is just pathetic in 2025.",

Controls are nightmare to remember and enemies nail you from a 1Km out with very little to balance except reducing their accuracy to potato mode. The AI can somehow nail you from a mile out but also manage to be extremely dumb at the same time, standing out into the open, crashing vehicles into every wall/prop possible and exploding on trees. Don't waste nearly $40 on this nightmare, the gun fighting is good and there are a lot of realistic elements but the aforementioned problems are not worth it.",

Also very glitchy as multiple times I had to restart missions because an enemy had just disappeared so it wouldn't move onto the next objective.\nhad high hopes for this game but sadly fell very short.",
