      "review": "I like this game a lot because I'm brain damaged and I create mods for single player. For your average player considering this game, I'd get it on a sale. It goes for pretty steep discounts during holiday and seasonal promotions. I would not pay the full $70 or $80. \n\nMany people consider NFS Heat to be the better game, but Heat and Unbound will be the last NFS releases we will see for while if not forever. If you catch the game at a 80% - 90% discount and it piques your interest, never hurts to try it out and see what you think.\n\n\nPros:\n- Excellent graphics, audio, car models, etc. Arguably some of the best in the franchise\n- Good customization, lots of licensed manufacturers and custom concept kits\n- Expanded car list compared to previous game, every single car and most customization carries over from NFS Heat\n- Driving feels good if you learn it. I like the sense of speed and how it doesn't rely on brake to drift unlike previous games\n- Active multiplayer with a nice variety of event types\n- Active modding scene. Multiple \"overhaul\" mods such as Project Unite, Unbound Remix, and Hard+ greatly supplement the game\n\nCons:\n- Lackluster single player experience. Awkward progression and unremarkable story\n- Car handling is tricky to master. Competitive play leans heavily on the \"burst NOS\" mechanic\n- Not the best balance with car performance, with a few \"meta\" cars being behind a paywall\n- Poor optimization just like NFS Heat, demanding on GPU and CPU resources. Low-end set ups will likely experience crashing\n- No anti-cheat system for multiplayer, you might run into players using mods nefariously. This isn't super common and its easy to block other players\n- Art direction isn't everyone's cup of tea. Animated driving effects can be disabled and many players mute the soundtrack",

      "review": "[h1]Need for Speed™ Unbound[/h1]\n\na nice game to play and one of the best (if not the best) modern nfs. to a extend its way better than heat: smoother driving and proper drifting mechanics. after years they finally improved the horrible drifting, and driving in general feels nice and pretty smooth even if sometimes the steering wheel will lock and not letting you turn and sometimes there is this weird bug where the game without any reason (no shift+tab either) will start using mk inputs until you press something on the keyboard. the customization is great as usual even improved on some aspects, like removing front/rear bumpers and some crazy bodykits; i love how you can finally make a huracan performante without a rear bump that the shows the Exhaust pipes tell me a game that let you does that vanilla, sadly you can't see the twin turbos such a missed oppurtinity... about the story it's MEEEH could be something ok just to have context but still. i'm tired of this tiktokification and \"we do this to express ourselfes, we are oppressed, we are doing nothing bad bla bla bla\" because speeding at 300km in urban centers it's a great and safe and smart thing to do right? i know some dumbass do this irl too but cmon STOP defending us, at least in the old titles you are well self conscious and were 0 excuses to what you were doing (rightfully so). also a little note on the music since there was a \"discussion\" topic on this when the game came out. i'm not a fan of most choices they made here, even if i liked few ones (a$ap and carti hehe) people keep comparing unbound playlist with the BEST ones of the older titles... it's fine if you don't like this genre of music but using the BEST songs as comparasion it's such a lack of intellectual honesty, at this point i believe who said this was completely blinded by nostalgia or never played those games.",

      "review": "[b]I am here in defence of Need for Speed Unbound.[/b]\nWith 18.7 hours of this game with story almost finished. I feel pretty confident in saying that this game gets WAY more hate than it deserves. Unbound isn't perfect don't get me wrong, but it's a hell of a lot better than anyone gives it credit for.\n\n[b]The Handling[/b]\nThe biggest criticism I keep seeing thrown around is the handling model, I think it's blown way out of proportion. Yeah, the drifting in my opinion can sometimes feel like a hit or miss. Earlier titles nailed that flowy, predictable drift zone and Unbound doesn't fully recapture it for me. The grip handling though? It feels great once you settle into it. The cars bite into corners, speed feels weighty, and there's momentum to everything that just works. People clowning the game for \"feeling too arcadey\" are missing the point entirely. This is an arcade racing game, the controls are meant to feel more exaggerated, it's meant to be loud, it's meant to be stylish! And Unbound's handling suits that vibe.\n\n[b]Art Style[/b]\nI'm one of those people that initially hated the graffiti style effects and cel-shading when the game was revealed. It just looked cheap and gimmicky. Then I started playing it and actually warmed up to it. Don't get me wrong the character art style still doesn't do much for me, but the effects around the cars? Burst nitrous trails, cel-shaded drift sparks and the stylized air time effects... they look absolutely FANTASTIC in motion. There's an energy to them that elevates big moments, and the more I played the more I realised they're one of the game's best additions. Honestly Criterion should double down on their concepts for the next games and stop playing it safe for each instalment. If you're going weird and stylish, commit to the idea, don't half a$$ it. \n\n[b]Progression and Economy[/b]\nI bought the Ultimate Edition on sale for £11.24, so I started with a handful of cars which definitely softened the early grind. But even then the progression felt fair. Upgrades feel meaningful, especially when you bump the cars into the next grade. If you've got a favourite ride and want to take it all the way to the end, Unbound lets you do that, and that's something that previous titles messed up (Heat managed to almost do this but it still felt more limited than in this game. I would go further into it but I wanna stick to talking about Unbound).\n\nI heard a handful of people talking about how they find the grinding too slow, and sure I don't entirely disagree. But NFS 2015 showered you in money, and everyone hated that too. I feel as though this has always been a difficult balancing act for each game.\n\n[b]Cops (They're actually fun again!)[/b]\nNeed for Speed Heat had some great police chases but also made me terrified to even start one. Unbound fixes that. Challenging enough to feel exciting, but not too overpowered that you avoid them entirely. Different police tiers behave differently, from my experience car classes seem to influence how intense a chase gets, and the damage threshold is much kinder than Heat. If you keep calm and learn how to outsmart them instead of driving headfirst into every bus and lamppost, the chases are an absolute rush! It's honestly a shame some players aren't experiencing that side of the game with positivity. \n\n[b]Story and Characters[/b]\nI can't defend this part, it's pretty bad. Not unplayably bad, but the writing feels like a group of out of touch board members trying to imitate \"what the kids are saying these days.\" It's cringey, forced and shallow. Our protagonist also likes to sound and act like an idiot. You’re telling me that after witnessing one of your closer friends (Yaz) almost ruin your mentor’s career and steal the car you both worked on, my character is just supposed to forgive her like nothing happened? Absolutely not, I would have left that snake in the streets after winning the Countach back.\n\nRight... where was I? Oh yeah. Older black box era NFS games understood how to keep things short, grounded and serious. Unbound's story feels like it's constantly trying too hard to be cool.\n\n[b]Miscellaneous[/b]\nThe in-game soundtrack honestly sucked. I turned the entire music off for the game and played my own DnB spotify mix instead. It honestly made the game feel WAY better than whatever Unbound was trying to push. However, the sound effects are phenomenal. The wooshing noises going past cars, the audible horns as you race in the oncoming traffic lanes, nitrous boosts and car engines are an absolute bliss to listen to.\n\nI stayed away from online because I have no interest in being paired with players that constantly try to ram you off the street. It's just not the way I play racing games so if you're looking for an insightful review of that I recommend checking other reviews and see what they say. \n\n[b]So Why All the Hate?[/b]\nSome of the criticisms are completely fair. The story is cringe, characters are weak, drift handling (in my experience) lacks consistency and the economy can feel slow for some players. However the other complaints feel like people projecting. Complaints about handling because they wanted a sim when I believe NFS at it's core has always been more arcade focused, hating the art style without giving it a fair chance and the grinding aspect of these games will always be complained about whether it's too easy to gain money or too long to grind for it.\n\n[b]Final Thoughts[/b]\nUnbound does more right that it does wrong. Under all the graffiti and flair, there's actually a surprising amount of mechanical depth too. Car builds meaningfully change how your car handles, nitrous types serve different purposes, and the day/night risk vs reward cycle forces actual decision making instead of mindlessly driving to events and grinding for money. There's more room for experimentation and mastery here than people give it credit for. Yeah the story is bad and soundtrack isn't great, but the core of the game? It's way better than what other players lead you to believe. A lot of the hate feels misguided, exaggerated or just bitter.\n\nIf you want a lively arcade racer with personality, Unbound is absolutely worth your time.",

The city has a cool atmosphere too: it’s gritty but colorful, and feels alive in a slightly stylized way.\n\nThe progression system is also pretty engaging; the whole “betting on yourself” structure makes each race feel like a real gamble. Customization is still top-tier — both cars and characters can be tweaked to look exactly how you want, and the options feel wide without being overwhelming.\n\nThe only downside is that the stylized visual effects may not be everyone’s taste. Sometimes they get a bit too flashy in tight races, making it harder to focus.

The devs have truly perfected the online experience. I have yet to play \"PVP\" or \"Lockdown\" but the fact that we have dedicated modes for such is already a good sign. What I can speak to is how well integrated the online events are in conjunction wit the open world experience.\r\n\r\nYou aren't immediately harassed by police and can mind your own business, but you can get in a chase anytime you want by getting in a collision with a cop car. You can meet up for rounds of \"Link Up\" for a chaotically fun time (think of Forza's Forzathon Live events). Or you can start a race from a \"Meet Up\" location that gets sent out to all the other players in your session (lobbies of 16, races typically cap at 8)\r\nso the chance for some old fashion grudge racing is still alive and well, even in the laid back online open world layout we have here.",

      "review": "If you are looking for a good modern NFS, you should also be looking at HEAT. UNBOUND is just a side-grade to HEAT, where both of them do things better/worse than the other.\n\nOverall, this game isn’t worth for the SP. The boring campaign progression, weird difficulty wall, stingy payouts and lack of any endgame activity isn’t worth the experience. However, if you are looking for the MP, the story is different and it’s worth the check. The added mechanic of bust NOS adds a skill check in races, and there’s a lot of events for you to participate in. There’s also a much more larger library from cars to try out and exclusive MP customization’s. The payouts are also better than in SP, and making money is easy even for a complete beginner. \n\nThe [b]story[/b] is actually decent for a driving game. Is those start from the bottom with a revenge plot, that makes you want to progress the game. However, it wasn’t very well delivered, and the writing is very weird and awkward at times, making some “GenZ” jokes, that don’t connect. There’s also events that don’t really make sense and a bad guy that never appears.\n\nThe [b]visuals[/b] are very good, and cars are extremely detailed and well done. They added a cartoonish art style to the game that was very controversial, however i think it gives a very distinct identity vs all other racing games, and they should continue in the future. The anime characters really contrast with the hyper realistic vehicles, which makes the car pop much more. Also, all the crazy effects just hype the driving (arrows popping when applying NOS, wings showing when doing jumps, etc).\nAlthough the graphics are good, the atmosphere is disappointing. The whole game has a gray weather effect, that makes the game feel dull. Maybe it’s a design choice, to make the extremely colored visuals pop more. They also added NPC’s on the map to make the game feel more alive, which is a great touch.\n\nThe music, i can’t comment since it’s a very personal choice. The music leans more on rap music. However, the tone of the music is to much slow paced, even during races and cop chases, which, imo, is a downside.\n\nAbout the [b]gameplay[/b], cars are now divided into different classes. You can make several builds for a car to enter different classes, which is interesting. Cars can only participate in the specific car class, which makes races more competitive. However, power-creep still exists, and 2 cars from the same class can still have huge differences in performance. You can finally do grip builds, unlike HEAT, and they are actually very satisfying to play. They added a complete new mechanic, burst NOS, which is separate from normal NOS and is gained by driving aggressively. Burst NOS gives a slight speed boost, but also increases your grip allowing to do corners with crazy angles. The idea behind it was good, but makes the races being decided by who can abuse the burst NOS better. The cops, overall, are a dumber version of HEAT, with the addition of us being able to damage them without damaging us, making them essentially not a threat. However, they are literally everywhere, and pop up every couple of seconds, while in a chase and just free-roaming.\n\nThe [b]customization[/b] is still one of the biggest points of NFS titles, and this is still present in UNBOUND, now with the added style effects. If you don’t like them, they offer you a way to remove those effects, but only for your car. For the player character, the customization is a lot more limiting and underwhelming.\n\nAbout [b]SP[/b], was a complete downgrade from HEAT, and is one of the most boring experiences ever. Not only the progression is very slow, but it also seems to be designed to be time waster. Instead events being scattered all across the map, they are compressed to 6/7 meeting spots. All the safe-houses are far from most meeting spots, and you can’t TP. Also, races can be on the opposite side of the meeting spot, stopping you from being able to “combo” several races. You will waste more time driving from A to B to START a race, than actually racing. This is made worst by the fact that a cop shows every 30sec. You can either dodge it or risk to confront them and waste 10min evading them.  Also, the payouts are very low, so when you finish the game, if you just want to play around and experiment with new cars, you can, but you will have to grind A LOT. In terms of difficulty there is a difficulty wall in the beginning, but as soon as you pass it, the game just becomes increasingly easier, to the point where neither AI racers or cops can keep up with you. Also, SP wasn’t updated with any of the cars of the MP DLC’s.\n\nAbout [b]MP[/b], the experience is much, much better than HEAT. Although UNBOUND has a lower player count, the player base is much more active, and much more willing to race, although very hardly you will find a full race lobby. The newcomer experience is much easier now, with a recent mode that allows you to get some cars for free, or sell them for big quantities, this without needing any upgraded car in your garage. There is also a free mode event, which a lot of people usually join in and participate. As expected, is much more common to find people playing in the higher classes. The car meta suffers a lot from power creep due to recent additions, so its very common to see always the same 2-3 cars. Sadly, they are so OP, that even driving well wont be enough if the adversary is using one of this cars. Finally, the payouts are also better, so if you wanna experiment with more cars, you should go to MP. Be warned that the SP garage isn’t shared with MP, like in HEAT, with the exception of those you won on special events and tournaments on SP.\n\nAbout [b]performance[/b], i found a very big problem at the beginning of the game, where i couldn’t even pass from the first mission. After along time trying to troubleshoot, i found out that the issue was the FPS spike when loading cut scenes. Locking the FPS resolved my issues. However, i still encountered some crashes, mainly during SP. Also, this game has the same issue from HEAT, where your CPU is just pushed to 100%, constantly, for no reason. I recommend checking some videos on how to fix this, if you don’t want your PC smelling like a toaster.",

      "review": "[b]Review by [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33369540-Abrix/]Abrix\n Gaming[/url] – 4K quality gameplay reviews and recommendations.[/b]\n\n[b]Need for Speed Unbound – A Bold, Stylish Evolution of Street Racing with Heart and Attitude[/b]\n\n[i]Need for Speed Unbound[/i] brings the franchise roaring back with style, confidence, and a fresh identity that finally pushes the series forward. This isn’t just another NFS — it’s a celebration of underground racing culture, built with personality, attitude, and an artistic flair that makes every moment behind the wheel look and feel electric.\n\nThe first thing that hits you is the visual style. The combination of hyper-detailed cars and hand-drawn graffiti-inspired effects sounds risky on paper, but in practice it’s brilliant. Boost flames, wings drawn in paint strokes, comic-style sparks on drifts — these animations amplify the rush of speed rather than distract from it. Unbound looks unlike any racer out there, and that distinct identity becomes one of its greatest strengths.\n\nHandling is tight, responsive, and exhilarating. Every car feels different — heavy muscle monsters, high-grip JDM legends, twitchy supercars — all brought to life with weight, power, and personality. Drifting and corner exits with perfectly timed boost feel incredible, rewarding skill instead of luck. For the first time in years, NFS racing feels truly competitive and satisfying, not just cinematic.\n\nThe risk vs. reward heat system is where excitement peaks. Every race earns money, but also raises police heat, and every night becomes a gamble — push your luck for bigger payouts or quit while you’re ahead. Evading cops through Lakeshore City’s alleys, highways, and industrial zones is a white-knuckle thrill that brings back the spirit of Most Wanted and Heat, but with even smarter police tactics and dramatic chases.\n\nProgression is meaningful, not grindy. Your garage becomes your legacy — buying wrecks, upgrading engines, tuning setups, experimenting with parts, and designing bold liveries that match the game’s rebellious style. Every upgrade matters, and every dollar earned has purpose.\n\nStory mode is another pleasant surprise. Voiced characters feel grounded in car culture rather than stereotypes, and the narrative of rivalry, betrayal, and ambition actually lands emotionally. Your character isn’t just a background driver — you’re part of the scene, and the journey to the top of Lakeshore’s racing hierarchy feels personal.\n\nThe soundtrack injects pure adrenaline — hip-hop, trap, and global underground beats match the tone and energy perfectly. It elevates every drift, jump, and police chase into a cinematic moment.\n\nMultiplayer is slick and straightforward, built for seamless fun: fast matchmaking, competitive playlists, crew events, and the same fantastic car progression — without unnecessary grinding walls. It’s easy to lose hours simply cruising, racing, tuning, and flexing your style.\n\n[i]Need for Speed Unbound[/i] is a bold new chapter — fast, stylish, confident, and unafraid to evolve. It respects the series’ roots but refuses to be stuck in the past. With stunning style, tight controls, adrenaline-driven racing, deep car culture, and a massively replayable campaign, Unbound proves that NFS still belongs among the kings of street racing games.\n\nA thrilling return to form — and a statement that the franchise has more to offer than ever.\n\nYou can check my gameplay video [b][url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxvWbrDkSJsCMiiesQ06MrEylz1aZkMK7]here[/url][/b]\n\nSubscribe To My Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1ZOvQERjGtRkl7ImTcDzdw?sub_confirmation=1\nJoin My Discord - https://discord.gg/uM94ehT7hv",

Its handling model is improved over previous entries, and the story campaign is serviceable, though not ground-breaking. Critics praised the customization and sense of speed, while noting that content variety and world activity feel limited compared to genre leaders.",

      "review": "Alright game at best, it has good points but also many flaws.\n\nTo start with the positive things: the multiplayer is definitely the best part of the game, the rest is really unremarkable. Many types of events to choose from.\nThen, the customization is another nice point. Just like Heat, there's a lot of stuff to choose from for most cars, and i rly liked the bodykit presets.\nI liked the driving physics too. A bit similar to the previous title but tweaked a bit, with Burst NOS as an important mechanic. You can choose if you want your car more grippy or drifty, which is nice, and i appreciate the fact you can modify the sliders even outside the garage.\n\nNow for the negative aspects: pretty boring singleplayer experience, it gets very repetitive after a while because it's always the same type of events, over and over again. The story is nothing special, just what you would expect from a NFS game. \nThe performance... is BAD, with insane cpu and gpu usage, even on lower settings. There were also many visual glitches, as well as lag/stuttering after performing specific actions such as alt tabbing or taking a screenshot. Sometimes i liked to take pictures of my cars (with the very disappointing photo mode; Heat's was much better, this one was clearly unfinished), but after taking a screenshot (with Lightshot, because the game doesn't have an input to take a picture) the game would start lagging and running at 30fps. Not sure what's the problem here.\nThe cops in my opinion were very annoying, more than challenging they were a nuisance and i never had fun escaping them. Heat had great cops imo, despite a lot of people saying they were too hard i think they were perfect.\n\nI would recommend this game ONLY if it's on sale. Otherwise it isn't worth playing.",

      "review": "When the rubber hits the road it’s evident Need for Speed Unbound hasn’t strayed very far from the fundamentals of 2019’s Heat. This is a little surprising following the series’ shift back to Criterion – a studio that has traditionally had a very distinct style of its own – although it isn’t a bad thing considering Heat was a welcome splash of gas for a franchise that was close to running on fumes. Unbound should, however, turn heads thanks to its bold new animated characters and special effects. Despite the odd juxtaposition between its traditional graphics and the cartoon-inspired flourishes, they are strikingly well done and make for an instantly recognisable instalment of this 28-year-old series. However, while the car customisation tools are as expressive as ever, it does feel unlikely that older players will be able to connect with the single-player mode’s preening cast of entitled chuckleheads, and unfortunately the separate online mode is currently missing core features like cops.",

The police in the game were especially trivial to deal with at first, but added generously to the enjoyment of the game. There is a decent selection of cars to pick from, and various customization options. The paint - decal system was also a pleasure to use, and allowed each car to feel unique, and personal to me. The story, although a bit predictable, had its moments, and was entertaining nonetheless. Unfortunately, my one issue with the game is the online playability. I felt that the online elements were unfun and non-motivating, there wasnt much reason to engage in the online gameplay, and as a result, I didnt engage all that much in it. I preferred the story mode significantly more. \r\n\r\nFinal rating: 7.8/10 - pleasureable experience, with many great reasons to play, although the online is lacking.",

Underground illegal street racing with high customisation and tuning is what makes me love these titles and is fresh compared to the over saturated festival race games. We also deserved more support past the recent update seeing we won't see NFS for a while.\n\nIf you enjoy NFS but want more from it, try Unite for the more modern titles (singeplayer). :))\n\n8/10",

Also the music is just bleh. I am not sure where they were going with this but it ain't it. Better off just playing heat it's the more enjoyable game, darn shame cause the city looks and feels nice at least.\nUnless you have a crew of mates to run around with, this open world Race game is not worth it when others exist.

The car list is great since they include a lot of cars that rarely been included in these kinds of games or have not been in one for ages. The customisation is extreme and extensive, I like it. These reasons are why i was interested in unbound in first place.\n>The stuff i disliked.\nThe story, characters and dialogue is horrible. Skipping cutscenes and turning off story audio is a must in my eyes. The cell-shaded characters and those car graphics are not terrible, i just disliked them, its an acquired taste.\nTHe music is not as horrible as all those comparison memes portray, but absolutely one of the weakest soundtracks in all of NFS titles. \n\nI have given it a negative review because I could not stand the day/night/week progression system.\nIn my eyes, it discourages experimentation by not allowing us to grind for money without progressing the story, pushing towards meta builds.\nIt also made all the customisation feel pointless because every penny not spent on performance/garage upgrades felt like a waste.\nThe way heat system is implemented, ensures that you are almost always at high heat after few races, making travels between meetups pain in the arse.\nThe ultimate edition dlc does aleviate the situation by breaking the progression a bit, but its like 2 to 3 times the price of discounted game.\n\nAt historical low prices it is a good buy, but honestly id still suggest to just get heat.\nThe cars and customisation are the only things this game has over heat.\n\nEdit\nMy playtime after original review consists of hunting achievements, online and collectathon.\nOnce you get over the campaign the becomes more enjoyable.\nI will still keep my review negative for that story progression system",

As a 22 year old today I can strongly say that this entry was terrible. I don't understand why but EA loves this cartoony, fortnite bullshit design which needs to stop and die out. They used that for this game, the new Skate, and a few other recent titles hence why I've aimed to avoid them if I can. Need for Speed is not a kids game, therefore there's no reason to build it around kids. We're racing illegally and avoiding cops, so why the hell are you trying to appeal to kids? When I was a kid I would never play anything as childish as this. Kids love games that aren't for them because they are actually fun. This here is basically rainbows and unicorns in car form. This entry shows that many teams are hurting gaming and showing their true inexperience. Whoever the creative director is, you are very out of touch, corny, and don't need to be in charge for this franchise. I'm complaining and I got this game for a huge discount which shouldn't be. It is very hard to fuck up a racing game yet they did so with ease. Literally all you need for a racing game is solid visuals, good handling, licenses from car brands, a variety of cars and mods, and decent writing at most yet this is a prime example of what not to do.  If you're someone who is thinking about getting this game I would tell you not to waste your money and go to Need for Speed Heat or any other previous entry.",

Nie spodziewałem się, że granie w ścigankę może być takie irytujące i zwyczajnie mało przyjemne\n\nPlusy\n - Dobra Grafika, porównywalna z heatem\n - Więcej modeli samochodów\n - System tuningu zdecydowanie lepszy od pozostałych tytułów\n - Lepsze działanie stacji benzynowych \n - Bardziej dopracowane modele samochodów\n- Lepszy system \"heatu\" Granie w nocy ma faktycznie sens, co nie ma miejsca w heacie, a szkoda. Więcej kasy, samochody do wygrania\n-Motyw \"zlotów\" zamiast stawania w losowym miejscu i aktywowanie wyścigu, wjeżdża się na zloty, to jest akurat świetny pomysł\n- Start wyścigu, trafienie w zielone pole w celu lepszego ruszenia jest fajnym zamysłem zabranym z wyścigów dragowych z poprzednich gier\n- Wyłączenie silnika przyspiesza ucieczkę przed policją\nMinusy\n- Cała fabuła napisana na kolanie, bez ciekawej historii\n - Okropne dialogi, wykręcające na każdym kroku\n - Wygląd postaci\n- Asłuchalna muzyka, bardzo mało utworów, cenzura w tekstach która \"wygłusza\" przekleństwa pogarszając jakość utworu\n- Policja pojawiająca się na każdym kroku, po prawie każdym wyścigu, wymuszająca wielominutowe pościgi które nie pozwalają na poruszenie się do wybranej lokacji. Niesamowicie szybki czas nabijania się poziomu \"heatu\"\n- Powtarzalność wyścigów, podobne lub te same tory\n- RNG w trakcie wyścigów, dużo zależy od startu i od tego czy nagle ktoś w ciebie nie wjedzie, nie zbodyblockuje na 10 sekund po czym gra cofa cię na tor na ostatnie miejsce. \n- System skręcania, niektórzy go chwalą, jak dla mnie jest drewniany i okropny na samochodach ze słabszą skrętnością. \n- Meta pojazdy, będące znacznie lepsze od innych w swojej klasie\n- Tragiczny early game zniechęcający do progresowania\n- Blokada wyścigów dla danej klasy. Ok, pomysł stworzenia wyścigów dla samochodów o różnej mocy jest spoko, ale czasem fajnie byłoby móc zmaxować samochód do np A+ i móc kupić jakąś część do samochodu nie wychodząc z tej klasy przez 1-2 punkty. Przez to że nie można swapować części między autami jak w heacie, jest to mega męczące.  Poza tym po wyścigach często trafia się pościg, nie mam zamiaru uciekać przed policją na heacie 5 samochodem o klasie B lub A. Proste usprawnienie to byłaby możliwość opuszczenia wyścigu pojazdem którym się przyjechało na zlot.\n- Wspomniane bodyblocki które zasługują na osobny punkt, nawet przeciwnicy w trybie single będą w ciebie wjeżdżać, wyrzucać z toru, zajeżdżać ci drogę. Przez ich okropny styl jazdy nie raz zdarzało mi się wpaść na nadjeżdżający samochód czy wpaść w poślizg.\n- Policja na wyścigach, czasem, w 10% przypadków, nawet pomaga ci wygrać, w pozostałych 90% focusuje się na graczu, pojawia się na skrzyżowaniach i taranuje samochód. \n- Za dużo części offroadowych w wyścigach na wyższe klasy. W wyścigach na klasę S napotkałem się na wiele wyścigów wymuszających jazdę po torach czy ziemi, z drugiej strony wymuszającymi jazdę prosto na asfalcie, przez co samochód offroadowy też by tu nie działał.\n- System wypadków, czasem przy 250kmh mojemu samochowi nic się nie dzieje, udeży w coś i jedzie dalej. Zarazem przy 100kmh jest w stanie udeżyć, odczekać 2 sekundy i zrobić 14 backflipów\n-OKROPNE checkpointy wyścigowe, ominięcie ich o 1 milimetr powoduje reset na torze po 3 sekundach, co niszczy pozycję w wyścigu.

I could not have been more wrong. \n\nThe cops. Gotta be the worst thing about this game and probably the worst ones ive ever had the unfortunate time playing against. A nuisance, thats what they all are, annoying. God awful. I dont think ive ever audibly groaned or complained abt a racing game ever in a non multiplayer setting. The handling is still an issue but alot better and more enjoyable with better upgrades which is a bad thing imo, why do i have to upgrade my car to near peak performance to enjoy the handling, it should be good from beginning to end of the game regardless of the cars level/parts. it felt like i was having an active fight against my car up until now. \n\nI hate tess. i dont think ive known anyone that ever acts like Tess ever and most ppl dont bcuz they tend to be very annoying and unpleasant to be around, glad my character is aware of that at the very least. I love rydell, guy is the only enjoyable character (besides the mc? idk, we're alright ig) Jaz is nothing, she only appears in like the qualifers idk. This story is also so unbelieveably boring, why are the cutscene/story elements all in the qualifers, theres no missions and nothing that builds the characters or adds more to the story, wtf is going on with the mayor, half the time it feels like im just playing post game bcuz it clearly doesnt change ever after every week; the gameplay loop is so flat. It doesnt feel any different, from the first time to the last, monday to friday, day or night, it doesnt differ except for like 2 things. Night is just day but worse, mainly bcuz of tess and that your heat from day (day being almost identical to night) carries over making it more annoying to play night cuz youre stuck at heat 5 most of the times after 2 races. heat 5 doesnt feel like a challenge or a threat or even exciting/fun bcuz its so annoying and happens every night or day even, literally have the cop chatter muted. This game feels like a chore half the time, i dont know how i got a random S class car from the jump but that saved so much pain of grinding so thanks i guess idk i just bought the regular game.\n\nThis game is fun, but rarely and its only in the races, that of which feel the same so many times. When the game excels god dang it does it good but when it fails, holy hell what a dumpster fire, its astonishing how extreme this game is, there is no middle ground btwn good and bad gameplay, its either fun or so bad i want to punch a hole in my face. \n\n\n[8 hours in at the time]\n\nI wasnt sure if i believed all the hate or mixed stuff for this game, i didnt want to buy it full price just to be yk safe and oh my god i am glad i did. Who thought this was worth priced at 90$. W H O. bcuz this is barely even worth 50$ or even maybe 40$. for what i got it at (10$) its a decent deal for a game. BUT why is the handling so inconsistently weird and flip floppily floaty; one moment ive dealing with a weighty car that feels alr and next im driving a floaty speedboat; all from the SAME vehicle. the cops are inconsistently a joke and then not (cop chatter is also, not that great? idk) if feels like your cars are either the strongest thing in existance or as weak as a hair strand, how does grazing a car just barely completely obliterate me. the story.. tbh idk if i dislike it or not, all ik is is that has a weak villain/rival thing idk; yas whatever her name is, she just seems petty for no reason (love Rydell) the writing is eh, i dont mind it but man is it cringe sometimes (esp tess, also is it just me or does asap rocky sound like half asleep, no offense he just doesnt feel into it at all)\n\nthe visuals (on all fronts; style, presentation, vibe, artstyle whatever) are the only awesome thing abt this that i can rlly think of (besides the customization, its always great) but yeah geninuely beautiful graphics but this game is not it for me, heres to hoping the next installment is like nfs heat or just better than this (the effects are cool too ig, i dig em) gonna try and play this more? maybe i'll change my mind? but this is just not it.",

Also if we compared the modern era of NFS games (NFS2015, Payback, Heat, Unbound) Unbound is the worst, Even Payback is  better than this s**t. Instead of focusing on the cars, the vibe, and the player mechanism, they went for this weird cartoony style that just doesn’t fit NFS at all. The car control is honestly terrible. The cars don’t move or sway naturally like they used to, it’s like driving a toy instead of a real machine. Everything feels choppy and unresponsive. The cars look cartoonish and out of place in what’s supposed to be a serious street racing game. Story mode has cringe writing all over it, obnoxious characters and lame ass plot that you can see from a mile away. The only good thing going for this game is graphics, everything else is inferior to any other modern NFS. If you value your time and money do not purchase this. Over all experience is frustrating. If you need to enjoy modern NFS games with new hardware try to buy NFS Heat. It's the best modern NFS tittle for now. If you really need to buy Unbound buy it when 90% discount.

(Seems like Activision has just settled on HipHop for all of their games. How very inclusive of them. ba-dum-tss.)\r\n- Most tracks require drifting. Game should be called \"Need For Drift\". Some classic mindless drag racing would be a nice touch.\r\n- Limited amounts of restarts in single player. WTF is that about? -_-\r\n- No fast travel.\r\n- Limited character customization options. (Again, EA is supposed to be inclusive but there are no brown dudes. Only pale white and dark black men.\r\n- A lot of cars and customization options behind paywalls. Typical EA bull***t that we all hate and they keep doing.\r\n- There is a Battle Pass. -_-\r\n\r\nAll that being said...\r\n\r\nI've been playing Need For Speed since the first one with Underground 2 being the GOAT. \"Unbound\" feels very bound and restricted with very little activities and starter cars that handle well but struggle to make first or even second place. I watch NPC opponents crash then pass me while I have a perfect run. Police vehicles appear in front of you out of thin air. This game is basically Heat 2 but Heat is a little better. I would have been pissed if I bought this game full price but I just bought this game and NFS Heat Deluxe Edition on sale at 90% off for the bargain bin price of $6.99 each. If you have been playing games for as long as I have you know of the deterioration of big name video game companies like EA and that you should never pay full price for their bull***t.

      "review": "Extremely unbalanced difficulty. Some races you are miles ahead and some miles behind for no apparent reason. The first drift events are impossible on the highest difficulty no matter how amazingly you drift but the obstacle events are so easy that you get 1st place for messing everything up. I have bought every drift upgrade for my car and set the handling slider as drifty as possible and I still get last or 3rd even though I get 1st easily for every other event. The amount of upgrades and drift seems to make no difference whatsoever as they did not balance the game in the slightest. It feels like they never tested or even tried to balance any of it.\n\nThe bets you can make at the start of each race make no sense either. I always place the maximum bet which is Justicia and for some reason she always comes last. Why would the highest bet on the racer with the best car always come last!? NOTHING has been balanced or makes ANY sense in this game whatsoever. Its just broken.\n\nCop chases are also unbalanced and way too easy up to level 4 heat and then you reach 5 and are stuck in chases for 30+ minutes with police spawning constantly appearing out of nowhere. Its not difficult but it is infuriating, exhausting and incredibly time wasting.\n\nRace retrys are limited even on the easiest mode. Surely people who want an easy mode are allowed to learn the game and race tracks without being punished and penalised? Nope! I played on the hardest difficulty and there are only 2 restarts per day for me! If a random crash out of your control happens then sadly you are out of luck and must suffer the consequences. No amount of skill will change a thing. One race I went over a jump and crashed into a bridge mid air so I lost my first place and could no nothing about it. Seems like bad placement of the bridge to me but I guess thats my fault for wanting to go over the jump that was clearly designed to be used...\n\nThe map never opens on your location so you constantly have to find yourself which is annoying as hell. The mini map and main map are terribly designed. The mini map is too zoomed in to see upcoming police and the main map does not deal with challenge information very well at all. You have to hover over every single challenge just to see which ones you have completed and what star rating you have achieved if any. A colour code would have been far easier and quicker to use.\n\nI am sure I have missed many more things wrong with this game but the sad thing is that it could have been really good if they just balanced and tweaked everything properly. The base game and graphics are ok apart from the awful pop in but they couldnt be bothered to polish the game off leading to a terrible experience overall.",

      "review": "Need for Speed Unbound was a total disaster and for a good reason. \n\nStory Mode: It's not a very good strongpoint for this title. I enjoyed playing single player once, never came back to it again. Your car progress doesn't save from single player to multiplayer like in it's predecesor Need for Speed Heat. It's understandable, for multiplayer balancing purposes i reckon, but then you have to grind an another process in order to get vehicles. As for, this title has one of the biggest dissapointments when it comes to collaboration with famous people, A$AP Rocky. I expected that A$AP Rocky would have a lot bigger role in this game, yet he's just a side character and he's pretty much completely irrelevant. Justice for A$AP man. It's story ? I guess it's tolerable at the very least. I won't spoil stuff, but the plot was very strange, especially at the end of the game. Unsatisfying end to the story mode. \n\n\nMultiplayer: At launch, it was a complete disaster. Basically, it was just a \"free roam\" like in Payback. EA tried to change it, made some progress here and there, but just like Heat, it was abandoned once again. They tried to make a NFS title that would have a live support. It doesn't really work with NFS titles. Simply, it would be something like \"a Forza Horizon clone\" if you get me (no hate towards Forza, but i think we can all agree that we are sick of these street racing games, that don't even represent street racing properly).\n\n\nCustomization: This is a pretty good strongpoint for Unbound. I liked some of the customization and aftermarket parts that were available. Hell, you can even remove bumpers this time ! Customization is pretty okay, but nothing THAT special... except they tried to make something special. You see, i don't hate these effects when you either, go flying or use burst nitrous because at the end of the day, NFS is an arcade racing game. BUT HOLY, THE FACT THAT WE COULDN'T DISABLE THEM WAS ATROCIOUS. Sometimes, simple effects are the best ones.\n\n\nArtstyle: Not a big fan of the cartoon artstyle. I won't criticise it that much because i don't really understand the whole art thing. I guess it's okay to see, that they tried something new ? \n\n\nMicrotranscations: Guys, it's EA. Of course they will implement an offer into every possible corner visible. Expensive, irrelevant, uninteresting. Simply, not worth it. \n\n\nDLC'S: Pretty much the same case like microtransactions. Expensive and lazy content.\n\n\nDear Electronic Arts,\nIf you want to make a street racing game, AND if you want to actually succeed making a good title, then please, take Need for Speed Unbound as a good reason of what NOT to do as a representation of a street racing game. It's nothing else but a gigantic pile of dogsh*t. It's okay to listen to the community once a while, to get you some ideas, of what the people actually want. We don't want an another game like this ever again.",

Aside from the graphics, nearly EVERYTHING is a downgrade over Heat.\n\n• Soundtrack: There are probably a couple of songs that fit the theme of a racing game; the rest are either forgettable or straight-up slop with no effort put into them.\n\n• Story: Mediocre at best, irritating at worst.\n\n• Car sounds: A muffled & quieter version of Heat’s.\n\n• Cop presence/AI behaviour: Less aggressive, dumber, and slower than in Heat while also being painfully difficult to get around them at high heat levels because they spawn LITERALLY EVERYWHERE WITH HELICOPTERS. The cop sighting system is pretty cool, though.\n\n• Singleplayer campaign structure/replayability: The week system could work in theory, but it falls flat on its face with its execution as it basically allows you to skip certain days without any downsides. Also, I REALLY dislike the fact that you can only choose from events that are available on certain days instead of all of them being available at once. It doesn't even show which events you've already completed.\n\n• Difficulty/racing AI behaviour: Utterly unbalanced, especially in S+ events because none of your opponents' cars are properly upgraded to keep up with you, even though they're actually capable of driving well.\n\n• Handling physics: Somehow nearly as bad as NFS 2015's physics. Drifting is essentially a death sentence because the ability to countersteer is practically nonexistent. Gripping through corners doesn't feel great either because it feels like you're driving on rails with the random chance of spinning out with no control over it. Certain cars cannot go through bumps without frantically bouncing and often going airborne. To top all that off, most cars can also feel weirdly snappy, even on the lowest steering sensitivity setting.\n\n• DLC/monetisation/content updates: What the actual f**k. A large chunk of all the paid DLC content is multiplayer-focused in a battlepass-like system which were initially sold for atrocious prices. And of course, the singeplayer mode got none of the new cool gamemodes, other than the mostly underwhelming cars.\n\nCan absolutely recommend... avoiding this one, unless it's on a 90% sale and you want to mod the living hell out of it.",

I just had a hour and a half chase, repaired almost 20 times by sheer luck, and could NOT lose them whatsoever. They rubber band insanely, can't outrun them with high speed, and couldn't lose them EVEN WITH JUMPS OVER A LAKE.

      "review": "this is the worst racing game ive ever touched, and the worst need for speed game ive ever played. so far im only halfway into the story on hard mode and it's been nothing but miserable. you barely win any cash from races, there's barely any new cars to buy from the same roster they've had since 2016, arguably worse customization, and the driving itself is unbearable. why is a hypercar with some of the most downforce drag compared to almost every car drifting from nothing but tapping the gas on a slight turn? i've lost multiple races because i've used restarts trying to get the max profit otherwise i can't afford a simple upgrade, and the cars you can win from races are only good for selling profit since theyre not only extremely painful to drive but disgusting to look at, like a 7 year old got a hold of a box of crayons and decided to draw a car from memory. don't buy this game if you want a racing game, get forza 5 instead, or play any other need for speed. the fall off of this series is laughable, i don't get how this company went from making nfs most wanted and nfs heat to this garbage.",
