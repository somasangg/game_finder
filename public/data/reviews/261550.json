With new mechanics, new ways to explore, and other new content added by both the update and the DLC, this game feels fresh. I expect to continue enjoying this as a top game on my list.\n\nI want to make note of those who complain about the DLC price. Game development is not free. As Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord has been avaliable for quite some time, paying for the amount of content War Sails provides is quite reasonable. We all have bills to pay, including companies.\n\nThank you for a great game and an awesome DLC!",

      "review": "Owning every M&B title ever released i am very pleased with what Taleworlds has delivered here, minus a few minor details.\nStory was never M&Bs strong point, which is a good thing in my opinion. Instead the game focuses on building armies and fighting medival battles while (hopefully) expanding an ever growing dynasty kingdom on the grand strategy board.\nMy main points of critique are:\n\n1. Technically the game has only become more of what it already was (not a bad thing as well), while only adding very few improved battlefield mechanics and still heavily lacking more important ones, like: Better formations (okay, we do get a minor improvement here and it seems to have taken a substantial amount of work, but...bruh), RTS Camera (can be modded in though), and/or not even a map that could be used to give tactical orders (M&B 1 actually had this).\nOn top of that you are not even able to assign troops to formations yourself any more, which means that we even made a loss on that end. Not a massive one, but it was useful for leveling up troops or protecting more vulnerable units.\n\n2. Strategically very stupid AI.\nLeaders will declare war and sign peace treaties at random for no apparent reason.\nDeclaring a war in the real world is a very serious business that will draw existential repercussions. In M&B, Leaders seemingly will declare war because they got up with the wrong leg in the morning and sign a peace treaty because a ray of sunshine tickled them just right.\nThey have no deeper strategic goals, no revenge to take, no damsel to rescue, no cultural difference to equalize, no barbarians to civilize, no faith to spread, and no ambition to greatness or starving population to feed and settle.\nOr... well they actually DO have all these things, but they won't act on it.\n\nAnd while this does of course offer plenty of moral justification for the player to become the next Ghengis Khan/Alexander/Cesar/Habsburger and brutally overthrow all those petty minds and rule in their stead, it makes the entire interaction with other lords and leaders rather pointless and bland.\nWhy waste time on improving relations with a noble when i will just chop their head off in a later campaign to conquer their homeland anyways?\n\n3. No reinforcements, battles take place in a timeless void.\nAs is, and was with all previous titles, you can just wait until a 1000+ men strong army disbands and splits up into its constituent groups to attack nicely sized 120 men strong chunks of troops with your 300 men strong group. So long as the other groups are not within a certain very limited radius around that group they will not intervene, allowing you to slaughter most of the chunks one after the other without having to fear facing off aginst overwhelming odds.\nIt would have been great at this point if surrounding groups within a larger radius would (if quantities allowed) get the call to move to that battle and arrived on the scene with a delay - or at least be underway and therefore closer to the player if the battle was over before they arrived.\nIn battle a timer could be displayed for each group's arrival time, simulating progression of time and troop movements as the battle wages.\nA system like that was used in \"Freeman\", and while the game was otherwise a complete failure, they at least understood that this was an essential realism enhancement for M&B-style games.\n\nAnyways, my 1st world complaints aside: I am very happy with the depth that is theoretically possible in terms of kingdom management, NPC-Relations, Diplomacy, Strategy and Tactics... once modders start/continue fleshing all of these things out.\nTo that end it would be very helpful if Taleworlds didn't fubar all their efforts with every second patch though.\n\nA lot of awesome things have been added to this franchise, graphics are very okay compared to older titles, mechanics have seen a serious upgrade, the entire game feels a lot better rounded than previous titles, and for every loss we had to take we got richly compensated with new features and mechanics that really show the developers dedication and passion behind this game.\n\n7/10 would butter again.",

What makes me question if i would recommend or not, is TaleWorlds greed in launching a halfbaked game that even 5 years after launch still has many issues and now they launched a half baked DLC (still fun) but still much to improve and considering the history of the company, they will leave it so the modding community \"fixes it\" for them.\r\n\r\n[b]TL;DR: TaleWorld sucks, native game kinda bad, but modding community saved this game.[/b]",

Every major mechanic — from combat to diplomacy to economy — keeps getting refined and improved over time, and the game feels better with every update. The optimization is genuinely impressive too — the game runs smoothly even during massive battles and complex simulations.\n\nThere’s almost nothing like Bannerlord on the market. It stands alone as a massive, living sandbox where you decide who you want to be. A humble trader traveling between towns, a feared warlord crushing empires, a petty thief building an underground network, or a rising noble carving out a dynasty — the game never tells you “no.” Your imagination sets the limits.\n\nOn top of that, Bannerlord is an incredible foundation for mods. Whatever theme, era, or playstyle you can think of, someone has probably made (or is making) a mod for it. The possibilities are endless.\n\nIf you love true RPG freedom, emergent storytelling, and the feeling that the world reacts naturally to your choices, Bannerlord is absolutely worth your time.

It blends large‑scale battles, political intrigue, and personal adventure into a sprawling simulation that feels alive. Few games give you this much freedom to write your own story in steel and strategy.\n\n🎮 Categories\nGameplay: A mix of tactical army management, real‑time combat, and sandbox freedom. You can fight as a lone warrior or command hundreds in massive sieges.\n\nAtmosphere & Visuals: Expansive medieval landscapes, bustling towns, and epic battlefields create a believable world.\n\nProgression: From small skirmishes to ruling entire realms, progression feels organic and rewarding.\n\nPerformance: Generally stable, though large battles can tax weaker systems.\n\nImmersion: Diplomacy, trade, and politics add depth beyond combat, making every decision feel impactful.\n\n✅ Positives\nMassive battles with hundreds of soldiers, offering unmatched medieval combat scale\n\nDeep sandbox freedom: fight, trade, rule, or simply roam the world\n\nOrganic progression from mercenary to lord, with meaningful choices along the way\n\nStrong modding community that expands replayability\n\nPolitical intrigue and kingdom management add layers beyond combat\n\n❌ Negatives\nAI can feel clumsy in large battles, sometimes breaking immersion\n\nDiplomacy and politics, while deep, can be slow or repetitive\n\nPerformance dips in huge sieges on mid‑range PCs\n\nSome mechanics (like trading or clan management) can feel grindy over time\n\nEarly game pacing may frustrate newcomers before armies and kingdoms become accessible\n\n🎯 Verdict\nBannerlord is a medieval sandbox masterpiece, offering freedom, scale, and depth that few games can match. Whether you want to lead armies, rule kingdoms, or simply live the life of a wandering knight, the game delivers endless stories. While AI quirks and grind can slow things down, the sheer scope and replayability make it a must‑play for fans of strategy and medieval combat.\n\n⭐ Highly Recommended for players who love grand battles, political intrigue, and open‑ended adventures",

The hitboxing is TIGHT, the battles are huge and tactical, the map feels alive.  And the new 1.3+ patch has improved the game.  But, there are things I would've told myself:\n\n1. The game has a lot of mechanics, but it doesn't explain all of them.  You'll need to watch guides on YouTube to play well, start on the lowest difficulty setting.  The directional blocking is simple to learn, hard to master.  For advanced battlefield tactics, the best source is TacticalEnlightenment on YouTube.  Don't declare your own kingdom unless you have >100k gold.  Don't start beheading nobles unless you don't mind having enemies.\n\n2.  You don't need to conquer all of Calradia, that's boring.  Most people find being a mercenary more fun.  This is a sandbox game, do whatever you feel like doing.\n\n3.  This game has timewasting RPG mechanics.  A younger me tolerated that garbage (in Warband), but older me has no tolerance for it.  You can enable \"fast mode\" settings to speed up leveling, and use console commands to give a bunch of focus points.  Don't feel obligated to waste your own time with a shallow game mechanic (RPG leveling).\n\nI highly recommend this game.  We (the fans) often feel it \"could've been the greatest game ever, but mistakes were made\".  I also think that.  But there's still nothing else, like the Mount and Blade series.",

A more classic story mode would have been a nice addition or at least a clearer pathway towards getting castles and becoming a bigshot would be nice. \n\nHaving said all that, it's fun as fuck and it has the feel of a strategy game while being surprisingly accessible, so it's great for a smoothbrain like myself",

Also, there is a buggy economy system in the game because if there is a city that belongs to you, when you sell the captive lords there, they go to the dungeon and we can buy them from the dungeon and sell them again, so there is no shortage of money and in my opinion, this bug spoils the fun of the game, so when we have a single city, there is a problem of money after a while. We never pull it, take it from the dungeon and sell it back from the inn, it is very simple. Apart from that, the game has done everything perfectly, and the story is a special one.

I have over 1,600 hours in it, and it's been a blast playing this ever since I discovered it in 2024.\nSo naturally, seeing the the new expansion with naval combat, I bought the DLC the moment it became available.\nHowever, alongside this DLC I have seen some glaring problems in my gameplay that I could simply not ignore, and hopefully Taleworlds developers listen to my plight and release a few patch notes to address these issues.\nI haven't dwelled too much on War Sails, for me the naval combat and ship customization looks alright.\nWhat my concerns are on the performance side of things. I have noticed bugs from the Beta versions that the new 1.3.4- 1.3.5 patches carry on. I will list here what I have encountered:\n\n-When kicking or bashing an enemy in combat, my cursor freezes, whereas in 1.2.12 I had no such issues.\n-Foliage/ grass does not move when I step on it. Maybe it's a nitpicky thing, but collisions worked just fine in the previous versions before the Betas.\n-There is a significant decline in performance in 1.3.5 compared to 1.2.12. While I understand that War Sails introduces new mechanics and assets into the game, some empty maps I have fought on on Empire plains or Sturgian hills that previously ran just fine now see sudden FPS drops, that could go as low as -20 or -30 FPS, simply staring at the sun or into the ground. My PC setup isn't the latest, but it isn't a complete potato either. (GTX 1080 TI, 16 GBs of Ram, 2 RAM slots with 2660mhz speed, i5 8600-K processor with 6 cores. I run the game on a SSD for faster loading times.)\n-Sometimes when I open the game menu, it overlaps with my game map and the text glitches through. I have not encountered this bug often, so I don't know what to say.\n-The settings menu is laggy and not as smooth compared to 1.2.12.\n-Ambient occlusion sometimes shows works and sometimes doesn't. I had to switch the setting on and off multiple times.\n-In the formation menu before battles, sometimes when I place my divisions they unselect themselves and I have to re-select them every time I change the formation of my troops.\n-Troop divisions used to have a green highlight around their bodies in 1.2.12 when you selected them. Now, it only shows the circular clan icons above their heads. I am not sure if this is by design or another bug.\n\nEdit: I have only remembered this now, and I felt like I needed to add: I notice a distinct lack of tournaments in the new 1.3.4-1.3.7 patches compared to the previous versions. I can seldom find one when lack of money/ reputation in the beginning is a concern. I hope this doesn't remain by design, or at the very least their frequency is adjusted to be once a few days.\n\nIf possible, Talewords, please address my concerns above and release a few patches to improve performance and tinker with the bugs. I will not downrate this out of sheer anger or bias, but in hopes this comment is reached out to easier.\n\nCheers!",

But I simply cannot give it a positive review because of how lazy and corrupt the developers are. It has been 5 years since the game came out early access and many of the same issues, and lack of content remains. But why is that? Well the developers are based in Turkey, a country that subsidizes game development in hopes of inspiring more people to develop games and thus diversifying the Turkish economy and Turkish influence (think soft power). The devs don't have an incentive to continue to update the game significantly, they'll do a patch here and there and technically they are \"developing\" and thus are entitled to receive subsidies. This is like going to work and if you clock in and go to the bathroom and clock out and go home you get paid for a full day. \n\nIt's a cool concept, truly but it is squandered in the most horrific fashion. The fact that war sails has released recently may give hope that they will continue to develop the game through DLC (think paradox) and my goodness I would much prefer that and pay to see this games full potential. But the fact of the matter is nobody knows what the hell these developers are doing they go radio silent for months, years and then boom war sails DLC comes out. And they have always been like this throughout the decade long development of this game. When you buy a game from a developer, it is like making a contract. Whether that entails an early access will become fully fleshed out release, or a release will get the patches it needs through the years and better yet DLC/Update to enhance said game. But you simply cannot trust these developers with a contract because they're like the flaky friend that ghosts you for no reason and then texts you out of the blue. \n\nThe only thing this game has going for it are voice commands (through mods it is possible), graphics, and a slightly more fleshsed out overall system for the world. I will thus continue to play Mount and Blade: Warband to scratch my itch instead of Bannerlord and I hope that one day I can come back to this game actually being improved and fleshed out the way it was promised to be.",

However, the developer, TaleWorlds, released no updates for around 2 years straight only keeping their activity feed alive by showcasing \"community tales\" which no one gave a damn about or cared for. For a game that has such a solid foundation it is disappointing that the developers dropped the ball so hard. Further exacerbating the root problem is that the late game-gameplay is repetitive and bland, the first time you amass the wealth and troops to create your own kingdom with 4 settlements you have done all the base game has to offer and you are practically forced to move on to mods. Unpaid modders have gone above and beyond keeping this game alive with all of their hard work and effort which is where this game really shines. But on the side of TaleWorlds the half baked DLC of war sails is, in my opinion, too little too late. If it was up to me the modding community would get half of the revenue of all future sales of Bannerlord and even then it wouldnt reflect how much they have contributed to Bannerlord. I want to conclude that yes, I did enjoy the basegame Bannerlord for the first few years when it held promise but I cannot positively review a dev team that has purposefully ignored their fan base for literal years and then try to make up for it with a DLC that is overpriced and underwhelming.",

The actual combat system—duels and fighting as your character—is top-tier, and it is fun growing a warband slowly and pursuing whatever goals you want. That being said, this game has a lot of problems, and the devs aren’t really keen on fixing them, instead doing the now-unfortunately common practice of letting mod makers do all the work. Before the new DLC was announced, the last update was in December 2024, which was basically a nothing patch. This September, they finally released an actual patch that included genuine fixes—such as soldiers actually using pikes, which has been a problem forever. Though the cynic in me can’t help but feel like they only released something so people might actually buy the new DLC. That’s kind of why I’m making this review. But before I get too off-track, I’ll talk about my main gripes with the base game (although the DLC feels more like a mod than an actual expansion). A lot of the game feels really barebones in places, such as diplomacy and dialogue in general. I’m also not a big fan of the quests. I feel like the siege AI could be improved, especially with ladders. I’ve only just started playing again because there was a really annoying bug where the enemy AI would get stuck in a wall during a siege, making it impossible to win. I believe they fixed it in the recent update, but it was in the game for far too long. I’m kind of rambling and not making much sense, so I’ll just cut to the DLC portion. It feels like they took a page out of Paradox’s playbook—with paying shills and everything. It adds one new mechanic, a new kingdom (that only has four cities and is far away from anyone else, by the way), and a whole lot of new bugs. Since I do not support that kind of behavior, I haven’t bought the DLC, so take my opinion with a grain of salt—I can only go off what others have posted. \r\n\r\nThis is one of those games that is so close to being great. The devs just need fire under their feet to stop being lazy and get their shit together.",

      "review": "Mount & Blade II — Bannerlord: A promising foundation that never truly evolves.\n\nI’ve had a long love–hate relationship with Bannerlord. Over the years, I hoped the series would grow beyond its rough foundations, especially given its enormous potential and underrepresented niche. Unfortunately, despite better graphics and some refinements, Bannerlord feels almost identical to its predecessors—and not in a good way. The investment and iteration from game to game are barely noticeable.\n\nBannerlord is marketed as a fusion of RPG and grand strategy, yet it struggles to capitalize on either side of that formula. Instead, it leans heavily on the same janky RPG systems while giving only surface-level attention to the strategic layer.\n\nCombat: Simple, Abusable, and AI-Dependent\n\nThe melee system remains basic but incredibly exploitable. Combat often encourages gimmicks—horse-archer spam, kick-throwing exploits, and other cheesy tactics—because the AI and systems themselves simply can’t respond intelligently.\n\nTroops struggle with even rudimentary battlefield behavior. They rarely do anything beyond facing the enemy, and even that fails at times. The player can abuse this endlessly: form a line, let the enemy crash into it, circle behind, and clean house. Only the occasional stray soldier will peel off to bother you, and it’s usually an easy 1v1.\n\nThe same issues plague formations. Under arrow fire, shield walls don’t adjust, reposition, or sidestep; they just march directly forward. Unless the player micromanages every tiny movement, units expose themselves to damage because the AI can’t handle nuanced positioning.\n\nStrategic Layer: Restrictive and Unrewarding\n\nDiplomacy and faction gameplay feel more like dice rolls than strategy. Instead of fixing weak AI, the developers added strict limitations to the player to prevent easy steamrolling. Influence costs, arbitrary restrictions, and slow progression all work to hold you back, not because it’s strategically meaningful, but because the AI needs guardrails to survive.\n\nRecent updates have made things worse by giving AI parties near-constant access to fully trained end-tier troops. Meanwhile, the player deals with attrition and a rotating cast of recruits, exposing major faction imbalances. After three years, some cultures still lack meaningful weaknesses while others have glaring ones.\n\nEven leveling your clan to field more parties doesn’t solve the issue. Companion-led parties act autonomously—often suicidally. They wander into bad fights, get absorbed into other lords’ armies, or just sit idle. You end up grinding until you become a one-person superpower, at which point challenge evaporates.\n\nProgression: Repetitive and Grind-Heavy\n\nAll these systems funnel the player toward one outcome: grind until you personally overpower the world. Strategy takes a back seat to RPG stat-building until you reach a point where you can brute-force everything. Bannerlord increasingly feels less like a strategic sandbox and more like an RPG grindfest with a little strategy sprinkled on top.\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nBannerlord is best enjoyed by players who want an RPG world where they can slowly build themselves into an unstoppable force—similar to games like Kenshi. If that’s your goal, Bannerlord delivers a satisfying power fantasy.\n\nBut those seeking meaningful grand strategy, smart AI, or evolving systems will find the experience lacking. After years of development and three years on the market, the game still relies on mods and community work to reach the depth it should’ve had at launch.\n\nWith new competitors appearing in the genre, I can only hope TaleWorlds steps up and finally delivers the rich, strategic experience Bannerlord has always promised but never quite realized.",

Also Patrols!\nCON: Took away and changed some mechanics that don't make sense:\n\n1. Great that I can sneak in to bandit camps, but why remove the ability to go swords a blazing. I can only \"send\" my guys to do the dirty work. If it's a matter of balance just force 5-7 troops like an elite squad style vs waves of enemies or something.\n2. Loot (quantity) is nerfed. I understand maybe it's to force players to do more \"economy\" like caravans or as a short nerf to blacksmithing, but it doesn't make sense. If you're in a 200+ vs 200+ mini battle chasing some Defectors or another squad you only get 10 swords?!? Just from the guys that I lost and picking up THEIR stuff, I should have more loot. If you want to nerf it, lower the quality of equipment which is the equivalent of \"it's good but it broke\".\n3. Odd AI behavior in Sandbox. Kingdoms declare war but then do nothing. I was an Aserai merc then Khuzaits declared war on Aserai, I was like \"Great, time to take back Husn Fulq.\" (Mind you Aserai were in peace.) How many armies did the Aserai raise? Zero. How many armies did Khuzaits send? Zero. Whut?!? But Aserai were all gung ho to declare war on countries all the way across the sea. Wouldn't it make more sense for kingdoms to focus on their land neighbors (if unallied, or they've taken a default city). Why is the AI prioritizing taking a poorer city across the sea when you have a taken \"base\" city just sitting undefended?!?\n4. (EDIT) Speaking of AI, since there are supposed to be alliances now, have these kingdoms ever heard of the enemy of my enemy is my friend? Nope! In Calaradia, the enemy of my enemy is also my enemy. Talk about snowballing.\n5. (EDIT) More AI Shenanigans, so basically for some reason, if you start a seige and a bigger army joins you to help - for some reason the machine thinks that they're in charge of the bombardment and siege engines now... But then the other army  does nothing. You then have to leave and rejoin your own siege. It's either that or Caladog is just a passive-aggressive MFer.\n\n-- These are more requests or rants --\n\nA. Ships and inventory. If you're counting my inventory weight, can I at least use MY ships as floating warehouses. It's like I have to dock for a raid or ambush, and the captain goes \"bring ALL your grain too\", \"bruh we're only here for a day tops\".\nB. Do the Devs just love the Vlandians and Khuzaits, or do they just hate Sturgia? They split Sturgia in two so UNLESS you play sailing ASAP, it's pretty worthless to ever align with. Which is fine for the Nords with their all amphibian units but Sturgia, those guys can F themselves. Why would Sturgians even use horses at this point when it adds to the ship carry weight.\nC. Speaking of the Nords, who's the genius who thought to put the \"all infantry\" (aka, vulnerable to cavalry) Nords with their only land border to the Khuzaits?!?\n\nWill I keep playing? Yes.

TaleWorlds Entertainment created Warband, a game that I'd say is groundbreaking and quite revolutionary at the very least, it went on to become very popular and spawned a huge community of modders; and then these very same developer created Bannerlord.\n\nBannerlord on its own by no means is a bad game; putting aside the various bugs and glitches for a minute it has good graphics, decent battle system, etc etc. People new to the Mount & Blade franchise would enjoy vanilla Bannerlord, and probably more after trying out the mods. The problem starts when Bannerlord is compared to its predecessor. Yeah, Warband is just [i]that[/i] good, it's like comparing a [b]Beef Wellington[/b] to the [b]feces[/b] it became later in the day.\n\nMy first 4 hours of playing vanilla Warband, I was smitten; there were so many things to do, an intricate system to learn about, so many things to try out. Meanwhile my first 4 hours of playing Bannerlord, I was bored. Nothing is happening on the map, even after I activated the cheat mode to teleport around the map and max scouting stat, I see nothing is happening. No lords battling bandits, no caravans battling looters, heck I barely seen any bandits or looters roaming around. I see things happening in the log though, but that's it, just some flavoured text.\n\nHow did this come to pass from the very same developers who created Warband? Not to mention the biggest elephant in the room, that is, for a game propped by modding community for years, every time there's an update it always break the mods.\n\nBut hey, I heard rumors that these people are some greedy corrupt w$nkers who updates the game once in a while simply just to get the grant from their government going--to prove to their government that they're still in the business, so I won't put much hope in the future of this game and the franchise as a whole. Regardless, I won't be refunding this game, I am still quite fond of the modding community so I'll wait a while until the mods are compatible with War Sails DLC and playable.",

Even after this I still find most elements janky, buggy and it just feels random rather than being based on skill. Battle commands also feel very limited and there really isn't enough flexibility in the battles to make it feel like a good tactical war simulator. It definitely isn't Total War. AI tactics aren't particularly advanced either. It feels like a cross between a war simulator and first person medieval simulator and is good at neither. Game balance also seems to be a massive problem, with archers being massively OP.\nCampaign options also feel oddly limited and there isn't enough flexibility in diplomacy to make it a good strategy simulator. Tutorial's are terrible and nothing in the game seems remotely intuitive or straightforward. Luckily there is a very active community and plenty of youtube videos without which this game would be indecipherable. \nThe last straw was the Warsails expansion.- and the more I play and discover the worse it gets. No attempt to fix old problems or polish substandard features. Instead they have made a load of gameplay changes that no-one wanted. The early game has now gone from tough but enjoyable to a total grind with very limited options. Been trying to work my way through the stealth tutorial for about 3 hours. Needed to watch multiple online guides and even then it just feels random and unpolished.
