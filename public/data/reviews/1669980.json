      "review": "Although my playtime is about 16.3 hours as of writing this review, I would say it is likely closer to 14 hours as I left the computer on with the game running. That was enough time to complete one run (from being a toddler to an adult) while reading almost all dialogue and another run skipping almost all dialogue.\n\n In this game, you have the choice to:\n- capture animals and horses\n- train said horses\n- race said horses\n- show said horses in a beauty contest\n- adventure through four different areas in a demon-riddled fores\n- romance almost everyone and take them out on dates\n- receive special gifts from characters with a high enough relationship score\n- act in plays\n- watch movies\n- work at the bathhouse\n- mingle with the elite in banquets\n- draw sketches\n- paint paintings\n- study\n- enact order as a vigilante in a dark alleyway\n- fish\n- go boating\n- grow crops\n- cook dishes\n- read books\n- manage a school schedule\n- purchase weapons clothing, and a very small assortment of goods related to farming, horseback riding and showing, and alchemy\n- decorate your room\n- dress up\n- chat and gift all characters items\n- follow alongside your Hogwarts-style house via knighthood\n- be either a good or bad father\n- debate and/or fight almost everyone\n- repent your inner darkness\n- sell materials and cooked goods\n- be tutored by the church\n- attend and compete in festivals\n\nThere are some aspects, like performing developmental exercises as a toddler, that are locked to age. It feels like there is a decent enough progression to growing up and unlocking more things to do in the game. \n\nDialogue was not like old Harvest Moon games or even Stardew Valley, where it becomes repetitive after a certain point when trying to raise your relationship with characters. I REALLY appreciated and commend Egg Hatcher for putting such varied dialogue. My first run through consistently felt new because of this despite repetitive activities I will dive into in a moment because I kept learning a little something about each character or the overarching subplots. However, I would be remiss to not point out the awkward translation from, what I'm guessing is Mandarin to English.\n\nFor example, when you take a character out on a date, there is an option at the end to, what I believe is, to essentially seal the deal with a romantic or flirtatious moment. I cannot remember what the actual word option was called, but it was not \"flirt\" or something similar. I only know this because I would often need to give the character something like a flower to unlock it, and then they blushed whenever I clicked it. I believe these translation issues likely dumbed down some nice writing for not only the dates, but the plot overall as well. I know this game has good writing because when you are acting in a play, you have to choose a text box option that fits the mood.\n\nFor example, the mood would be: Romantic.\n\nThe correct option would be something like:\n\nIf my love for you is the ocean, then you are the island I gently kiss with my waves.\n\nOkay, okay, I know I'm not writing peak itself here, but y'all get the point. There were genuinely nice moments indicating nice writing despite the somewhat clunky translation. However, I still feel like the game is very easy to play and understand despite my gripes with the translation. Just don't give it to someone genuinely trying to learn English because it will seem strange. I wanted to go in-depth on this aspect just in case someone reading this intended to play it in English with English not being on a level of being able to put the puzzle pieces together.\n\nThe plot itself was definitely basic. There was a subplot involving feathers I feel was not explored enough. Either I somehow did not explore this aspect enough (as I did not play the evil route) or it was not delved into deeply enough for me. \n\nActually, a lot of parts of the game felt rather surface level. For example, the fishing is just clicking fish in a pond and does not have an aspect with reeling in the fish like with Stardew Valley's bar or Animal Crossing's timing restrictions, and your companions may start as a nice add-on to adventuring but they quickly become just an extra body when you outpace them, even when you level them to your level. Most activities are basically waiting for a loading bar to complete alongside a cutesy animation. \n\nThe companions part actually was so rough to work through as there was a part that, because of my level, was marked \"easy\" to complete while adventuring, but because of how the boss fight is conducted, you NEED other adventurers rather than just yourself. They just kept dying even though I was much more than just powerful enough to defeat it on my own, technically. You legitimately HAVE to get better weapons via Alchemy, which is already a pretty random process. (Despite me not having the slay 300 demons Steam achievement, I feel as though I can speak on this, as in my second run, I slayed 297.) It speaks to some balancing issues I have with the game, like how I feel as though the darkness values (you gain darkness when you do something morally wrong or dubious) should be more severe with consequences. It was too easy to simply \"repent\" almost all darkness away.\n\nI also feel like it is important to say this is NOT a gooner game. You aren't weird with your daughter. The daughter is REALLY close with the dad even as a teen, which kinda made me weirded out, but that was more on me not having the greatest relationship with my own father, I think. \n\nThe art style is cute. Clearly a lot of effort was put into it. It looks good on a 4K monitor. Music isn't annoying or bad. When you get to the end of the first run, you can see how many endings there are, and there seem to be a LOT more than what I was expecting. I literally never have found myself saying this, but if less endings meant some of the grinding within the game were more fleshed out mini-games or other parts, like more clothing to wear or more different types of fishes to catch, I would take it.\n\nAll of this being said, if you liked the choosing aspect of Telltale Games (but not the combat or having to be quick to choose), enjoy games where number goes up makes you happy (like Apotheon before it became incredibly problematic and completely changed), BitLife, or visual novels, I feel like this is the game for you. I did have a decent amount of issues with it, but I genuinely feel like if this game were released on Switch with the translation issues fixed after some advertising/being sent to some reviewers, it would be explosive in popularity. It is a little bit too chill for me, but that means everyone else who wants to potentially relax a little more than me would adore this game. I can see it being very easy to play on the Steam Deck. All aspects of the game, except for fishing, are easily playable with any controller. \n\nGenuinely, I am shocked this developer has not put out more on Steam at least. If Egg Hatcher genuinely kept making games like this, I could see them becoming one of the best for life sims ever. There are genuinely so many things to do. In this current world of some Indie games seeming incredible but extremely short especially for the price, this game will keep you occupied for hours. I tried to go quick on my second run, remember, and I still played 14 hours!!\n\nEven if you are unsure, put this game on your Steam wishlist and buy it on sale. I'm likely going to email/go to X/attempt to join the Discord of the developer, as they are clearly not the largest, and offer to help with some rewording. I recommend everyone else also KINDLY point out some grammatical, spelling, or awkwardly worded sentences.",

You make decisions and actions as her father in early game, then are demoted to just decisions once the fmc gets to around 12 years old. Then the actions are conducted by the fmc, and the currency of actions is cheese or “action points”.  There is also a mood bar which will decrease/increase with some activities. \r\n\r\nThere isn’t many voiced lines for the npcs/romance options, but all the interactions between the father and daughter are voiced (not for English).",

      "review": "I am in agony....getting every achievement in this very, VERY, thorough game is almost as hard as convincing me to do my homework on time. I have WAAAAAYYYY too many hours on Volcano Princess, and a lot of it is me having to redo long runs because I couldn't get the hyper-specific career I needed for some reason. \n\nGameplay? Amazing! There's so much to do and so much to see in VP. Gamble your life away in dice games, get your ass kicked by monsters because none of your hot waifus/husbandos want to go adventuring with you the first couple months, stat manage your daughter's skills and classes to hell and back! Embrace the life of a farmer, a horse-racer, a shady back alley explorer? Rest in the arms of the goddess to erase the darkness of your moody teen so she won't stop listening to her eye-less single father and become a cultist/prostitute/demon queen, and a whole plethora of other shady things. Debate people who are definitely smarter than you (damn you Claude!), duel people who are definitely stronger than you (damn you Lebsa!), go on dates with NPCs who are definitely too old to be going on dates with your poor unsuspecting daughter- er, what? (I'll get into that later). Embrace high society and attend parties where you have to have meaningless conversation with rich people, become an actress, work a job! A probably shady job! Become an alchemist, a painter, a- you know what I think you get it. There's a LOT to do.\n\nThe characters are all quite charming. It's fun to see how your bi-con daughter will grow up and what she'll take an interest in (we love women who also love women in this house!) and her love for her father is very sweet. The NPCs all have their own charm, the problem is a lot of the ones that shouldn't be romanceable are romanceable....like, wdym the Bard Derek has technically seen her around since she was 5 and he was a grown ass man who broke off an engagement with a fiancee he ran off with, but at the end of the game you can marry him??? This isn't even a one-off instance; the vast majority of NPCs that Rose can sweep of their digital feet are quite a bit older which isn't inherently a problem until you realize she's been around them since she was a minor....yikes. That's not even mentioning the NPC who WAS my total fav when I first started the game and was woefully ignorant to the plethora of concerning tags she'd have if she was in an AO3 fanfiction.\n\nThe plot itself is self contained and not bad...until you get into the \"plot twist\" stuff which makes no sense and also causes a looootttt of red flags should you choose to romance a certain NPC who honestly shouldn't be romanceable. But unless you're insane like me and want to do everything, you can play the game multiple times over without suffering from the knowledge I now have. \n\nWHY ARE THERE SO MANY JOBS OH MY GOD??? I love the abundance of choice, but I'm in AGONY trying to collect them all. I have like 7 achievements left. \n\nThe art is very good, the CGs are also very nice. I love that one CG where Rose marries Kenneth it's very cute, also the harem end CG is fun. I like that Rose can be with one person regardless of their gender, TWO people regardless of their gender (polyamory in my sandwhich?), or half the main cast LOL. You go girl.\n\nGreat game, lots to do, lots to see, amazing art, overall quite unique as a game. I only bought it because I needed something to fill the \"Long Live the Queen\" shaped hole in my heart (still need more games like it!) but I don't regret the purchase at all.\n\nThe translation is a bit wonky, the achievements unlock incorrectly which makes it absolute agony to figure out what you still need to do, and there's so much concerning shit with the romances I'm half tempted to throw my Rose in a church and have her embrace the word of the Goddess over the love of mortal flesh...unless she seduces a priestess also significantly older than her. Cool. Why not? DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON LEBSA. DON'T BE ME! DON'T BECOME A LEBSA FAN BECAUSE SHE'S HOT! GIVE UP ON THE WHIMS OF HOT WOMEN AND EMBRACE THE LIFE OF A MASOCHISTIC STAT BUILDING MANIAC INSTEAD!!!\n\n....I'm going to go do my homework now.",

There are numerous diverse characters all coming from different backgrounds and having their own unique baggage that your daughter helps them grow from.\n\nThe game is also exceptionally well at representing how fast time goes by. Each month passes in the blink of an eye and before you know it, your daughter is already 18 and you’re already at the coming of age ceremony. It is incredibly difficult, or almost downright impossible if you slip up just a bit, to max out all friendships. This emphasizes how crucial time management is because before we know it, those years and months could just slip by. It also perfectly encapsulates the rough transition for parents when their child goes through adolescence. Like your child just stops hanging out with you. Everyday you see a new unfamiliar face at your door asking to see your daughter. Her priorities have shifted and you can only just watch and offer advice when she asks for it.\n\nThe combat system and mini games are also very entertaining, ensuring that you always have something to do. There are also numerous goals and side quests to work towards depending on which friendship you wanna max out or which lord you swore your allegiance to.\n\nThere are so many branching endings and achievements to get, and this game is like stupidly cheap. \n\nTheres so much more i wanna express but i can’t cause i just forgot or yeah whatever. i’m not a parent nor am i an expert critiquer but holy this game is a masterpiece and i absolutely love it.\n\nUh main issue i got is romance system but who cares about that anyways u should totally place this game i love it ok thats it bye.",

      "review": "[b]backlog journal (2/150): playing & reviewing all my neglected sale games[/b]\n[i]bought in jul 2023 • completed in nov 2025 (100%)[/i]\n\nvolcano princess is a parenting sim, where you play as a father raising your daughter in a fantasy medieval kingdom. you handle her daily schedule, education and hobbies. over time, she also grows through social interactions with various side characters. there are visual novel elements sprinkled in, including romance routes (you can pursue men, women, or even multiple partners). do note: some of the romanceable characters are noticeably older than the protagonist, which may be uncomfortable for some players. it’s something to be aware of before diving into certain routes. ultimately, all your choices affect her career outcome, romance ending and even your “father rating\". with 25 romance endings and over 50 career endings, there’s a huge amount of variety!\n\ni love the art style. everything is gorgeous, especially the cgs and the costumes. the relationship events are adorable, and the characters are surprisingly fleshed out for a game that isn’t mainly a dating sim. the game also has a lot more depth than i expected. you can catch and race horses, debate and duel others, work part-time at the bathhouse, paint, perform in plays, fight in dark alleys, farm, cook & lots more! the character dialogues are an unexpected charm too. the characters say different things depending on the time, season or story events (like the coming of age ceremony), and taking them out on dates to the four different venues is always cute. some scenes even had me blushing >//< also, shoutout to ze and kenneth… i’m obsessed.\n\nthere’s definitely replay value, especially if you want to 100% all the endings. the new game+ system gives you points based on achievements obtained, which you can use to boost your daughter’s stats and speed up future runs. that said, getting every ending still felt a bit grindy and towards the end it did become a bit of a slog. it took me about 10 hours for the first run and around 44 hours total to complete everything. i also wish you could save anywhere instead of only at the end of each month.\n\nthe translation is mostly okay, but some parts could be improved. a few minigame instructions confused me, i had to look up a video just to understand dice duel. however, the main story itself felt a little confusing to follow & emotionally it didn’t land for me. i was much more invested in the side characters and their interactions (their letters were so cute) than the core plot. some of the achievements are also not synced properly (e.g. you unlock achievement a in game but it unlocks achievement b on steam - you have to track your progress using the game's internal achievement instead).\n\noverall, it’s a beautiful, charming and surprisingly deep parenting sim with tons to do and lots of heart. despite a few rough edges, i loved my time with it.\n\n[code]check out what i played next at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45862522]kitten's backlog journal[/url] ♡[/code]",

      "review": "Although my playtime is about 16.3 hours as of writing this review, I would say it is likely closer to 14 hours as I left the computer on with the game running. That was enough time to complete one run (from being a toddler to an adult) while reading almost all dialogue and another run skipping almost all dialogue.\n\n In this game, you have the choice to:\n- capture animals and horses\n- train said horses\n- race said horses\n- show said horses in a beauty contest\n- adventure through four different areas in a demon-riddled fores\n- romance almost everyone and take them out on dates\n- receive special gifts from characters with a high enough relationship score\n- act in plays\n- watch movies\n- work at the bathhouse\n- mingle with the elite in banquets\n- draw sketches\n- paint paintings\n- study\n- enact order as a vigilante in a dark alleyway\n- fish\n- go boating\n- grow crops\n- cook dishes\n- read books\n- manage a school schedule\n- purchase weapons clothing, and a very small assortment of goods related to farming, horseback riding and showing, and alchemy\n- decorate your room\n- dress up\n- chat and gift all characters items\n- follow alongside your Hogwarts-style house via knighthood\n- be either a good or bad father\n- debate and/or fight almost everyone\n- repent your inner darkness\n- sell materials and cooked goods\n- be tutored by the church\n- attend and compete in festivals\n\nThere are some aspects, like performing developmental exercises as a toddler, that are locked to age. It feels like there is a decent enough progression to growing up and unlocking more things to do in the game. \n\nDialogue was not like old Harvest Moon games or even Stardew Valley, where it becomes repetitive after a certain point when trying to raise your relationship with characters. I REALLY appreciated and commend Egg Hatcher for putting such varied dialogue. My first run through consistently felt new because of this despite repetitive activities I will dive into in a moment because I kept learning a little something about each character or the overarching subplots. However, I would be remiss to not point out the awkward translation from, what I'm guessing is Mandarin to English.\n\nFor example, when you take a character out on a date, there is an option at the end to, what I believe is, to essentially seal the deal with a romantic or flirtatious moment. I cannot remember what the actual word option was called, but it was not \"flirt\" or something similar. I only know this because I would often need to give the character something like a flower to unlock it, and then they blushed whenever I clicked it. I believe these translation issues likely dumbed down some nice writing for not only the dates, but the plot overall as well. I know this game has good writing because when you are acting in a play, you have to choose a text box option that fits the mood.\n\nFor example, the mood would be: Romantic.\n\nThe correct option would be something like:\n\nIf my love for you is the ocean, then you are the island I gently kiss with my waves.\n\nOkay, okay, I know I'm not writing peak itself here, but y'all get the point. There were genuinely nice moments indicating nice writing despite the somewhat clunky translation. However, I still feel like the game is very easy to play and understand despite my gripes with the translation. Just don't give it to someone genuinely trying to learn English because it will seem strange. I wanted to go in-depth on this aspect just in case someone reading this intended to play it in English with English not being on a level of being able to put the puzzle pieces together.\n\nThe plot itself was definitely basic. There was a subplot involving feathers I feel was not explored enough. Either I somehow did not explore this aspect enough (as I did not play the evil route) or it was not delved into deeply enough for me. \n\nActually, a lot of parts of the game felt rather surface level. For example, the fishing is just clicking fish in a pond and does not have an aspect with reeling in the fish like with Stardew Valley's bar or Animal Crossing's timing restrictions, and your companions may start as a nice add-on to adventuring but they quickly become just an extra body when you outpace them, even when you level them to your level. Most activities are basically waiting for a loading bar to complete alongside a cutesy animation. \n\nThe companions part actually was so rough to work through as there was a part that, because of my level, was marked \"easy\" to complete while adventuring, but because of how the boss fight is conducted, you NEED other adventurers rather than just yourself. They just kept dying even though I was much more than just powerful enough to defeat it on my own, technically. You legitimately HAVE to get better weapons via Alchemy, which is already a pretty random process. (Despite me not having the slay 300 demons Steam achievement, I feel as though I can speak on this, as in my second run, I slayed 297.) It speaks to some balancing issues I have with the game, like how I feel as though the darkness values (you gain darkness when you do something morally wrong or dubious) should be more severe with consequences. It was too easy to simply \"repent\" almost all darkness away.\n\nI also feel like it is important to say this is NOT a gooner game. You aren't weird with your daughter. The daughter is REALLY close with the dad even as a teen, which kinda made me weirded out, but that was more on me not having the greatest relationship with my own father, I think. \n\nThe art style is cute. Clearly a lot of effort was put into it. It looks good on a 4K monitor. Music isn't annoying or bad. When you get to the end of the first run, you can see how many endings there are, and there seem to be a LOT more than what I was expecting. I literally never have found myself saying this, but if less endings meant some of the grinding within the game were more fleshed out mini-games or other parts, like more clothing to wear or more different types of fishes to catch, I would take it.\n\nAll of this being said, if you liked the choosing aspect of Telltale Games (but not the combat or having to be quick to choose), enjoy games where number goes up makes you happy (like Apotheon before it became incredibly problematic and completely changed), BitLife, or visual novels, I feel like this is the game for you. I did have a decent amount of issues with it, but I genuinely feel like if this game were released on Switch with the translation issues fixed after some advertising/being sent to some reviewers, it would be explosive in popularity. It is a little bit too chill for me, but that means everyone else who wants to potentially relax a little more than me would adore this game. I can see it being very easy to play on the Steam Deck. All aspects of the game, except for fishing, are easily playable with any controller. \n\nGenuinely, I am shocked this developer has not put out more on Steam at least. If Egg Hatcher genuinely kept making games like this, I could see them becoming one of the best for life sims ever. There are genuinely so many things to do. In this current world of some Indie games seeming incredible but extremely short especially for the price, this game will keep you occupied for hours. I tried to go quick on my second run, remember, and I still played 14 hours!!\n\nEven if you are unsure, put this game on your Steam wishlist and buy it on sale. I'm likely going to email/go to X/attempt to join the Discord of the developer, as they are clearly not the largest, and offer to help with some rewording. I recommend everyone else also KINDLY point out some grammatical, spelling, or awkwardly worded sentences.",

I can't wait to keep playing! I think the romances are also pretty nice/funny, and the fact there's poly endings is also a big plus in my books. It does feel like you (as her father) aren't really involved in her life for a bigger part when the game really picks up. So that might be something to think about, given it's not just a raising your daughter simulator, but rather a \"you play as the daughter from a 3rd person pov\" simulator, if I can put it like that.

It has all the makings for things I like in games like this. But GOD is the english translation terrible and totally Machine Translated. \n\nI can sometimes look the other way, but seeing as these games involve a lot of reading I quickly tuned out from playing this. If you can deal with MTL translations, then It's totally worth playing! It seemed to have quite a lot to do from what I played with many endings to pursue. I just cannot keep playing. It grates on me and drives me crazy and sometimes I just straight up do not know what I'm doing because of the TL and I really can't recommend it until it gets an update where they clean up the botched script.",

Lots of poor grammar or phrases that seem nonsensical, and are clearly the work of machine translation. I think the game would 100% benefit from an English speaker going through and cleaning up the script. \n\nUntil that happens, I'm not really able to recommend this. I could look past this in most games but not in one as text heavy as this one.",

It’s just that for a game that positions itself as a parenting sim, your baby daughter grows up in the first 2 hours, becomes the protagonist, and it turns into a mediocre and boring dating simulator. It’s a well-made game, it’s just really not what I was looking for.",

      "review": "The English translation of this game is quite poor. Sentences come out wonky and the text processor often splits lines mid word, or forces the ends of sentences offscreen. There's also no English dub (understandable), which means that missing text is lost forever.\n\nI don't think this will be a dealbreaker for everyone, but it is for me.",
