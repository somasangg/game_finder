It's honestly frightening how much fun it is to think up team combinations or find ways to optimize your gameplan/combos. It's one of the most expressive and creative fighters I've played. Truly a game for the fighting game freaks of the world to sink their teeth into. Even in 2025 its a fantastic way to spend your time and money as its still being updated 7 years later.\n\nPS. Check \"https://isthereanydeal.com/game/dragon-ball-fighterz/info/\" for a sale on the legendary edition for all characters, I've seen it as low as 23.USD before",

The combos in here are well thought out, the sprites are beautiful and the roster is pretty solid overall. My only real complaint with DBFZ and most Arcsys games is the way they do menus. I much prefer a list than a walking menu, but that's a small nitpick. I really do hope we get a DBFZ2 sometime in the near future. Easily a top 3 DBZ game of all-time. <3",

As a huge DBZ fan, I was very excited to get it, even more with the epic destructive finishes that, I must admit, were the main reason I got the game. Something I like about the usual DB games are the campaigns as they take you through DBZ story or make new stories based on it. However, this game single player is divided into 3 different “campaigns”. Either you play with the heroes, with the villains, and with the androids. While the hero and villain campaign are OK, the android campaign is one of the worst things I have ever played. It is repetitive, and most of the story-telling videos between battles are Android 21 moaning because she is hungry. The story gets good until the heroes arrive and then you have more characters to play with. I finished the campaign, and I don’t even want to get into the multiplayer. However, I can see is full of players, so maybe it is good, I am not going to test it to be honest.\r\nThe fighting gameplay is fun, but a little repetitive. Most of the time it involves either pressing constantly A, X, or Y while moving the character in different directions. Some combos are absolutely epic when you start combining characters and playing with character changing mechanics. This makes me think that the multiplayer mode should be fun.\r\nMore bad things: The number of characters is very low, you need to get a lot of them by paying DLCs, which is crap. The characters are not getting different transformations during battle, just for special movements.\r\nI would recommend to get this game in a very big discount and don’t lose your time if you like DBZ story modes.",

After that, something was very wrong with the framerate. It displayed a solid 60fps, but looked more like 20fps, and that problem persisted through everything for me, including the lobby area, the cutscenes, and the fighting. \n\nI've played it on xbox before and didn't have that issue, so I can only assume something is up with the big picture mode integration that is causing all of that.",

And even then when you just need to get one or two hits in to effectively win the game as long as you are using some king of meta combo, it kind of takes away any sense of real skill from both sides. Again, I loved this game, and I love fighting games. But with the latest patch I think this game is much worse, and it is kind of only fun for people who have been experts since the beginning",
