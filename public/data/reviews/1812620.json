For ps5, ps4 emulation, vibration does not work until going through all the settings and tweaks and finally finding the right one.  Oh and once you do, you will realize that the standard ps5 vibration without emulation is not the same using this software whether you do the pass through or not.  I bought this software in hopes of finding a piece of software that would help me since i have a ps5 controller and hate having to switch back and forth or turn off profiles in other emulation software like ds4 windows and never fully getting the ps5 controller experience.  Some games like Gotham knights, gets a double input on the down and up buttoms, no fix found, tried the fix double input button in the software with no luck.  On battlefield 6, the adaptive trigger passthrough works slightly, right trigger does, left trigger doesnt. Tried looking up support on steam's product support and their webpage is broken.   If you cannot get the vibration to work on ps5 or 4 emulation, try enabling haptic feedback mode, it works but it will be very weak as compared to the normal ps5 vibration.  So in conclusion, the best way to get a ps5 controller experience, just disable this software. 3+ hours trying to tackle each issue I am having with this software.  Any tips or solutions are welcome.  So far cant get the vibration to feel like a normal ps5 should feel and I am referring to games that do support ps5 native vibration and controllers.\n\nMake sure to disable in steam, enable steam input for xbox controllers, this will cause multiple blue screen crashes.",

And it shows with updates and how much time it takes to make small steps toward complete dualsense support on PC. And it's in contrast with the price and pricing. 10€ for this? A program that sometimes works, sometimes doesn't? For a hobby, it should be free. Or if you really want to milk people actually treat it as a job. Do it regularly, weekly - upmost. If I could, I would refund. I already refunded the DSX+ dlc, because that's a complete scam for 5€. There are actual GAMES for that price. Games that beat the breath of this \"hobby\" project. I advise everyone NOT TO buy this. Instead download ds4windows to use the dualsense. Atleast that's free.",

Even so, its cheap enough, whatever. It makes it sound to simple to use but its such a pain. I couldn't even get it to work properly in game, and most games couldn't even get controller to work at all as it kept popping up an error script everytime I tried to use the controller in a game, and that was even with the \"native\" function selected and the suggested functions enabled. Tried it in Baldurs Gate to hopefully add vibration to the dualsense since Larian couldn't be bothered to add it themselves, and it just made everything weird. The game thought I was an additional player joining, I guess it was recognizing my controller as an additional one with this app idk, but made playing it weird as it didn't recognize my controller as being the main player and couldn't well, control my character and all properly. After all that and an hour of messing around I just had enough and refunded. I don't need more complications in my life to be honest. I'd rather just play normally than to spend all my time messing with this just to end up playing the same or worse anyway lol",

I bought this software in hopes of finding a piece of software that would help me since i have a ps5 controller and hate having to switch back and forth or turn off profiles in other emulation software like ds4 windows and never fully getting the ps5 controller experience.  Some games like Gotham knights, gets a double input on the down and up buttoms, no fix found, tried the fix double input button in the software with no luck.  On battlefield 6, the adaptive trigger passthrough works slightly, right trigger does, left trigger doesnt. Tried looking up support on steam's product support and their webpage is broken.   If you cannot get the vibration to work on ps5 or 4 emulation, try enabling haptic feedback mode, it works but it will be very weak as compared to the normal ps5 vibration.  So in conclusion, the best way to get a ps5 controller experience, just disable this software. 3+ hours trying to tackle each issue I am having with this software.  Any tips or solutions are welcome.  So far cant get the vibration to feel like a normal ps5 should feel and I am referring to games that do support ps5 native vibration and controllers.\n\nMake sure to disable in steam, enable steam input for xbox controllers, this will cause multiple blue screen crashes.",
