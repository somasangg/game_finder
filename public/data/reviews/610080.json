But that's ultimately a minor gripe which can be resolved in a few seconds via search engine.\n\nOverall, if you want an incremental game that rewards analytical skills and experimenting with builds, with a very long road to completion, this is a great choice.

      "review": "Игра Realm Grinder - это увлекательный представитель жанра idle, где ты начинаешь с малого и постепенно строишь огромную империю, экспериментируя с различными фракциями, улучшениями и перерождениями. Геймплей построен вокруг бесконечного цикла накопления ресурсов и открытия новых возможностей. Сначала все кажется простым, но потом раскрывается сложная система престижа, с множеством путей развития и необходимостью оптимизировать свои стратегии.\n\nМне понравилось разнообразие доступных фракций, каждая из которых предлагает уникальные бонусы и стили игры. Процесс поиска оптимальной комбинации для максимальной эффективности очень увлекателен. Графика, конечно, простенькая, но это не сильно портит впечатления, учитывая глубину геймплея.\n\nПожалуй, единственный минус - это некоторое однообразие в поздней игре, когда уже опробованы многие стратегии, и остается только методичное увеличение чисел. Однако, постоянные обновления и добавление нового контента частично решают эту проблему. В целом, Realm Grinder - отличный выбор для любителей idle-игр, желающих погрузиться в сложный и захватывающий мир.",

      "review": "Игра Realm Grinder - это увлекательный представитель жанра idle, где ты начинаешь с малого и постепенно строишь огромную империю, экспериментируя с различными фракциями, улучшениями и перерождениями. Геймплей построен вокруг бесконечного цикла накопления ресурсов и открытия новых возможностей. Сначала все кажется простым, но потом раскрывается сложная система престижа, с множеством путей развития и необходимостью оптимизировать свои стратегии.\n\nМне понравилось разнообразие доступных фракций, каждая из которых предлагает уникальные бонусы и стили игры. Процесс поиска оптимальной комбинации для максимальной эффективности очень увлекателен. Графика, конечно, простенькая, но это не сильно портит впечатления, учитывая глубину геймплея.\n\nПожалуй, единственный минус - это некоторое однообразие в поздней игре, когда уже опробованы многие стратегии, и остается только методичное увеличение чисел. Однако, постоянные обновления и добавление нового контента частично решают эту проблему. В целом, Realm Grinder - отличный выбор для любителей idle-игр, желающих погрузиться в сложный и захватывающий мир.",

The repetition is fairly standard for an idle game, which consists mostly of restarting over and over for bigger numbers, but I thought it was fairly egregious in RG. You are expected to restart within the first few hours to take advantage of different races while collecting in-game trophies. That’s 6 restarts right there. And while the races do offer different bonuses and benefits, they do not change the gameplay nearly enough to warrant restarting so much. \nAs for the lack of direction, I had no idea what I should be doing at the beginning, so I just kind of winged it. The game hides a tiny little advisor in the bottom right that gives you a single sentence on what you should be focusing on. \n\nIn my ~35 hours of playtime, I did not find RG deep or unique enough to continue. Furthermore, despite it being free to play, there is a cash shop that sells you a currency that very clearly will expedite your experience. So while it's a single player game, the pay-to-win option is present. \nI think if RG wanted to grab my attention, I would have loved to actually see small previews of the games supposedly “Deep” systems instead of everything supposedly cool being hidden behind dozens of hours of repetition. \nDue to the above, I cannot recommend this game.

The bulk of the gameplay consists of simply reincarnating over and over to accumulate larger numbers. \nBy far the largest original mechanic this game has is the racial decision and bonuses. The ise a choice between good and evil (at the start) each with 3 choices. Each race has their own strengths that benefit different playstyles.

The repetition is fairly standard for an idle game, which consists mostly of restarting over and over for bigger numbers, but I thought it was fairly egregious in RG. You are expected to restart within the first few hours to take advantage of different races while collecting in-game trophies. That’s 6 restarts right there. And while the races do offer different bonuses and benefits, they do not change the gameplay nearly enough to warrant restarting so much. \nAs for the lack of direction, I had no idea what I should be doing at the beginning, so I just kind of winged it. The game hides a tiny little advisor in the bottom right that gives you a single sentence on what you should be focusing on. \n\nIn my ~35 hours of playtime, I did not find RG deep or unique enough to continue.

      "review": "[h1][b] TLDR: Very average and very repetitive. [/b] [/h1]\n\n[h1]PROS: [/h1]\n➕Different playstyles through racial bonuses\n\n\n[h1]CONS: [/h1]\n➖No way to increase UI size(?)\n➖Pay to progress much faster\n➖Repetitive \n➖No audio slider, just on or off\n\n[h1] [b] Content (Game world/Narrative) – [4/10] [/b] [/h1]\nThe game world consists entirely of a single screen with an area of land that various buildings are built upon. The only thing that changes within my playtime was the color palette. \n\nThere isn’t really a narrative. \n\n[h1][b] Gameplay (Mechanics/Difficulty) – [6/10] [/b] [/h1]\nAs far as the mechanics go, this feels like a fairly traditional idle progression game to me. The bulk of the gameplay consists of simply reincarnating over and over to accumulate larger numbers. \nBy far the largest original mechanic this game has is the racial decision and bonuses. The ise a choice between good and evil (at the start) each with 3 choices. Each race has their own strengths that benefit different playstyles. For example, the elves are focused on clicking, while the fairies give big bonuses to your starting buildings. There are even additional factions and races to unlock that generally focus on different aspects of the game, but the core always remains the same - reincarnate. \n\nWhile the game isn’t necessarily difficult, there is a large lack of direction. For the first dozen or so hours, I had no idea what I should be doing. Furthermore, googling isn’t helpful since apparently there was such large patches to the game that all information aside from whats on Discord seems to be outdated. There is a small hint section that provides help, but it took me hours to actually accidentally stumble across it (its in the very bottom right….). \n\n[h1] [b] Graphics (Quality/Technical) – [4/10] [/b] [/h1]\nAbsolutely nothing special. From a graphical standpoint, this is Playstation 1-era fidelity. \nI don’t mind poor graphics, but the thing that kills me is the inability to increase UI size. Such a basic thing that makes the game that much harder to enjoy. \n\nOn the technical side, I encountered no bugs or issues with running it. \ni9-13900KF | RTX 4090 | 64GB RAM | 1440p @ 240hz | Windows 11 installed on SSD \n\n[h1] [b] Audio – [2/10] [/b] [/h1]\nAudio is largely repetitive. There is only 3 (that I found) different soundtracks, one for each faction. Either way, I ended up muting the sound because there was no volume slider. I’d have preferred it quieter, but its either on or off. \n\n[h1] [b] Replay Factor (Longevity) – [7/10] [/b] [/h1]\nThere is some great replay value here, if you have the patience and can endure the repetitive playstyle. The game slowly drip feeds you new mechanics as you progress, but this often can take dozens of hours. Still, to see everything the game has to offer, it can be a massive time commitment. \n\n[h1] [b] Final Verdict – [5/10] [/b] [/h1]\nRealm Grinder (RG) caught my attention as one of the higher scored idle games on Steam. Being that it was free, I decided to try it out over the course of a week or two. \nThere were two things that become evident to me immediately within the first few hours of playtime - the repetition and the lack of direction. The repetition is fairly standard for an idle game, which consists mostly of restarting over and over for bigger numbers, but I thought it was fairly egregious in RG. You are expected to restart within the first few hours to take advantage of different races while collecting in-game trophies. That’s 6 restarts right there. And while the races do offer different bonuses and benefits, they do not change the gameplay nearly enough to warrant restarting so much. \nAs for the lack of direction, I had no idea what I should be doing at the beginning, so I just kind of winged it. The game hides a tiny little advisor in the bottom right that gives you a single sentence on what you should be focusing on. \n\nIn my ~35 hours of playtime, I did not find RG deep or unique enough to continue. Furthermore, despite it being free to play, there is a cash shop that sells you a currency that very clearly will expedite your experience. So while it's a single player game, the pay-to-win option is present. \nI think if RG wanted to grab my attention, I would have loved to actually see small previews of the games supposedly “Deep” systems instead of everything supposedly cool being hidden behind dozens of hours of repetition. \nDue to the above, I cannot recommend this game. My recommendation for an idle game is Melvor Idle, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Synikx/recommended/1267910?snr=1_5_9__402]you can read my review here[/url]. \n\n[h1] [b] Recommend? (Price) [Y/N] [/b] [/h1]\n[h1]No[/h1]\nCould be worth a shot since it's free, but just be mindful of P2W issues. \nYou can find my curator page here: https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Synik_GR",

Calling them “games” is probably breaking the definition of the word, and Realm Grinder is a master of futility. Click the button and you can build more things, except you don’t. Own thousands of farms? Maybe, but you’ll just see one, same as with everything else. There is the minimum amount possible in the way of visual reward to be gained, and even less in the way of enjoyment. It’s soulless, purposeless, and a waste of time. A better option would be to put your mouse in your pocket and go for a walk. That way, you’ll still be accompanied by the endless sound of clickety-clack, and you’ll at least have something to look at.",
