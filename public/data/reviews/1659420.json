      "review": "Here, have some Indiana Jones. Take some of this Tomb Raider too. What do you get? Tomb Jones. But what we have here are the adventures of some people with upper body strength so incredible, it is only surpassed by their ability to cheat death about three dozen times a day.\n\nIf you want a game that tells you all these emergent little stories through interaction, this is not it. In the familiar Naughty Dog fashion, this is a movie that you play through. It's a wild ride with high emphasis on production values, motion capture and voice acting. There is one path forward and even that practically plays itself, until you reach an action scene, and you get to do at least something. The good thing is that the action is fun enough to keep you going and I like the contrast between the game basically running on autopilot and the sometimes even, gasp, challenging combat. Drake's superhuman ability to throw himself up a mountain doesn't mean he can eat bullets forever, albeit he can eat bullets a lot, and I liked coming up with different ways of clearing those arenas. Enemies can be deadly and they will come after you if you as much as take cover for too long.\n\nI don't particularly like this sort of entirely linear and expendable game design, but I can't say I'm impervious to Uncharted 4's entertainment value, because it kept me entertained enough.",

I can say I've never owned a Playstation and Uncharted 1-3 are PS Exclusive so if you have played them I recommend just playing to finish Nathan's story, maybe then it'll get a better review but on its own there are much better.\r\n\r\nTo sum up its the story of Nathan and his team who go on a search to find the legendary story of Captain Avery and the Lost city of Libertalia with millions in Gold (which is his dead mothers legacy) before his enemies who have a lot more resources get there before him.\r\n\r\nGameplay: 6/10- Good Parkour and some fantastic fight scenes but majority of the combat was lacking.\r\nDifficulty: 5/10- As you would expect in Normal Mode.\r\nGraphics: 5/10- Really good but there is a decent amount of bugs with the PC Port.\r\nStory: 6/10- It was good enough to make me want to finish it.\r\nLength: 5/10- Great balance, not too short or too long to make me give up, completed in 20 hours.\r\nMusic: 8/10- OMW in my opinion the pirate and adventure music CARRIED the Game.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nMany people loved this game so don't let this review stop you but let me know if you think it was a bit overated, I personally think its NOT on the top 10 best story games of all time.\r\n\r\nOverall a 6/10",

      "review": "Naughty Dog continues to prove they’re absolute wizards when it comes to crafting narrative-driven video game experiences. With Uncharted 4 and The Lost Legacy, they reached a new level of mastery—these titles feel like the point where the studio truly perfected two core elements of the series.\n\n1. Exceptional Storytelling and Characters\nThe story, voice acting, and overall character immersion are on another level. These characters feel real—grounded, believable, and emotionally compelling. You don’t just watch their journey; you buy into it. Naughty Dog’s cinematic approach hits its stride here, making every quiet moment, set piece, or conversation feel meaningful.\n\n2. A Refined Gameplay Mix\nThe gameplay variety is significantly improved from earlier entries. Stealth is more satisfying and flexible, encounters offer multiple approaches, and the puzzles are actually engaging this time around. Combat, exploration, and problem-solving flow together far more naturally, making it consistently fun to play—not just to watch.\n\nA Must-Play—Especially on Steam Deck\nThe PC/Steam release looks and plays beautifully, and it’s absolutely epic on the Steam Deck. Performance is smooth, visuals shine, and the portability makes the cinematic adventure feel even more impressive.\n\nVerdict\nNaughty Dog is at the top of their game with these titles. The Legacy of Thieves Collection is a must-play for anyone who loves narrative action games—and on sale, it’s an absolute bargain for this level of quality.  #DLGbump",

      "review": "I've completed Uncharted 4 now three times. An ambitious game and a fitting sendoff for Nate and the crew, I think it falls short of the best in the series, and even ties or comes in below U3 for me personally. Graphically, it is the best in the series and is downright gorgeous. The grappling hook feels like a natural extension of Nathan, and I can't believe it's taken 4 games for us to get this: it's that good. Gunplay and climbing also feel leagues above U3 and U2, so why the inevitable BUT? Story and characters both take a mistep here. \n\nNadine-Let's start with the obvious one. Much complaint was made about Nadine when U4 first launched in 2016. While IMO much of it was overblown, there are some valid criticisms. The fact that she is able to completely kick Nate's ass not once, but twice along with his brother at the same time is laughable. There are ways to write bad-ass female characters, but making one who is able to not just hold her own but pulverize two grown men at the same time is not it. \n\nRafe-Personally, I think Rafe is the best villain of the series. While that may not be saying much, and in the grand scheme of things he is just another rich goon with another private militia behind him, he at least has some depth to him given his past history with the Drake brothers. I think a lot is left on the table with him in this regard, especially given his drive to find Libertalia and Avery's treasure mirroring Nate's in a darker fashion. I wish ND explored this dichotomy more, and had more story moments showing how Nate and Rafe aren't so different at the end of the day, and the lengths at which these two men are willing to go to achieve their ends. Bonus points for the final fight with him, which is climactic and the best \"final boss\" fight in the franchise. \n\nSam-Where do I start with Sam? He is an extremely well written character, and feels like a natural extension playing off of Nathan once you get over the sudden whiplash of his introduction. I theorize Amy Hennig departed Naughty Dog because of Sam and the way he is written into the story. Nowhere in the past 3 games did we ever get to know this long-lost brother nor was he ever mentioned, and it feels very unnatural for him to show up and drive the main plot of the series. \n\nElena-I'll keep this one brief. Elena's character is fine overall, but I don't buy Nathan lying to her and setting out for adventure with Sam. After getting to know her for over 3 games, and all of the adventures these two have been on together, it makes no sense for Nathan to concoct a lie to her when I feel she would have been ok with him going and likely even tagging along. Negative points for the length \"apology\" section of the story where the action grounds to a halt just over midway through, and we are forced to solve elevator and car puzzles with her. \n\nLost Legacy-This is a fine DLC, and it's great to see Chloe back in action after her distinct absence from U3. Unfortunately, Neil Druckmann heard gamers loud and clear and decided to shoehorn everyone's favorite character, Nadine, back into the story. While she is slightly more tolerable here, I would've much rather her be partnered up with Sam, or even Charlie Cutter from 3 who is also noticeably absent from this game.\n\nI enjoy Uncharted 4 very much, but it falls short of the best the series has to offer, and is a country mile behind Uncharted 2. It is well worth a play for any Uncharted fan, with the caveat that the story and characters are not nearly as well written as one may expect from Naughty Dog.",

A thief's end is filled with impressive set-pieces and very well thought-out action sequences, some of the best in gaming. The graphics are very good, even nine years later, with some beautiful shots in particular throughout the story, and the gameplay is solid, although nothing special. The story is heartfelt, really focusing on the characters, with messaging that will hit home for many, and really shines through the characters and their interactions with one another, particularly with the witty dialogue and swagger of the main character. It is a beautiful story focusing on Nathan Drake and those who have molded him over the previous three games, and probably one of the best I've experienced in a game. The spin-off game included in this bundle continues in much the same way as a thief's end, with a different main character, but plays much the same. The story is well-made and entertaining, and Lost Legacy experiments with a more open-world design which pays off well, making the gameplay and exploration more interesting in a good way. The exploration of a part of the world not seen at all in previous outings works well, and both games are a must play. 10/10.",

As a person who enjoys some history, architecture, and travel, the game hits all three for me.  I look forward to finishing the game!",

The graphics are excellent, character design and movements very fluid, game play feels precise and the story, while devilishly aggressive (hard cover, violent) is well conceived. \r\nI have no idea how long its going to be, it takes some time just to move the character from place to place,  like a great adventure, but it makes me want to play the rest of the series going forward. \r\nGreat job!

Set that aside I had already beat Uncharted 4 years ago on Play Station 3 or 4 can't remember but I wanted to experience it again.  I don't have the best gaming PC but the game blows most modern day games away.  I never played the other game that I assumed was an add-on but I heard it sucked.  It is also incredibly good.  Only complaint is the one puzzle that I spent like 2 hours on was the one that wouldn't constantly make me angrier asking me if I needed help.  Once I did figure it out though, I felt like Einstein.  The dialog can be a bit PG cheesy at times but also whoa PG-13 didn't see that coming.  No blood but sneak up and snap some one's neck or grab their ankle and throw them off a cliff, then think nothing of it... might not be for everyone.

The balance between the dramatic story, fun gameplay, and the stunning graphics is utterly unmatched. Uncharted 4 is not just the greatest game that was made by PlayStation besides Uncharted 2.

Recenzenci chwalą oba tytuły za świetne połączenie filmu akcji i gry wideo — sceny są pełne napięcia, a postacie mają wyrazisty charakter, co razem buduje bardzo angażujące doświadczenie.\r\n\r\nTechnicznie gra prezentuje się rewelacyjnie. Na konsolach nowej generacji dostępne są tryby w 4 K, 60 klatek na sekundę, a nawet 120 klatek dla tych, którzy mają sprzęt wspierający HDMI 2.1 — co skutkuje płynnością i spektakularną jakością obrazu. Ponadto, poprawki w teksturach, lepsze wczytywanie czy dźwięk przestrzenny dodatkowo podnoszą jakość i sprawiają wrażenie, że gra faktycznie została odświeżona z rozmachem.\r\n\r\nMechanika rozgrywki wciąż błyszczy — strzelaniny, wspinaczki, elementy platformowe i zagadki są ze sobą świetnie zgrane. Seria od zawsze była znana z „kina akcji”, a tutaj nadal dostarcza momenty pełne adrenaliny, humoru i nieoczekiwanych zwrotów akcji. Nawet jeżeli znasz już te gry z poprzednich generacji, ponowna przygoda z nimi w nowej odsłonie potrafi być równie satysfakcjonująca.\r\n\r\nPodsumowanie\r\nUncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection to doskonała propozycja dla tych, którzy szukają w grach wysokiej jakości — pięknej oprawy, silnej fabuły i świetnej mechaniki. Niezależnie, czy jesteś długoletnim fanem serii, czy dopiero zaczynasz swoją przygodę — to zestaw, który warto mieć na radarze.\r\n\r\nPoziom trudności: Umiarkowany\r\nFabuła: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5\r\nGrafika: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5\r\nDźwięk: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5\r\nDługość rozgrywki: ⭐⭐⭐⭐/5\r\nCena: ⭐⭐⭐⭐/5",

I'm not complaining. I'm sure some people think this is the BEST kind of game, but who knows. I tend to prefer a way more open and expressive experience, but do your thing. and do it well. \r\n\r\nit's good. it seems to run well on PC in its final state. Naughty Dog's attention to detail on their environments, even though they're really only walk-through museum corridors, really was something. it looks fantastic. cinema-quality acting and sound. based on overall quality of content IGN INC. awards it 6.59723568 out of 10. rounded down. not an average. though the gameplay IS pretty average.",

      "review": "UNCHARTED: Legacy of Thieves Collection delivers two excellent, cinematic single‑player campaigns that feel like playing through big‑budget adventure films. The performances are top‑tier across the board – Nolan North, Troy Baker, Claudia Black and co. give real weight to the banter, the drama, and the quieter character moments, making you care about what’s happening even when the plot leans on familiar treasure‑hunting tropes.\n\nWhat really stands out are the vistas and set pieces. From lush jungles and sun‑drenched coasts to ancient ruins and bustling cities, the environments are constantly impressive and often downright breathtaking. The remaster on PC helps a lot here: high‑resolution textures, sharp image quality, and strong art direction combine to make both games look great even years after release. Climbing and traversal sequences sometimes feel a bit on-rails, but they serve the cinematic pacing well and keep the spectacle flowing.\n\nGameplay‑wise, it’s a polished but safe mix of third‑person shooting, stealth, light puzzles, and climbing. The gunplay is serviceable rather than exceptional, and encounters can get a bit repetitive, but the variety of locations, set pieces, and story beats helps it stay engaging through both campaigns. As a package, getting UNCHARTED 4 and The Lost Legacy together is strong value if you’re in it for narrative‑driven adventures.\n\nOverall, Legacy of Thieves is a great cinematic experience with fantastic performances and stunning vistas, slightly held back by conservative, familiar gameplay design and some repetition. Still, for anyone who enjoys story‑driven action adventures, it comfortably earns an 8/10 and a recommendation.",

I was pleased to find a greater emphasis on stealth in this final chapter, a feature I have hoped for since the second game. The addition of mechanics like whistling or throwing items to distract enemies would have been a superb feature for the entire series. Furthermore, the hand-to-hand combat in Uncharted 3 felt more refined and impactful than in any other entry. On a more humorous note, I must express my exhaustion with the recurring theme of undertaking monumental efforts for treasure, only for it to be destroyed or lost at the conclusion. One must also wonder what kind of treasure hunter remains tied to a conventional nine-to-five job. I truly appreciated the narrative's family progression at the end, showing their daughter developing an interest in adventure, which beautifully sets the stage for her to continue the family legacy.",

Which... yeah, might be obvious, I didn't realize tbh. \nThe first of the two starts with Nathan Drake as MC (it's actually the 4th in the series), going on a hunt for some big, lost pirate treasure. Between not telling the truth to waifu, reconnecting with someone important from the past and trying to win the race for treasure, we fight, climb, explore, drive, solve puzzles and climb even more. \nIt really was a blast! I loved the different locations, the amazing views, the dive into history. I really don't get why they would leave behind some items, but others are oh so interesting? Seems odd as treasure hunter. At least the game didn't sell them as archaeologists, but adventurers, which seems more accurate to the kind of discovering imho. I could really have done with way less fighting tho.\n\nSame in the end with the second game. Here we play as Chloe Fraser, diving into absolutely stunning sceneries on the hunt for an ancient, ornate tusk. Every so often we get stuck between the Indian Army and Rebells, who - yes, you got this right - are also hunting down the tusk. So more fighting. And basically all of the above. Just this time way shorter. AND we can get a bracelet to help find treasure! I seriously which it had already been in the first game. And uh... from the start. I missed so many pieces. \n\nAll in all I had a great time with the two games. I didn't even break my fingers trying to work with controller. So yay! \nBeautiful. Great story. Okay (but too many imho) fights. And!\nMotion Sickness Counter: 0/10!",

      "review": "As a diehard fan of narrative-driven games, I have to say that despite being a masterpiece of industrial game production with many merits, the obviously altered happy ending made me write it off completely. (Spoiler alert)\n1. The final act suffers from a noticeable drop in quality, with clear signs of rushing. While the mid-section is packed with surprises, the climax—which should have been the highlight—feels surprisingly lackluster.  \n2. The game’s underlying theme mirrors a pirate utopia saga, where the leader’s greed-driven betrayals unfold in parallel with the growing ideological rift between the Drake brothers.  \n3. The story heavily emphasizes the complicated history between the brothers: Nathan’s reluctant abandonment, Sam’s deception, his distrust toward Sully, his pride, and his simmering jealousy toward his brother. All of this sets a solid foundation for Sam’s descent into darkness. In contrast, Rafe feels underdeveloped, even overshadowed by the mercenary leader in terms of presence.  \n4. What really convinced me that the ending was altered is that scene at the Libertalia blacksmith ruins: when Nathan examines an artifact, Sam suddenly attacks him with a broken sword(ofcu's jokingly). Nathan is startled, then falls into an unsettling silence.  \n\nSam was the one who introduced Nathan to this life—even the “Drake” alias was his idea. But after spending 15 years in prison following a failed escape, he watches as Nathan achieves three legendary archaeological discoveries, getting closer to fulfilling their mother’s legacy. From his perspective, Nathan—who settled into a quiet life after retirement—is a traitor. Sam was left behind, and the person who eventually bailed him out wasn’t his own brother, but someone he didn’t even trust.  \nSo from the very beginning, Sam wasn’t fully honest with Nathan. He fabricated the story about a drug lord, waited a long time after getting out before contacting Nathan, and more. Throughout their journey, the two don’t grow closer—instead, the gap between them widens. Deceptions, bullets, falling off cliffs… The long conversation at the Libertalia tavern lays their conflicting values bare. After that, the underlying theme of pirates turning on each other surfaces unmistakably. At this point, Sam’s turn to darkness feels inevitable.  \n\nThe most fitting ending would have been Sam’s betrayal, culminating in a final sword fight between the brothers, with Sam meeting his end aboard the pirate ship.  \nI understand that as the series finale, a happy ending is what many hoped for. But forcing a cheerful resolution while ignoring or overwriting the established narrative buildup is a disservice to the art of storytelling.\n[hr][/hr]\n[h3]Reviews: 4/10[/h3]",

      "review": "TL:DR - I can't give it a full-throated recommendation because of what Uncharted 4 is bundled with here. Because in almost every way U4 is great, Lost Legacy is bad - except the usual gameplay loop, which is largely identical between the two. So - yes, and no.\r\n\r\nSpoilers ahead.\r\n\r\nI'm new to the series, and only started with these 2. And 4 left me feeling like, hell yes - can I have more of this! It's Adventure with a capital A and is very addictive in the way it draws you in and always keeps wondering what happens next, while exploring and gawking at the gorgeous world. Story is fun, characters well written, dialogue is snappy. Bad-guys aren't exactly textbook \"bad\", since, what you are doing yourself and your goal there is essentially the same as mercs' - treasure, even though for different underlying reasons. I was surprised how long it is, for a more linear game - and that is to its benefit - it dots all the i's by the end. \r\n\r\nI didn't mind Nadine in U4 at all. Looking at how the action goes in Uncharted, it is all quite over-the-top, wall-crushing, slide-jumping, 1-man-army craziness. And her being sort of the main \"villain\" - you'd expect her to be tough as nails, because that's just how it goes - you don't get to take out the main baddie in one shot. With all that, you get your suspension of disbelief at a reasonable level - you \"just go with it\" fairly easily. U4 left me thoroughly impressed overall - it is definitely the crown of this bundle.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately instead of a jewel, there's a turd on top of that crown - and that is Lost Legacy.\r\n\r\nIt still sort of remains on-the-rails linear adventure, but much more open this time. And those more open-world'ish maps (there's really just the one) is where you feel how it detracts from the razor-sharp focus and urgency the previous game is great at.\r\n\r\nWhat if Tomb Raider had a lame side-kick ? (yes, ok ... Jonah, you're right). It would be this. It has an obnoxious, foul-tempered, abrasive bitch of a side-kick, who is somehow worse than she was as villain in U4 ! I sort of expected some degree of woke nonsense from NaughtyDog at some point - so I wasn't exactly surprised by this. \r\n\r\nIt's the usual tired old crap of elevating a girl, by putting a guy down - and yes Sam gets put down all the time, being written as this mewling, pathetic tool. There is literally a scene where he joins Chloe in a jeep and gets immediately yelled at by Strong Diverse Woman to go take the back-seat. Which he complies with immediately, like a limp little soy-noodle. This unbelievable, dysfunctional relations-dynamic totally drowns out the few good things about this game, which would've been actually half-decent otherwise.\r\n\r\nSuspension of disbelief ? I'd sooner want to believe Chloe powersliding down a slope, while no-scoping 10 mercs in the span of 5 seconds, than her putting up with that hissing pot of vitriol sitting next to her, and not ejecting her out of her seat at the next tall cliff.\r\n\r\nChloe is OK, but nothing more than that. She's voiced by Claudia Black, which is always an auditory treat - but she's given the most cringy, sinfully boring script, which can't keep your attention for 10 seconds, because how rottedly mundane it is. Every time there's banter between the 2 characters - my mind would wander, looking for something more engaging - like counting my teeth using my tongue.\r\n\r\nIf I could rate U4 separately, I'd recommend it wholeheartedly. But in this \"collection\", the difference between the 2 games is just vast. I'd never pay for Legacy, and looking at the stuff ND have released lately - I'd never give them my money again. \r\n\r\nBut I'm glad I got U4 from it at least.",

The camera often needs to be on one exact pixel to make a jump otherwise he just stands there like a dummy, and the performance is not great - lots of lag during jumps and slides. The puzzles are stupidly easy to work out but take ages since you need to press a button about 50 times to solve it even when the solution is very obvious.

So - yes, and no.\r\n\r\nSpoilers ahead.\r\n\r\nI'm new to the series, and only started with these 2. And 4 left me feeling like, hell yes - can I have more of this! It's Adventure with a capital A and is very addictive in the way it draws you in and always keeps wondering what happens next, while exploring and gawking at the gorgeous world. Story is fun, characters well written, dialogue is snappy. Bad-guys aren't exactly textbook \"bad\", since, what you are doing yourself and your goal there is essentially the same as mercs' - treasure, even though for different underlying reasons. I was surprised how long it is, for a more linear game - and that is to its benefit - it dots all the i's by the end. \r\n\r\nI didn't mind Nadine in U4 at all. Looking at how the action goes in Uncharted, it is all quite over-the-top, wall-crushing, slide-jumping, 1-man-army craziness. And her being sort of the main \"villain\" - you'd expect her to be tough as nails, because that's just how it goes - you don't get to take out the main baddie in one shot. With all that, you get your suspension of disbelief at a reasonable level - you \"just go with it\" fairly easily. U4 left me thoroughly impressed overall - it is definitely the crown of this bundle.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately instead of a jewel, there's a turd on top of that crown - and that is Lost Legacy.\r\n\r\nIt still sort of remains on-the-rails linear adventure, but much more open this time. And those more open-world'ish maps (there's really just the one) is where you feel how it detracts from the razor-sharp focus and urgency the previous game is great at.\r\n\r\nWhat if Tomb Raider had a lame side-kick ? (yes, ok ... Jonah, you're right). It would be this. It has an obnoxious, foul-tempered, abrasive bitch of a side-kick, who is somehow worse than she was as villain in U4 ! I sort of expected some degree of woke nonsense from NaughtyDog at some point - so I wasn't exactly surprised by this. \r\n\r\nIt's the usual tired old crap of elevating a girl, by putting a guy down - and yes Sam gets put down all the time, being written as this mewling, pathetic tool. There is literally a scene where he joins Chloe in a jeep and gets immediately yelled at by Strong Diverse Woman to go take the back-seat. Which he complies with immediately, like a limp little soy-noodle. This unbelievable, dysfunctional relations-dynamic totally drowns out the few good things about this game, which would've been actually half-decent otherwise.\r\n\r\nSuspension of disbelief ? I'd sooner want to believe Chloe powersliding down a slope, while no-scoping 10 mercs in the span of 5 seconds, than her putting up with that hissing pot of vitriol sitting next to her, and not ejecting her out of her seat at the next tall cliff.\r\n\r\nChloe is OK, but nothing more than that. She's voiced by Claudia Black, which is always an auditory treat - but she's given the most cringy, sinfully boring script, which can't keep your attention for 10 seconds, because how rottedly mundane it is. Every time there's banter between the 2 characters - my mind would wander, looking for something more engaging - like counting my teeth using my tongue.\r\n\r\nIf I could rate U4 separately, I'd recommend it wholeheartedly. But in this \"collection\", the difference between the 2 games is just vast. I'd never pay for Legacy, and looking at the stuff ND have released lately - I'd never give them my money again. \r\n\r\nBut I'm glad I got U4 from it at least.",

Besides a great, well-builed story, the game offers beautiful graphics, with occasional landscape shots (of which there are too many later in the game), well-written characters, and a few, but visually appealing, action scenes reminiscent of a Tom Cruise movie. Well, those are all the positives for me. On the downside, Uncharted 4 is disgustingly repetitive; every chapter looks the same: a long climb, then enemies to defeat, then a cutscene revealing it's the \"wrong castle,\" and then it's back to start. After 5 hours, it's utterly boring. Nathan doesn't have a skill tree, doesn't learn new specialties, and just wanders around (people say Uncharted is better than Tomb Raider, btw). There's also a problem with enemies, as the enemy UI is as stupid as a brick, so for example, you can just hide in a bush and discover you're gone. Besides, the game heavily emphasizes stealth. While enemies can be bullet sponges, you're down in just three shots. However, stealth is difficult because of the map design and enemy placement. Coming back to the ending, I was a bit disappointed because at the end of Nathan Drake's adventures was only okay at best.",

      "review": "TLDR; I initially recommended this game, but after finishing it.. I cant in good conscience recommend it! I have no idea why ppl think this is a good game! graphics do NOT make a game.. a good story first and foremost, then good game play make a good game! the graphics are a plus and the better they are the more enjoyable IMHO (obviously with so many ppl liking minecraft.. I may be one of the few that enjoy good graphics!!). this game had neither.. story was utterly stupid (mostly toward the end), and the game play is on rails (typical console game)\n\nthe story is a bit stupid and very predictable, the ending left a bad taste in my mouth.. but considering they built this game on some historical facts. its let down by the comedic action scenes (constantly dying until you find the 'right' place to go, either in fire fights or while 'climbing'). but because they used real world historical events, its the structures, traps/'puzzles' that are beyond stupid.. not only would they have taken many decades to build, I cant imagine how they'd get the amount of materials required to build everything to the islands in quesdtion! the cost would have been immeseaurable and the amount of master builders required (to build the mechanisms, buildings, etc)..unfathomable.. it makes the game a complete joke!  \n\nregardless, game play is pretty bland at best (very 'point and clickish' because its so linear).. but the mechanics are a bit 'old school' (dumb for this 'era'!).. pushing trolleys around.. to 'solve' problems.. the over dramatic jumps/action scenes that NO one could actually do.. the ability to pick up things (even with someone elses' help!) you couldnt unless you were the hulk! you just have to constantly suspend reality/pyhsics to play this game.. and the enemy are competely stupid.. their reaction time is beyond a joke.. I do NOT like 'collect' games that put things in stupid places.. especially when it is clear that someone else would have seen the 'treasure'.. so it should be gone! if its 'out of the way' then its not so bad.. but if it doesnt add anything to the game, I'm not interested.. collect for collects sake.. no thank you! and for supposedly 'intelligent' ppl.. they are pretty darn stupid to constantly let the bad guy in on their plans.. the whole dramatic thing loses any impact when it is constantly hitting you in the face! the lying to the wife (and how did she find him!?).. the self involved glory hound that is nathan drake (\"you cant do it without me!\").. the pathetic 'action sequences' with 'QTEs' (not that you can really do anything skillful, as it is ALL scripted!!), the list goes on.. \n\nhonestly I just couldnt recommend it.. it's just NO where near as good as a lot of ppl seem to think it is.. and the second 'installment' is so full of DEI I nearly vomitted it was so bad.. almost couldnt finish it!",

When you try to aim and shoot you just get aim punched so much you can't even take quick shots out of cover to thin down their numbers.\n\nI've legit not played any single player games till this day that had me die so many times in the majority of the gunfights to the point I wanna write a negative review.\n\nEDIT:\nDO NOT PLAY ON HARD DIFFICULTY",

At the point where Drake is supposed to lift the crate, simply does not work - no matter which key or button I press, the character is unable to lift the crate high enough to place it with the others inside.\n\nThis issue completely prevents further progress in the game. I am extremely disappointed.",
