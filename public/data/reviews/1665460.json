Matches here play out more naturally, and it’s easier to enjoy the football itself.\r\n\r\nI’m neutral about the card releases every Monday and Thursday. They can get expensive, but at the same time, Konami does give free-to-play players decent cards so they can still compete.\r\n\r\nMy only concern is the power creep. We already have a player reaching 110 overall (Ibrahimovic), while most free cards only have an overall of 102. The max free-to-play card has 104 OVR (Batistuta) with the appropriate booster, so the gap is slowly getting bigger.\r\n\r\nStill, for the gameplay alone, it’s worth trying. It's free anyway.",

      "review": "so, I've been playing this game on mobile/pc/console, since 2021, and to be fair I think it's the best free-to-play football game you can play right now. \nEfootball PES 21 was the best football game KONAMI ever released, and it was perfect... But then, the very next year, KONAMI announced that they'll make the game free to play and will end the legacy of \"PRO EVOLUTION SOCCER\". The new name that have remained was \"Efooball\".  When everyone was hyped for the next update, the game wasn't really reaching the expectation. They killed the most loved game mode of the game by the community, the master league. I was pretty annoyed that they released some game modes, and the edit mode to, but i still played the game. The graphics were awful (at least on the console/pc), you couldn't even think that's \"a newer game\" than the PES 21. At launch, it was unplayable. most of the players deleted the game and returned to PES, or started playing FIFA. Even I gave up, but not entirely. You see, I was still playing on my mobile phone with my friend, because it was miles better than FIFA mobile, and rarely on the console with a cousin. The next year, KONAMI made a huge update, when they \"fixed\" a bit the graphics and the game became a bit enjoyable, they also gain more licensed team. In Efootball 2024 they added a new game mode where you can play co-op with other players, and you could finally add your friends ID so you can invite to play with you easier. And again, the graphics became to look better. The next edition they've done better, and this year even better.\nWhat I'm trying to say, is that KONAMI really tried to make a free-to-play football game that you can enjoy playing it and make it better and better as the year past, and I really look forward to see what they'll bring next.",

Ive Only played against AI not PvP and its better than other AI opponents like EA. Its fine and you dont need to spend money on coins if you dont want to as you can earn players and items to get you started. BUT to be honest the Pay/Gamble scheme for Legends and higher rated players is disgustingly expensive. Approx £150 for 20,000 coins to get the Latest Ibra and Platini is not a microtransaction its a Downright ROBBERY Macrotransaction. Whether you NEED higher rated players to win online, they no doubt help. There are some players/managers you can get that arent very expensive and as a free to play game spending a small amount to boost your starter squad is feasible. The main part being is the game Fun and enjoyable to play, yes it is, does it have faults and improvements that could be made yes it does. Worth trying out imo.",

      "review": "eFootball is a gotcha mobile card game, that is using the brand recognition of pro evolution soccer. If you accept that it is in fact not a simulation but a collectible card game, there are reasons to appreciate this game. Naturally its focus is customer satisfaction, so that people who pay for the cards have a good time. Most of the money is made on mobile, therefore there is a constant effort to make mobile players competitive. This was accomplished by trimming the manual features of pro evolution soccer that were incompatible with mobile gameplay. There are options for manual player swapping, shooting, passing etc. but these options are underdeveloped and punishing, thus generally avoided by competitive players. The game uses an event based system, so that your inputs are assessed as either successes or failures according to player attributes and an appropriate simulation of the event is generated and presented in the screen. For example in pro evolution soccer a pass or shot would deviate from their target numerically on the map so a bad passer would pass the ball to X:12 Y:18 rather than X:10 Y:20. In eFootball \"the bad pass\" is determined as failure and a result from the failure table is generated. So the pass will either go out, either go directly to the defender or the keeper. A bad pass will never end up in a random place in order to speed up the gameplay. This doesnt depend on how much you press the button, which actually determines who the pass is directed to. So you can press the pass button as hard as you like, the pass will many times leave your feet gently ending up on a defender. If you increase the manual option it will go out more often, without providing you any meaningful gameplay options since nobody cares to develop manual gameplay as it is inaccessible for mobile. If you decide to cross the ball it will check player skills and attributes, after which it will produce a cross event. How much you press the loft pass button will affect who the ball is aimed, whereas the quality of the cross depends on player attributes much like football manager. You are going for a header but do you have aerial superiority and heading skills, if not you will most of the time miss the target standing right in front of the goal. Putting a side the fact that standard (free) players fail what amateur players accomplish routinely in real life, for a manager game it even has good gameplay. You make the decisions for your players and try to interrupt AI scripted attacks. PES in mid 2000s and onwards are miles better than anything eFootball has presented so far but here is the thing, they are football simulation games. This just aint it.",

The gameplay feels decent now — player movement is smoother, passing is sharper, and dribbling has that old PES vibe in some moments. Still, you can feel the game is built around a free-to-play model, so content and modes are limited unless you’re okay with grinding.\n\nOn my RTX 4050 + Ryzen 7 HP Victus, it runs super smooth — 120–150 FPS on high, no issues at all. It’s lightweight, so the laptop barely heats up.\n\nPros\n\n✔ Solid gameplay, especially passing and ball control\n✔ Good animations after recent updates\n✔ Still has flashes of that classic PES feel\n\nCons\n\n✘ Limited modes compared to old PES\n✘ Free-to-play grind isn’t for everyone\n✘ Updates are inconsistent in quality\n\nOverall: Not the PES we remember, but it’s playable and improving. If you miss the old PES mechanics, you’ll find moments here that still feel like the good days — and performance on the laptop is flawless.",

At least FIFA has SBC's which is a good way to grow a good team, but in this game, yes, they give out a lot of free stuff, but it's just horrible stuff that doesn't make an impact on your team. As someone who got top 100k, the reward was not worth it. It's always a player who is bad and doesn't help the team at all. There are limited ways to get new players. You either gamble in packs or save up for packs that are 750 coins for managers and players + managers are 1,200 coins or more. Or you hope they give out a good free icon. Once you get to DIV 3 and above, the game is just not rewarding enough for what you have to deal with. They don't even have a reward per match; you have to wait till the season is over, which is about a month and a half or something. Not even 5 eFootball coins per match win, and you just face the pay-to-win teams who miraculously get all the rebounds and make your defense forget how to defend. Also, the passes don't go where you aim them, servers are horrible feels like I'm playing in mud. There is more, but I'm over this. Just don't play.",

The AI pulls off impossible passes, laser–accurate shots, and nonstop fancy skills like they’re playing a different game. Fine, whatever. But what pushed me over the edge is how my players suddenly turn into clueless, slow, useless robots.\r\n\r\nThey react late, they pass the ball straight to the opponent, they freeze on simple plays, and half the time it feels like they’re stuck in mud. And don’t even get me started on shooting. There are moments where I should score easily — open net, perfect timing — but somehow the ball hits the bar, bounces out, or the keeper turns into Prime Buffon. Every. Single. Time.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the AI scores with the dumbest, weakest shots imaginable.\r\n\r\nHonestly, don’t install it. It will ruin your mood.

Then ofc i lost the game, because the retarded system doesnt not let you rejoin the game.. i had this more than once, y saw oponents having the same thing.. and no, i dont feel great for having a free win, because i know i hate when i lose for the same reason.\nAnd to top it all, you get sometimes some of your ballers refusing to go to the ball, running to a ball that was through by the other side, and was go be outside the court, but they run and your team is the one who loses the ball.. sometimes the players refuse to kick the ball.. \nOh i forgot, faults.  I dont really play dirty, but the funny thing is, sometimes the game lets the other guy kick your players the whole game, sometimes not even a yellow card, but if you \"press\" on the other guy players, you get a yellow card,  and even got a red card once, in a game where the fault count was something like 13 to 1 (i  had 1) and the other guy only got like 2 yellows, while i got a red card.. and 23 where the ones i got called, problably the real amount was something like 25.",

As long as your character is better than the other, you will NOT get past that character. Which also says that this game is p2w. It wouldn't have been much of a problem until the matchmaking is so sh*t in this game because it pairs you with pros much more often, which means you have to fight players with advantage over their roster. I also dislike the sign up awards. That means everyone has the same roster than you and most likely, they've probably played more than you which just means you'll get squished by the players there. Not to mention stuff like delay, lack of roster, lack of strategies and controls, etc. Like I said, I shouldn't expect much from a free game but I still have huge standards for something that's been around for a long time.

      "review": "eFootball is the strangest heartbreak: a free-to-play football sim with some of the best on-pitch feeling in the entire genre. The gameplay is wonderfully grounded, the animations often whisper realism, and compared to FC26’s hyper-arcade physics, eFootball feels like stepping onto actual grass instead of a neon trampoline.\n\nAnd that’s… pretty much where the praise ends.\n\nThe game has almost no content to speak of. Most of what does exist is just a carousel of card players you’re nudged to buy with real money. No arena, no proper training mode like FC26 has, no league-style progression, no career alternative, nothing to sink your teeth into unless your teeth are already shaped like a credit card.\n\nAnd where is a Pro Clubs-style mode? One of the most beloved experiences in FC — completely ignored here. I’d live in that mode if it existed. Konami seems determined to pretend it doesn’t.\n\nGraphically, the game took a time machine — backward. PES 2021 looks better in almost every way, while eFootball often resembles a console port of a mobile game (and the mobile-style menu UI only makes that impression stronger).\n\nBut the real villain wearing the referee’s uniform is the scripting. The AI has an invisible thumb on the scale, especially helping players with Pass Assist 1/2 and Smart Assist turned on. These assists practically play for you, rewarding the most repetitive, creativity-proof playstyles as long as you’ve bought the right overpowered cards.\n\nManual controls (FUMA) don’t just lack support — the game feels like it punishes you for daring to use them. Finesse/Controlled Shot on manual is so poorly implemented it might as well be a placebo animation.\n\neFootball has a brilliant football heart…\nBut everything around it — the modes, the systems, the assists, the progression, the scripting — feels like it escaped from a different, far cheaper game.\n\nIf Konami ever decides to build a full game around this beautiful gameplay core, we’d have a masterpiece.\nUntil then, it’s just a fantastic match engine trapped inside a content desert.",
