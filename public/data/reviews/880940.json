This is the closest you'll get to a \"Good Mario Party\" game on Steam, it's cool it supports up to 8 players, and is much better than \"Party Panic\" as a Mario Party esque game. \n\nIt has a few problems though, you only get 15 seconds for your turn to keep things fast, and you cannot extend this at all. So if you're playing with friends for the first time, I guarantee you they'll complain about how they're not given any time to figure out what the weapons do, and whatnot. Some of the base minigames are hit or miss with janky mechanics, so it's rough around the edges for sure.\n\nApart from that, I do think this is a terrific game party game, and at just 15$, it's a must have if you like to like to play locally.

Not sure why that happened.\n\nThe game was fun and perfect for playing with family or friends. There are some cosmetics and a few mini-games to enjoy, but you really should play it with other people. The AI of the bots honestly isn’t great.

      "review": "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ An Absolute Blast with Friends — The Ultimate Party Game Chaos!\n\nPummel Party is pure multiplayer mayhem at its finest! This game captures the wild, unpredictable fun of classic party games and cranks it up to eleven. Whether you’re battling through mini-games, sabotaging your friends on the board, or unleashing hilarious power-ups, every match is a riot from start to finish.\n\nThe gameplay balance is perfect — easy for newcomers to pick up, but with just enough strategy and skill to keep things interesting. The mini-games are clever, varied, and genuinely fun, ranging from frantic reflex challenges to laugh-out-loud chaos. And the item system? Brilliant. There’s nothing quite like blasting your best friend with a rocket or zapping them off the map right before they reach a trophy.\n\nWhat makes Pummel Party shine is how it never takes itself too seriously. The humor, the ridiculous physics, and the unpredictable twists keep every session fresh. It’s also regularly updated and supported by the devs, with new content and improvements that show genuine care for the community.\n\nWhether you’re playing locally or online, this is one of those games that guarantees laughter, shouting, and unforgettable moments. It’s the perfect game for game nights, Discord hangouts, or just when you want to settle scores in the most chaotic way possible.\n\n🎮 10/10 – A hilarious, polished, and endlessly replayable party masterpiece. If you have friends, you need Pummel Party.",

Winning mini games means nothing in this, if you're not at the top of the leader boards it gives you awful items (if any at all) while pandering to the people who are top of the board. Thought it was just a bad first game, but after playing again and realizing it actively screws you over if you're not in first place I can't believe I spent money on this. Save your money and get a game you'll actually enjoy.",

      "review": "The idea is great and most of the game is too. There is just one MASSIVE issue which, in my opinion, completely messes up the experience: the player's performance in mini-games, for which you actually need to use some kind of skills, are way too unimportant when its about the (final) outcome of the game. \n\nIf you do rather well during the mini-games yet someone else randomly finds the perfect weapon for their position on the board, you can already fall behind quite a bit. And even though this game isn't necessarily about winning at all (since there are awards to be won for doing extremely bad), it is a given that anyone winning where actual skill is involved should be rewarded for that. Other than that, the balance of on-board items is 100% something that should be looked out since I don't believe anyone actually really thought about that part much longer than a couple of hours at most.\n\nIt sure is a really fun party game but its very unrewarding to do above average so to me its not really that great as a general game experience. This is the reason of me not recommending it.",
