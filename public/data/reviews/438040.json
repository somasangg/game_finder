      "review": "They say every warrior has two stories:\r\nthe one he lives… and the one he remembers.\r\nMine began back in primary school, around age 8,\r\nwhen I barely understood what I was doing — just clicking, laughing, exploring.\r\n\r\nYears later, at 20-something, I returned with purpose.\r\nThis time, I played seriously. I invested. I pushed.\r\nBut the game had changed more than I expected.\r\n\r\nTime wasn’t adventure anymore — it was currency.\r\nProgress wasn’t heroic — it was limited by hourglasses.\r\nAnd when the only way to speed up the journey\r\nis through clovers bought with mushrooms bought with money…\r\nthe grind stops feeling like a quest, and starts feeling like a countdown.\r\n\r\nSo today, I say goodbye.\r\n\r\nNot to the world — but to the race.\r\nNot to the game — but to the pressure to “keep up.”\r\n\r\nI’ll forever remember the thrill of clearing a final dungeon,\r\nthe roar of my Berserker Molgrath,\r\nthe shield of my Paladin Amoras,\r\nand the joy this game gave me through childhood and beyond.\r\n\r\nI’m not leaving because I stopped liking the game.\r\nI’m leaving because the hourglasses ran out.\r\n\r\nAnd yet… a hero who leaves\r\ncan always return — when time allows.\r\n\r\n“The adventure doesn’t end. It just goes idle.”",

So screw it.  If a company is this bad where they delete accts and characters within 2 weeks, they don't deserve money or a positive rating.  Don't even attempt to tell me to email customer service.

No new players join the game anymore, its just nostalgia chasing 30+ people swiping their rent to skip ads and idle time. Not even a game anymore.",
