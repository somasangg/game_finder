      "review": "🧠This is a fantastic game, a mercenary squad simulator set in an alternate Middle Ages world. It offers everything from managing the camp to combat based on turn-taking. The storyline doesn't matter or, rather, it is a minor issue - the game is subdivided into regions/locations, and each has its main quest. If not, the focus is gameplay - travel, collect resources (there's crafting), improve your squad overall skills (there's a progression bar for the entire squad), and individual fighters (there are seven classes, each with three subclasses), and complete quests (generated in the tavern and as part of the location's main quest chain).\nThe game is so worth the money and can actually give a delightful experience.\n\nIt looks that Wartales took a lot from Battle Brothers and Northgard as far as the management side is concerned. However, the question remains; if you're going to take the mechanics, why not take all the successful ones? In this sense, Wartales is a paradox to me. I enjoy the game, but it is missing a heap of features that are both obvious and not obvious.\n\nWartales has only five quest types generated which are to defeat an enemy team or buy here and sell there. The rest of the one-time tasks are also two: kill the boss of the location, clear the camp, and find the local crypt. That's all, in fact, there was a lot of them in Battle Brothers if you remember. Besides those, there were also hunting and tracking, escorting of caravans, delivery, artifact searches, and crises. Wartales is missing all of these.\n\nWartales has equipped the players with seven different character classes in total. The weapon types assigned to the classes are very specific: the axes, the maces, the swords, the spears, the daggers, the bows, and the brass knuckles. The three subclasses for each type of weapon are not very thrilling - each one has only two skills, which together form build variety. The rest of the subclass is identical. Do you still recall the number of skills that were available in Battle Brothers? You can say that Wartales does not even offer one-third of that variety.\n\nTo begin with, I considered the game's fight to be a combination of the ones in Heroes of Might and Magic, Banner Saga, and yes, it is similar in concept and totally similar in many ways. There are still some small differences, like half-steps, but in the end, not much has changed. Is this a disadvantage? I doubt it, because the developers have already made various battle types - battles in the dark tombs where you still have to find the enemy; a battle with a nightmare, where the enemies are causing fear effect on characters;\nan arena - three 4x4 battles with conditions and a boss fight at the end;\ncapturing bandit/robber camps - where you first weaken the garrison by finding individual groups of bandits/robbers scurrying around.\nThe combat is usually quite pleasant and stimulating; it is always a good time to engage in combat. The only thing is, however, that preparation for battle is a bit tiresome. In Banner Saga, for instance, you can see on icons which characters are taking part in the battle, and the arena is not as large and spacious as in this game, but you get used to it very fast.\n\nThe maps are quite dynamic and interactive since there are various items distributed on the maps that can be used - healing with herbs, throwing the abandoned hatchet lying nearby at the enemy. A few maps have the end-of-turn mechanics that deal area-of-effect damage, for instance, a cave collapse or lightning, and also have areas that block players, like fog that conceals only the enemies (not the players. In the fog, the enemies can see your soldiers perfectly well) and mud that slows down (thankfully, it works for both enemies and players). Everything seems to be alright, but there is a very urgent need for a height and cover mechanics. The whole map is flat in Wartales. The game doesn't let characters go up or get down anyplace or hide anywhere. Basically, there is no place to go up and nothing to get down the line.\n\nFor me the squad tactics are a very irritating part of the game. Firstly, let me explain how almost every battle goes (with rare exceptions): at the beginning of the battle the enemies are distributed all over the map. And there are also spawn points where your fighters can be positioned. And these spawn points are the main issue. It seems that prior to the battle, some unseen force has taken all your fighters, along with all the enemy fighters, and done the following: squeezed them in its hand, shaken them up thoroughly and then just thrown them on the map. What is the mercenaries' formation? What strategy? It doesn't matter here. All the fighters will be dispersed across the map in pairs, threes, or fives. Totally random. It is nearly impossible to gather your whole squad at the beginning of the battle and come up with some sort of formation. What you can only hope for is that the spawn points of your squad are not too far apart so you can place all your characters in one area of the map at least. It is quite ironic that the game has squad upgrades which allow you to create these spots closer to each other at the beginning of the battle.\nThat is my personal opinion and the instances I hold on to.\n\n✅The Good.\n- Open world with exploration\n- Professions add depth\n- Co-op/party play support\n- Emergent stories and your own mercenary tale\n\n❌The Bad.\n- Battles can become long and tedious\n- NPCs feel lifeless\n- Limited character customization depth\n- Interface is not always intuitive\n\n🧾Conclusion.\nThe game is amazing. Lively visuals, impressive opponents, glorious party management, and mainly the camp. An attractive vast map and stealthily grinding resources through simple games. It is all captivating to discover, and also very enjoyable to do. \nThere is plenty of content and the game remains fascinating. For a long time I have been looking for a game that lets you play with your own music in the background (so far I have not found anything similar except for Civilization V). Definitely, it is a must-have.\n8/10🔚",

      "review": "💬In my two-decade long gaming profession, I may have encountered nothing better than Wartales the best turn-based tactical strategy game with RPG elements. This is a very strong statement and I will try to give reasons for it.\n\n🎮The developers, Shiro Studio, who are behind the game Wartales, have managed to make a very genius, varied and large-scale fight system. At first, it is quite similar to the Expeditions series from Logic Artists but during the course of the game, it becomes evident that Shiro has really gone deeper and farther in terms of combat.\n\nWartales is a title where more than 50+ warriors can be battling in the same period on the warfront, with a large number of classes and kinds of unit already being available to take charge. The playing experience is marked by incessant development of squads and by a slow change of tactics and strategy during confrontations. Indeed, this is an uncommon turn-based game where wining the battle depends upon both tactical and strategic reasoning, and in one fight, the gamer may be directing at once two or three different tactical units, each having its own set of combat goals and manner of fighting.\n\nWartales delivers an amazing world of combat and has also an equally advanced system of crafting, thus the player can completely immerse himself in the surrounding world where 90% of the inventory items can and should be crafted which means bringing up a camp, learning different crafts, and finding out and using more and more features.\n\nAs a squad develops, it becomes possible to create something akin to a PMC with a network of bases and logistics across all game regions through a trading post system. This system is not yet fully developed; in particular, there is no regular passive income, but even the existing updates significantly enhance the gameplay.\n\nWartales is remarkable for its genuinely vast open world that is intricately mixed with several interesting stories through which the player slowly unveils the history. It is true that the developers did a few wrong things with the individual region scenarios, such as some NPCs not changing their behavior after the completion, which lessens the feeling of influence. On the other hand, completing the region scenarios and unveiling their connections offer more than the typical storyline found in other similar games.\n\nFreedom of squad development is the last thing that Wartales gives to you. You can go beyond just being a mercenary and manage a trading company, set up an organized crime group, or even put together an archaeological expedition, and then you can either put all your money into this area or spread your investments among many areas at once. The Arena has exciting gladiator battles, and you can also enjoy fun turn-based rugby games, and with the \"Pirates of Balerion\" DLC, you can not only build a ship but also start conquering the archipelago that is infested with pirates. This DLC is like a separate game already, equipped with a whole series of new, interesting mechanics to engage with.\n\n👍Positive.\n+ Deep tactical combat.\n+ Strong party management.\n+ Good replayability.\n+ Immersive medieval world.\n\n👎Negative.\n- Gameplay loop can drag.\n- Thin overarching narrative.\n- Grindy progression.\n- Stutters especially with large parties or late game.\n\n🧾Summary.\nTo sum up, Wartales has been, in my opinion, the best turn-based tactical strategy game with RPG features that I have ever experienced. If titles like Disciples, Darkest Dungeon, Expeditions, Banner Saga, and the like are your thing, then this game is a smart pick that will provide you with endless fun for hours on end.\n🎯7.5/10\n💬I wish the developers at Shiro continued fruitful development on their projects and good luck in this endeavor!",

      "review": "Wartales has been out for some time, I took a fast look at Shiro games inclusion to the world of rpg games. Let's get to it\n\nWhat I liked:\nTheme: This is several games in one. The bloodlust of Battle Brothers, Mount and Blade, the crafting, skill, and jobs of many other backward game RPGs, from exploration, to crafting, to battles. Nice Start\nAesthetics: The sounds, graphics, music, voice work, micro managing pages, all are clear and not something you are surprised with\nControls: Though you can use a controller, it is easier with mouse and key to allow functions to be manageable\nCombat: From leveling to alternate builds, you can have some nice combine controls to help create the warband you wish. \nWorld: From maps, animals, buildings, have all been presented well and all with great uses. \nTactics or Tactical: It has both a tactical feel due to do leaders, turn order, and map options, but skill combinations and coordinated warband tactics that prioritize smart choices with good level of play options.\nCustomization: Plenty of fun options to give your team the look you want.\nCrafting: You not only craft, but player control its results with cute fun animated interactions and the resource gathering matters in your crafts you choose. You Fish, Climb, Hammer, Mine, Mix drinks...hick.\nProblem Solving: You have it all like other games of missions, quests, problem solving events and the plights at hand that you resolve.\n\nWhat I feel needs improving\nCamera: Again another game that keeps you far from the action with safe isometric and lack of a more refined close up world map. Those things are clearly indicated, you would have liked this in a different perspective to put you more into the action instead of the same boring safe dull development that other companies are giving you better presentations. Clair Expedition, Mordheim, Dispatch, Camera perspectives matter\nGrind: Though you will start over, that is not necessarily a good thing. The sequencing of camp, mission, battle, complete will wear thin on you.\nSystem strain: The more you progress, the large your parties, the latency seems to struggle, so machines close to the minimum may struggle. Could run into some bug issues, but they do update things to minimize it. \nDLC: Again another game that gives you a base and adds DLCs that take advantage of your wallets\nGORE: It has blood and abusive animal themes. If you take both seriously. I can only warn. Though a standard in most games of this rating, keep in mind the illusionary game element. See the gameplay and then decide for yourself. \nEye Impaired: The Lack of UI control keeps everything small, so if you struggle with vision. You may not like this played on smaller screens. Though I did not find it an issue. It is something many developers overlook. \n\nOverall\nWartales does a lot right than wrong and a fine effort by the developers in giving you a ton to do for the price. If you love Battle Brothers and those themed games then Wartales maybe just for you. I would have to have seen a better perspective option choice in development to get you more into the game visually, but it accomplishes its goal of giving you a fine RPG old school medieval game for the price of admission. I would stay away from streamer videos showing everything, or they play for you, but you will have a ton to do in Wartales for sure. \n\nSee the video gameplay above discussion to see if this game is right up your alley and maybe wait for a discount to counter its high entry. My score 3.5 out of 5",

(The same display I'm watching them and playing game to see difference) Not sure why that is?\n\n2nd thing I'll say is if you read thru reviews and Discussions, a good portion of all the negative reviews are from folks who don't seem to have systems good enough to run the game or they seem to have ADHD? Some of that maybe oversight from DEV's min spec listing? Some are obvious that the players never bothered to check min specs and comparing \"well I can run another game fine\" silliness. Some want the game to be what it's obviously not and then just being mad about it. \n\nThis is a game that mixes RPG Visual Novel choices with Turn Base Tactics that require heavy amounts of micromanagement and mild crafting (if you don't want to deal with it you can ignore it but game rewards you for doing it). Some or all of this is not going to appeal to everyone. \n\nIt's a game meant to challenge you and piss you off to make you more determined to win. It's not about instant gratification. There are some bugs in the game and optimization seems to not be the greatest. I'm thinking it's from the mass amounts of AI engines running that just stock pile memory over time? But most of the people that enjoy the game just figured out to close out game and re-open after few hours for a memory dump. And I have had no issues while doing this. \n\nIf you love being challenged to win. Then this game has so many aspects that make winning rewarding. Literally everything you do in game has some type of reward system for doing it.  Definitely a bargain on sale. I have only done the base game and no DLC. Will update review if I buy and try.\n\nSome things I've seen people say about the game that are not true:\n1) Suspicion System: (think like GTA) Some say it's impossible to escape? Not true. I have not only robbed people, looted their homes but also fought and killed multiple waves of guard troops AND survived to take Wanted Meter back to zero. Just like GTA, the more you go wild then the more of pain in the a$$ it becomes to survive and the longer it takes to stay away and let things cool down. There are also Skills that you can earn to make Wanted Meter drop faster and even run faster when being chased.\n\n2) Animal Allies: I've seen people say there is no point in having animal allies? Completely not true. All teammates are able to be Reserved (benched) to not come to battles via their settings while in Camp. Admittedly, this Reserve System sometimes works and sometimes doesn't and I haven't been able to figure out why or how to counter? Also, it's possible to skill up certain Trades to control the animals in battle. Not just always stay dumb AI that run to die. The animal allies let you carry more loot, make you travel faster on the map and you can even armor them up so they can be damage sponges for the always larger groups of enemies.",

      "review": "Not the worst turned-based I have played... I do recommend it despite a few things I didn´t like.\n\nStory: or better stories... each region has its own story and you pick to certain extend who you are supporting. The stories are not bad and you are well enough guided through them. What I miss though is an global game story - you don´t really realise that you are through with the game until you have completed all regions and there are only side missions left. Even ending one of the 4 main ability quests, which ends up in showing the credits, doesn´t feel like a story coming to an end - that´s a bit disappointing.\n\nBattles: turn based with up to over 60 fighters both sides combined - that was a new for me. It leaves quite a lot of tactical options, even if you end up using your preferred way in over 90% of the battles not to spend too much time... so despite battles becoming repetitive, and there are many many battles, I didn´t stop playing as I do with some games that just last too long and lose me on the way - not Wartales though and I admit I can´t nail  down precisely why...\n\nResources and upgrades: huge content here - and many ways to gather resources or upgrade equipment. I could do with less, but I guess fans of chasing the next few points of strength, dexterity, critical hit chance... will find there fair share here.\n\nTime: that´s my pain point... games that last too long normally get me bored, they become repetitive sooner or later and make you wish the end is near so that you get rewarded by a nice grand story finale. As mentioned above, that´s not the case here... Also long games do not encourage me to play them again to try out a different approach or different ending.\n\nAnd still I do recommend Wartales\n\nOh, and one question for you - I just saw that my review shows playtime of 136 hours, but playtime in my steam library shows 250 (definitely feels more like 250) - does anyone know why there are 2 different playtimes?",

I highly recommend this game if you like party management because it's the meat of the game. You have to choose the classes, assign them jobs to fit your needs, enslave prisoners if you so choose to, tame animals to add as another combat character etc. It's just so much to do.  \n\nThe game has a grey moral system so there is no real right or wrong. You are mercenaries though so how you want to influence decisions is up to you but they don't cause actual impact for yourself because why would it be? You're mercenaries your services belong to the highest bidder or whoever you deem worthy of your services. But as all things if you do too much crime, the stablishment will hunt you down..like KCD2's Devil's band. \n\nThe story/quests are good enough to keep you engaged. The world is vast and enemies are varied. From zombies, to animals/insects even zombie animals to various types of human enemies, combat never gets dull especially as you unlock new skills/classes and try out different combos.\n\nThat said, there are cons such as the UI is kind of lacklustre. For instance, when trying to solve puzzles you literally either have to snip the picture and paste it somewhere, or when entering sepulchre doors, you have to go into camp to refer back to the codex to see what the actual runes are. There's no way to access it from the compendium tab. I don't know why maybe i'm doing something wrong. Also, people be forming couples but then there's no upside to it? I don't understand the purpose of it at all. \n\nThe Tavern DLC also does not have an option for you to just collect all your earnings at one go. So I have to manually click thousands of times just to collect earnings? No thanks. \n\nThe DLCs are also terribly expensive even if they do enhance the gameplay. That said, they're nice additions, not a must have. The core of this game is undeniably great and you'll enjoy it without the need for DLCs. \n\nHope people give this game a chance, especially when the game is on sale.

It has a hundred mechanics that are explained and another hundred that are completely hidden and obfuscated which normally would annoy me but man, the way it hits you with cool upgrades and character interactions just from doing stuff is sick. \r\n\r\nI have not tried the DLC. The amount of DLC and price seems a little rough, I hate the Paradox style production technique of all updates being a paid DLC.\r\nThat said, I do highly recommend the base game even at full price, but if you can catch it on sale definitely give it a try.\r\n\r\nThe game feels like a mix of old school Dungeon Siege meets Final Fantasy Tactics.\r\nIn a weird way, it even has a gameplay style reminiscent of a monster collection game like Pokemon.\r\nPeople that enjoy fantasy RPGs and team building games, but with Diablo-esque loot, and very high customization and open ended gameplay but aren't huge on story or railroading, I give it a solid 9/10.\r\nUnderrated gem!",

      "review": "In Wartales, you assemble and manage a band of medieval mercenaries, fighting battles and cooking meals. Units have different classes, which can be developed into specialized builds. All this happens in a large open 2D map, with some light story/RPG elements mixed in (a \"tactical RPG\").\r\n\r\nThe combat system is turn-based, with each side taking turns with individual units.  If the enemy has equal numbers, you will move one unit, then they will move one unit, and so on.  You can freely choose which unit to move, but that unit must take all of its actions for that turn.  The order in which the computer moves its units is fixed, so you can target the one that is going to move next.\r\n\r\nEach unit has active and passive abilities.  The active abilities require spending \"valor points\", which are in a pool shared by your entire team.  Certain actions, such as striking multiple units with a single attack, will earn a valor point.  Valor point management is a key factor in both your tactics and the way you build units.\r\n\r\nFeeding and paying your troops is also important.  There are camp upgrades that make these easier.  You can learn a variety of recipes, which require different ingredients that can be purchased or scavenged.  Some recipes can be combined into \"feasts\", which provide more nutrition per ingredient and also give bonuses to the entire warband.\r\n\r\nYou can craft armor, weapons, and gear.  One significant annoyance is that some of the gathering and crafting actions require playing a real-time mini-game, usually based on clicking at just the right time. Some of these can be ignored, e.g. you can do without fish or superior gear, but sometimes skills like mining and woodcutting are used to clear debris.  While most of these are pretty easy (crafting at the forge seems a bit finicky), the game would be better off without them.  There are also some non-real-time puzzles, e.g. a sliding tile game in Ancient Tombs and a Mastermind game when deciphering artifacts, that are pretty simple.\r\n\r\nThe game lets you adjust the difficulty for combat and troop management independently, so you can configure it to your liking.\r\n\r\nThe game was generally stable, with no crashes, but sometimes it freezes up for 10-15 seconds while launching for no apparent reason.  If you get a black screen, don't let Windows kill it right away.\r\n\r\nAt a high level, its similar to Battle Brothers, but it plays very differently.  Notably, BB required you to adjust your tactics significantly based on the nature of the enemy.  With the exception of rat nest clearing and the odd \"boss\" fight, combat in Wartales has more of a rinse-and-repeat feel.  This is why I'm stopping about halfway through the campaign.  With 40+ hours spent, I definitely got my money's worth, but I just don't feel the need to finish.\r\n\r\nRecommended for fans of turn-based tactical combat games.",

It goes for a bit of a tough survival feel although it does feel more forgiving. \n\nThe world itself is very low-fantasy so mostly realistic with a few very light fantasy elements and with a bit of a gritty feel to it. Somewhat unique in this sense. \n\nThe gameplay is solid with a good range of abilities for each class although it doesn't have any cover mechanics or any defensive preparation like barricades unlike Expeditions.

I plan to play it again with mods after a couple more updates as the game is still actively being developed.\n\nIts hex style turn based combat but you bring your own army. You have to fund them, feed them, train them, make sure they're happy, etc. Then you bring your army all around the world to do different tasks, engage in combat, get into interesting adventures and happenings, and change the landscape (minutely) with decisions for the politics and happenings in that region. Plenty to do but it all more or less involves combat. Theres also a rugby type game mode later which is different enough to be interesting even if the RNG can be rather frustrating but its not impossible. \n\nCombat is very fun if youre into the turn based but sandboxy - bring your own. Meaning there are minimal pitched fights - its not a puzzle game its a tactical RPG game where you recruit and equip your own units. This is a double edged sword though as you can be supe runderleveled for a fight as well as super over leveled. You could do adaptive difficulty if you want it pretty difficult the whole way through though. Combat feels like youre hitting the shit out of someone with a bunch of armor on and is plenty bloody and each kill feels like a success. loot the dead, use it to gain more power, rinse and repeat as you scope out the next fight. Combat is good fun\n\nOverworld has many different types of terrain and I really like how that reflects on the battlefield. Cool but nothing incredibly new - but each region is at least notciably different. Plan your resources, upgrades, and movement to pick the right fights and grow intelligently or at least with purpose.\n\nProfessions are cool they really add some depth to the game imo. Each profession does something passive or sometimes direct to increase your power and resources more and more as you grow. Eventually you can become pretty self-sufficient as long as youre fighting and looting effectively. hint: when you get to the point you can afford a trading post - it would be wise to store excess resources in there for later.\n\nBase game was fantastic but left me wanting more at the end. Luckily theres the Skelmar Invasions, and pirates of Belerion really add some different flavor to the game and I am about to finish Belerion and it has been pretty cool and very different compared to the rest (combat is more or less the same except on ships you have a few things that are different you have to watch out for) different enough to capture my attention all over again.\n\nOverall Im nearing the end of my first playthrough and Im kind of sad. What an awesome bring your own army tactical RPG game. Not many like this. I love hex turn based combat but all the other games feels like it limits you way too much where as this one leaves you open to either scale up effectively and become a powerhouse (with your own units and thus startegies) or make the wrong decisions and experience pain.\n\nHighly recommend if you're into these turn based hex-like tactical/strategy games. I think in that regard this game is extremely underrated.",

You can very quickly learn a sprint skill allowing you to run across the world map for faster travel, and you buy upgrades like horseshoes for your animals to move faster as well. You can even speed up combat animations if they feel to slow.\n\"I stole something and guards got mad at me!\" I don't even know what to say to that one. \n\"I upgraded my horse and the game didn't tell me that was permanent!\" Again like, really man?\nYour inability to understand a game doesn't make it bad.

Keep trying X number of times until you find the pattern that makes it work kind of thing.\n\nThe survival element becomes the biggest thing in this game while the combat and RPG ones fall behind.\n\nAnother thing is combat. The game tries to scale with what your party is apparently. You get a bigger party and manage to struggle to get good gear through all the resource attrition it will just get unbalanced harder.\n\nThe idea is apparently you will loose some members in battle where you'll just have to replace them and/or you keep reloading and doing the battle over again several times until you get a better outcome.\nSome of which is random as maybe one of the baddies will get a chain of random crits that kill your favorite party member.\n\nLike any bad balanced game, maybe fun for awhile but then you notice the tedium vs reward diminishes.\n\nI wanted to like it, like a bad movie you hope it will get better, but I had to jump off as it just wasn't getting any better.\n\nI think they would be much better off just reducing the max party size like traditional party based RPGs do so it would make it easier for them to not get lost in balancing things properly.\nAnd say if you go running around and find a random iron rock, it shouldn't always be just a constant single one. It should match your party since. Like one or more resource per party member.\n\nFor most games they will try to hide a lack of content and/or depth in one area by making another element harder.\n\nI'd like to see a better \"WarTales 2\"",

I do not recommend at full price.\n\n[h1] The Pros [+] [/h1]\n[list]\n    [*] Aesthetically and mechanically, the world is rough, hostile, and basic, as it should be for a band of fictional Medieval Mercenaries. No \"magicking\" your way out of even the basic things.\n\n    [*] The Profession minigames are well conceptualized, not too difficult and gratifying to perfect.\n\n    [*] The Combat system is well designed. Tactics, strategy, and logistics all play an important role, and the Valour point system does not let you monotonously cheese your way through things. \n\n    [*] Character progression, interpersonal relationships between mercenaries, and the overall development of your warband are all well conceptualized. Every new gain is felt, as is every loss. I cursed up a storm when my blacksmith was lost clearing out a nest of Plague rats.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] The Cons [-] [/h1]\n[list]\n    [*] Bugs - Frequent animation freezes can be a real nuisance, especially when you are trying to get the timing on Profession QTE's just right. Also, after a certain point, black screens become more and more frequent, forcing me to restart the game, sometimes a full reboot.\n\n    [*] The crime and theft system is on the wrong side of egregious. When you steal, it is always detected. Chances at stealth simply do not exist. Worst of all are the Guard patrols, which are too many and ridiculously committed to running you down, even at the lower Wanted levels. This is supposed to be a Medieval setting, not Cyberpunk.\n\n    [*] Story Elements - Secondary, at best. Questlines and unique traits that are supposed to be present with unique recruits are absent due to either bugs or incomplete design. Damned disappointing.\n[/list]\n\n[h3] Conclusion: [/h3] Get on sale. Standard price is too much, especially with all the expensive DLC.",

I am not sure why it has so many good reviews, maybe its based on the demo or people did not play it for long. The bad reviews are real. \n\n1) it does not say anywhere in the game or help that once a pony has been upgraded to war pony, it cannot be disabled from joining in a combat and cannot be changed back. It is permanent and the A.I bot will always control the pony to move in front to die in combat. If you have will power, it will help. But until then, its GGWP. U will get a huge suprise.\n\n2) It keeps giving random tip to capture animal but they are probably useless like the wolf which is also controlled by A.I and suicidal\n\n3) The wanted score is totally lame. Even if you have like 68 score and 0 stars, you will have 2 -3 patrol instantly spawning in front of you after you camp and sleep. Once you enter a tower, speak to someone (note: time is frozen when you spoke to someone in the cut scene in the tower structure), you exit the tower, 2 patrol armies instant spawn in front of you and chase you with top speed.\n\n3) The aggressive range of being wanted with the vigilant or cannot remember what skill/trait is useless. The guards are all homing onto you from one side of the map and spawn next to you.  So the wanted 0 zero stars and score is lame when 2-3 patrols keep spawning next to you and tailing u. \n\n4) everything is dark and gloomy in color and contrast etc. I think it is purposely done so to show the doom and gloom of the world and the fate of the characters. It is so hard to see things in the battle map or world map or dialogue area.  Have to click everywhere or increase brightness of screen.\n\n5) Online article say openGL is more stable and worst graphics than the 3d. To me, 3d is lousier than 3GL and both are not stable.\n\n6) i do not see the oldest job in the world yet after playing for 1 day - pr0stitution. I do not see slaves yet either. Maybe its just one day of playing but I dont find any realism if there arent any of these. I do not see LGBTQ either . I am quite certain in such a realistic world, there should be some action that is not related to battle either.\n\ni tried this game  on free weekend until 11 Nov @ 2 am. But I am stopping early because the fishing, pick locking , wood chopping etc etc gets repetitive and tired. \n\nYou really have to figure out a lot of things by yourself.

The rest is mostly just managing supplies by cooking stuff with purchased salt supply, and equipping the party who has very inflexible mastery over only their initial weapon type. The town's blacksmith doesn't sell any equipment at all and you mostly have to smith stuff yourself with the variety of resources you collect around the map. \n\nTurn-based combat is manageable when you have a small band of troops, gets increasingly tedious as it gets larger and battles become a slogfest. Combat UI isn't great either, could've highlighted allied and enemy troops with different colors, as every human unit looks similar; move distance for both enemies and allies could've been shown by default by simply hovering or selecting them, instead of being a two step process of having to select units and hover over the move command for every unit.\n\nCombat skill-tree is a bit questionable in design, I'm wondering why I shouldn't just fill the party with berserkers whose combat efficiency far surpasses most other unit classes. It's also annoying that many classes can't be equipped with any (light, medium, heavy)armor until lvl 3, which takes quite a few combat encounters to grind out.\n\nNon-combat profession system is kinda interesting, but apparently there's an epidemic of short term memory loss in the middle ages where all experience is lost if you switch from one profession to another, even if they share the same mini-game like woodcutting and mining.  Personally I don't mind the mini-games that come with most of them, except fishing, which is poorly explained.\n\nRoleplaying is pretty limited. In the first area you can make morally-grey binary choices to side with either the villagers of the county or desperate neighboring refugees. As far as your party member goes, all of your troops are pretty interchangeable; once in a while while camping, there might be randomized events with minor choices. \n\nThe game is also rather buggy and crashed several times.",

And we tried 4 times, sorry no thank you.\nAnd apparantely it has been like this since for a long time.\n\nThere are \"fixes\" online, try this, do this, if not that, then this. etc etc.\nBut its not my job to make the game work, the devs are responsible for that, not me, nor my friend who had the same issue. I shouldnt need to \"fix\" it from my end, it should just work.\nBut they have no issues pushing out DLC after DLC, fix your mess first.\n\nSo because of that, the game is a hard no for me. The blackscreen just ruins it, straight off.\nBut when it worked, it was fun.\nI liked creating my own character, i thought the battles was simple and fun, thrilling even.\nI actually have no dislikes about the game (for the short period i got to play, maybe there is something further in i dont like) This is good.\n\nBut pushing me out of the immersion, over and over. Nope.\nThen i rather give it a negative review, because if its all positive, then who would care to fix it.\nWell we, the players of course.\n\nWe were very close to buying it, when this issue started showing up constantly.

      "review": "Honestly did not even feel like writing a review, but I feel I have to for the sake of others looking for a similar experience as me.\n\nTLDR : Great foundation; managing a growing merc band and exploring the world feels awesome but the lack of customisation kills the roleplay. You can’t rename or change titles, can’t edit most companions, and the modding/save editing scene is tiny. At this point, just play modded XCOM 2 if you want tight control over a band of mercs. This game isn't it.\n\n----\n\nLove the core idea i.e starting out with a handful of mercs and slowly growing into a roving army, managing food, wages, and morale while exploring the map yourself instead of through menus. It nails that grounded, gritty “mercenary band” feel. (starting my own Band of The Hawk and being the Griffith is always a niche itch many squad-based tactics games miss).\n\nBut man, the customisation is frustratingly barebones. You can only edit the looks and gender of your starting four companions, who themselves are randomised and locked to the four base classes. Once someone earns a title, that’s it. You’re stuck with it forever, can’t change it, can’t rename it. You’re fucked if you didn’t like the title they got. Hint : titles also are “secret” unlocks as in “engaged melee with x enemies” which just sort of happens in the back. There’s almost no control over the little flair things that make a troop feel yours. The game wrestles control away over flair details away from you. At least allow the starting 4 mercs to be completely under my control lol.\n\nThere’s no “sandbox” or roleplay flexibility at all - not even an option to disable achievements for full control. Why can’t I change meaningless things like the titles of my characters? Might not be important for you but I know these things are important to a subset of players who are like me. So important I’d start a new save or reload hours back to fix it. Just a shame this game isn’t good enough for me to want to rewind those hours back.\n\nModding and save editing aren’t reliable either, since every update breaks them (not all mods, but mostly save editing stuff), and the mod scene isn’t nearly as alive as something like XCOM 2. There are mods on Nexus, but fewer than 100, and honestly most feel low-effort or abandoned.\n\nCombat itself doesn’t look or feel as great as other giants in the genre (XCOM, BG3, Divinity:OS2) though it can still be satisfying, and it works well enough. Might just be my setup (playing on a laptop while away from my PC), but the animations and impact feel a bit off compared to the big boys.\n\nInventory management is also annoying. No “sort” button, no “sell all junk,” nothing to make late-game looting smoother. Battles themselves get stupidly tedious the deeper you go, and what used to feel tactical becomes a slog. There’s no way to choose which of your troop goes into combat.\n\nAnd yeah, the DLC. It’s not Paradox-level yet, but it’s starting to feel that way. Tons of extra content dangled in front of you in-game when the base experience already feels unfinished as an open-world, squad-based RPG in my opinion with what little control you’ve got.\n\nI jumped the gun and bought it on sale because I've been waiting to play this for a while, also grabbed Skelmar DLC. Wish I could refund it now tbh.\n\nIt’s a shame, because the foundation is great. The world, the travel system, the combat loop are all solid. But when a game is built around your band of mercenaries, it really sucks that you can’t make them feel like [i] your [/i] band.",

I'm not interested. Shut up shut up shut up.\n- bug: audio is muted by default on all channels.

With a grid, everything is planned out , who’s where, what movement needs to be done and you can be much more tactical with positioning.\n\nI’m also missing  chaining actions and the ability to pass a turn. Here I have to move, wait, attack, wait, and then pass. In Dofus, I can just do 1, 2, spacebar, boom, done.\n\nOverall, the world doesn’t click for me visually, and my perspective it just feels unpolished, like sauce poured over bare bones. The story and honestly the whole “life” of the world and its NPCs just doesn’t land. I don’t believe a word they’re selling, and the vibe just isn’t there for me. Plus the movement feels janky and the camera is weird.\n\nSo why am I writing a negative review for something that’s free for the weekend and I don’t even own?

      "review": "[h1] CHARACTER CREATION [/h1]\nCharacter creation is not detailed enough, and the character models are not that good either. I mean, seriously, why are all female faces ugly? Especially white females look terrible... Or why don't we have any normal/handsome looking guy faces either? And what's wrong with hand models?! Even on males, those big hands look weird AF, but on females they are just outrageous, and weirdly enough all NPCs in the game are using the same limited character models, so everyone looks like everyone, and that kills all immersiveness, and makes getting into the game harder than it should, I mean, how it won't? Imagine going to a blacksmith and seeing he has the same face and hair as one of your characters. How should that make any sense?\n\n\n[h1] ARE STORY AND STORY-TELLING GOOD? [/h1]\nThere is no main story; instead, each region has a storyline that players can investigate, and characters' interactions with each other. Meanwhile, they are not bad, can't say they are good, and along with a lack of a main story, it makes the narrative quite lacking.\n\n\n[h1] HOW ABOUT QUESTS? [/h1]\nIn most quests, you face choices, and mostly it's about killing either one person or another. While it's kind of interesting to have control over things like that, still, I feel like it's too limited, like why is there no option to fix things in other ways? Certain quests have some options like bribe or scare them, but it's mostly for only one side, for example, for getting a unique item called ''Fly'' you are forced to kill one refugee, because while you can bribe or scare other people, you can't do the same for her, which is nonsense. There are tons of nonsense quests like the whole Woodcutters situation as well. But still, some quests like ''Sikha's Fangs'' were interesting, which you kind of have to follow the trail she left behind, it feels like hunting or something like that.\n\n\n[h1] HOW ABOUT THE COMBAT/GAMEPLAY? [/h1]\nIt's decent at most points, and has alright variety, but it gets repetitive at some point, and the whole needing to constantly upgrade your gears, etc, doesn't really help either.\n\n\n[h1] HAHA FIRE GOES BRRR [/h1]\nIn this game, burning/fire attacks sucks, because when you attack someone with fire, and they are on fire, if they attack you as well, you get fire too! That makes using fire completely useless.\n\n\n[h1]GEAR SYSTEM SUCKS[/h1]\n90% of the gears are not upgradeable, that's quite nonsense, but what makes it worse is game difficulty being nonsense as well, you are literally forced to grind up to date gears constantly, because even going 2 level behind with using gears you like their bonus or look, etc, can make fights hard AF and you might face with losing your units over and over again, and all of these combined makes gameplay tedious and annoying.\n\n\n[h1] LOCKPICKING SUCKS [/h1]\nLockpicking did not become easy even when you reach the highest level, or even with the lockpicking item. Personally, I was waiting for it to become automatic when I reached the highest level, but it was literally the same as before, such nonsense. And like this is not bad enough after some progress with the game, even easiest locks, like the ones with little food in it have 3x locks to pick, wtf?!\n\n\n[h1] CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT SON [/h1]\nYou can reset your character's specs, but not d*mn stats, why the hell not?! WHY?!\n\n\n[h1] WOW! SOO HARDCORE! SO REALISTIC![/h1]\nFarming some mats at the early game is pretty d*mn annoying and hard, like why is it so hard to find/farm d*mn cloth or grease?! You can buy leather and oil from normal merchants, so why not cloth and grease?! It's behond me how they can make something like this RNG, all animals have fat, and all people wears clothing, can't loot the stuff literally there, and it's being rare loot is behond stupid.\n\n\n[h1] NAMING SYSTEM SUCKS [/h1]\nI found the game naming system is quite annoying and nonsensical, like seriously, we have country names, simple right? And you wanna go to a certain country, but on the gates it says another name like Edoran, then you look what is Edoran in regions, you found nothing, then search the net, and found it lets you go to the Country of Arthes, bro seriously why doesn't it state lets you go to Arthes?! Why? It's so d*mn basic sh*t to do! How they even messed this up?!\n\n\n[h1] DLC SYSTEM SUCKS [/h1]\nDLCS should be part of the main game are sold separately, which is something I hate.\n\n\n[h1] VERDICT [/h1]\nDespite all the CONS, I enjoyed the game most of the time, and I'm gonna suggest at least giving it a try, because it's worth that alone, but as a whole experience, honestly, I'm not fully sure myself either.\n\n\n[h1] RATINGS [/h1]\n[*]Story & Story-Telling = 5\n[*]Gameplay Mechanics  = 7\n[*]Gear Variety & System = 6\n[*]Enemy & BOSS Variety = 6\n[*]Visual Style & Quality = 7\n\n[*]General Rating = 6.2",

You get to recruit, customize, and equip your party, and as they grow and develop, you really feel rewarded. I liked the sense of progression and the freedom to explore the world at my own pace. The exploration itself is well done, with a large open map and plenty of contracts and locations to discover. It really gives you the feeling of leading a group of adventurers through a medieval world.\n\nHowever, the experience is weighed down by several frustrating issues. A painfully slow traveling across the world map with no way to speed it up, which makes moving between locations feel like a chore. Performance was also a problem - I ran into frequent stuttering, long loading time, and even a couple of freezes.\nIn addition, It’s hard to get into the game when the UI need to remind you that don’t have specific DLC, it breaks immersion and makes the game feel incomplete.\nI wanted to like Wartales, but in its current state, it needs better optimization, more quality-of-life improvements, and a less intrusive approach to DLC.",

      "review": "Battle Brother is better than this.\n\n4/5 of the way through the main game, I hit the level limit... I mean come on, including all the DLCs, there's tons of content to explore and no more progress to be made with my troop.\n- Despite the limited fast-travel system, you will spend A LOT of time walking VERY SLOWLY between locations scattered across a continent, with ways constantly blocked by (in)conveniently placed rivers and mountains. That funnelling of your exploration I could understand if this were a linear plot, but it's not, it's open world. There are horses aplenty in the world, but can you ride them? No. Can you buy a wagon like all the merchants have? No.\n- You can run, but only for a very short time before your stamina is exhausted. Does dropping into a tracker camp, or stopping to chat and trade with a merchant restore you stamina? No, oh but walking (slowly) does...\n- Many resources are in short supply. Wood is one of them, despite you being constantly surrounded by forests and (in my case) having a master woodcutter along. You can pick it up off the ground, buy it occasionally or chop it at specially sanctioned wood-chopping stations where a certain amount of wood may be chopped within a fixed time period.\n- Speaking of chopping wood - the mini games, Oh my God! They were an attractive and really fun part of the game when I first started, but they wear thin, VERY quickly. Picking locks, mining, forging, fishing etc all become tedious in the extreme.\n- Animals are, by and large not very useful. You can encounter and recruit half a dozen different species. Horses are useful for carrying stuff and in the early game, bears make good tanks. After that, I got rid of all my non-horse animals. Trying to keep them alive on the battlefield was just a massive hassle.\n- Battles are slow. Even with the animations turned up to maximum speed, they are slow. Some animations don't make sense, and you always have to wait for them to finish. Defeated enemies leaving arenas, for example. Or lightning strikes - these take place one at a time and consist of two animations, one small explosion followed by the actual bolt. These sound like minor things, but they add up and end up becoming annoying. Later in the game when there can be 40+ combatants, battles can become a bit of a chore. Why won't those 30 under-levelled and massively out-matched wolves run away until you have slaughtered 26 of them? Who knows. Why did they attack in the first place?\n-Speaking of which, you have complete freedom to move your mercs to any of the available starting points in each battle, but no control at all over where they initially spawn. This means you will have to reposition most of your mercs in EVERY SINGLE battle. Why the game chooses to hide your tanks at the back or make the front like knife-wielders and archers, with alarming regularity, I have no idea.\n- I hate the escape battles in cursed villages with a passion - so incredibly tedious, slow-paced and poorly designed.\n- Cooking is tedious (and you'll need to do a lot of it to maximise your food usage). There's not one window where everything happens. Each recipe cooked is a series of pop-ups and confirmation clicks, with a drop back to the camp screen to show your cook 'receiving' the cooked items. It would be a lot easier if you could cook more than one thing at a time, but you can't.\n- Loot, like in so many games, is by and large useless and just stuff to sell. You'll be waiting for high-level forged items and legendary items (plus the money to upgrade them).\n- There are some natural resources lying around that you can't seem to reach - usually iron ore in the sides of hills, where you can't seem to get your characters close enough to pick it up - better pathfinding would help - see below.\n- When you are buying things, you can't scroll your inventory. Nor can you see how many of anything you already have, so you have to either just buy everything you think you need, or keep dropping out of the trade screen to check.\n- The tavern DLC is fun for a couple of hours, then just becomes a pointless background detail where you are constantly plagued by the same old requests over again. +10 Influence - oh, yay! I already have 8000... the tavern has a different currency for some inexplicable reason, which you can withdraw in very limited quantities. It's handy, but doesn't ultimately have much game impact. My tavern currently has around 40,000 currency and there's literally nothing to do with it.\n- The Feif DLC is very similar (and also has yet another currency). Once you've completed your feif after a few hours, it becomes background fodder. You can't withdraw the currency. It has almost no impact on the main game. There's no point in sending any mercs you garrison there on missions because there's nothing to do with the proceeds. Bad relations with other countries have absolutely no effect on you. It all feels a bit pointless.\n- All the DLC are quite expensive for what they are, and they don't seem to add much to the game. Each seems like a good idea poorly and minimally executed.\n- The pathfinding is really bad - inexcusable in this day and age. Getting across bridges and round small, sometimes barely visible lumps in the ground, becomes very tiresome. What tends to happen is they walk until they hit some sort of (usually visible, but not always) obstacle then just stop. The number of times I've had to click on resources, merchant groups or pitons multiple times to interact with them is annoying. Having to click 3 or 4 times on a piton whilst running from the guard because your guys just dumbly stand next to it is rather frustrating.\n- Being a bad guys is tough. The game implies it's a perfectly valid option, but the rewards are few and constantly dodging the guards who are, until later in the game, always more powerful than you, is just not worth it. You can't befriend bandits or anything like that - again, it feels a bit pointless. Robbing the odd merchant of a bit of cheese to reduce your food bill is about all it's worth bothering with.\n- And finally, there is the story & tutorials. Oh. My. God. Tiltren, the usual starting province is well written and provides a decent grounding in the basics. After that, good luck! You will inevitably spend a small age walking backwards and forward (and eventually Googling) trying to work out what the hell you have to do next or how certain mechanics work or where you find a resource you apparently suddenly need.
