      "review": "TL:DR; Some prefer this to the sequel, Its a very solid first entry that has genuinely expansive and quality expansion packs/DLC.\r\n\r\nCoH 1 is interesting to compare to its sequel and DoW 2 -it has a slightly higher priority on base-building and whilst each faction does have its fair share of differences I'd say they're less different feeling than in CoH 2. They all have their niches; Americans are fast and adaptive, Germans 1 are slow and tough, Brits are defensive and sneaky, and Germans 2 are experimental and on wheels.\r\n\r\nThere's not a lot to say other than it pioneered the squad & cover based gameplay that the gaming community really enjoyed to the point it made its way into different franchises made by Relic. The campaigns are fun and unlike CoH 2 you get one for EVERY faction, not just the starting two.\r\n\r\nI can't speak to the multiplayer scene or balance, but I always got the impression this was better balanced than its sequel on that front- god help you trying to get into it now. Old multiplayer games like these without proper skill-matchmaking tend to calcify their gaming community quickly into \"you are statistically much more likely to come across someone so above your skill level you may as well be a chew toy\" and this dries up the pool of even and fun matches for anyone new.\r\n\r\nEven not on sale its pretty cheap, and it goes on sale a lot. I heavily recommend it to fans of strategy games, and this goes for the expansion packs too.",
