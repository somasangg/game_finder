      "review": "Summary: It's better than Wilds.\n\nI don't know how to sufficiently praise this game. I feel like it and this series was made to specifically ingrain itself in my brain. The hunting, tracking, trapping, and research that goes into a hunt is such a peak experience. Yes, the areas can be a little tedious to run around in...but they're honestly small enough and you have enough traversal tools that it isn't really a problem?\n\nWhere Wilds gives you a mount and automates hunting things down with little to no study or research into a vast and unknown ecosystem, World feels like you're truly trodding into new ground and territory with each map. Not to mention the vast, almost limitless collaborations and content that was added in rotation after the game was \"done\". Missed the Resident Evil collab? It's still there, just a pretty high level event.\n\nAnd Icebourne? Well all I'm going to say is that there's a reason why the DLC is the same price as the base game.",

The weighty combat, the atmosphere, and how alive every monster feels make each hunt unforgettable.\nCompared to Monster Hunter Wilds, World is slower but far more immersive and grounded. Wilds may be bigger and flashier, but World delivers pure hunting excellence.\n10/10 – A timeless masterpiece.",

I think the monster designs are bang on and while the main story can drag on (see what i did there) at the start, as you progress there less escort quests and much much much more 'kill this big-ass dragon NOW!!!!!!!' type quests (which is appreciated) and I dont think I will ever come off the high that was soloing the final boss of the main story (IT IS SO PEAK). Now I am around a third of the way through Iceborne and it is superb.\r\nIf like looking at cool monsters, and want to feel cool as fuck beating the shit out of them - this is the perfect game for you.\r\n\r\nPLEASE PLAY THIS GAME ITS ON SALE LIKE ALL THE TIME AND ITS FUCKING AMAZING",

The world feels alive, every area is full of creatures, details, and dynamic monster fights that never feel the same. The combat is deep but smooth, and every weapon has its own personality, so finding your style is fun. The best part is co-op, hunting giant monsters with friends is exciting and honestly the heart of the game. The gear-crafting loop keeps you hooked -  hunt, upgrade, repeat.\nIt’s not perfect. The game can feel grindy, especially when you need rare materials. The learning curve is also a bit steep in the beginning, and matchmaking can sometimes be frustrating. But once you get into the rhythm, it becomes incredibly satisfying.\n\nOverall, even in 2025, Monster Hunter: World is absolutely worth playing. It’s huge, challenging, beautiful, and endlessly rewarding.",

      "review": "Less a review and more my personal experience with the series. \r\n\r\nBeen interested in MH ever since I was little, I adore the monster designs, I'm a sucker for cool heavy armor, hardly gets more tempting. Still I suck at action games and I love animals so I wasn't sure if I could ever enjoy a 'hunter' game. \r\n\r\nDecided to finally bite the bullet and try MH Stories a few months ago, and in short, those became my current favorite games in terms of gameplay, they were incredible. My interest in MH only grew deeper so I started watching the old games on youtube and I quickly fell in love with the world. My worries about the whole 'hunter' thing were quickly shattered. The monsters of monster hunter are simply that world's wildlife, nature is filled with incredibly dangerous creatures that are a constant threat to humanity. We hunt them not for recreation, but for survival, and to preserve the things we wish to protect. Humans are simply another piece in the food chain. Or to put it more bluntly; if the local geese could carpet bomb your house you'd feel a lot less bad seeing them shot. In a sense I'm glad I ended up waiting to get into MH since I doubt my younger self would've been able to appreciate something this nuanced.\r\n\r\nAnd now we finally get to World. It's the first game available for me to get on PC, and it's the game that introduced my favorite monster, Nergigante. So I went out of my comfort zone and decided to play a 3D action game for the first time.\r\n\r\nAs always, where MH shines the brightest is with giving you so much freedom. Right off the bat you get to choose between a bunch of weapons, so you're pretty likely to find something that fits your playstyle. The game throws you out in a very open world where you're free to hunt whatever you please and craft whatever you want, I hardly ever felt stuck since there was always something I could farm to make the encounters I was struggling with easier. \r\n\r\nTo my surprised despite having never played 3D action games I loved MH World all the same and before I knew it I not only completed my goal of defeating Nergigante but also cleared the main story. No help from strangers, no cheesy tactics, just me bashing everything in the head with my trusty hammer. \r\n\r\nI'm really glad I gave MH a shot since it's shaping up to be one of my favorite series, and I encourage others who had similar worries to mine to give it a shot regardless... assuming anyone made it this far into my TED talk.",

      "review": "If your looking at reviews for the game, its too late, just buy it. here is why\n1: it doesnt have issues like another game that recently game out, \"cough\" wilds \"cough\"\n2: though it isnt fully open world, at least at my stage in the game, the areas feel extreeeeeemly alive. there are small creatures running aroung, ranging from weird cute fuzzy farrets with wings to almost flat cactus that run away from you. OH, and get this, you can \"net\" (for lack of better words) some of these creatures and release them in your room! PREHISTORIC CACTUS PETS! there are multiple bigger monsters that will have turf wars, and it can get pretty chaotic and awesome at the same time.\n3: you have a bipedal cat that you can dress up in cute or feisty armor and they will even heal you! mine has saved me countless times from being chomped by a t rex with weird malfunctioning wings.\n4: the armor sets look SO FLIPPING DOPE, and so do the weapons. Some people  will say that the weapons look like someone slapped on a feather or a scale, and though this is true with some weapons, it sort of makes sense: heyyy guys I just got home after killing this monster that dosnt have scales and im going to forge a razor sharp sword out of his toenails. wait what... feel like you need more than ten toenails and 20 teeth for a greatsword the size of your upper body.\n5: combat. people say its slower than wilds or rise, and that is probably true. However, in my extreeeeemly arrogant opinion, it doesnt matter. some of the weapons pick up speed, or they feel very smooth(like the longsword) also, think if it like this: remember the toenail greatsword I spoke of a moment ago? welp I dont think you would be very agile with it, and it obvoisly doesnt attack fast. also, your a cool jacked hunter, hunting massive beasts, why on earth would you use small weapons?\n6: the story so far is so so cool! there are quite a few bad-ass cenematics with either your character or another. it also feels like it provides you with something to do when you are tired of \"grinding for monster parts\"(it also unlocks more of the game)\n7: there seems like an endless amount of content, and i dont even have the dlc or done with the story!\nif you actually read all of this, just buy the game, or wait till its on sale. Its emersive, in some ways its funny and cute, you can customize your room to have pets and ect, you can get cute costumes for your cat thing, there are a TON of monsters and creatures with a seemingly alive ecosystem, oh and there are actually white people it this game witch is nice. just buy it, best $40 purchase in a while",

      "review": "My new hyperfixation and favorite series, I didn't know anything about mh before playing mhw this year, I only thought it was the typical AAA game that's just loved by everyone bc \"big company, lots of money for a simple game, realistic graphics is the only good thing going for it and blablabla, is probably not good and only a cashgrab\" yeah stupid from me and completely not biased being someone who mostly plays indies, then I met my gf and she wanted to try mhw with me some day, so I decided to buy it just to try if it works on my computer it does and I start playing with her, didn't take me long to fall in love with this game, and then the whole series, these games are just amazing I feel wrong and so stupid for originally believing that these games were bad just bc AAA, the games are just hard enough to be challenging but fun, the world and ecosystem is just gorgeous, the story might not be the best but mh never tried to make the story their main priority (except in wilds), learning about the monsters and their ecology reason to exist has become one of my new hyperfixations of the past months and I haven't kept throwing hours into mhw just bc I'm beating the game with my gf at the same time and we just arrived in the guiding lands, doesn't matter if I already know something from other games the game never stops to amaze me and gives me an amazing challenge that I want to keep playing and playing just for fun hunting and mastering the weapons, if you're new yes play mhw is amazing to play I only recommend you to do 2 things: 1. Don't play with the defender armor/weapon it ruins the experience of getting better and learning how the gameplay loop works so do yourself a favor and play without them, 2. Buy the dlc once you're done with the main game, why? Bc the clutch claw a mechanic implemented by the dlc can make you have it extremely easy immediately during low/high rank where monsters won't punish you as much compared to master rank exclusive to the dlc, those recommendations are just for following what is the original intended path of progression in a way that makes you understand and be interested in the games in a more deeper level to maybe love the series as a whole too.\nAlso as an extra damn this game is well optimized or at least for me I play on a laptop i3-1005G1 1.2Ghz with the Intel UHD graphics for 10th gen and just 8ram and I run the game at 24 maybe at 12-15fps in the forest while it's raining but for my computer to run that stable is just amazing that's more than enough to play in my opinion and it hasn't ruined my experience while playing I've been enjoying it and loving it so I'm guessing someone with a better pc than mine will be able to run the game no problems.\nI do recommend it's not just fun this game is peak and a great starting point for the series and has become one of my favorite things this year and new favorite series and I plan on keep playing for years to come, gotta thank my gf for showing me so many amazing games this year",

I may not be the most experienced in the franchise's many titles, but what I have played, I've put a lot of hours of enjoyment into, including Tri, which I went into completely blind and ended up playing literally until the servers closed down.\r\nI could talk about and applaud so many different aspects of this game, but in short, I think this is an amazing starting point for curious players completely new to the franchise, but also ask that veteran hunters, who skipped this release or left quickly after initial reactions, go back and give it another earnest look, to enjoy the depth of programming and design expertise, as well as passion and detail.",

But ever since the title update that added the FFXIV monster, I can't boot the game. Crashes immediately. Every. Single. Time. So my friend suggested we start playing World. Holy shit. I actually love this so much more than Wilds. Wilds would take a couple minutes to boot; meanwhile this game launches right away. There just is so much more (to me it seems) reliance on the player's ability to pay attention to the fight and surroundings and not on just pressing a button to call for your seikret to save you. I can see what people are talking about with Wilds being too easy. It just seems to do so much handholding. You get on your seikret, press a button, and hold the sprint button to automatically go to the quest location. Here, you actually have to explore the areas on foot. \n\nI don't know what else to really put here. I like Wilds. Only play that game if you have the best computer that man can afford. I like World. I like it more than Wilds. Not that I didn't have good times playing it. But since I can't play it right now, World comes out on top. I think I've had way funnier moments playing this game than the latest one. It (along with Wilds) are some of the few games where if we die, my friends and I laugh it off and just get back into the fight. My friend and I were fighting Teostra last night and just after I died to his ultimate attack, a rando joined (who was hacking) and teleported and insta killed it. It was so funny. Yeah I like this game. I recommend it.",

You start of running away from these giant beasts but once it clicks you end up knowing a monster so well you can beat the crap out of it without being hit once and have them flailing on the floor for most of the battle. Very satisfying.\nSome endgame bosses seem impossible but with enough practice they are all beatable.\nStarts off quite simple but gets grindy towards endgame.\n\nOverall game play loop: 7.5 / 10\nHealing teammates dressed as scantily clad warrior with rainbow wiggler head on: 10/10",

      "review": "It's unusual for me to reflect positively on having spent an extra hundred and fifty hours in a game that I would've said before was horrible. Normally, after two hundred hours, you have a pretty good grasp of whether or not you like a product. This time, though, after I ground down the grinding lands, massacred every creature, put far too many moles into pipes and stared into the soulless, life-consuming eyes of the handler for far, far too long - I actually look back now, and find myself glad that I got through. That I kept going past the point that would've been the end of my journey, if it wasn't for my completionism.\r\n\r\nMHW starts pretty strong - the ability to try out all the weapons right off the bat is wonderful, and it let me settle on the weapon I loved most - Lance. I felt strong, fighting my way through monsters, suffering carts but always making progress. I completed all the quests, got to the beginning of High rank and worried that this is where I'd run into a brick wall. I was thankfully wrong - as I kept going, albeit with more carts and frustration now, slowly making my way towards the final boss of High Rank and of the base game - Xeno'Jiiva, my absolute favorite monster in the whole game to fight. Defeating him felt amazing, the fight was perfect, and I went into iceborn with my head held high, happy and enthusiastic for what would come next.\r\n\r\nThen Iceborn hit me with a rock, dragged me into a river and watched the bubbles until they stopped.\r\n\r\nTo say there was a... spike in difficulty would be a great understatement. I went from sometimes tense but rewarding fights to twenty plus minute slogging sessions as creatures with obscene amounts of HP vaulted over my head ever two seconds, spamming projectiles and insanely fast attacks. The old world wasn't safe either - you thought Rathalos was bad before? Hoo boy, you wait till you see Master Rathalos who seems to be allergic to the ground and has an arson streak longer than the unskippable cutscene before Alatreon. I went from comfortable to suffering, enduring fight after fight that just seemed to layer bullshit on top of bullshit - where I'm being expected to clutch claw onto a monster that throws me off in nanoseconds of me grabbing it, spending so long away from my reach that it turned into more of a badly-designed, poor hitbox laden bullet hell than a game about hunting monsters. I kept going, kept pushing, my will to continue eroding with each and every Acidic Glavenus, Ebony Odogaron or Tigrex caterwauling around doing obscene damage. Finally, i reach the final boss of Iceborn and... i get so very dissapointed. It's just a worse version of Xeno'Jiiva, with worse hitboxes, ridiculous damage and an ugly design. I was about ready to just cheat, call it in quits and blitz through and be done. But I stuck it out. I knew that, if I could just make it to Fatalis, I could plunderblade my way to the ultimate gear. That's exactly what I did.\r\n\r\nDragging my way through Rajang, the epitome of bad design, to Furious Rajang who is just an even worse type of shit than regular, getting a breather with Stygian Zinogre and Safi, having the game straight up lie to me with Alatreon (because it doesnt mean \"elemental damage\", it means \"fire or ice damage based on the form he's in, which means the lightning i was doing did NOTHING\"), until finally I was face to face with the ultimate dragon. Through hours of Plunderblade, part breaking and a shit ton of crashes, I finally had my armor - the ultimate armor and weapons, with which I could conquer the rest of the game. Then, it got so much nicer to play.\r\n\r\nNow, monsters that were three shotting me barely hurt. I had enough decos to make a killer build, and it no longer mattered if an enemy spent 90% of the fight unreachable, because I could hit them for a massive chunk when they were available. Knockback didn't (always) send me to the opposite side of the arena, as I cleaved through enemies with even more ease than I did at the start. The game finally let me appreciate it, the awesome visuals, the interesting monsters, the remarkable attention to detail and the really cool customisation options. When the game stopped trying to be Dark Souls but replace fair with bullshit, it was actually a really good time. But I had to go through hell to experience that hundred hours of fun at the end.\r\n\r\nI've diverted from my usual review style for a reason, and that's this: If you are doing just the base game, you'll have a great time. If you're planning on going beyond, then read my story carefull and ask yourself: Am I willing to suffer for eighty or so hours to get to the point where the game becomes fun again? For me, my eyes were set on a goal that got me to that destination without *too* much stress, as much as I hated it at times, but for a regular person? I'd be very surprised if you'd be willing.\r\n\r\nIf you play this alone and have a low tolerance for bullshit then be warned: Iceborne is not the game for you. Otherwise... the best advice I can give prospective buyers isn't a comprehensive breakdown, but a warning: It's a sweet beginning and a satisfying end, with a rotten middle that serves to highlight every single flaw this game has. If you get hooked at the start, try your best to power through to the end, because Iceborne isn't fun 80% of the time, until you become strong enough to counter the bullshit. When the game lets you, it's a really enjoyable experience. The rest of the time? I hope you like pain, tedium, death and frustration - but at least for me, it was worth it. Thankfully.",

In comparison, other 3rd-person games with melee weapons (Zelda, Souls, etc) just have a \"target lock\" system (where you always look at the enemy). Tilting the analog stick sideways makes the character sidestep, not rotate.\n\nFor me, this seemed like a forgivable problem, since I main Bow in Wilds (alongside with SnS). So on the surface, I thought I could just transfer my knowledge from Wilds back to World with only a bit of hiccup. But it turns out this weapon was designed with a completely different mindset -- almost like a different genre entirely!\n\nBow in Wilds is about agility. You can [i]infinitely[/i] Discerning Dodge out of danger. Charging Sidestep to keep momentum. Flying Swallow to close the gap (or run away quickly -- looking at you, Omega's Mustard Bomb). Then Thousand Dragons for huge burst point-blank damage, or Piercing Dragon from far away along the monster's length. You can even tag the monster with a Tracer for homing shots, or Focus Strike on wounds to stagger the monster. The options are wide open.\n\nBow in World? Just shoot-shoot-dash, shoot-shoot-dash, [i]shoot-shoot-dash[/i], rinse and repeat. Forget about Piercing Dragon because once you initiate it, you can only adjust the angle slightly (and it takes so darn long to charge). Also forget Thousand Dragons since it requires you to load slingers first (which is fun, tbh, but the uptime is so slim). Flying Swallow isn't in this title; instead, the same button combo becomes a jumping melee attack that resets your momentum. There also no Discerning Dodge, so say goodbye to your precious iframe. Most importantly, don't even trust Charging Sidestep -- the game only recognizes 4 directional inputs despite being performed on an analog stick. Plus, it seems to prioritize forward direction even when I'm tilting the stick to almost 9/3 o'clock, so the game dashes me straightly forward into death instead of sidestepping to the left/right out of danger.\n\nI mean, I picked up Monster Hunter to fight the monsters, not the controller.\n\nThe game isn't \"bad\" per se. On the contrary, it's a beautifully crafted game. Going back to Wilds, I already miss the \"footprint tracking\" system. It’s also great to see more monsters in the franchise. At the very least, I think I'm going to complete the whole game, including the fearsome Fatalis (by letting my friends carry me). But will I [i]master[/i] it like I did in Wilds? Absolutely not.",

But with this game, I just can't get into it. I've tried so hard to like it, giving it four separate attempts, but damn, it's just incredibly painful to play. I could never last more than two hours before uninstalling.\n\nThe tutorial is okay, it teaches you the basics and gives you an idea of the gameplay loop. The problem is, as soon as you're past the intro, you get bombarded with a ridiculous amount of information. The terrible font and the bloated, unintuitive UI are enough to give you a headache. I absolutely hated it.\n\nAt first glance, the starting area seems really interesting, but God, it gets boring so quickly. And goddammit, I hate the blue tint filter they put over everything; it's so unpleasant on the eyes.\n\nThen there's the combat, which is supposed to be the gem of this series, but for some reason, I couldn't get into it either. Everything feels so rigid and weighty that it makes the original Dark Souls look fluid by comparison.\n\nHonestly, the game just didn't click for me, no matter how hard I tried. I even convinced some friends to play with me, hoping co-op would make it better, but we all just ended up getting bored together, lol.\n\nIf you're already a big fan of the series, this is probably a great game for you—many people consider it one of the best. Unfortunately, it just wasn't my vibe. If you're on the fence or if this is your first Monster Hunter game, be careful. The tutorial can take a while, and you might accidentally play past the two-hour window to get a refund",

      "review": "If you've already poured hundreds of hours into Wilds, don't pick up this title as your \"next Monster Hunter\" game.\n\nI mean, World is good and fun. But the gap in control schemes between 2018 and 2025 is [i]wilds[/i] (no pun intended).\n\nBasically, I just couldn't play melee weapons in World because there's no \"focus camera\", where you hold (L2) to control the direction your character faces. So your attacks will [i]stupidly[/i] miss the target most of the time because your character is facing slightly off by 15 degrees, thanks to the disjointed 2 analog sticks for character facing and camera control. --- This isn't about \"adjusting\" your facing during a long combo. This is about \"how can you be sure\" you're facing the correction direction [i]in the first place[/i]. In comparison, other 3rd-person games with melee weapons (Zelda, Souls, etc) just have a \"target lock\" system (where you always look at the enemy). Tilting the analog stick sideways makes the character sidestep, not rotate.\n\nFor me, this seemed like a forgivable problem, since I main Bow in Wilds (alongside with SnS). So on the surface, I thought I could just transfer my knowledge from Wilds back to World with only a bit of hiccup. But it turns out this weapon was designed with a completely different mindset -- almost like a different genre entirely!\n\nBow in Wilds is about agility. You can [i]infinitely[/i] Discerning Dodge out of danger. Charging Sidestep to keep momentum. Flying Swallow to close the gap (or run away quickly -- looking at you, Omega's Mustard Bomb). Then Thousand Dragons for huge burst point-blank damage, or Piercing Dragon from far away along the monster's length. You can even tag the monster with a Tracer for homing shots, or Focus Strike on wounds to stagger the monster. The options are wide open.\n\nBow in World? Just shoot-shoot-dash, shoot-shoot-dash, [i]shoot-shoot-dash[/i], rinse and repeat. Forget about Piercing Dragon because once you initiate it, you can only adjust the angle slightly (and it takes so darn long to charge). Also forget Thousand Dragons since it requires you to load slingers first (which is fun, tbh, but the uptime is so slim). Flying Swallow isn't in this title; instead, the same button combo becomes a jumping melee attack that resets your momentum. There also no Discerning Dodge, so say goodbye to your precious iframe. Most importantly, don't even trust Charging Sidestep -- the game only recognizes 4 directional inputs despite being performed on an analog stick. Plus, it seems to prioritize forward direction even when I'm tilting the stick to almost 9/3 o'clock, so the game dashes me straightly forward into death instead of sidestepping to the left/right out of danger.\n\nI mean, I picked up Monster Hunter to fight the monsters, not the controller.\n\nThe game isn't \"bad\" per se. On the contrary, it's a beautifully crafted game. Going back to Wilds, I already miss the \"footprint tracking\" system. It’s also great to see more monsters in the franchise. At the very least, I think I'm going to complete the whole game, including the fearsome Fatalis (by letting my friends carry me). But will I [i]master[/i] it like I did in Wilds? Absolutely not.",
