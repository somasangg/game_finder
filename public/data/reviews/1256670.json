Enjoyable, tightly designed battle system with constant 90 degree difficulty spikes. Not for the faint of heart. My only real complaint is that it's tutorial could DEFINITELY be better. \n\nI'll admit I got stuck at SEVERAL points in the game, but if you're willing to put the time in and learn and respect the game's mechanics I'd genuinely say this is one of if not the best games I've played and definitely worth playing.\n\nNot going to go into the story beyond just saying that it's good. It does a really good job expanding the setting and giving more context for the world after playing Lobotomy Corporation, their previous game which was a lot (imo) less focused on the setting outside of the building.\n\nIf you care at all about the story or anything I'd genuinely recommend just not looking up anything at all about the game online or engaging with the community because in my experience Project Moon fans are extremely gung ho when it comes to just spoiling stuff for no reason.\n\nMusic's incredible, no notes.",

You will try out pages of minor characters since there are very few golden pages at this stage of the game. \n\nHowever, you will soon start to get flooded with golden pages that you have to start using if you want to finish the game on your own without a guide. This sucks since there are alot of minor characters/pages that I would like to use, but they simply suck compared to the other pages. \n\nAlso another (smaller) problem would be the floor balance. It is very clear that some floors are OP (Yesoda and Gebura), while others come online way later in the game that I didnt feel like bothering to make them work.\n\nOther then that I would highly reccomend you to play this game.

This game is hard and learning how to make effective card combinations and builds will be deciding factor between dropping the game at Queen of Hatred or not.\r\n\r\nIf you however persist and this game *clicks*, it becomes one of the best deck building/turn based experiences I played and I mean overall, from music to world building.\r\n\r\nMy final grade is 10/10, which in my turn doesn't mean the game is without faults, it is however one of the best experiences I ever had with a video game and I hope that Ruina becomes more well known and can sit alongside indie titans like Undertale.",

The story lacks sense and keeps introducing random characters that proceed to immediately die and never be mentioned again, on top of both spoiling the lore of the previous game but also contradicting it.

Some fights are essentially impossible because the enemy just gets more attacks per turn than you do ensuring you are guaranteed to take damage and the only solution for this is to ***at random*** obtain a key page with more attack slots as a reward from a stage, which is NOT guaranteed and you therefore could just never get one and be stuck, unless you waste time grinding some boring level over and over again.

You also need to grind to even be able to play or progress the story whatsoever since stages require books to enter but the stages you need to grind on also require books to enter, which means basically failing one of the aforementioned impossible levels means you will have to waste a lot of time just to get a chance at trying again.

      "review": "Start of the game is miserable. The story lacks sense and keeps introducing random characters that proceed to immediately die and never be mentioned again, on top of both spoiling the lore of the previous game but also contradicting it. The gameplay is boring (basically a point and click since the bit of strategy you'd expect is ruined by the dependance on luck) and particularly RNG based (Speed values, enemy targetting, clash and attack power on combat pages). Some fights are essentially impossible because the enemy just gets more attacks per turn than you do ensuring you are guaranteed to take damage and the only solution for this is to ***at random*** obtain a key page with more attack slots as a reward from a stage, which is NOT guaranteed and you therefore could just never get one and be stuck, unless you waste time grinding some boring level over and over again. Game is extremely buggy and has a tendency to just delete my combat pages during librarian customisation without making them be re-equippable or anything afterwards which means they're stuck with weaker attacks unless I go back to mf grinding for the combat pages. You also need to grind to even be able to play or progress the story whatsoever since stages require books to enter but the stages you need to grind on also require books to enter, which means basically failing one of the aforementioned impossible levels means you will have to waste a lot of time just to get a chance at trying again. Bashing your head against a brick wall feels the same as this game but it at least has tangible results. Genuinely see no reason to ever play this over Lobotomy corporation or Limbus company, especially since the latter is free.\nPeople in the community all say that it gets better later on and that you could just download mods to skip the grinding and whatnot but honestly, if you need to download mods and spend hours enduring the mindnumbingly mediocre gameplay just for it to start becoming playable, then the game isn't good. Don't waste your time or money on this.\n\nTLDR : Senseless story, unfun gameplay (repetitive, completely RNG based, extremely grindy, losses are punishing but victories aren't rewarding). Only good parts are the soundtrack and the art and you can just find those online so you might as well go and look them up instead of forcing yourself to play this utter mess.",
