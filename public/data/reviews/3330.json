It's a small yet addicting game that  definitely had its concept not stolen from a Japanese company.\n\nYour objective in Zuma is to clear all of the marbles on the way before they reach the skull (or two) and become the Sun God.\nPlaying as that frog, you can find sorts of power-ups that will help do your job easier. You can also find coins, create gaps, combos and chains in order to finish the level.\nThere is also Gauntlet Mode, a practice and a survival mode aimed to test your Zumaic skills. Think you can make it to Sun God 10?\nI also love the artstyle it uses. Good gracious how beautiful it is!\n\nMy criticisms when it comes to this game is how repetitive the music is; I swear I had to listen to the full song sometimes during Jaguar/Sun God levels since they're too long. For difficulty, it's a bit balanced but I have to say, it is harder than Zuma's Revenge (a bit closer to Heroic Frog).\nNot only that but the game can be often boring if you have nothing to do, especially if it's your only game.\n\nConclusion:\nZuma Deluxe is a good casual game if you're into old times. It's still solid to this day but I recommend its sequel if you want more content. The choice is yours tho.\n\nFinal Rating: 7/10",

Основные уровни пролетают на одном дыхании, даря ощущение легкой победы, но не стоит расслабляться – игра умело подкидывает своеобразный челлендж, заставляя напрячь внимание и реакцию. Да, игровому процессу катастрофически не хватает разнообразия в изгибах уровней для шариков и различных бонусов (Например, как в Luxor 2005), которые могли бы добавить глубины геймплею. Но! Эти недароботки можно простить, ибо перед вами квинтэссенция классики, проверенная временем. В ее простоте и есть магия, заставляющая возвращаться снова и снова. Ну а что говорить то еще? RIBBIT!\n\n[h1] When we were young - Ruki Vverh! (and when our parents got into it) [/h1]\n\nZuma Deluxe is a fucking classic! The main levels fly by in one go, giving you the feeling of an easy victory, but do not relax – the game skillfully throws up a kind of challenge, forcing you to strain your attention and reaction. Yes, the gameplay sorely lacks variety and twists of the levels for balls and various bonuses (for example, as in Luxor 2005), which could add depth to the gameplay. But! These shortcomings can be forgiven, because here is the quintessence of classics, time-tested. There is magic in its simplicity that makes you come back again and again. Well, what else can I say?

The spheres that tumble forth are no mere ornaments of color but the very relics of a degenerate Aztec pageant, a carnival of chaos born of crude sacrifice and primitive awe.\n\nAnd yet, as I set myself to the task of firing one orb into the next, I felt the thrill of dominion over that lesser heritage. What the Aztecs could never master, I dispatched with a steady hand and a mind sharpened by discipline. To them, it was frenzied blood and stone; to me, it is geometry, rhythm, and the sweet song of inevitability as their sacred marbles shatter in ordered succession.\n\nZuma Deluxe thus becomes an unintentional comedy: the trappings of fallen civilizations preserved in pixels, only to be neatly subdued by the modern player who bends their savage art into a pastime of precision. The game is simple, hypnotic, and entirely delightful, though I cannot play without smirking at the thought of those long-vanquished builders of temples watching their legacy reduced to a frog spitting marbles.\n\nIdk, it's pretty fun.",

      "review": "let me get things straight, i played this game before i got it here on steam. Good and simple game design, good game doesn't need to be complicated. Level design, stunning and iconic. you will still remember it a decade later. although, I've been playing for over 2 hrs and I already noticed some problems that you won't really notice in the first few levels.\n\n1. User Experience does not meet up to what the game is.\n\nyou can't have a good gameplay flow without a good UX even when your game design is brilliant. The pace off how you shoot the ball is a bit too slow for it to get exactly where its supposed to get. the movement of the balls in the \"alley\" are too jerky in speed that is a bit hard to predict. This is more noticeable in a few levels in, causing you to place the ball in the wrong slot when it gets tighter. \n\n2. Some parts of the level map is a bit harder to distinguish when trying to place the ball, it is hard to tell the separation of the overlapping lanes when its crucial. \n\nwell to be fair, I do not remember Zuma to have these problems, it could be that it is just this version on steam. It has been a while since I last played it. Came back to play for User Experience module in university.",
