I play with my friend who’s overseas (about 8+ hours away), and it works perfectly with Remote Play. I use a controller while my friend plays as Player 1 and I’m Player 2.\n\nI haven’t noticed any of the translation issues mentioned in earlier reviews — it seems like the developers have fixed those. For the price, this is a solid game. Some levels are pretty challenging, and there are tons of maps and a wide variety of different drinks to make.\n\nIt’s not a casual, laid-back, “healing” type of game — you’re working in a café with high-demand customers, kind of like PlateUp! Overall, I highly recommend it!\n\nP.s. The fox is Good for the second area, lots of stirring involved. (unlocked fast stir at level 2)",

It starts off easy, but gets very difficult very quickly.  I've been struggling on a number of levels as well as some of the higher difficulties.  I'll be sinking a bunch more hours into this one!\r\nI know this is early access, so here are a couple of my quibbles with the game.\r\nI'm not a huge fan of the devil character - I really would not have expected that in such a cute graphical style.  I also wish there was a way to start a day over (even if it's only once per week), as sometimes I've just made a massive ordering mistake.  A couple of other small visual things (like the steam is hard to see compared to the stale graphic), and it can be really hard to see what is or isn't already in the cup (so you get things wrong without knowing why).",

      "review": "as a solo player, Feed the Cups is so much fun! the feel of the game is different enough from overcooked, plateup and cooking sim, that it's now a permanent addition to my cooking game collection. where overcooked throws novel complications (moving stations, player-controlled platforms, ice/fire lvls, etc.), plateup throws time, space and floor management, and cooking sim yeets wonky 3d physics at you, feed the cups' bread and butter is requiring you to fulfill orders within seconds with near perfect accuracy while balancing inventory, space, stress, and cleanliness management with every order and potential customer. \nalthough both ftc and pu feature talent/resource selection inbetween days, ftc has a breakneck pace due to the stall setup. the customers will leave if their order is not taken or fulfilled quickly enough, and a mistake means you've wasted not just time, but resources. i think the most different aspect of ftc is how you deal with purchased resources.\nat the beginning of your first shift, you're met with a brand new location and boxes of supplies that need to be taken in and stocked before being torn down and trashed. not that big of a deal early game, but come the last few days when you've added a recipe that needs 3 new ingredients and a new cup size, you'll find that space management becomes a huge factor. \nadded to that, every buff (aside from reputation gifts) comes with an \"equal\" anti-buff and these are potentially devastating. tho, not enough to make you lose outright, unless you've already been screwing up. \n\noverall, i feel like this game truly stands on it's own legs apart from other popular games in the genre. \n\np.s. if you really cannot handle even cheeky depictions of the devil/pentagrams, this game is 1000% not for you. you will have no choice but to interact with the devil and his contracts.",

I play with my friend who’s overseas (about 8+ hours away), and it works perfectly with Remote Play. I use a controller while my friend plays as Player 1 and I’m Player 2.\n\nI haven’t noticed any of the translation issues mentioned in earlier reviews — it seems like the developers have fixed those. For the price, this is a solid game. Some levels are pretty challenging, and there are tons of maps and a wide variety of different drinks to make.\n\nIt’s not a casual, laid-back, “healing” type of game — you’re working in a café with high-demand customers, kind of like PlateUp! Overall, I highly recommend it!\n\nP.s. The fox is Good for the second area, lots of stirring involved. (unlocked fast stir at level 2)",

I play with my friend who’s overseas (about 8+ hours away), and it works perfectly with Remote Play. I use a controller while my friend plays as Player 1 and I’m Player 2.\n\nI haven’t noticed any of the translation issues mentioned in earlier reviews — it seems like the developers have fixed those. For the price, this is a solid game. Some levels are pretty challenging, and there are tons of maps and a wide variety of different drinks to make.\n\nIt’s not a casual, laid-back, “healing” type of game — you’re working in a café with high-demand customers, kind of like PlateUp! Overall, I highly recommend it!\n\nP.s. The fox is Good for the second area, lots of stirring involved. (unlocked fast stir at level 2)",

It starts off easy, but gets very difficult very quickly.  I've been struggling on a number of levels as well as some of the higher difficulties.  I'll be sinking a bunch more hours into this one!\r\nI know this is early access, so here are a couple of my quibbles with the game.\r\nI'm not a huge fan of the devil character - I really would not have expected that in such a cute graphical style.  I also wish there was a way to start a day over (even if it's only once per week), as sometimes I've just made a massive ordering mistake.  A couple of other small visual things (like the steam is hard to see compared to the stale graphic), and it can be really hard to see what is or isn't already in the cup (so you get things wrong without knowing why).",

      "review": "as a solo player, Feed the Cups is so much fun! the feel of the game is different enough from overcooked, plateup and cooking sim, that it's now a permanent addition to my cooking game collection. where overcooked throws novel complications (moving stations, player-controlled platforms, ice/fire lvls, etc.), plateup throws time, space and floor management, and cooking sim yeets wonky 3d physics at you, feed the cups' bread and butter is requiring you to fulfill orders within seconds with near perfect accuracy while balancing inventory, space, stress, and cleanliness management with every order and potential customer. \nalthough both ftc and pu feature talent/resource selection inbetween days, ftc has a breakneck pace due to the stall setup. the customers will leave if their order is not taken or fulfilled quickly enough, and a mistake means you've wasted not just time, but resources. i think the most different aspect of ftc is how you deal with purchased resources.\nat the beginning of your first shift, you're met with a brand new location and boxes of supplies that need to be taken in and stocked before being torn down and trashed. not that big of a deal early game, but come the last few days when you've added a recipe that needs 3 new ingredients and a new cup size, you'll find that space management becomes a huge factor. \nadded to that, every buff (aside from reputation gifts) comes with an \"equal\" anti-buff and these are potentially devastating. tho, not enough to make you lose outright, unless you've already been screwing up. \n\noverall, i feel like this game truly stands on it's own legs apart from other popular games in the genre. \n\np.s. if you really cannot handle even cheeky depictions of the devil/pentagrams, this game is 1000% not for you. you will have no choice but to interact with the devil and his contracts.",
