There are maps that are either easy or maps that can be very difficult to beat, depending on the difficulty chosen, but it is all part of the fun of this game.\n\nThis is definitely a must game to buy for any tower defense and strategy players, and not to mention, it has co-op you can play with either random people or friends, which is even more fun.\n\nP.S: You guys should add Extreme Difficulty maps just like in BTD4 & 5 <3",

I wish Plants VS Zombies had ended up like the Bloons series instead of becoming a cheap sellout joke of a franchise that hasn't made a decent game since the very first one. BTD6 is what happens when the same developer stays consistently good for over 15 years straight without selling their soul to a huge company. This is definitely a great comfort game to chill out and play but you can also go full min/max and go for a 7 hour hardcore round with friends. The art style looks somewhat kiddish but the gameplay can get unbelievably challenging depending on what modes/events you're playing. I think this is really a game for everyone and I hope ninja kiwi stays passionate about this franchise. Also a fun fact: I have never in my hundreds of hours of playing BTD6 (I have many more hours on mobile) encountered a single bug or glitch, which I'm not sure I can say for any other game out there",

      "review": "Unfortunately, tower defense games have been on a decline; it’s a game genre that’s considered old or “a mobile game,” and honestly, it’s true.\n\nThis genre is very old and was built on limitations, this game though, it’s different.\n\nThe general simplicity of “monkey pop bloon” and “big and cool monkey pop big bloon” is very inviting and easy to understand, yet the game can get very difficult and requires great understanding and patience. The difficulty range is incredible, if you’re a chill gamer, you can play an easy relaxing map, and if you are a hardcore gamer, there are much more difficult maps that will take you hours to figure out. And don’t get me started on CHIMPS…\n\nDid I mention the challenge/map editors? You can find thousands of custom-made challenges/maps that are very accessible through the game. Some of them will showcase something cool, others will teach you something about a specific tower, and some will take you days to figure out.\n\nThe amount of game types, upgrades, levels, tower combos, maps, and challenges is truly remarkable — easily the best and most complete tower defense game on the market, and it’s piss cheap (on discount it's less than 2$)\n\nOVERALL RATING: 8/10\nGreat game that is for everybody.",

      "review": "[h1]What is it?[/h1]\n\nBloons is a classic tower defense game where your sworn enemies are… balloons. You stop the sinister rubber threat from reaching the end of a path by deploying an army of cute monkeys armed with everything from darts to literal orbital lasers. As rounds progress, the bloons get faster, tougher, and develop special properties. This forces you to combine tower types, manage resources, and make enough strategic decisions to qualify for a mid-level military consulting job.\n\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\n\n[b]Strategic Gameplay[/b]\nThere’s a large variety of monkeys to choose from, each with unique upgrade paths that range from “reasonable” to “Did we just invent monkey-powered thermonuclear warfare?” Advanced maps throw curveballs at you so you can’t just run the same cookie-cutter strategy every game. A passive skill tree adds even more depth, just in case a hundred upgrade options weren’t enough commitment for you.\n\n[b]Replayability[/b]\nThere are so many maps, modes, challenges, and events that you could play this game for weeks and still go, “Wait, what is that tower supposed to do?” And the devs add new content constantly: monkeys, maps, cosmetics, they’re in a long-term relationship with this game and it shows.\n\n[b]The Vibe[/b]\nEverything is aggressively cute. The monkeys? Adorable. The animations? Adorable. The bloons? Adorable but also evil. If you ever need a quick dose of wholesome serotonin to forget the horrors of adulthood, boot up Bloons and let the monkey army soothe your weary soul 💜\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n\n[b]It's a Mobile Game[/b]\nYou can tell this game was designed for mobile first. The game occasionally tries to lure you into buying in-game currency, just a little nudge like “Hey, wouldn’t unlocking this hero instantly be nice?” \n\nBut honestly, you don’t have to buy anything. I haven’t spent a single cent beyond the base game and a DLC that adds a rogue-like mode and I still ended up with more in-game currency than I knew what to do with. So while it’s technically pay-to-progress, the grind is gentle and fairly balanced. And not buying anything also keeps the sense of progression intact.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nIf you enjoy tower defense games, Bloons is a no-brainer. With tons of replayability, ongoing updates, and cross-progression between Steam and mobile it’s the perfect game whether you’re killing five minutes on the train or five hours avoiding your responsibilities at home. It’s charming, strategic and just the right amount of addictive.",

      "review": "[b]Bloons TD 6[/b] is an extensive, modern instalment in the Bloons Tower Defence series of strategy games, and as with the previous games in the series, the main objective of the game is to build and maintain a line of defence against approaching balloons, utilising monkeys of a range of classes with special abilities. The game, on top of its large collection of playable maps (and their additional game modes), also offers multiplayer features, encouraging team effort in building a successful defence.\r\n\r\nThe game keeps players engaged and coming back for more with daily challenges and global events. Players can also create and share their own challenge maps with others, allowing vast customisation options for players seeking for specific types of challenges. Though the content and mechanics of the game may be overwhelming to new players, the game is likely to eventually grow on them, if given enough time.",

Eventually, she wound up taking the kids to live with her mother in Vermont, who I was never quite fond of so it didn't bother me even slightly.

      "review": "Deep, flexible tower-defense mechanics\nThe core loop is simple but strategic: place monkey “towers,” pop “Bloons,” earn cash, upgrade towers, defend longer waves. \n\nThere’s a wide variety of towers (monkeys with darts, magic, support, etc.), each with multiple upgrade paths — this gives many different approaches and play-styles. \n \nEndgame possibilities like “Paragon” upgrades (merging strong towers), and “Hero” towers with unique abilities, add long-term strategic depth beyond basic tower upgrades. \nPlenty of content + replayability\n\nThe game offers dozens of maps and a wide variety of modes beyond standard waves: there's co-op, boss events, challenge modes, and even community-created content. \n \nThere are “meta-upgrades” (sometimes called “Monkey Knowledge” or similar) — permanent or long-term upgrades, which reward continued play and experimentation. \n \nFor many players, the mixture of casual-friendly visuals and deeper strategic mechanics hits a sweet spot: easy enough to start, but with enough complexity to stay interesting for many hours. \n\nThe game uses 3D graphics with cartoonish, colorful, and clear visuals. Bloons, towers, and paths are easy to distinguish. \nThe UI and controls (especially on PC / Steam / touch devices) are generally straightforward and make building/upgrading towers manageable even during hectic rounds. \nIt supports both single-player and multiplayer (co-op for up to 4 players), so it works both as a solo game or with friends.\nThe game is solid for those who like tower defense games...\nBut in this game i think I'll give an 8/10 because of the constant attemps of making money out of the players by giving packs and bundles of things to pay for easier experience...i didn't even buy the Rogue Legends but I've played the test and is another simple rogue like but now with tower defense is the middle...\n\nIN MY OPINION THIS GAME IS FIRE OK?SO BUY IT...IT'S WORTH IT!!!",

I have to stop.\r\n\r\nAside from being one of the most addictive games I've ever played, BTD6 is an inspired installment of the iconic Bloons Tower Defense series. Keeping with the tradition, this game features more towers, maps, gamemodes, and content than its predecessors. This makes it exciting to dive into, but here I am approaching 80 hours of playtime and I feel like I haven't yet explored half of what this game has to offer. I never tried the Odysseys, races, bosses, or any of the advanced or expert maps. I wanted to unlock all the tower upgrades, but I couldn't even do that. I am recommending this game because it is fun and well-made, but players should be aware that this game will do everything it can to consume you and your time. \r\n\r\nCaution aside and regrets notwithstanding, BTD6 is a great game that surpasses its predecessors. From the parts of the game I did experience, BTD6 impressed me as being one of the most balanced games in the series. No longer are there strong towers and weak towers--every tower can contribute to your defence. This, combined with having so many options for camo detection and MOAB destruction, gave me a sense of freedom that the previous games did not. Not only does this enable exploration, the large variety of game-modes encourages it. You are not locked in to just a couple of strategies--try new things and have fun! \r\n\r\nThis game is not without its flaws, but as someone who has enjoyed watching the series evolve over the years, BTD6 blew me away. Nevertheless, its time to get on with my life.",

Remove the bowl from the heat, then add the molasses, vanilla, and salt.\r\n\r\nStep 4\r\nIn a medium bowl, add the eggs and use a handheld mixer to blend on low speed until the eggs look frothy, about 1 minute. Slowly add the sugar while blending on low speed, then increase to medium speed to beat until lighter in color, thick and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes.\r\n\r\nStep 5\r\nSift or whisk the flour with the cocoa powder, then add to the chocolate butter mixture, using a rubber spatula to stir until the flour completely disappears, about 30 seconds. Fold in the sweetened eggs until the batter looks cohesive. Fold in the chopped nuts (if you’re using them).\r\n\r\nStep 6\r\nPour the batter into the pan, using the spatula to spread evenly from corner to corner, and place in the center of the oven. Bake for 25 minutes, until a glossy top forms and starts to crack. Keep an eye on the edges, they will firm up first. To check, insert a toothpick near the corner—it should have a few moist crumbs.\r\n\r\nStep 7\r\nLet cool on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes before cutting into 16 brownies. (If you’d like—and if your pan isn’t glass—you can plunge the pan into cold water immediately out of the oven. The temperature shock achieves a chewy crust while maintaining the gooey center, a tip I learned from Eric Kim.)\r\n\r\nStep 8\r\nStore the brownies in an airtight container for up to a week. For longer storage, cut and freeze the brownies, then warm up in the microwave or oven before serving.\r\n\r\nI would also recommend packing yourself a large bong.",

Especially when the roguelike dlc costs 75% the price of the base game, at least in my region (aus) while not adding much actual like, content. Suuuuuure you get randomised tower restrictions and randomised waves but is that really worth 75% the price of every other gamemode combined? Absolutely not.

Remove the bowl from the heat, then add the molasses, vanilla, and salt.\r\n\r\nStep 4\r\nIn a medium bowl, add the eggs and use a handheld mixer to blend on low speed until the eggs look frothy, about 1 minute. Slowly add the sugar while blending on low speed, then increase to medium speed to beat until lighter in color, thick and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes.\r\n\r\nStep 5\r\nSift or whisk the flour with the cocoa powder, then add to the chocolate butter mixture, using a rubber spatula to stir until the flour completely disappears, about 30 seconds. Fold in the sweetened eggs until the batter looks cohesive. Fold in the chopped nuts (if you’re using them).\r\n\r\nStep 6\r\nPour the batter into the pan, using the spatula to spread evenly from corner to corner, and place in the center of the oven. Bake for 25 minutes, until a glossy top forms and starts to crack. Keep an eye on the edges, they will firm up first. To check, insert a toothpick near the corner—it should have a few moist crumbs.\r\n\r\nStep 7\r\nLet cool on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes before cutting into 16 brownies. (If you’d like—and if your pan isn’t glass—you can plunge the pan into cold water immediately out of the oven. The temperature shock achieves a chewy crust while maintaining the gooey center, a tip I learned from Eric Kim.)\r\n\r\nStep 8\r\nStore the brownies in an airtight container for up to a week. For longer storage, cut and freeze the brownies, then warm up in the microwave or oven before serving.\r\n\r\nI would also recommend packing yourself a large bong.",
