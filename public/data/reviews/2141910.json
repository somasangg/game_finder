The stack resolves [i]exactly[/i] like paper, but the client enforces priority, shows triggers, and auto-taps. Teaching new players the stack in paper? Painful. Here? The client [i]shows[/i] it.\n        [*]Example: When I play Sheoldred, the client visually stacks all 5 triggers. In paper, someone might miss one.\n    [/list]\n    [*][b]Interface is Clean and Functional[/b]\n    [list]\n        [*]Hover over a card? Oracle text pops up. Need to see why you lost a turn? The history panel shows [i]exactly[/i] what happened. Deck builder has filters, and the animations (especially mythics) are satisfying without being overwhelming.\n        [*]Compared to Hearthstone's clunky UI, Arena feels like Magic was designed [i]for[/i] it.\n    [/list]\n    [*][b]Queue Times are Insane[/b]\n    [list]\n        [*]I'm in Europe, and queues for Standard/Explorer/Historic are 2–5 seconds most of the time. Paper nights? They're a whole evening. Here, I can jam 2 Bo1 games while pasta boils.\n    [/list]\n    [*][b]Limited is Perfect for Learning[/b]\n    [list]\n        [*]Quick Draft vs. bots lets you practice archetypes without committing. Premier Draft with humans feels competitive. Sealed queues pop fast. As a paper drafter, this is HUGE. Practicing here made me better in-store.\n    [/list]\n    [*][b]New Player Experience is Actually Good[/b]\n    [list]\n        [*]Tutorial + colour challenges do a shockingly good job. You get starter decks, and promo codes/free events (like the recent Dominaria United event) help jumpstart your collection. If you stick to a plan, you can build decent decks without spending.\n    [/list]\n    [*][b]Variety of Formats[/b]\n    [list]\n        [*]Standard, Historic, Explorer (Pioneer proxy), Singleton events, Brawl.

I'll go 12 games drawing 0 lands in a row, then 8 games with 12 lands. In paper, variance exists, but it feels [i]fair[/i]. Here, Bo1 sessions amplify streaks. If it tilts you, play Bo3.\n        [*][i]Not[/i] as bad as people claim, but it's there.\n    [/list]\n    [*][b]Economy is Greedy (But Manageable F2P)[/b]\n    [list]\n        [*][b]F2P on Main:[/b]\n        [list]\n            [*]Daily quests + 4 wins = enough resources to craft 1–2 competitive decks per set.\n            [*]Rotate between aggro (fast laddering) and control (Bo3).\n            [*]Wildcards are gold, but lands hurt. Craft them [i]first[/i].\n        [/list]\n        [*][b]Alt Account (Spent $£€200ish):[/b]\n        [list]\n            [*]Mastery Pass + bundles = 3x faster progress.

Then make sure you use money strategically and invest into Arena. My recommendation: once per month buy 90 packs. Each week reinforce your collection with at least 10 packs for gold and 10 packs for gems. If you still have issues feel free to increase your investments until it feels good.\r\n\r\nThis game requires strategic in-real-life planning. Prioritise packs over eating out and you are golden.\r\n\r\nAnd please, don't play mono-red. If that's the only deck you can build – don't play Arena yet. Update your CV work on your LinkedIn profile and farm some money.\r\n\r\nAll the negative reviews are from people that cannot think strategically.",

I signed up right when Arena released but didn't actually play it till now so I had hundreds of free cards waiting for me which was great and I haven't actually spent anything on it so far. Problems are there for sure, You WILL get suspect terrible draws. you Will get players who spend a ton of money, have crazy decks and draw the perfect hand that kills you in turn 3 strangely often, Other reviews bring this up as well, random is random but it seems a bit suspect again... You WILL get players running the clock out every turn hoping you forfeit I guess..? And of course there is the crowd that forfeits as soon as they are down by 5. Those last 2 are human problems and not so much the games fault. The presentation is great and also resource management is automatic making your life easy. No did you tap for that moments. Please read through other reviews, I agree with much of what has been said both good and bad. At least its free to play and you can check it out to see if you want to spend money on it or not...One last note, they release a new set now every three moths or so, It really seems like a money grab and going with quantity over quality. I would not recommend spending all of your money just keeping up with the newest sets.....its not making anyone happy....",

Standard has kinda sucked during the time frame ive been playing (Izzet/ViVi).\r\n\r\nPros: -free*\r\n         -works well for the most part\r\n         -dont have to commit as much time and resources into building decks you wanna try out\r\n        -you can play whenever you want instead of having to get a group together or driving down to your lgs\r\n\r\nCons: -Hand smoothing. Takes away from the randomness of your opening hand a decent bit. you will frequently have the same few cards in your hand. (for standard this is only a thing in best of 1)\r\n         -Slow. when theres multiple triggers on the stack (especially when those triggers resolving causes more) the game grinds to a halt.\r\n        - Starting out is rough. youre not given a ton to start out with so if you come in wanting to play something specific it will take awhile to get the cards you want / need. i understand this is part of the monetization model but still it sucks and has turned away alot of my friends who wanted to play it.\r\n        -commander weighting. For the most part the system is fine, but for some the system has them way higher than it should. the content of the deck should play more of an impact in the system than it does.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnique: Alchemy cards. alchemy cards are their own thing all together, for some theyre a pro for some theyre a con. Most are very strong without really being interesting but some find a mix where they make use of the fact this is a digital card game and use that to make interesting cards with actual flavor. alchemy cards are also used as ways to nerf and buff. for example on arena The one ring makes you pay 1 to tap it.\r\n\r\nTLDR: its a free game that is a good way to get into magic, its not perfect but it is fun.",

Classic games like chess are *purely deterministic*. There is no randomness in the structure of the game itself. Which is to say there is no hidden information at the game level itself. The only hidden information is what you and your opponents future moves will be. MTG perfectly balances observable and hidden information giving it an easier learning curve and more fulfilling game experience than purely deterministic games like chess. Furthermore the art and story as well as deck building process and worldwide mtg community give the game social and creative aspects that other games simply can not ever contend with.",

      "review": "I’ve put around 40 hours into MTG Arena so far, but I’ve been playing Magic: The Gathering in real life since high school back in 2016 — almost a decade now. Magic has given me some of my best memories and helped me make friends I never would’ve met otherwise, so stepping into Arena felt like coming home.\r\n\r\nOverall, MTG Arena does a great job capturing the core feeling of the game I grew up with. The gameplay is smooth, the rules are handled cleanly, and it’s honestly convenient to be able to jam a match anytime without needing to organize a whole meet-up. Draft and Limited formats in particular feel great online, and the animations and sound effects add a nice bit of flair without getting in the way.\r\n\r\nThat said, Arena definitely isn’t perfect. The economy can feel rough, especially for newer or returning players who want to build multiple decks. Wildcards are valuable and slow to acquire, and it sometimes feels like you’re being nudged toward buying packs instead of earning them through play. Still, if you’re patient, you can build solid decks without spending money — it just takes time.\r\n\r\nBut despite the rough edges, Arena has let me reconnect with a game that’s been part of my life for nearly ten years. It’s a great way to practice, try out new ideas, or just enjoy some good old Magic when you don’t have a table of friends in front of you.\r\n\r\nIf you love Magic, Arena is absolutely worth giving a try. And if you’re new, it’s one of the easiest ways to learn the game that’s given me so many great memories.",

Very emotionally discouraging start, but after 70-ish hours putting decks together is fun, try and test thing. Many cards up to date. Slow grinding start with the rank and tiers. Some started decks and AI that shuffles cards like if you gotta loose, once you can start using your own decks the harmony becomes clear.  I painstakingly have played this game through the night time. Still learning all the effects and what thigs are. Since cards are new to me from playing yu-gi-oh, not knowing what cards are and seeing new cards from booster packs is cool. Even if I am impatient, the craft option with the wild flowers is pretty good. THough its still pretty frustrating not getting to play cards that you like emotionally, its not practical so its not a good system given the AI doesn't have too much to offer. The probability and statistics against PvP always has me draw 2 mana and then consistently monster cards. About 80% of duels I draw 2 mana cards and mulligan and same thing. 20, 30, 40.. it don't matter how many man cards I put, always drawing cards as if the game didn't want me to play.",

A true tactical masterpiece.\n\nEnemy Turn:\nOpponent’s Turn:\n--> Normal Summons Sage with Eyes of Blue and casually adds Maiden of White from the deck, as if that’s completely normal.\n\n--> Link Summons into Spirit with Eyes of Blue and adds Mausoleum of White, because of course they do.\n\n--> Discards Maiden of White to directly activate True Light from the deck. Why bother drawing your cards when you can simply skip that part?\n\n--> Uses True Light to set Wishes for Eyes of Blue from the deck. More free cards.\n\n--> Activates Mausoleum of White, targets Spirit with Eyes of Blue, and sends a Blue-Eyes White Dragon straight to the graveyard. Sure.\n\n--> Tributes Spirit with Eyes of Blue to Special Summon the Blue-Eyes White Dragon from the graveyard. The classic “I totally meant to do that” move.\n\n--> Uses Maiden of White’s graveyard effect to Special Summon itself, because nothing stays gone in this game.\n\n--> Activates Wishes for Eyes of Blue, discards a card, and casually adds Sage with Eyes of Blue and Roar of the Blue-Eyed Dragons. The hand just keeps getting fuller.\n\n--> Normal Summons another Sage with Eyes of Blue thanks to Mausoleum of White; adds Effect Veiler to hand, because why not add even more interaction?\n\n--> Activates Roar of the Blue-Eyed Dragons to Special Summon Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon from the deck in defense position. Lovely.\n\n--> Uses the graveyard effect of Wishes for Eyes of Blue to equip Neo Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon to the Blue-Eyes White Dragon. As if it needed help.\n\n--> Special Summons Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon using the now-equipped Blue-Eyes White Dragon.\n\n(Optional: They could skip this and save it for later, in case the overkill needs to be spread across multiple turns.)\n\n--> Synchro Summons Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon using Maiden of White and Blue-Eyes Tyrant Dragon. Because apparently that’s legal.\n\n--> Synchro Summons a second Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon using Sage with Eyes of Blue and Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon. Of course there’s another one.\n\n--> At the start of the next turn, both Blue-Eyes Spirit Dragon effects can be used to Special Summon two Blue-Eyes Ultimate Spirit Dragons from the Extra Deck—just in case the field didn’t look threatening enough.\n\nEstimated Time of opponents turn:\nApproximately the duration of a small Netflix episode, or long enough for you to question whether you’re still the main character of this duel.\nOR\nlong enough to question your life choices.\n+====+\nSo let's start the review for MTGA: \n\nThe game is free — which is great, because who doesn’t love paying with their time, sanity, and, naturally, their wallet if they want cards sometime this decade. Another system wouldn’t really work anyway; after all, we can’t have a model that doesn’t gently encourage you to hurry up and buy things. A subscription model would just trigger FOMO.\n\nI’ve never played Magic before, but don’t worry: the game offers a tutorial that explains everything. Well… “explains” in the sense that you’ll know how to cast a creature, but the stack will still hit you like a tax document written in ancient Sumerian.\n\nThere are events you can join where you unlock “starter decks” — as long as you win with those decks first. It’s the classic “you can have the thing once you prove you don’t actually need the thing” approach to game design.\n\nAfter finishing the tutorial and unlocking your decks, you just hop on Untapped, grab a meta list someone much smarter made, and pretend you know what you’re doing. Works every time.\n\nAnd on the casual level, it truly doesn’t matter which deck you play. You can’t influence what you draw anyway, but hey — at least you can influence how gracefully you lose with it.\n\n10/10 Absolute Cinema",

It honestly hurts my heart to  see something I love so much use money as a barrier to entry. This is coming from someone who is a long time collector/seller who desires the cards to have as much value as possible. If I had to choose between the cards being extremely valuable or a lower financial burden for people to play, I would choose the latter. Arena is genuinely a Pay to win game as is the paper card version. MtG has enough money to show their fan base some love by maybe allowing players to purchase the cards in real life and have them redeemed in game so we dont have to choose between a tangible collection or a digital collection.

If you're a fan of Magic the Gathering, this is a great way to play when you can't play with friends or go to a local game store.\r\n\r\nLonger Review & my Criticisms:\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue is the huge lack of features & social systems, which is weird for a game as inherently social as MTG. There's no easy way to add friends from random players you meet in game or challenge them to rematches. There's no way to invite a friend to play in the same draft as you or set up custom drafts/sealed/cube with friends. \r\n\r\nAnd biggest problem a lot of people would have - you can't play Commander & all games are 1v1. \r\n\r\nYou have Brawl as a Commander substitute, but it's a bummer they still haven't figured out a way to allow 4 people to play together. It's probably because they couldn't get that working with people playing on phone, but the simple solution would be to just disable that mode for those on mobile!\r\n\r\nThe game is just very singularly focused on the solo player experience vs random people online. \r\n\r\nAt one point, they had a really great format called Historic, but about a year ago they ruined that by introducing \"alchemy\" cards... Cards that are digital-only & have Hearthstone like mechanics that can't really function in the paper format. It felt like Historic was slowly building towards a pseudo-Legacy format, but then it devolved into a weird game that no longer feels connected to the main game.\r\n\r\nI wish they had made Alchemy & all the digital-only nonsense its own format & left everything else as close to paper Magic as possible. I play this game because I want the 1:1 experience, not some other amalgamation or experimental off-shoot. Then again, this company made an \"Un\" set (a joke set) tournament legal in paper MTG, then went on to inject all kinds of corporate IP crossover stuff into the game, so they've long since abandoned caring about their OWN IP & are more than willing to disregard their legacy in favor of pleasing shareholders.\r\n\r\nI could play Standard or PIoneer, but they let former get warped around a handful of busted cards that they refuse to address until the hype for those sets die down, and the latter is all but forgotten & abandoned at this point. \r\n\r\nMaybe I could get into Timeless (all cards available on Arena), but man I hate seeing the \"Universes Beyond\" silliness in MTG. When every company is forcing crossovers with other IPs into their own products, it's starting to feel like there's nothing with its own identity, lore & world anymore. Magic had huge success for so long building up its OWN world, but now we have to see Godzilla fighting Spider-Man with Subway Train & Bagels with Shmear vs Avatar... it's ridiculous.\r\n\r\nAnother issue some people will have is how microtransaction-heavy the game is. You can slowly grind out wildcards to build a deck, but don't expect to have anything competitive for a LONG time. Once you finally build a competitive deck, better hope you really enjoy it, because grinding up wildcards for another one is going to take a while. \r\n\r\nIMO, the best thing to do is either buy $20 worth of gems, do some drafts, and try to fill out your collection that way. If you win at least 5 of 7 games (before you get 3 losses), you'll be rewarded with more gems than you spent (plus some coins - the free in-game currency). You'll also slowly build up free wildcards this way, so at least you get to have some fun while building your library.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if I have these issues, why am I still recommending? Because Steam doesn't have a \"mixed\" option, and it's a good place to play certain aspects of MTG. The game feels at its best when it sticks as close to the paper game as possible, and I hop on for a few weeks to draft when new sets come out.\r\n\r\nUnless the new set is Spider-Man, then it's so bad that I play twice & drop the game until the next set releases. But hey, the pick-2 draft format was cool.",

      "review": "As an avid paper magic player who spent the last decade playing in paper, spent 2000+ hours on MtG: Arena (I played since open beta, before the game got onto steam) and literally spent 0€ in the client, I DO NOT RECOMMEND this digital version of the game.\n\nWhile opposing to Magic the Gathering Online (which has an incredibly outdated UI) this has the generic digital only hearthstone-like UI, with flashy animations. Nothing spectacular, but does the job to be aestheticly pleasing.\n\nAaaaaand i kinda ran out of good things to say about it. Oh yeah, its F2P and if you know your game and you don't change your deck as often as you change your underwear you don't need to spend any money.\n\nFirst of my major gripes is that the game is rigged. Not in the meaning that you it stacks your opponents deck (that might don't use any card advantage or card selection) to always draw the perfect card in the perfect situation, even if it sometimes feels that way (but the opposite is true too, i played like dogshit, missplayed all the time yet, i won without any difficulty).\n\nWhat i mean is, that the matchup you get is dependent on your own deck.\nI've build a tribal aggro deck in Brawl. It had a positive winrate, but had a boros go wide aggro matchup which was basically impossible to win. Played with the deck roughly 300 matches, and around 33% was that pesky aggro matchup, so 100 out of 300 matches.\nI build another deck which is really close to a deck i own in paper. This time it's a control deck, with a combo finish. I construct it, to have a good matchup against the boros aggro, as it seems that it's a highly played deck in the format. I play around 100 matches with the new deck. Let me assure you there were no new sets, new cards, no new combos were discovered between playing the two decks. Suddenly nearly all my opponents played control/prison. out of 100 games 1 was against the same boros deck. 33% observed metashare dropped to 1% overnight. After that I played again with my aggro deck. Suddenly the \"old meta\" appeared again. Played 10 matches out of curiosity, 3 of them were the same old boros deck and i did not see any of the prison decks, which I encountered while playing control. Browsing the threads it seems that others have spotted this behaviour too.\n\nOther, probably even more severe gripe: the client has no formats that interests me and it is full of \"fake\" formats and \"fake\" cards which by design, can't exist in paper. I'm a paper player. When I can't go to events due to time restriction or other, I still want to play Magic. Arena basically offers 2 real formats: Standard and Pioneer. I do not care either of those. I like high power level formats, such as Legacy and Duel Commander. There is a format that somewhat resembles them. Timeless and  Brawl, but since these have no paper equivalent, so it's playerbase is much more limited. In higher ranks (Mythic) sometimes you get to play against the same player 3-4 times in a row. Because it has such a limited playerbase noone takes the effort to actually balance the format. Strip Mine is legal, while it's banned in Legacy and restricted in the most powerful format: Vintage. Here you can run 4 copies because why not. This causes one of the high  power level format to be more toxic than the DotA playerbase.\nUPDATE regarding this paragraph: WotC has decided to ban (among other cards) Strip Mine from Brawl, which is a good step in the right direction. However I do not understand why do they have to schedule a digital only format's ban update (which has no tournaments) to be together with paper formats' ban announcement, which often are before/after big tournaments. The whole appeal of a digital only format without tournaments that if something is a problem you can change/ban the cards anytime you want. No need to wait for other formats to have anything banworthy.\n\nThe ranked is not rewarding.\nJust maintain a 51% winrate and you'll get to Mythic (the highest rank) within a week or two. And what is your reward of being between the best players? 5 whole boosters! At least other games give you some flashy badge or cosmetics that is exclusive of the rank.\n\nProbably predatory behaviour, but i can't prove:\nIn more recent Call of Dutys, there were a hidden feature: if you spent money in the shop, you got easier opponents, thus rewarding you spending real or ingame money. I often feel like when i make a new deck i buy lots and lots of boosters, to get the cards i need, or to farm wildcards (you can craft cards with them), I feel like my winrate with the new deck starts very high and then slowly declines in a few days. But again. I did not collect data regarding that, so i can't prove it.\n\nOther minor petpeeves, is missing quality of life features, that have been implemented in MTGO. When playing storm you can save what to target with your storm spell. Oh boy do i \"love\" to manually click on my opponent 30 times when i cast Tendrils of Agony. Or when i build a deck and i write a cards name in the search field, the game does not find it, because i used a comma or something like thlat in the card's name. \"Teferi, Hero of Dominaria\", or \"Liliana's Triumph\" come to mind as examples. Then you have to rewrite it incorrectly. Like is it really so difficult to program it correctly? EDIT: they fixed the faulty search.\n\nWell i think thats it. Don't get me wrong. I'm not angry. I'm just disappointed after 7 years the client still does not have a meaningful way for me to play MtG.",

Or you can board wipe your opponent on the one match for the day where this bad initial shuffle didn't happen to you, and then draw only lands for 10 turns in a row while you already have half your lands out on the field, ultimately giving your opponent the win because you can't draw any of your finishers. I have almost never experienced either of these happening with real life cards in a real life deck for Magic the Gathering. Even the old yugioh games for gameboy did deck shuffling a hundred times better than this. WotC is failing hard with Magic Arena, do not download this piece of garbage.

While this is arguably the easier way to play with being able to get resources to craft specific cards making it technically cheaper to get specific combo pieces you may need, which creates the other issue. You, as a new player, are going to have weaker decks starting out. You can win with the pre cons yes, but they are not particularly strong. You'll often run into optomized decks in the main formats that can completely stop you from playing. This is why I say Arena is bad, as newer inexperianced players are just going to be hit in the face by decks that completely shut them down and they won't know *why*. Magic is a very complex game, where some cards are directly just stronger versions of others. This leads to a very frustrating new player experiance.  This, coupled with the fact standard magic is kind of ass, makes this a pretty terrible way to get into the game\n\nI'd suggest genuinely (if you are willing to) purchase a pre con you find interesting at your local game store and get some friends and look into commander, its a much better format in general because its not only a four player format which allows for some fun and interesting strategies, like group hug decks. Group Hug decks are decks that actually just buff everyone else, but what most people play usually sneaks in a win con of punishing players. Group Hug decks usually get the benefit of being protected by other players in the group since people want those extra draws or buffs. It's what makes commander much more interesting.",

It will be an entire play session of easy no brainer W's.  It's almost as if.. you're not playing the game at all, but instead Arena is playing you.\r\n\r\nArena: You lose today.  Get ready for it.  I shuffle your deck.  You get what I tell you.\r\n\r\nThis is MTG Arena in a nutshell.  Do not spend money on this game!  It's rigged!!\r\n\r\nWith that said, it is completely free.  It is a nice way to build decks.  It's nice not having to go to the store just to play a couple hands of MTG.  All be it completely manipulated hands that tilted in one direction or the other.  You've been warned.",

      "review": "I can't describe it any other way than, this game feels like it's designed to make you not want to play it. In a way, it makes me feel insane, because I love playing Magic, but this is so far divorced from the version of the experience that I love. It's the same cards, yes, but it's a completely different game. MtG is about community, and there's literally nothing community about it. No way to form a clan/guild or playgroup. No way to organize events. No trading. You never know if you're interacting with another person, because you can't chat. Suddenly, people feel safe playing more unsavory strategies, because of the online disinhibition effect. People who tend to play the more fair strategies end up being pushed out of the game altogether, and everyone else just has to adapt. It feels like they still want us to believe that this is the Digital Magic product of the future, but I just don't see them putting any sort of effort into making the game better for the community. Sure, they do UI updates to make things look more flashy, but nobody actually cares about that stuff, because it realistically does nothing to make the game more fun. I wanna buy 3 packs of whatever set with 1-7 of my friends, set up a play group with them, then we party up and draft or sealed, or open packs and trade them. I wanna have the OPTION of whether I can chat with people. Give us an \"opt in/out of chat\" in the settings, and like, I dunno.... ban people for saying messed up stuff? Bring the community aspect back to the game! Get rid of this anonymity-riddled, play-your-most-toxic-deck because \"my opponent isn't in front of me, therefore they aren't a person\" version of it, where everyone's only mission is to log in and do their daily missions as fast as humanly possible, which, by the time you actually do manage to complete them, you're so exhausted with the shuffler, the matchmaking, and your opponents griefing, that you just log out, not feeling like you really played Magic at all. This game sucks. Just play Tabletop Simulator with your friends instead.         2/10",

There are way too many sets in standard and the power level is off the charts. It truly leaves very little room for deck creativity, and is all about tweaking meta decks to get ahead. A three year standard rotations is too long. Additionally, making all Universe's Beyond (UB) sets standard legal further ruined the format. Not because I'm a UB hater, but because releasing 6-7 sets a year into standard increases the card pool to an out of control number. I would not recommend new players to this game with how standard is currently.

No amount of \"there are no bots\" that we get from WotC will convince me otherwise. I regularly encounter stretches where I play several players in a row, and they have the EXACT SAME PLAYS TURN FOR TURN. FOr example, I just played 6 games where I faced off against an Azula grixis deck. Turn 1 they dropped a land and an equipment. Turn 2 they drop another land and another equipment (more expensive). Turn 3 they drop a watery grave untapped, dark ritual, then cast azula and equip with one equipment., Turn 4 they they drop a land, equip the other equipment, attack, cast a lightning strike, copy it with azula, and take my life total down from 25 (Brawl) to 9, since the equipments are giving azula ridiculous buffs.\r\n\r\nI know what you may be thinking \"This just means they're playing similar decks!\"...no. It doesn't. They played the EXACT same cards on the same curve. Same Azula, Same Artifacts, Same Non-basic Lands. All 6 games in a row.",
