      "review": "I am sorry but even calling this shovelware would be too nice.\n\nI would like to start by writing about what this game does well but as much as I try I cannot find one good aspect.\nEven looking at the tags I find a lot of them simply not applying. More like \"oh there is a sword in the game so I can tag it knight\" even when all the sword does is being stuck in a stone.\n\nI plaied 2€ for this and I regret it. The 44.8h you see where mostly spent with the game running in the background. Alt tabbing in every once in a while to see if my party was hard stuck or not and then spending 5 to 10 minute assigning new gear. Smash some quests and then go back to just let them do the highest level they could without dieing to farm xp and gold. Overall I maybe put 4 to 5 actual hours into the game as it was so boring I just forgot about it.\n\nWhat the game does wrong.... oh boy....\n\n1. You get one party.\nThis is categorized as idler but you have to finish quests wihs you have to manually select. You can auto-advance yes but you simple will get stuck. Whenever you do you have to manually shift through various gear and craft it and compare and the only idling part is the bit between absolute frustrating inventory management.\nAlso only having one party feels absolutely bad. You can recruit endless heroes so why not make a mechanic for multiple parties so you can farm more?\n\n2. The game is simple where it should be complicated and complicated where it should be simple.\nTo \"upgrade\" your town you have building levels all tied to quests. No ressources needed, no proper planning just do the quests. To increase ressource gathering you can just hire whatever people and as your town levels even common folk of higher level greatly outscales epic low level which just seems odd to me.\nEverything about ressources seems to be utterly dumbed down to the point you even have to spend experience orbs as currency that just slows down progress and makes little to no sense to me as why I need to spend experience points on a bloody festival event.\n\nThen comes the needless complicated part. Play the video and during the first few seconds look very carefully at the character window. See that scrollbar? Yes your character got 30+ bloody stats all shortened to 3 letter acronyms so you are sure to be confused because on the items they are written out and not acroynms. Half the stats do not even seem to bloody matter throughout the game. It is all about about 3 things.\n1. Do you attack before the enemy? Yes? Great. No? See 2.\n2. Can you tank the first enemy turn? Yes? Great. No? Get higher vitality items.\n3. Did you unlock some new gear? Yes? You are probably hard stuck until you use it, put it on and use the new level of equipment that likely came with it. No? Just keep on doing whatever quest.\n\n3. There is no strategy.\nIf you got enough HP that is pretty much all that matters. Sure you do the usual of slap in a healer and a tank but that is as basic as it can get.\n\n4. Recruitment is abyssmal.\nEven heroes have tiers and if you want to get a certain hero on a higher tier? Well good luck because in my nearly 45hours idling I could not get the highest tier for every hero and there is an autobuy function but no worry because level do matter f*** all. Once past a certain point you need so much xp even 45 hours of idling with max xp boni will not even get ONE of your heroes to max level.\n\n5. So many heroes feel just pointless.\nTheir abilities are nothing special, they do not feel like they are even useful for any synergy and just like \"hey there is a sprite I could use so let's make something with it\".\n\n6. Artwork inconsistency\nIt is obvious that a lot of the pixelart is shared but at least keep it a little consistent. Heroes, normal enemies, bosses all seem to have widely different sources of pixelart with the snowregion probably being the worst offender.\n\n7. Inventory management is nothing but pain pain edition.\nEnjoy comparing your rings with 8+ different attributes against one another.\nYour crafted items having randomly assigned attributes so you can craft them 500 times+ without getting what you want and then accidently selling them as you try to \"sell all items\" of a kind from a sword that looks just a few pixels different from a weaker variant you had before.\nOh and certain items come with guaranteet attributes but those you have to figure out because even after crafting a thousand the game will not tell you.\nA warning that you sell an item with socketed gems? You wish.\n\nI could write so much more negative things about this game but I am frankly just pissed off from playing it.\nThe last f*** you the game gave me after slugging myself through this abomination was a nice \"you did it\" pop-up window after I clicked \"finish\" on quest. Aparently even beating the last quest was not noteworthy enough to stop autogrind and my party overshot the goal by 10 stages. Absolute dogsh**.",

More like \"oh there is a sword in the game so I can tag it knight\" even when all the sword does is being stuck in a stone.\n\nI plaied 2€ for this and I regret it. The 44.8h you see where mostly spent with the game running in the background. Alt tabbing in every once in a while to see if my party was hard stuck or not and then spending 5 to 10 minute assigning new gear. Smash some quests and then go back to just let them do the highest level they could without dieing to farm xp and gold. Overall I maybe put 4 to 5 actual hours into the game as it was so boring I just forgot about it.\n\nWhat the game does wrong.... oh boy....\n\n1. You get one party.\nThis is categorized as idler but you have to finish quests wihs you have to manually select. You can auto-advance yes but you simple will get stuck. Whenever you do you have to manually shift through various gear and craft it and compare and the only idling part is the bit between absolute frustrating inventory management.\nAlso only having one party feels absolutely bad. You can recruit endless heroes so why not make a mechanic for multiple parties so you can farm more?\n\n2. The game is simple where it should be complicated and complicated where it should be simple.\nTo \"upgrade\" your town you have building levels all tied to quests. No ressources needed, no proper planning just do the quests. To increase ressource gathering you can just hire whatever people and as your town levels even common folk of higher level greatly outscales epic low level which just seems odd to me.\nEverything about ressources seems to be utterly dumbed down to the point you even have to spend experience orbs as currency that just slows down progress and makes little to no sense to me as why I need to spend experience points on a bloody festival event.\n\nThen comes the needless complicated part. Play the video and during the first few seconds look very carefully at the character window. See that scrollbar? Yes your character got 30+ bloody stats all shortened to 3 letter acronyms so you are sure to be confused because on the items they are written out and not acroynms. Half the stats do not even seem to bloody matter throughout the game. It is all about about 3 things.\n1. Do you attack before the enemy? Yes? Great. No? See 2.\n2. Can you tank the first enemy turn? Yes? Great. No? Get higher vitality items.\n3. Did you unlock some new gear? Yes? You are probably hard stuck until you use it, put it on and use the new level of equipment that likely came with it. No? Just keep on doing whatever quest.\n\n3. There is no strategy.\nIf you got enough HP that is pretty much all that matters. Sure you do the usual of slap in a healer and a tank but that is as basic as it can get.\n\n4. Recruitment is abyssmal.\nEven heroes have tiers and if you want to get a certain hero on a higher tier? Well good luck because in my nearly 45hours idling I could not get the highest tier for every hero and there is an autobuy function but no worry because level do matter f*** all. Once past a certain point you need so much xp even 45 hours of idling with max xp boni will not even get ONE of your heroes to max level.\n\n5. So many heroes feel just pointless.\nTheir abilities are nothing special, they do not feel like they are even useful for any synergy and just like \"hey there is a sprite I could use so let's make something with it\".\n\n6. Artwork inconsistency\nIt is obvious that a lot of the pixelart is shared but at least keep it a little consistent. Heroes, normal enemies, bosses all seem to have widely different sources of pixelart with the snowregion probably being the worst offender.\n\n7. Inventory management is nothing but pain pain edition.\nEnjoy comparing your rings with 8+ different attributes against one another.\nYour crafted items having randomly assigned attributes so you can craft them 500 times+ without getting what you want and then accidently selling them as you try to \"sell all items\" of a kind from a sword that looks just a few pixels different from a weaker variant you had before.\nOh and certain items come with guaranteet attributes but those you have to figure out because even after crafting a thousand the game will not tell you.\nA warning that you sell an item with socketed gems? You wish.\n\nI could write so much more negative things about this game but I am frankly just pissed off from playing it.\nThe last f*** you the game gave me after slugging myself through this abomination was a nice \"you did it\" pop-up window after I clicked \"finish\" on quest. Aparently even beating the last quest was not noteworthy enough to stop autogrind and my party overshot the goal by 10 stages. Absolute dogsh**.",

Whenever you do you have to manually shift through various gear and craft it and compare and the only idling part is the bit between absolute frustrating inventory management.\nAlso only having one party feels absolutely bad. You can recruit endless heroes so why not make a mechanic for multiple parties so you can farm more?\n\n2. The game is simple where it should be complicated and complicated where it should be simple.\nTo \"upgrade\" your town you have building levels all tied to quests. No ressources needed, no proper planning just do the quests. To increase ressource gathering you can just hire whatever people and as your town levels even common folk of higher level greatly outscales epic low level which just seems odd to me.\nEverything about ressources seems to be utterly dumbed down to the point you even have to spend experience orbs as currency that just slows down progress and makes little to no sense to me as why I need to spend experience points on a bloody festival event.\n\nThen comes the needless complicated part. Play the video and during the first few seconds look very carefully at the character window. See that scrollbar? Yes your character got 30+ bloody stats all shortened to 3 letter acronyms so you are sure to be confused because on the items they are written out and not acroynms. Half the stats do not even seem to bloody matter throughout the game. It is all about about 3 things.\n1. Do you attack before the enemy? Yes? Great. No? See 2.\n2. Can you tank the first enemy turn? Yes? Great. No? Get higher vitality items.\n3. Did you unlock some new gear? Yes? You are probably hard stuck until you use it, put it on and use the new level of equipment that likely came with it. No? Just keep on doing whatever quest.\n\n3. There is no strategy.\nIf you got enough HP that is pretty much all that matters. Sure you do the usual of slap in a healer and a tank but that is as basic as it can get.\n\n4. Recruitment is abyssmal.\nEven heroes have tiers and if you want to get a certain hero on a higher tier? Well good luck because in my nearly 45hours idling I could not get the highest tier for every hero and there is an autobuy function but no worry because level do matter f*** all. Once past a certain point you need so much xp even 45 hours of idling with max xp boni will not even get ONE of your heroes to max level.\n\n5. So many heroes feel just pointless.\nTheir abilities are nothing special, they do not feel like they are even useful for any synergy and just like \"hey there is a sprite I could use so let's make something with it\".\n\n6. Artwork inconsistency\nIt is obvious that a lot of the pixelart is shared but at least keep it a little consistent. Heroes, normal enemies, bosses all seem to have widely different sources of pixelart with the snowregion probably being the worst offender.\n\n7. Inventory management is nothing but pain pain edition.\nEnjoy comparing your rings with 8+ different attributes against one another.\nYour crafted items having randomly assigned attributes so you can craft them 500 times+ without getting what you want and then accidently selling them as you try to \"sell all items\" of a kind from a sword that looks just a few pixels different from a weaker variant you had before.\nOh and certain items come with guaranteet attributes but those you have to figure out because even after crafting a thousand the game will not tell you.\nA warning that you sell an item with socketed gems? You wish.\n\nI could write so much more negative things about this game but I am frankly just pissed off from playing it.\nThe last f*** you the game gave me after slugging myself through this abomination was a nice \"you did it\" pop-up window after I clicked \"finish\" on quest. Aparently even beating the last quest was not noteworthy enough to stop autogrind and my party overshot the goal by 10 stages. Absolute dogsh**.",

Yes your character got 30+ bloody stats all shortened to 3 letter acronyms so you are sure to be confused because on the items they are written out and not acroynms. Half the stats do not even seem to bloody matter throughout the game. It is all about about 3 things.\n1. Do you attack before the enemy? Yes? Great. No? See 2.\n2. Can you tank the first enemy turn? Yes? Great. No? Get higher vitality items.\n3. Did you unlock some new gear? Yes? You are probably hard stuck until you use it, put it on and use the new level of equipment that likely came with it. No? Just keep on doing whatever quest.\n\n3. There is no strategy.\nIf you got enough HP that is pretty much all that matters. Sure you do the usual of slap in a healer and a tank but that is as basic as it can get.\n\n4. Recruitment is abyssmal.\nEven heroes have tiers and if you want to get a certain hero on a higher tier? Well good luck because in my nearly 45hours idling I could not get the highest tier for every hero and there is an autobuy function but no worry because level do matter f*** all. Once past a certain point you need so much xp even 45 hours of idling with max xp boni will not even get ONE of your heroes to max level.\n\n5.

Heroes, normal enemies, bosses all seem to have widely different sources of pixelart with the snowregion probably being the worst offender.\n\n7. Inventory management is nothing but pain pain edition.\nEnjoy comparing your rings with 8+ different attributes against one another.\nYour crafted items having randomly assigned attributes so you can craft them 500 times+ without getting what you want and then accidently selling them as you try to \"sell all items\" of a kind from a sword that looks just a few pixels different from a weaker variant you had before.\nOh and certain items come with guaranteet attributes but those you have to figure out because even after crafting a thousand the game will not tell you.\nA warning that you sell an item with socketed gems?
