Something that I especially appreciate about Stationeers is that it's a survival game where survival is an actual challenge, rather than a handful of easily managed tasks/meters. Thanks to the complexity of the in-game simulation, you're never completely safe as one oversight can cause a spiral.\n\nThe core gameplay loop revolves around building your base on one of several inhospitable rocks while juggling atmospherics, temperature, food/water production, and power. This is all underscored by the ability to create and implement advanced automated systems by building on what you've already learned and writing code using an in-game scripting language to monitor, press buttons and turn dials for you.\n\nStationeers can best be compared to games like Stormworks and Space Station 13.

In a fun and creative way, this game challenges you to design, build, and manage your very own space station, forcing you to grapple with complex systems that mimic real-world scientific principles. From managing atmospheric pressure and gas mixtures to setting up intricate electrical grids and automated factories, Stationeers offers a deeply rewarding sandbox for creative problem-solving.\n\nWhat makes Stationeers truly special is its unapologetic complexity. This is a game that respects your intelligence and rewards you for learning. You'll find yourself consulting guides and learning about thermodynamics, not because you have to, but because you'll be genuinely motivated to see your creations come to life and your station thrive in the harshness of space. The satisfaction of successfully building a self-sustaining habitat after meticulous planning and execution is unparalleled.\n\nA huge shoutout is deserved for the small, dedicated development team at RocketWerkz. Over the years, they have shown an incredible commitment to this niche project, continuously releasing updates that have not only fixed issues but have also added massive new features and completely overhauled core systems like terrain generation. It's inspiring to see a small team so passionately dedicated to realizing such an ambitious vision.\n\nIn an industry often dominated by major studios, it is vital to support independent developers who are pushing the boundaries of what games can be. Stationeers is a shining example of a small team creating something truly unique and intellectually stimulating. If you're looking for a game that will challenge you, teach you, and give you a profound sense of accomplishment, all while supporting a deserving indie developer, then look no further than Stationeers.

The game features in-depth atmospheric and logistical systems bringing about a near realistic space station building simulator. With several planets to choose from, each with their own unique challenges, this game presents players with interesting problems to solve. \n\nSome such problems could be heating your base on a frozen planet, providing your crops with specific temp and gas mixtures. Cooling down the same base because you overheated it. Not to mention recovering from early game power blackouts because those heaters love to consume power. \n\nThis game is about problem solving, thinking outside the box. Instead of using power hungry heaters, why not use the output gases from your furnace? You needed to smelt those ores and alloys anyways! Stationeers truly is a fun game that gets the brain working.\n\nThis game is NOT a survival game, it's a simulator. As such it does have a slightly high learning curve. There is far too much information to be included in the game's base tutorials. Your guidebook or \"Stationpedia\" can always be accessed by the default key f1.

Why should I grow anything else than potatoes(or switchgrass/ferns for some planets)?

After all... this game is not ment for stupid people? ...the community just requires some moderation.\n    [*]Rocketry, after you get by the challenge of setting it up, it gets boring and overpowered.\n    [*]The difficulty curve: Once you get by the challenge of acquiring steady supply of water, food and oxygen, the game game goes to \"creative mode\".\n[/list]\nWhat I dislike:\n[list]\n    [*]The trading system\n[/list]\n\nThe game is continually being updated, so I believe its shortcomings will improve over time.",

The dev team has done a tremendous job getting the game to a really enjoyable place, especially with the updated terrain systems – wandering around and picking a spot for a base actually feels exciting now, not just functional.\n\nDoes it do everything you’d expect from a fully open-world space exploration game? No. But what it does, it does really well. If you’ve ever wanted to live out your best “The Martian” roleplay, this is the game. The way it simulates gases and atmospherics adds a ridiculous amount of depth and tension: every leak, every pressure difference, every mistake actually matters. On top of that, the manufacturing and automation systems go just deep enough to keep you constantly engaged in upgrading, optimizing, and protecting your base without feeling like you’re drowning in complexity.\n\nI’m always thinking one step ahead in this game—how to improve my life support, how to expand the base, what to automate next. Stationeers nails that feeling of “just one more tweak,” and suddenly you’ve lost hours. My playtime alone should give you an idea of how many hours I’ve happily sunk into this game.\n\nIf you’re into space, base building, and automation, you should definitely consider giving Stationeers a shot.",

You can also very easily edit those scripts from your OS with your text editor of choice, and there is a VSCode extension for typing and highlight\r\n- There is quite a complex automation game, hidden behind the survival hurdle that most people will encounter quite fast\r\n\r\nThere is so much to say, I am very happy I got this.",

This game has tons of little projects contained within it, and the fact that everything is exposed to a logic network means that you can pretty much automate almost every task with the built in mips-like assembly programming language. It's basically packed with tons of projects, from small to large. Last week, I spent a bunch of time automating smelting in the advanced furnaces, which required me to figure out how to route ores from storage to the correct furnaces, how to ensure I have the right fuel mixtures and getting them into the furnace without exploding my base, how to build a custom control panel to let me know what's going on in the system and allow me to control it, and so on. Most of this work wasn't strictly necessary, but the game really just gives you a box of tools and parts and lets you go out and build whatever you feel is interesting (and if you're not careful, punishes you, too). It's a unique vibe, because the progression / pacing feels quite slow compared to other games in this genre, but I don't really care because I'm having fun just figuring stuff out and tinkering with different systems.\n\nI would absolutely recommend this game to people who have a programming background and enjoy crunching numbers and a bit of trial and error. It really doesn't hold your hand, the tutorials are barely enough to get you started, and the game seems to have been evolving a lot over the years to the point where a lot of the docs/guides are out of date or lack information. The game describes itself as \"not a casual game\", and I would say that anyone looking to buy this game should really consider that warning. But if all of that doesn't scare you off, I hope you can appreciate this game as much as I do.",

Topped only by the likes of Factorio (I'd even say neck and neck)\n\nBut… I don’t recommend it.\n\nEvery time you load a save, you’re basically playing Russian roulette with your progress. It might work fine, or it might just refuse to load at all. It also crashes a lot, especially while mining. And if the game decides to autosave while you’re editing terrain, congratulations that save is now a coin toss between loading later or corrupting itself permanently. Your “fix” options are either loading a much later backup (if you even have one), or resetting the terrain and hoping that doesn’t break your world even more.\n\nThese are serious bugs that should’ve been addressed immediately, but as far as I know, they haven’t even acknowledged them. Which is crazy, because everything else about this game is top tier. It’s just hard to enjoy when you’re constantly wondering if your save file’s going to detonate the next time you load it.\n\nMotherboard: ASUS Z790 Pro RS Wifi\nGPU: Nvidia 4070 Ti\nCPU: Intel i9-14900K\nSSD: Samsung 990 EVO 2TB\nRAM: Kingston Fury 32x2 \n\n*EDIT* I've updated my review to be positive now, a few people commented on my review and helped me figure out where the issues were coming from, and it seems they stem from a mix of the auto-save system and my PC hardware. Updating BIOS helped somewhat for a few hours, but the crashes persisted, then after trying a fresh game using only manual saves, I realized I no longer had any issues crashing. As soon as I reloaded an auto save, it began crashing again (however less frequently than before I updated BIOS)",

Having to cycle between 7 different variants of wire joints and however many different rotations is obnoxious, some kind of click and drag system would do wonders. Buildings having multiple stages is somewhat interesting, but being limited to two hand slots kind of kills it, leading you to walk back and forth between storage for every single stage to pick up two sheets of plastic or whatever. There's probably some hotkey combo or flow that would make swapping things around better but I never found it so you effectively have two inventory slots in a survival-crafting-building game.

They keep messing up the good stuff and over complex simple stuff making it so you have to hold several keys to basic actions what a waste! Maybe in a few years they will figure it out and fix it but as it is right now its such a pain to even try and play with the messed up controls!",

The \"tutorial\" is a joke and as a new player I'm guessing you're expected to watch hours of YouTube videos to even get to the point where you don't die of thirst after the first night. This has been an excruciating hour and I've not even managed to get my helmet off so I can drink something.\r\n\r\nIn sum, this game is about as much fun as being stabbed in the belly with a rusty, blunt, tetanus-ridden knife. 0/10 would not recommend",

Not only can I not simply connect with my friends game but it's been a struggle since I started playing. There needs to be some serious rework of the multiplayer system within this game. Can't simply join my friend through steam, see his server in game as it requires you to search for the server name or ip, but it's a constant struggle to connect. The mulitplayer needs a serious update. After multiple attempts to join my friends game, restarting the game, trying again, verifying files, trying again, and even restarting my computer. I'm still unable to get to the point of putting in the password for his game. What is going on with that!!!!!!!",
