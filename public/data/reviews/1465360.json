The game isn't perfect, of course, and the weight of some vehicles feels quite odd, as does the damage to the wheels and suspension on a seemingly perfect paved road. Playing solo is quite fun, especially if you listen to music or a podcast. However, the game becomes even better in co-op, as there are many lengthy missions that can take several hours to complete and a little help is always good. Overall, the game is definitely worth the asking price.",

      "review": "The gameplay and graphics are top shelf, BUT the sound quality on the trucks, primarily engine noise and the audio when shifting through the gears is extremely pathetic, it sounds like you keep shifting into the same gear...it's really bad and a shame since the trucks and landscape look so stunning.\n Buy the game on sale for no more than 15 dollars, then buy the Mastodon truck DLC for 5 bucks, then for $20 you will have game and the tool(s) to progress and earn enough money to build and buy trucks and actually make progress in the game at a reasonable pace and not turn your life into an Asmongold-ish dirty house with cockroaches mess, you can get sht done in the game with the Mastodon at a reasonable pace and have plenty of time for real life too.  YES I REALISE THIS SUCKS, the game should have been designed in a way that the street trucks they start you with had street missions with street/ paved road routes and deliveries to earn cash and level up your truck and modify it to actually be able to get through mud without taking 20 minutes of winching to move 10 feet but unfortunately this game was designed to keep you playing for long periods of time to show engagemnent charts to shareholders and sell paid DLC as well,  they are greasy bstrds and they don't care, therefore the game is intentionally designed to take forever and a day to get anything done with trucks they start you off with to force you to buy DLC, In real life NO logger that wants to make money because in real life less time = more money so there's no way a real life logger would use stock trucks in forests and logging trails, yes again this is by design which sucks, so in order to get trucks that loggers use in real life you either have to buy DLC which is super greasy on the part of the game studio, or you can waste your finite life grinding like a moron, or you can wait like I did to strike when the iron is hot, and like I said, get the ultimate gameplay and ablilty to progress at a reasonable rate for 20 bucks. DO NOT GIVE THIS GAME MORE TIME THAN IT DESERVES AND IT IS NOT WORTH MORE THAN 15 BUCKS FOR THE BASE GAME AND 5 BUCKS FOR THE MASTODON",

Hundreds of game mods and trucks, co-op multiplayer, lots of maps, runs smoothly on ultra graphics, even when your pc is ran by a potato. Highly recommend to people that like getting thigs dirty, and exploring. Has lots of equipment. Heck, you can set up wildlife camera traps, tow winches, and more. It can be frustrating at times. i've gotten my truck stuck in the mud for 30 non-in-game minutes. Really fun and worth the price. I have also written a review for Expeditions: a Mudrunner Game, too. Highly recommend. (tip: Always have awd(all wheel drive) enabled when offroading.)",

Is it repetitive, absolutely, but I don't mind.\r\n1.\tDrive here, oh, can’t reach that location.\r\n2.\tBring materials to clear obstruction, or build bridge.\r\n3.\tContinue drive to reach location.\r\n\r\nThat is the basics, and call me unimaginative, but I like it.  The graphics are not so intense my less than top of the line computer does just fine.  I have played this game for almost 900 hours as of this review, and I can list on one hand the times it has crashed, in my book that is enough for me to buy a game these days.  In the last six months I picked up a Steam Deck, and it works phenomenally there as well.  Bit of a battery hog, but what isn’t except 8-bit games.  I have also not completed this game in all the time I have played.  I keep getting distracted by some random place I see on the map and want to drive to it.  \r\n\r\nCan this game be difficult, absolutely.  I flipped over two large off-road trucks during a delivery to a map that does not have a garage (base of operations) and had to spend almost 30 minutes just to get another truck out there to flip them back over, only to roll that truck.  I was unhappy to say the least but still had a blast. The other thing is that leveling up to get better tires is a must, but I spent so much time doing side quests that it was a non issue.\r\n\r\nThe only drawback to this game is the lack of a solid story.  There is a bit of a bit of one and it is centered around rebuilding things in the different maps, and I have completed only one of the three main objectives.  But to be honest it does not detract from the game.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy off-road driving in video games and a little mindless fun, then this game is a good match.",

This is just a honest feeling good game, so you can sit with a cup of warm coffee/chocomilk/whatever, play a podcast, take your rig, plan your routes, leave your base and when you were like 2/3 of the route, you roll over by touching a stone, so now you need a second truck to assist the first one, and that's the very moment you get stuck in a swamp born from the sweetest dreams of Hidetaka Miyazaki... After like 45 minutes of your life you'll never recover, once you achieve to get to the destination, you realize yoU DIDN'T GET THE CORRECT CARGO so you have to go back right to the start FOR FUCK'S SAKE GIT GUD OR SOMETHING I DUNNO I JUST WANNA CRY AND I'M NOT PLAYING THIS GAME AGAIN IN MY FUCKING LIFE ALT+F4 ALT+F4 ALT+F4...

If you enjoy trucking simulators and have the patience of a rock like I do, then pick up the base game and Seasons one through 5 for hundreds upon hundreds of hours of offroading madness.\n\nYes, I 100%'d all seasons through Washington because I'm actually insane.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 7/10\nIN A NUTSHELL: An offroading career",

It’s better with friends, but still amazingly fun to play solo.\n\nIt expands on the premise of Spintires and MudRunner by adding a huge amount of content — maps, missions, cargo types, trucks, customization, and much more. And if you ever start to get bored, the Steam Workshop is enabled, so you can mod to your heart’s content.\n\nWhat I don’t like, however, is that the physics feel inferior, at least in my opinion. Compared to MudRunner, the sensation of driving your truck over mud and rough terrain isn’t as satisfying. The frame of the truck feels too rigid — in MudRunner and Spintires you could see the metal twisting and fighting with the terrain, really showing how the trucks struggled while carrying heavy cargo. That made progress feel more rewarding. Here, the physics sometimes cause vehicles to fly or get flung around, which breaks immersion.\n\nAll that said, it’s still a faithful continuation of the series, and the huge amount of extra content is a big plus.",

I thought I loved Death Stranding for the weirdness, but turns out that I 100%-ed it actually for the isolating experience of conquering hostile environments. This game scratches the exact same itch. \r\n\r\nThere's not really any story, no surprises, barely any progression (truck upgrades, new vehicles and some change to environment to make some routes easier, like clearing obstructions or rebuilding bridges)- it is exactly what You think it is from videos and screenshots. If that doesn't interest You, then there is nothing else for You here. If the idea of engaging technical traversal of environment sounds curiously appealing, then this might be a surprise cozy game for You. It was for me. It's like ETS2 if the road hated You.\r\n\r\nThis game can get quite tense at points - hauling 50foot 20ton semi trailer on the edge of a sloped cliff, crawling forward with the most powerful yet not powerful enough truck with a winch holding the trailer from toppling over and rolling down the hill is close to as exhilarating as it was for as a Souls boss fight.",

Keep that in mind.\n\nSecond of all, God, I cannot recommend SnowRunner to people like me. At first, the gameplay is pretty relaxing - slow-paced for sure, but nonetheless fun and doable (for the first 5 hours of gameplay).\nThen you sink more hours in: what used to be a little challenge becomes increasingly more frustrating due to bugs, trucks flipping over and janky physics. It doesn't even feel difficult, it's just... pure frustration with no feeling of reward whatsoever. \nThe biggest issue I find with SnowRunner is that you HAVE to be good at it and oversee most of its jankness in order to enjoy it. That said, I'm sure it can be a virtual paradise to truckers.\n\n33 hours in, and I can safely say it is one of the last time I start up the game. For the sake of my desk, at the very least. Too bad it got too difficult for me after 5 hours, I lost 30€.",

      "review": "Anyone who states that this game has realistic physics is delusional.  I bought this looking forward to a realistic offroad trucking simulator.  That is not what this is.  You could swear the physics were programmed by a toddler.  You lose an entire axle from a small river rock.  The trucks are as slow as molasses.  You can't run over trees.  You do not bounce in soft mud in reality, you sink! Have the clowns who made this game ever been off-roading in their life, or did they just program this game thinking this is what off-roading is.  The physics have no bearing in physical reality ?  But this game seems to think you can bounce all over the place in quick sand?  This game is programmed to be hard, not from a realism perspective but from the perspective of someone who likes self harm.  This is an unhealthy outlet in the form of a game.  I was blown away how good the reviews were only to wonder what the hell do people see in this turd?  It isn't even a polished turd.  I cant even give it the honor.  But it seems like the devs only motive is to get those with special needs hooked so they can buy more DLC.\n\nUpdate: I manage to find an original copy of the first game in the series made by this developer, SPIN TIRES, now that is an off-road simulator.  The trucks actually have a valid gearbox, the physics are like real life off-roading, your truck has weight to it, you can build momentum and speed as well, it doesn’t feel like you may launch into orbit with Sputnik like Snowrunner, you don’t bounce around like you are on a bumpy sheet of glass.  The chassis of the truck flex and bend, small trees break under load and larger ones bend from your truck up to a certain size.  The environments don’t give you serious damage or damage out of nowhere unless you really hit something hard.  I enjoyed SpinTires so much I played it for like 7 hours today.  I then bought Mudrunner which is the second game by this developer.  It is like a graphically updated SpinTires, it basically looks like Snowrunner, but with different locations, and was the predecessor of Snowrunner.  That is the game I recommend you play if you have an itch for an off-road simulator.  You likely won’t be able to find a copy of SpinTires unless you are internet “SAVVY”. I do not recommend the sorry excuse for a physics engine that Snow Runner has.  Essentially, the only thing Snowrunner has on Mudrunner and SpinTires is wider variety of missions and more dlc, and what looks to be slightly better graphics, which is meaningless in 2025.  Literally everything else about the game is worse. And dumbed down.  Why, to be released on console.  SpinTires is a legit pc off-road simulator.  Which Mudrunner was dumbed down from SpinTires and Snow Runner is a game for those who still crap themselves and have not been potty trained yet. \n\nApparently, the Publisher and Developer had a dispute while making DLC for SpinTires and parted ways. Sued each other, and the dev made Mudrunner.  However SpinTires still existed.  Obviously whatever happened in their dispute the publisher had to take down SpinTires.  However, the engine utilized in Snowrunner had to be different from MudRunenr and SpinTires.  Why…who the hell knows.  Maybe it was a settled agreement.  But all I can tell you is when the dev coded this game, they did it like a rabid mongoose on Crystal Meth.  Nothing about the physics engine or game mechanics make sense, and there are colossal bugs in the game that make it down right unplayable or infuriating, self abusing even.\n\nSo I recommend if you have a desire to play an actual off-road simulator, play Mudrunner or try a find SpinTires as it is the superior one and I played the hell out of it today.  It is exactly what I was hoping this game was, but it isn’t.  Sadly. I cannot recommend Snowrunner, as it is a broken game, which is really disappointing, because I am now a fan of the first two installments.  So it has nothing to do with difficulty or skill, as SpinTires is more difficult as a game.  Snowrunners bugs make it unplayable and difficult from ineptitude of the dev’s physic engine design choices.  All they had to do was reuse the same engine, or code the same values.  I mean damn, he shit the bed.  Also, Roadcraft has the same engine as Snowrunner, so this STD plague of a physics engine is now cascading into this devs other titles, with a semi truck game on the way too, yikes . Unless you got SR for like 4 dollars, then maybe it is worth it. But even then that 4 dollars would be better spent on a gallon of diesel, which should be used to set yourself ablaze, as it would be less painful than having to endure any time experience SnowRunners Physics engine.  Save your money. Save your sanity.  As this game starts off slow before you start realizing the bugs and glaring errors, unless you play challenge mode initially. Where I found all the bugs. Which are game breaking and make it unplayable, infuriating.  I am trying to protect you as a consumer.  Not to waste your money on a broken game that will screw you over later on in gameplay, secretly hiding its inadequate, buggy and unrealistic engine.\n\nThis is the worst engine I have experience in 17 years on steam, and 30 years of gaming exp.  It is a shit show.\n\nI managed to find mods for the game to a put it in a state where it is playable and actually fun.  Adjusting things like the physics, weight, suspension, getting rid of the bouncing, ridiculous damage that makes no sense.  Now it is actually enjoyable.  But you shouldn’t have to do this.  So my review stands.  Unless you want to mod the piss out of it I wouldn’t play it.\n\nThe base game includes 3 maps, Michigan, Alaska and Taymyr.  There are 16 additional DLC maps:  So that means the base game only has less that 15 percent of the total locations. The same thing for trucks.  You start out with a chevy pickup and a flat bed chevy dully.  The rest have to be purchased through in game currency, which you have to level up to get the better stuff, which you earn from jobs or you have to buy DLC.  If I counted right, there are 69 DLC trucks locked behind paying more.  All this for a crap physics engine that needs to be fixed through mods.\n\nThe graphics are decently nice, not hard on the eyes.  However, the fact I have to fix the physics engine with mods to make the game enjoyable, and then download mods for more vehicles really isn't a good view.  Which the modded trucks are free, and they operate better, because modders fix the phyiscs on their trucks to make them operate effectively and realistically, unlike the game itself.  This all brings me back to the money dispute between Pavel who works for Saber and the Oovee Game Studios Publisher.  I can only guess money is the primary motivation, given they had to change the physics engine, to distance themselves so Oovee didn't have a claim.  Which is worse in every way.  But since the devs intentions are clear in what they have done with their installments, it is clear money was always the motivation, when the trucks hit a rock and launch so hard into the air with the trailer it would make NASA Engineers at Cape Canaveral Jealous.  Fix the damn game, fix the physics, fix the bounciness of the trucks.  Make it like Mudrunner and Spintires.  Not a conindence the mods I use do just that lol.  \n\nI don't think anyone who isn't a self mutilating body cutter, would enjoy the basic game with DLC's as is.  The game is too punishing with the crap physics and takes too long to do anything or get anwhere.  I would imagine it would get exhausting.  There is a lot to do, but one mission could take 2 hours, and that is you hauling ass, and having no mishaps. This isn't an experience that respects your time.  \n\nI can only recommend it if you mod it or you like indulging in masochist tendencies.  Or you are a child that goes 'OOOooooo, Big Truck Momma!\".  Then you may enjoy yourself.",

Small slopes of snow or mud act as super glue because if your going 40 mph and you run into such a slope, you get stopped immediately and probably flip over and respawn back, so that's fun. Now the most fun part, the trees are made of tungsten and are impossible to break even with the biggest truck in the game a 15 ton truck cant break a single bald tree that is rotting away and if your going through a gate to another area in co-op there is a chance that you and your friend will fly together in to space and the collision physics just has a stroke so that's fun.  \n\n  \n\nSO INSTEAD OF MAKING ANOTHER DLC TO MAKE MONEY FROM THE GAME, MAYBE FIX THE BUGS FIRST THAT MAKE THE GAME UNPLAYABLE.",

No real physics in the game! not the terrain is the problem but how devs think a 16 tone truck moves through the real world. and for the finale, there is no momentum in these game. Ex. you are on top of a hill and you speed up just to get a momentum to pass a muddy area, at least a little bit, but guess what, the mud is like sticky tar! stop the truck immediately no matter how big or small is the vehicle and also taking engine dmg ! not wheels dmg or suspension dmg... engine dmg! how?????",

Keep that in mind.\n\nSecond of all, God, I cannot recommend SnowRunner to people like me. At first, the gameplay is pretty relaxing - slow-paced for sure, but nonetheless fun and doable (for the first 5 hours of gameplay).\nThen you sink more hours in: what used to be a little challenge becomes increasingly more frustrating due to bugs, trucks flipping over and janky physics. It doesn't even feel difficult, it's just... pure frustration with no feeling of reward whatsoever. \nThe biggest issue I find with SnowRunner is that you HAVE to be good at it and oversee most of its jankness in order to enjoy it. That said, I'm sure it can be a virtual paradise to truckers.\n\n33 hours in, and I can safely say it is one of the last time I start up the game. For the sake of my desk, at the very least. Too bad it got too difficult for me after 5 hours, I lost 30€.",

      "review": "Anyone who states that this game has realistic physics is delusional.  I bought this looking forward to a realistic offroad trucking simulator.  That is not what this is.  You could swear the physics were programmed by a toddler.  You lose an entire axle from a small river rock.  The trucks are as slow as molasses.  You can't run over trees.  You do not bounce in soft mud in reality, you sink! Have the clowns who made this game ever been off-roading in their life, or did they just program this game thinking this is what off-roading is.  The physics have no bearing in physical reality ?  But this game seems to think you can bounce all over the place in quick sand?  This game is programmed to be hard, not from a realism perspective but from the perspective of someone who likes self harm.  This is an unhealthy outlet in the form of a game.  I was blown away how good the reviews were only to wonder what the hell do people see in this turd?  It isn't even a polished turd.  I cant even give it the honor.  But it seems like the devs only motive is to get those with special needs hooked so they can buy more DLC.\n\nUpdate: I manage to find an original copy of the first game in the series made by this developer, SPIN TIRES, now that is an off-road simulator.  The trucks actually have a valid gearbox, the physics are like real life off-roading, your truck has weight to it, you can build momentum and speed as well, it doesn’t feel like you may launch into orbit with Sputnik like Snowrunner, you don’t bounce around like you are on a bumpy sheet of glass.  The chassis of the truck flex and bend, small trees break under load and larger ones bend from your truck up to a certain size.  The environments don’t give you serious damage or damage out of nowhere unless you really hit something hard.  I enjoyed SpinTires so much I played it for like 7 hours today.  I then bought Mudrunner which is the second game by this developer.  It is like a graphically updated SpinTires, it basically looks like Snowrunner, but with different locations, and was the predecessor of Snowrunner.  That is the game I recommend you play if you have an itch for an off-road simulator.  You likely won’t be able to find a copy of SpinTires unless you are internet “SAVVY”. I do not recommend the sorry excuse for a physics engine that Snow Runner has.  Essentially, the only thing Snowrunner has on Mudrunner and SpinTires is wider variety of missions and more dlc, and what looks to be slightly better graphics, which is meaningless in 2025.  Literally everything else about the game is worse. And dumbed down.  Why, to be released on console.  SpinTires is a legit pc off-road simulator.  Which Mudrunner was dumbed down from SpinTires and Snow Runner is a game for those who still crap themselves and have not been potty trained yet. \n\nApparently, the Publisher and Developer had a dispute while making DLC for SpinTires and parted ways. Sued each other, and the dev made Mudrunner.  However SpinTires still existed.  Obviously whatever happened in their dispute the publisher had to take down SpinTires.  However, the engine utilized in Snowrunner had to be different from MudRunenr and SpinTires.  Why…who the hell knows.  Maybe it was a settled agreement.  But all I can tell you is when the dev coded this game, they did it like a rabid mongoose on Crystal Meth.  Nothing about the physics engine or game mechanics make sense, and there are colossal bugs in the game that make it down right unplayable or infuriating, self abusing even.\n\nSo I recommend if you have a desire to play an actual off-road simulator, play Mudrunner or try a find SpinTires as it is the superior one and I played the hell out of it today.  It is exactly what I was hoping this game was, but it isn’t.  Sadly. I cannot recommend Snowrunner, as it is a broken game, which is really disappointing, because I am now a fan of the first two installments.  So it has nothing to do with difficulty or skill, as SpinTires is more difficult as a game.  Snowrunners bugs make it unplayable and difficult from ineptitude of the dev’s physic engine design choices.  All they had to do was reuse the same engine, or code the same values.  I mean damn, he shit the bed.  Also, Roadcraft has the same engine as Snowrunner, so this STD plague of a physics engine is now cascading into this devs other titles, with a semi truck game on the way too, yikes . Unless you got SR for like 4 dollars, then maybe it is worth it. But even then that 4 dollars would be better spent on a gallon of diesel, which should be used to set yourself ablaze, as it would be less painful than having to endure any time experience SnowRunners Physics engine.  Save your money. Save your sanity.  As this game starts off slow before you start realizing the bugs and glaring errors, unless you play challenge mode initially. Where I found all the bugs. Which are game breaking and make it unplayable, infuriating.  I am trying to protect you as a consumer.  Not to waste your money on a broken game that will screw you over later on in gameplay, secretly hiding its inadequate, buggy and unrealistic engine.\n\nThis is the worst engine I have experience in 17 years on steam, and 30 years of gaming exp.  It is a shit show.\n\nI managed to find mods for the game to a put it in a state where it is playable and actually fun.  Adjusting things like the physics, weight, suspension, getting rid of the bouncing, ridiculous damage that makes no sense.  Now it is actually enjoyable.  But you shouldn’t have to do this.  So my review stands.  Unless you want to mod the piss out of it I wouldn’t play it.\n\nThe base game includes 3 maps, Michigan, Alaska and Taymyr.  There are 16 additional DLC maps:  So that means the base game only has less that 15 percent of the total locations. The same thing for trucks.  You start out with a chevy pickup and a flat bed chevy dully.  The rest have to be purchased through in game currency, which you have to level up to get the better stuff, which you earn from jobs or you have to buy DLC.  If I counted right, there are 69 DLC trucks locked behind paying more.  All this for a crap physics engine that needs to be fixed through mods.\n\nThe graphics are decently nice, not hard on the eyes.  However, the fact I have to fix the physics engine with mods to make the game enjoyable, and then download mods for more vehicles really isn't a good view.  Which the modded trucks are free, and they operate better, because modders fix the phyiscs on their trucks to make them operate effectively and realistically, unlike the game itself.  This all brings me back to the money dispute between Pavel who works for Saber and the Oovee Game Studios Publisher.  I can only guess money is the primary motivation, given they had to change the physics engine, to distance themselves so Oovee didn't have a claim.  Which is worse in every way.  But since the devs intentions are clear in what they have done with their installments, it is clear money was always the motivation, when the trucks hit a rock and launch so hard into the air with the trailer it would make NASA Engineers at Cape Canaveral Jealous.  Fix the damn game, fix the physics, fix the bounciness of the trucks.  Make it like Mudrunner and Spintires.  Not a conindence the mods I use do just that lol.  \n\nI don't think anyone who isn't a self mutilating body cutter, would enjoy the basic game with DLC's as is.  The game is too punishing with the crap physics and takes too long to do anything or get anwhere.  I would imagine it would get exhausting.  There is a lot to do, but one mission could take 2 hours, and that is you hauling ass, and having no mishaps. This isn't an experience that respects your time.  \n\nI can only recommend it if you mod it or you like indulging in masochist tendencies.  Or you are a child that goes 'OOOooooo, Big Truck Momma!\".  Then you may enjoy yourself.",

Then you try a diffeent mission and guess what? You can't do it without doing your previous mission. \nTrying to progress in coop? Nice try, but no. Game won't save coop progress.\nI just wanted a lighthearted mudrunner with more maps and more environments, I got a infinite hour commitment to accomplish nothing and get stuck on frustrating missions instead of mud.",

Small slopes of snow or mud act as super glue because if your going 40 mph and you run into such a slope, you get stopped immediately and probably flip over and respawn back, so that's fun. Now the most fun part, the trees are made of tungsten and are impossible to break even with the biggest truck in the game a 15 ton truck cant break a single bald tree that is rotting away and if your going through a gate to another area in co-op there is a chance that you and your friend will fly together in to space and the collision physics just has a stroke so that's fun.  \n\n  \n\nSO INSTEAD OF MAKING ANOTHER DLC TO MAKE MONEY FROM THE GAME, MAYBE FIX THE BUGS FIRST THAT MAKE THE GAME UNPLAYABLE.",

No real physics in the game! not the terrain is the problem but how devs think a 16 tone truck moves through the real world. and for the finale, there is no momentum in these game. Ex. you are on top of a hill and you speed up just to get a momentum to pass a muddy area, at least a little bit, but guess what, the mud is like sticky tar! stop the truck immediately no matter how big or small is the vehicle and also taking engine dmg ! not wheels dmg or suspension dmg... engine dmg! how?????",
