The base game alone just isn’t worth $50 AUD. It’s barebones, limited, and looks outdated. Playing it without mods honestly feels like you paid full price for half a game.\r\n\r\nBut once you dive into mods, everything changes. Custom bikes, high-quality tracks, better sounds, graphics packs, gear, physics tweaks — the community basically rebuilds the game into something incredible. With mods installed, MX Bikes becomes one of the most realistic and enjoyable motocross sims out there.\r\n\r\nBase game? Not worth it.\r\nBase game + mods? Absolutely incredible.",

These tracks aren’t just fun — they’re alive. Every time you ride them, you feel the terrain teaching you something new.\n\nI try to ride slowly and increase my lap times gradually but consistently. That, to me, is the best approach to mastering this game. If you go too fast too soon, you don’t give yourself the chance to understand [i]why[/i] you’re crashing or losing control. When you take it slow and steady, the track starts to make sense — you begin to understand how the bike behaves, what causes mistakes, and how to correct them.\n\nThat’s when real learning happens. Before that, it’s all wasted potential. But once you ride with intention, that potential turns into actual growth.\n\nI’ve played other motocross games like [i]Monster Energy Supercross[/i] or [i]MXGP 2021[/i], thinking they might offer something better in certain areas — but after getting used to the realistic “MX Bikes feeling”, it’s hard to go back. Those games feel more like [i]arcade experiences[/i], while MX Bikes feels like [i]riding[/i].\n\nI also approach the game as if it were real life — imagining that a crash would hurt me badly. That mindset makes me ride smarter and more carefully, not just faster. It turns the experience into something deeper than just a game.\n\nThat’s why I understand the negative reviews: many people expect [i]MX Bikes[/i] to be another [i]MXGP[/i] or [i]MX vs ATV[/i], but it’s not. It’s not built for arcade fun — it’s a [i]simulation[/i] meant for those who value realism, patience, and the process of improving.\n\nOne last thing: I don’t like playing against my own trainer or ghost rider version. It adds pressure and distracts me from the track. When you’re trying to outrun your past self, you stop paying attention to the flow and rhythm that matter most. Improvement comes from understanding the track — not from rushing to beat a number.\n\nIn the end, [i]MX Bikes[/i] isn’t just about racing. It’s about [i]learning[/i]. It rewards focus, discipline, and respect for the craft — just like real motocross.",
