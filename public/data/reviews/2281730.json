      "review": "Here are my 10 resons why Combate Master is so good\r\n1. Combat Master stands out in the modern FPS landscape for one simple reason: it understands what makes a shooter fun. In a market full of bloated mechanics, slow menus, and heavy monetization, Combat Master brings the focus back to fast, fluid gameplay. It strips away unnecessary clutter and puts the player directly into intense, skill-based action. This dedication to simplicity — without sacrificing depth — is one of the game’s greatest strengths.\r\n\r\n2. The game’s movement system is one of the first things players notice, and it is also one of the main reasons the game feels so good. Combat Master offers remarkably smooth mobility, with sliding, jumping, climbing, and sprinting all integrated naturally into the flow of combat. This creates matches that feel quick and dynamic rather than static or predictable. The emphasis on mobility encourages players to experiment with creative positioning and high-speed plays that keep every match exciting.\r\n\r\n3. Closely tied to the movement is the game’s fluid gunplay. Weapons feel responsive, snappy, and satisfying, especially for a free-to-play title. Shots register clearly, recoil patterns are easy to learn but still require skill, and the overall pacing of gunfights is fast enough to reward sharp reflexes while remaining approachable. The result is a game where mastering your aim and timing feels rewarding rather than frustrating.\r\n\r\n4. One of the most refreshing aspects of Combat Master is its commitment to being genuinely fair-to-play. Unlike many free shooters that lock power upgrades behind paywalls or grind-heavy progression systems, Combat Master does not force players to spend money to stay competitive. Cosmetic purchases exist, but they do not alter gameplay. This ensures that every player enters the battlefield on equal footing, making victories feel earned through skill, not spending.\r\n\r\n5. Another major strength of the game is its optimization. Combat Master runs smoothly on a wide range of hardware, from high-end gaming PCs to older laptops and mobile devices. This level of performance accessibility is rare among modern shooters. Players don’t need expensive hardware to enjoy stable framerates and fast load times; the developers clearly prioritized performance, which greatly widens the community that can enjoy the game.\r\n\r\n6. Despite being lightweight and highly optimized, Combat Master offers solid map variety and design. Its maps are built to support the game’s fast pacing, with clever sightlines, verticality, and opportunities for close-quarters skirmishes. Whether sprinting across tight corridors or holding angles in open arenas, players experience different styles of combat across different locations, helping keep gameplay fresh.\r\n\r\n7. The matching system and quick game sessions make Combat Master perfect for players who want instant action. Many modern shooters require long lobby waits or multi-minute respawn timers, but Combat Master keeps downtime to an absolute minimum. Matches start quickly, rounds move fast, and players spend the majority of their time actually playing. This makes the game ideal for short play sessions as well as hours-long marathons.\r\n\r\n8. The game also benefits from an active and passionate community. Because of its easy accessibility, many players from different backgrounds — mobile gamers, PC players, casual fans, and competitive FPS veterans — all meet in the same space. This creates a lively and diverse player base, which contributes to fast matchmaking and a steady flow of new ideas, suggestions, and creative playstyles.\r\n\r\n9. Visually, the game finds a strong balance between being lightweight and visually appealing. While not aiming for hyper-realistic detail, Combat Master still delivers clean environments, readable character designs, and impactful animations. This clarity helps gameplay: enemies are easy to see, weapon actions are crisp, and effects never feel overwhelming. The visual design supports the gameplay rather than distracting from it.\r\n\r\n10. Ultimately, Combat Master is good because it respects the player’s time, skill, and hardware. It offers fast-paced action, fair competition, smooth performance, and enjoyable gunplay — all without demanding money or powerful equipment. In many ways, Combat Master feels like a reminder of what shooters used to be: fun, fast, focused, and built around gameplay rather than monetization. That combination makes it not only a good game, but one of the most refreshing free shooters available today.",

Like the map you advertise in the trailer, where tf is that map. i mean it just seems a little counter intuitive you made the effort to create ground vehicles but no means for them to spawn and be used on a map like oil rig which is the only battle royal map available. like what was the point. \ni have to say great game, awesome compatibility, honestly i like it more than call of duty at least in terms of equivalent game play, loading time and the leveling system.\nBut without any new content aside from paid skins, its like you have the biggest most pleasurable penis on the free prostitution platform but you can only get it up once every couple of months when u drop a new weapon skin, operator, or maybe a map, like you've blown your load early tried to aim for the face but ended up all over your grandmas antique rug. cmon g. not cool ;(\n\naside from that gg, really good if u want to start playing fps on pc",

It still felt like a game instead of a military simulation which is good!\n\nWith a slight adjustment to gore settings, I would say it's suitable for kids aged 12 and up. As this game (as far to my knowledge) does not contain swearing.\n\nAll this being said, there is however 1 suggestion I'd highly recommend that the developers do regarding the game's chat with players.\n\n1: if age is not 20 or above, disable chat features altogether, this includes microphone voice chats too. This reason being, is to protect the children that are not 20 or above to inappropriate swearing, cursing or any derogatory terms that online players may use to either, joke about or insult one-another.\n\n2: if those who are eligible to use chats on this game, including microphone voice call chats, to be monitored closely incase anyone tries to threaten other lives(even if they are joking), or encourages suicide attempts that children could be forced into making, as children are not educated and they may think that these ways of solving is the answer, when it's absolutely not, and not okay to do either.\n\nThe sole reason I am suggesting these 2 points, is because during my 22 hours of playing the game, I have noticed that the chat can get freaky, and not in a good way either. There are even those who falsely accuse those of pedophilia, even when they don't know the exact meaning of pedophilia, these derogatory terms used to either accuse or insult people, can fall into the wrong people's minds, and if so, can lead to devastating consequences to the youth that are not fully aware of what they are saying or using to \"ratio\" other kids/adults in this game.\n\nIt is very important that you see to these suggestions, as these suggestions could possibly attract more of a player-base, as long as it could possibly lead to a healthier one in the long term, and children and adults alike respect each other. \n\nNow, I'm not saying they can't joke along or have a laugh, but there are far better ways to do so without seemingly insulting someone else in the process. There are far better ways of joking about than to act creepy online, as this behavior is not acceptable as it leads to either creating traumatic events for the youth that should never have to be subjected to such behavior, or it simply has devastating consequences if they use this behavior online or in real life. I believe this behavior to be the works of pure evil and should never be tolerated, no matter whether it is a joke or not.\n\nThe jokes that children are coming out with is very frightening, this indicates to me, either, they aren't raised correctly by their parents in terms of manners/etiquette, or the parents unknowingly are deceived by their children by them hiding activity that they know their parents would scold them about.",

For a CoD clone, my expectations were at rock bottom, but my experience has been enormously positive. \n\nPROS\n\n- Solid gunplay\n- Deep customization, ABSURDLY deep for a mobile game\n- Decent map layouts and design\n- Zero pay-to-win mechanics, all weapons and gear are earned through leveling\n- Tons of free cosmetics simply for logging in and completing challenges\n- Fully playable offline\n\nCONS \n\n- Arena gamemodes like TDM and Domination have fixed team spawns that can lead to spawn-killing.\n- The large Pokrovsk map for Battle Royale was removed a while back and has yet to return. Oil Platforms is the only map on offer at the moment.\n\nIf you're like me and you wish CoD Warzone had PvE as an option, this scratches that itch pretty dang good. And with cross-platform progression (requires account sync with either Google or Facebook), this makes for a nice little addition to anyone's game library that they can take on the go with them, even OFFLINE. \n\nEvery once in a blue moon, there's a free-to-play game that really raises the bar and exceeds the usual low expectations for what is - at its core - a mobile game. Combat Master is 100% that game.",

Let's say that hitting the 60kills / 8 Deaths wasn't tasty anymore.\n\nI really wish more real players would be present, or that they would rework the match making so that you don't play against bots unless you select this feature in the custom private match menu.\n\nThat being said, the weapon customization is one of the best I have experienced in a FTP FPS and this game definitively has some great qualities.",

The game feels on par with a mobile fps or something you would see on Roblox (the former makes sense cause the game is actually available for mobile). It is very rough around the edges, but the devs are still working on it I hope. Gameplay is fun but some aspects are quite clunky like movement and aiming down sights. Also it is free so expect microtransactions, however they are not too necessary. The game also has a bot problem so I hope the devs fix that and not add more bundles.\n\nIf you want a free fps, or one that is better for low-end computers,  I would say that this is a good option, however there are better ones out there.",
