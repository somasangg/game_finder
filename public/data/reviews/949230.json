      "review": "I only played on the free weekend during the review.\nThere are good and bad things with the game. The game didn't crash for me, not even once, while many complain for a lot of crash. I played with the CS1 for a 100+ hours, mostly casually, just like in this one. My config is not the best compared to the recommended requirements (the minimum should be ignored for any games tbh), the problem is mainly on the gpu.\n\nTL;DR : You should wait for a 50% sale at least\n\n[h3]Pros:[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]There are roundabouts in the game without mods, unlike in the first game.\n[*]I liked the dummy version of the traffic manager. It was nice to set things in the intersections for myself, it would be better if the lane rules could be set for each lane. The ability to prohibit U-turns by default would be great, but for these cases the Traffic mod was useful.\n[*]The new road upgrade/replace mode is so much better than in CS1. You don't have to upgrade it on the middle of the road, very useful in highway intersections or if you don't want to destroy your buildings when upgrading for a bigger road. Although it takes some time to get used to it, but with turning off every snapping you can move the road a little bit.\n[*]The new progression system with the development points is really good, I could use the crematorium from really early on, while in the CS1 it was quite some time to unlock it.\nThe free region packs are good as well.\n[*]The new way of the service buildings is so much better than in the CS1. They are cost more than in the pervious one for sure, but the zones are much bigger. It was always strange for me that in the CS1 you had to put down 2 schools for like 3k people, multiple police stations, etc.\n[*]The upgradable buildings are great.\n[*]The really basic production functionality is good. Now the produced things have an impact on your city, mainly on the cost with no need for import.\n[*]The powerlines and the pipes being built-in most of the roads is great.\n[*]Mid level and mixed-use housing.\n[*]Topography for building is a great help, because without it sometimes is hard to tell the height differences.\n[*]Parallel mode and grid tool. The grid tool would be more useful, if you could set how to divide the area up, for example 3x4 or 4x4.\n[*]Continuously making the connection for the intersections, don't need to stop at each one.\n[*]Asymmetric roads\n[*]New happiness system, now you can see what the citizens' problem.\n[*]The game looks good, with the exception of the LOD.\n[/list]\n\n[h3]Cons:[/h3]\n[list]\n[*]There could be more policies, policy for free public transport (manually need to set it for every line), same fee for the parking lots by default, etc. But my biggest problem with them is, that I can't set any district policy for the whole city.\n[*]The LOD (level of detail) is awful, the more detailed buildings became smashed in noticeably if you zoom out, even it's not so far. This doesn't really change with higher settings either.\nThe optimalization is really bad, I could run the CS1 on anything back in the day. There should be no need for a 3080 for the recommended requirements. For comparison the CS1 recommended gpu was the 580, which was 5 years old at the release, not a 680 which would be the same 3 year time gap as between the 3080 and the CS2 release date. I don't know what the devs did in the past 2 years, because the region packs and all of the current DLCs are mostly the job of a graphics designer, so the devs could have plenty of time fixing it.\n[*]The way how the industries working in the game is a setback compared to the previous one. The district version was better. It should be more detailed, like in the CS1 DLCs. I think it's a reasonable expectation to have some of it in the successor base game.\n[*]The price, the base game should be 40 euros by default, not with the sales. I will probably buy it if it's 50% off at least.\n[*]This should be an early access in this form, not a release.\n[*]Traffic lights, still causing more trouble then use, just like in the CS1. The timing is the same for every lights in the intersection, even if the traffic flow most of the time is not the same for each side.\n[*]Using the stop sign for anything is a nonsense, it makes the whole intersection using stop signs. In CS1 you could set the stop sings for each road in the intersection.\n[/list]\n\nI don't consider the traffic accidents and some idiot drivers a bad thing, because these things can happen irl as well, although there  could be an option to change its occurrence.\n\n[h3]At the end:[/h3]\nI would give a mid rating for the game if it was an available option on Steam. But between the yes or no, I slightly tend more to recommend it than not. However, just like I said, you should wait for a sale, with this price a 50% one at least.",

      "review": "This game throws DLC after DLC at you. The DLC is soulless, and provides ~$1/minute of entertainment. The graphics are nice but I do miss the previous title.... the bugs too I must mention...\n\nAh wait this isn't Sims 4.\n\nSkylines 2 is the forever game. While we patiently waited for the port DLC something around 20gb of free OFFICIAL content was released via their brilliantly implemented mod manager. Factoring sales, I have paid only $50 for this game and the content just keeps rolling in. I'm not even finished playing with the content that came out months ago, hardly touched the China asset pack which is gorgeous. The DLC almost perfectly tied all that had been released together, and with the bike update just dropped, this game is perfection*. NETHERLANDS. \n\nI've seen complaints about performance but I get ~60fps even at 300k population, and when you sit back and consider how ludicrous the volume of simulation happening I think its acceptable if the game sneezes occasionally.. Seriously, click a random citizen, and watch them go about 10 minutes of their day. On the way to the park to walk their dog they pass 1000 other citizens, some shopping, others waiting for the bus, many with dogs of their own (there are so many puppers, I love this but cat update please, unplayable). Model railroad and Glenworld enthusiasts rejoice as we immerse into this horrifyingly immersive simulation. \n\n\n*Disclaimers\n- My wrists hurt.\n\n- This game is full of bugs, infested even. HOWEVER every single bug I've come across (and I am a risky player who absolutely ABUSES the Anarchy mod and MoveIt) is comletely fixable. This will make some players sick but I usally click continue when the game crashes and just delete whatever caused the crash and pretend nothing happened lol. I save backups every 30 minutes, and after anything finicky. I also like to keep my mods around 20-30 so that updates don't cause huge delay. The modders are fast. The mods are robust. Usually a 2 day break and all is functional. With patience you'll work through any quirk that I am aware of. I highly recommend watching some realism focused youtubers such as Infrastructurist or Cityplannerplays. They do well to cover vanilla mechanics as well as modded techniques which will make the game far more playable for a new player. \n\n- Bringing me into my third disclaimer. Cities Skylines is probably one of the hardest games that exist. Slight exaggeration perhaps, but that could be imposter syndrome talking. This isn't Minecraft anymore lads. The skillset is this mindmelting combination of 3D animation software, actual civil engineering and city planning, and a boatload of knot theory. I think if I switched my degree I'd have made a disturbing amount of progress. The 700 hours does not reflect the research I've done on road heirachy, intricate zoning layouts, ecological considerations, city history and flow of development, you name it. Despite this I still find myself cheesing some cities with a fat geothermal power plant exporting to the neighbours just to stop myself hovering in the red. \n\nAt the time of writing this review the game has cost me $0.001/minute of entertainment. \nTHIS DOES NOT INCLUDE ELECTRICITY LMAO.\nThis game is the only game that pushes my PC to 100% fan speed jet engine turbo mode. I can only imagine how thirsty the PSU is while it runs. \nAlso side note, if you don't like heatstroke or exploding graphics cards live in Europe or Antarctia:)\n\nIf you think you can handle all that then have fun.",

      "review": "Despite all of its flaws, I’ve genuinely enjoyed the time I’ve spent with it. However, even after being on the market for more than two years, Cities: Skylines II still struggles to meet the expectations set for a major sequel. At launch, it felt closer to an early-access title—hampered by severe performance issues, stability problems, and a striking lack of content compared to its predecessor, Cities: Skylines 1.\n\nA significant part of my frustration stems from how both Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive have handled the game. Colossal Order, once known for their polished and community-focused approach, delivered a sequel that appeared rushed and underdeveloped. Meanwhile, Paradox Interactive’s publishing strategy hasn’t helped; rather than prioritising core fixes and stability, they continued their usual DLC-driven model, pushing expansions while the foundational experience remained deeply flawed. For many players, it felt like the business decisions were being made at the expense of the game’s actual quality.\n\nThe slow development of essential tools further underscores the mismanagement. The long-awaited asset editor—fundamental for a city-building game whose community thrives on modding—is only expected to arrive by the end of the year. The fact that such a critical feature has taken two full years to materialise is, quite frankly, unacceptable for a sequel in a franchise that owes much of its longevity to user-generated content.\n\nLooking ahead, Cities: Skylines II and its new development direction need to focus on bringing the game up to the standard set by Cities: Skylines 1. That means not only expanding content and deepening gameplay systems, but also delivering the optimisation required to handle large, complex cities. A modern city-builder shouldn’t start struggle when populations exceed 100,000 citizens, yet preformance and stability remains a persistent issue.\n\nUltimately, the future of Cities: Skylines II depends on whether the new team—and its publisher—can recognise the game’s shortcomings, stabilise its performance, expand its content meaningfully, and rebuild real genuine trust with the community. For now, all we can do is wait and see if they can turn the game into the benchmark city-builder it was meant to be.",

I guess there is a time for everything but I really hope they listen to the community and fix issues the CO couldn't or didn't want to...

The game does remain imperfect, with the occasion visual glitch and very occasional crash depending on the use of mods. Delays in the release of features expected at launch have of course been frustrating.\r\n\r\nCities Skylines II is nevertheless stunning, and now runs relatively smoothly for larger cities. The tonnes of free assets you get with the base game allows for a huge level of diversity in how you build. There is no context in which I would recommend Cities Skylines I over the sequel, albeit if you have a ten year old computer. This is without question now the better game.\r\n\r\nGiven this is the better game, and the rightful positive reputation of the original, it is therefore reasonable to argue that this stunning game itself deserves respect that remains tainted from a dreadful launch and botched first (attempted) DLC launch.\r\n\r\nThat brings me on to the last point, the Ports and Bridges DLC is rich in content with excellent new features.

Not sure if I am totally sold. But it it adds options to how you enjoy the game.\n\nBalance is a bit hard to pin down, lets say the simulation is adequate to the level I have played now.\nLove the bridges, they are not life changing, but having functional bridges is really cool.\n\nI like the whole electricity balancing, it is another level of things you can do and I like playing around with it.\n\nNew info views that explain water, power and goods import and exports are a big improvement, I would like to see some better ones on some of these individual buildings. The static text data is here, but for a power plant for example. How big percentage of total production does it doe, how does it perform over the day and maybe some better explaining how the batteries work. I was just assuming the batteries would drain as soon as demand goes beyond production, but it is apparently a thing that only triggers during emergencies?\n\nSome traffic things felt new, but after fiddling around with it for longer it does feel similar enough and easy enough to get used to the new quirks, traffic is not brainless and the same tricks I used to employ still work. So there is definitely something there.\n\nIn general, I am positive. \n2 Years ago I wanted to just build a new PC to play this game. I bought a new PC recently and played this on that machine. And... There is a great game here, I can feel it. If it stays like this, it is \"good enough\", it is \"fun enough\".\n\nIt runs just good enough to not make me Nauseous, and I mean that seriously, throwing around the camera, gives me a lurch and strain on my eyes and the smoother the camera movement, easier it is for me to digest. This game is not perfectly optimized and even at the current level of fidelity doesn't run super smoothly. And... that is ok enough, I thought it would be super important, but... it is good enough.\n\nI keep coming back to... I want more, want it to be better, but this game is SOO CLOSE.\n\nFor a price I am willing to buy this and give it the benefit of the doubt.\n\nLets make it more solid, this is a 30 euro / dollar game. It is \"better\" in aspects to the first game, everything in life has become more expensive. It is not quite 40 yet and for me to shell out 50 or 60, I really need this performance thing nailed down.

This brought back memories with much more improvements to quality of life compared to the first game (without mods).\n\nTraffic and road management has been vastly improved, with more dynamic pathing (cims no longer just choosing the shortest path), and slip roads, roundabouts, and alleyways making roads flow better too\n\nThe economy system seems to be easier than what i recalled skylines 1 to have, for better or worse. Felt like it was easier to build what you wanted, but also that it was less challenging to build around. I recalled fussing over every inch of road I built and whether I had the right industries plopped in in skylines 1, whereas these are non existent in skylines 2\n\nOn graphics, it looks weird. I'm not sure why. Cars look like they have square wheels, making \"the wheels on the bus go up and down\" literally. I'm using Geforce Now too, so in theory should not have such graphical problems. While immersion breaking, it's not deal breaking I guess.\n\nWith that regard, I do hope the devs continue to focus on helping us build our cities prettier. Gaps between zoned buildings look ugly, Controlling which roads can zone so I zone on my inner roads and not outer roads will make things look more cohesive, and not make every building face the road would be great too! (irl, many buildings have pedestrian plazas around them so they can be angled)\n\nLast but not least, please improve the public transport UI.

The urban social structures behave like you would expect: residential doesn't like pollution, stores produce traffic, etc. But that is mostly stuff that Sim City 2000 figured out how to replicate on a 486 20 years ago. For a format that is as old as a city builder I was expecting it to be more complex under the hood. The UI is clunky and I can never find overlays that give me the information I want without opening multiple screens and searching. The traffic pathfinding is atrocious and pedestrians are absolutely EVERYWHERE. For a town of 20,000 people why are half of them walking down the sidewalk? In my real life town of the same size and I'm lucky to see 50 people walking the sidewalk when I cross the entire town.\r\n\r\nI think the title is better than the 50% rating it is currently at, but not good enough that I want to buy it on sale for $30, let alone pay for the truckload of DLC content. For an established format and a large developer I was expecting a lot more.",

      "review": "A huge step up from the first game.  Almost all gameplay elements are expanded on heavily. However, it is worth noting that traffic is still a huge gameplay element.  Although traffic as been made a lot easier, at least on easy mode, this is impart due to the new road building.  You can now line up new roads by lanes on existing roads, it will even paint the lines and split up traffic properly.  The game also features building upgrades, like Simcity, and mining/exporting of goods.  A whole trading system in fact, you make money on the taxes from the profits unlike Simcity.  All around I do genuinely think this is a better and more playable experience when unmodded then the first.  Some things could be better, i personally was hoping for lane line control and overall more traffic control like when modding the first game.  It also runs fine on my 3070 with no DLSS, overall at medium, no antialiasing.  With all that being said, 49.99 is quite steep, especially with paradox.  After all half the game will inevitably be locked behind dlc, via all new features being locked.  Personally I would probably by it at 35 on sale one day, because I played it during free weekend.",

Buildings\nAdding more types of churches as separate buildings, not attached to cemeteries and adding more iconic world landmarks to the game, would be a nice improvement.\nIt would be great if more sculptures and sports parks were included, similar to the original City Skylines version.\nThe game would look better if each region had more building variety, as it currently feels very monotonous.\nElementary schools are way too small to satisfy the city’s needs and takes up a lot of land.\n3. Textures\nCar textures should be adjusted so that snow doesn’t cover the windows of moving vehicles.\n4.

However, I didn’t encounter any serious bugs, which is a big plus. Overall, it’s a high-quality project that, despite its technical quirks, absolutely deserves attention. 😌",

      "review": "oof... \n\nWell, on that note, if you can't tell by my playtime, I never got into this game, at least not on here. I was there at launch. I was there before launch, really. I have [i]so many[/i] hours put into the original. I even have a whole [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45590199-Linguini%2527s-Library/list/146457/]tab on my curator page[/url] where I highlight and review every bit of content released for it. I'm a huge Cities: Skylines fan. I was counting down the days until this game's release. I have the ultimate edition of this game. I was genuinely excited, and had very little reason to think this wasn't going to match or exceed the quality of the prior game.\n\nWhen I loaded this game up during that launch window I was presented with a slideshow, so I waited...and I waited... To their credit, they [i]did[/i] fix it. I can run the game. Yay! But then there's the [b]other[/b] elephant in the room. [i]Where'd all my stuff go?[/i] When you have everything on offer from CS1, and then you move over to this game you just feel like so much is missing. I'm not talking about the niche offerings like concert venues, managing a hotel chain, or running a stock-market simulator...I'm talking about foundational, basic stuff. It still wasn't there...\n\nSo I waited...and I waited...and here we are all this time later. Only now are a [i]few[/i] of those fundamental things being added. They're the latest additions in a long game of catch-up that the developers had been playing, seemingly since before release. It's really a shame because I've kept up with this stuff, even though I haven't been actively playing. What I see is good, it just wasn't enough to make me want to invest my time in what [i]still[/i] felt like an unfinished game, which is especially unfortunate because there are a lot of cool mechanics that this game has that CS1 doesn't...and yet, I would rather just play CS1 right now.\n\nI was willing to let them cook while I kept consuming the thing I knew and still enjoyed. Now, we come to find that the chef has been replaced and maybe that second course I ordered over [i]two years ago[/i] is finally making it to the pass. The problem is, I don't know if I'm hungry for it anymore. \n\nLook, I wish the studio the best and a really, truly feel for the folks at Colossal Order - particularly the devs who were doing the grunt work all this time who were pigeonholed into these unrealistic timelines in the aforementioned game of catch-up that is this game release. I am forever thankful to the joy and memories that first title provided, and to those folks who put that together and continued to improve it over time. I hope to one day feel that same spirit with this game and thanks towards the former and future devs. In its current state, the game just hasn't won me back yet, and so this has just sat burning a hole in my library.\n\nI've watched who knows how many hours of people playing this game. I can see the vision here. I can see the bones of a good game, and to that point I can't in good conscious say this game is bad. If this was released in a vacuum, we'd all acknowledge the flaws but continue to praise what works about it. It wasn't, though, perhaps that's why we're here today with it being in the state that it is.\n\nSince there is no \"thumbs sideways\" option with these reviews, I'm going to leave this as a thumbs up, but recognize that I might change that in time. It really depends on what happens next with the new team. \n\nIf you are considering buying this game, I would say you should wait until there's a really, [i]really[/i] good sale.\n[b]Do not[/b] pay full price for this game... That said, if you don't own the original, I would rather suggest [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities_Skylines/?curator_clanid=45590199&curator_listid=146457]checking that one out[/url] if it is on sale over this one. You won't get some of the mechanical depth, seasons, etc, but you'll at least get a complete city-builder with a long established community still supporting it via the workshop, etc, to this day...",

      "review": "What to say... what to write... well, let's begin with a basic question that most may have...\n\n\"Is the game functioning, playable, of working order?\" \nTo this I say, yes. Yes, this game manages to deliver most of what it has promised, from a diverse and intricate level of networks baked into every asset, of the game, to highly detailed rendering of.. sims, oddly enough. It manages to deliver a game that is both enjoyable, rewarding, and addictive, though, the shortcomings to manage to appear at quantities deemed unacceptable for a game of such age. \n\nAlthough the game itself, although rough, and requiring some polish, (even after 2 years) manages to deliver a city-builder game unparalleled by any other, it stills fails to reckon with itself to bring detail and true inversion for the end user and player. The networks previously mentioned, although seemingly developed and... present, lack in true nuance, and unfortunately to not take all factors into account with regards to resources and availability. The realism of the game, therefore, is lacking. Although sims go about their daily life in eager bliss, it seems that every day, practically, around half, if not more, of all sims take the day off, or, spend the day shopping, unable to rally themselves to complete an honest days work. It leaves yourself wondering how businesses are able and capable of upholding themselves during such periods of workforce lull! Apologies for the tangent, but the realism is therefore, lacking.\n\nI find that bugs are prevailing as well, in fact, I took a year long hiatus from the game due to a bug present within my hustling bustling city names Ugatis, bless the cities soul, for the postal system managed to become all topsie-turvey due to the establishment of a postage distribution center, not accepting nor distributing any postage, instead halting all postal operations citywide, leading to my sims happiness decreasing by scores. This bug, hopefully fixed, left the game practically unplayable, for citizens were lamenting the lack of services due to this simple error. \n\nAs well, beware of updates. Although mods are present in the game, they continue to find themselves in a developmental 'early access' stage, perpetually plagued by bugs caused from updates, and leading to broken and failed games due to such presets being revoked within your city. Updates are the arch-nemesis of the game, and, although beneficial, mostly, they may only detriment, or wholeheartedly uplift the game to higher degrees, it's a game of chance, honestly.\n\nOne final point, before my tone shifts for the better. development has just been thrown a wrench. Colossal Order, the corporation responsible for the development of the game, has just been removed from participating, continuing, on the game we so love. Instead, Paradox, the publisher, is beholding the reigns to their personal, in-house, and conversely governed studio fully dictated by themselves, leaving the former studio in the dust, and leaving a new studio with the OH SO growing pains inherit to CS2. This studio, we all hope, will provide their resources to the game in positive ways, and will hopefully overcome the shortcomings felt by a restricted Colossal Order, and will provide the game with the attention, and the care it deserves, and that has been promised. Though, scars left from the Kerbal incident most definitely loom over this project as well. \n\nNow, you may be wondering, \"Why in the world did this dude just give a thumbs up to the game when this review is so, absolutely, positively, most ordainly negative review?!?!\" Well, the matter of the fact is, this game has found a place within my heart.\n\nAlthough I may hold resentment and worry towards the bugs, the challenges, the unfinished spectacles, and, most importantly, the future of the game, I feel that for, at least the base game, the experience is worth the price. Although for some, a discount would be desirable, the game manages to provide an experience akin to CSI, if not better. Though some aspects are lacking, the visuals, the gameplay, and the views of the city are unmatched within the industry. Yes, I will admit, I find the shortcomings majorly detractive, I feel that sitting, with a cup of tea, and watching my sims pass through their daily routine will never grow old. If you enjoy the relaxing growth of CSI, CSII bring it to a new level, just with some, other, peculiar challenges, though, with the right mods, the game can be brought to a level even CSI finds difficulty matching. The future, although painted to be bleak, will, hopefully--KNOCK ON WOOD WITH ME HERE--bring around the same levels and quality seen with CSI, though, with bridges and ports recently released, this has yet to be seen.. BUT, for the game that is present, I find it one that can be places within one of my favorites, and something that everyone must try, and formulate their own conclusions upon.\n\nApologies for my horrendous writing, if you made it here.. kudos.",

      "review": "I’m a big fan of Cities skylines games. \n\nYeah, the launch of CS2 was a little bit of a mess. But we know it, after all, CS1 has not been built in a single year, it has been extended many times and developed for several years to offer the experience we know from now on. Besides, we are conscious that the CS games are resources consuming. Simulations, in every way, need big supports and machinery. I play with an RTX 4060, and yes, at the beginning, CS2 was almost unplayable for me. But I’m really glad that they greatly improved the game performances, months after months. Now I can run it with (almost) any glitches. This is an honorable mention.\n\nBut of course, this type of game is heavy, it needs more resources to run and offer a complete experience. I pretend soon to switch to an RTX 5080, mostly because of the game, since I really like the series. Although, the developers are doing their best, this is 2025 and the majority of gaming setups are kinda strong, and yeah, we’re moving forward in computing level. I’m aware this is a sensible topic, as it involves equipment and of course money. I completely understand that some people cannot transit to an expensive setup to be able to run specific games.\n\nWith the recent divorce between Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive, this makes me wonder: why was the launch of CS2 a complete mess? Is this came from the developers studio, or from the editor pressure? My recent experience with Surviving Mars Relaunched highly disappointed me. In my opinion, the expectations for this game were not as great as for CS2, plus, they chose to relaunch a game which already existed and used the same UI and AI than the older one. Moreover, nobody was expected a Surviving Mars relaunch. Still, Paradox transformed it in a truly mercantile trap. The motivation of game editing, and so game developing in the path, becomes more and more each day about greediness, and I think the quality of games is suffering from that.\n\nI’m truly sad Colossal Order has been stripped of the game development rights. This is their baby and their identity. I’m pretty sure that my game experience on CS1 and CS2 wouldn’t have been so great without them. I hoped, and I knew, that they would have transformed and improved CS2, with the years, to become as great as CS1. Yes, it probably would have required at least 1 more year, but this is not a surprise considering the game genre and the backup of CS1. This should have been expected. Furthermore, just almost 2 years after the CS2 launch (on the 24th precisely), I think the vanilla experience proposed is truly nice.\n\nI loved the dedication they had. We have to say the dev-diary was really well done, and got better months after months. Colossal Order had clearly the will to listen the community and get content creators involved in the game expansion (still I really hope a road tool zoning choice please :P). The city from Sunny Scunny which served in the Bridges & Ports expansion was truly amazing to me and reflects a very goal that the game has reached. I was excited and hopeful to see the game expand more and more and offer additional content and innovations. For the reason that sometimes, when I’m diving back into CS1 again, it feels like CS2 has become so much comfortable and polished.\n\nYes, I’m mostly using the past tense, because I believe without Colossal Order in the development, CS2 will not be the same. Although, it will be an easy task to whoever is running it (Iceflake for now), since Colossal Order did most of the game’s construction and the hardest improvements. It almost feels unfair. I hope I’m wrong, but I wish the two studios the best.",

But I do like that they added some of the mod features from the original like electric roads, water & sewer integrated into roads, & roundabouts, although the roundabout option is limited. It also needs an undo feature, move it & find for assets. I use park gates to create parks throughout my cities and I don't see an option to do that in this version either.

      "review": "Cities Skylines (the first) was a legendary game, which was a solid pickup on sale. Sure, there was a lot of DLC, but the game was good enough on its own to hold its ground. Add a mix of mods in and there is a long lasting game. Cities Skylines 2 however, is simply OK. There are some wonky bugs found in the game, then on the flip side, there are additions to the game. To be honest I want to like it, but it feels like there's no real appeal to this one. \n\nThe [b]gameplay[/b] is okay. The building scheme is not as flexible as the first. CS2 does try to keep that flexibility but the snapping is slightly odd. The camera [b]controls[/b] are all fine and dandy, but the visuals sometimes play some funky tricks depending on how the viewscreen (or camera) is moving. The game progression itself is fine and similar to the first (you know, turn down the services, crank the taxes until they complain, etc...). There is a challenge to it still managing a city, budget, and happiness, though sometimes a little mundane. The small little additions (which feels like the mod community made some serious additions that the first should've had) do give encouraging hope that the game is really trying to be a solid successor. There is more to manage and the city does feel like it is more impacted by real life events. The wind blows in a certain direction - directing smog. Natural disasters can occur. Supply of goods (such as electricity) can be traded. These are all welcomed additions to the game - that again - feel like should've been included in the first. However sour I am about it, I am still glad it was included in CS2. \n\nThe [b]graphics and visuals[/b] make a solid attempt to be more realistic than the first. At that expense, it seems the game's stability has suffered a bit. The game at times can certainly look stunning, then move the camera a bit and the screen looks like its seizing up. Maybe its an effect? Maybe its just part of the game, who knows? Regardless, the effort is there to make the city a little more immersive (and fun to watch) than the first. The [b]sounds and music[/b] are a lot better in this one. A lot more can be heard, the music is nice and soothing, and again, an effort was made to immerse the player further into the game. Although the effort was made, it still does fall short from really hitting home. \n\nSo why the negative review? I can't buy it being sold at the price its being asked. I can't see myself even getting it for a sale for 25% off. I'm appreciative at having the chance to try the game, but I personally don't think it's worth the asking price. The game is still quite wonky - especially as the city grows and it just doesn't have a sequel feeling to it. There are certain additions which are certainly appreciated, but again, I can't wrap my head around the price of the game - especially during waiting periods of waiting to collect money to continue to play the game. Small adjustments like being able to change directions of single lanes isn't possible, and the traffic AI intelligence doesn't still seem to path find properly. Another - why isn't there a super speed to pass the time? I'd like to say I played this game fully for those hours posted, but that would be a lie. \n\nAgain - I wish I could recommend this as the first was amazing. This, this is just another city builder. Would've also loved to see some multiplayer feature. Build on the same map in different spots and connect cities? \n\n\n[h1]RATING: 7.5/10[/h1]\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[td]Gameplay[/td]\n[td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Story / Campaign[/td]\n[td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Visuals / User Interface[/td]\n[td]B-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Sounds / Music[/td]\n[td]B-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Replay-ability[/td]\n[td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td]Overall [/td]\n[td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]",

      "review": "A Glimpse of the Future, Running on Hardware from the Future\n\nReview:\n\nThere is a fine line between \"ambitious\" and \"hubristic,\" and Cities: Skylines II has built a beautiful, eight-lane superhighway directly over that line... which promptly leads to a 15-frame-per-second traffic jam.\n\nAs the heir apparent to the undisputed champion of modern city-builders, CS:II had one job: to be CS:I but bigger, deeper, and better. It is, unequivocally, bigger. The \"deeper\" and \"better\" parts, however, seem tobe stuck in simulation-limbo, still waiting for a patch to load.\n\nThe Performance: A PowerPoint Presentation with Good Intentions\nLet's address the elephant in the room—an elephant so large it has tanked the entire city's performance. This game is not \"unoptimized\" in the way we've come to expect. It is a work of technical audacity. It seems to believe that every player is running a dual-CPU quantum supercomputer cooled by liquid nitrogen.\n\nMy rig, which can comfortably render parallel universes in other AAA titles, sputters, chokes, and begs for mercy at the mere sight of a medium-sized suburb. We were promised a deep simulation; what we received is the world's most demanding slideshow. The game is meticulously simulating the dental records of every citizen, the thread count of their bedsheets, and the existential dread of their cat, all while forgetting that the player needs to be able to move the camera smoothly.\n\nThe \"Deep\" Simulation: A Puddle Pretending to be an Ocean\nThe core promise was a revolutionary economic and citizen AI. We were told every \"cim\" would live a \"full life.\" This, it turnses out, is technically true. They are born, they get a job (which they may or may not drive to), they mysteriously generate wealth despite the entire city's economy being on fire, and then they require a hearse... which may or may not arrive before the next ice age.\n\nThe economy is a baffling magic show. Industries demand workers, but no one wants to work. You import... something... and export... something else... and your bank account either swells to the size of a small nation's GDP or collapses instantly. It's less \"complex economic simulation\" and more \"pulling a lever on a very confusing slot machine.\" And the new land value mechanic? A fantastic way to ensure your entire population becomes homeless millionaires overnight.\n\nThe Foundation Is Here (The Rest Is Sold Separately)\nMake no mistake, the bones of a masterpiece are here. The new road tools are (mostly) a dream. The scale is breathtaking. The potential for creation is vast.\n\nBut that's the key word: potential.\n\nThis feels like a game built for its next five years of DLC. So many features that were refined to perfection in the original—advanced transit management, specific industry controls, even basic landscaping props—are either missing, broken, or simplified to the point of being abstract art. It's a magnificent, sprawling, half-empty canvas.\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nCities: Skylines II is not a bad game. It is a fantastic game that is trapped inside an unfinished, unoptimized, and frankly, baffling piece of software. It is a blueprint for a 10/10 sequel that was shipped as a 5/10 reality.\n\nIt has successfully captured the feeling of being a real-life city mayor: you have grand, beautiful plans, but you're constantly fighting a broken infrastructure, a nonsensical budget, and a population that seems to be operating on a different plane of existence.\n\nIt’s an investment in a future promise, not a finished product. We were sold a metropolis; we received a construction site with a fantastic parking lot.",

      "review": "Iv'e put a couple of hundred hours into the game and after finally getting what I paid for 2 years after launch, I hate to write this review. This game has been an roller coaster of emotions. I like the base game and it does show potential, but two years later the base problems still show.\r\n\r\nNEGITIVES-\r\n1. The performance issues are still here after two full years. Currently my system has issues playing when cities start to get larger. I play with a pretty new system: Ryzen 9 9500x3D / 64GB DRR5 / 3090 (I've also tried it with a 5080) and the game still struggles. I can't picture what the performance issues are like with people who run this game on less powerful hardware. It really makes this game less accessible for most people which is what made Cities 1 great.\r\n\r\n2. The lack of content/communication with the overall player base is pretty disappointing. I've tried to give the devs a overall pass on it, but I'm really just getting sick of the lack of communication. Not just on Steam, but all their social media platforms. Its not easy to really know what is going on with the game unless you are in the know.\r\n\r\n3. The Paradox Mod launcher is a joke. The Paradox Mod launcher is semi functional half the time and refuses to load some texture on OFFICIAL PACKS they decided to launch in the mod launcher instead of just launching it from the Steam Store as a free dlc. (Personal opinion, I believe they done this to make it easier on the eventual console release. However if they can't get this game running on current hardware, idk how they will attempted to do it on already 5 year old consoles) I want to defend this launcher cause it will be nice for console player to have access to mods, but at this point they should have just gave us access to the Steam Workshop at this point instead of this forever beta launcher.\r\n\r\n4. Bugs bugs and more bugs. The amount of bug that linger in this game after two years is almost incredible. Currently idk if the homeless bug is still in the game, but I am pretty sure it's there. If I went through a describe every single bug in the current build, this review would be massive. Its gotten so bad, I honestly don't know if the info the game gives me is correct. How can I fix something with my city if the game is giving me incorrect or inaccurate info.\r\n\r\n5. Lack of content. After two years we finally get our first major DLC Bridges and Ports. While this DLC adds a lot of content, we are still miles away from what Cities Skylines was during the first two years. While they have been trying to improve on adding more content, its going to be a while before we see anything. Its been two year and we still don't have bikes in the base game. While the dev's said they have been working on it I personally believe we are still a while off from bikes being added to the game, maybe in 2026.(I know they said late 2025, but I can't trust them anymore on that promise with the amount of delays). Another thing I just thought of is why are districts less detailed in their policies over Cities 1? We did get a lot of policies from DLC but we still got a lot for the base game. Hell I have more fingers on my hands than policies in this game.\r\n\r\n\r\nPositives-\r\n1.Road building tool is nice compared to Cities 1. While this can be fixed with mods in Cities Skylines, I personally don't like playing with mods and I want to keep things as vanilla as possible. \r\n\r\n2. The overall style they went with in this game is nice compared to the more ruff style of Cities 1. Its got a mix of Sim City design combined with a more grounded look and I personally like it.\r\n\r\n3. The amount of zoning styles are good and provide players a good amount of options for how they would like to build. \r\n\r\n4. The increase map size is a huge plus for allowing mega sprawl. Cities Skylines was pretty limited on the size of its map and the limit they imposed on how many tiles you can own and this became a larger problem later on when DLC got larger. \r\n\r\nOverall I'm going to keep a eye on the game and see how it improves over time, but for know I think I will limit myself on this game and avoid buying any DLC till they fix performance and the lack of base content for start. If you want to play a good city builder. I would advise picking up Cities Skylines and all of its DLC's over the past 10 year at a discount when they are on sale. \r\n\r\nI do want to make my self clear about my personal opinion of the dev's, I know they are trying their best to make this game what they wish it could have been and I wish them all the best in that regard. If anyone is to blame for this game being the way it is, its Paradox Interactive. I've been playing Paradox games since 2013 and they started to go downhill back from 2019-2020, while they are trying to improve they are  still reason why this game launched the way it did. \r\n\r\nAs a side note: When this game did launch it did make Paradox reevaluate other games before they launch. Prison Architect 2 is the best example of this and If you are interested in that, I would recommend checking it out.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall I give Cities Skylines 2 a 4/10. The only time I would buy this game at its current state is doing a Steam Sale for 70% off",

Basically the game looks great and allows you to build detailed  and complex infrastructure. The regional packs, unlike the DLCs, offer generally good looking buildings and are free. However, the game has one big issue that makes it unplayable after your city will grow a bit. The devs wanted to simulate every citizen and their dog in the game, with name, family relations, address, work place, commute routes etc., etc. While this might sound good on paper, it makes the game come to a halt when the city population grows to a substantial number. No matter what commercially available CPU you have, it will happen sooner or later. Forget about building anything larger than a small town or filling the map. The problem could be fixed by allowing us to build decorative, unpopulated buildings or by changing the crazy level of simulation that nobody needs in a city builder, but the team is busy throwing up expensive and unnecessary expansions packs instead of making the game work. There might be mods out there fixing this issue, but I still cannot recommend a game that doesn't work \"out of the box\".",

Honestly from what i saw on this patch 1 day before release i thought it was finished not in some shitty alpha development. If this game ever changes i may consider changing this review and yes ill still play it for now but DONT BUY THIS GAME FOR NOW and GIVE ATLEAST A YEAR LONGER. i loved this game when it released and want to play more of it but not in this state. not in the state id expect an indie game be in.

The conditions are that you have the patience of a senior monk and the fortitude to manage modding to the point where the game is playable.\n\nThe game has been plagued with publisher/sharehold greed, bouth through forcing timelines and developer mismanagement. They outsourced many systems, and most of those systems released with the game in a terrible state or not at all. Unity in particular failed to deliver tools CO was going to use to build the Asset Editor, which led to what will be a nearly 2 year delay before we will even see a beta version. \n\nCS2 released in a state that was poorly optimized in general, but has seen some improvements. You definitely still need a powerful PC to run this, and an even better one to build a city beyond 250k pop. \n\nAs of writing this, news just broke that CO is handing development over to Iceflake Studios, a small PDX developer with a portfolio consisting of mobile slop. This is not promising, and is likely PDX moving the game onto life-support. It's likely that some of CO will stay on to help onboard the new studio for at least a little while, or even move to Iceflake. Iceflake currently has several core development team positions open, including one titled \"GAME DESIGNER\" to work on citybuilder and management games, with a deep understanding of management game mechanics and knack for balancing game economies and simulations. They're also looking for people to fill a position called \"SIMULATION PROGRAMMER.\" These job openings tell me they currently don't have the needed specialist game devs to work on CS2.\n\nAs for the game itself, The vision was grand, the improvements to tools and updated visuals were promising. The content came very late. Free content creator packs kept it going for a while until they delivered the first major dlc 2 years late. Modders did what they could to get it into a playable state, but the lack of asset editor crippled the community. The Ports and Bridges DLC has definitely breathed some new life into the game, and bicycle infrastructure is due in an update in 2 days. There's currently a crippling traffic bug that causes Cims to visit commercial properties at an insane rate, leading to intense traffic. The economy and jobs are not consistent, indicating bugs.\n\nOnly get this game if you want to take a risk on the new studio in the coming years, or have faith that modders and content creators will fix the game enough and provide enough new buildings without having to fight hard against whatever updates the new devs might push.",

The traffic is a pain to manage and the game often picks a nonsensical lane layout for them. Even with the \"perk\" for street upgrades, there are still strange lane choices the engine makes that the TM:PE mod allowed players to resolve. Roundabouts were a great new idea, but the lane layout issues kill them in high traffic areas.\n\nPedestrian traffic feels like late game Stellaris populations... in the sense that they seem to kill late game more than any possible crisis due to the lag and other issues they cause. There is no clean way to build pedestrian bridges, and they have the traffic intelligence of a blind 2 year old on the side of a highway. Pedestrian crossings and jaywalking have caused a garbage truck to take over an hour to get from one side of the city to the other. A real life hour. At max game speed. With despawning traffic. Some intersections were lucky to have 1-2 cars make it through if pedestrian traffic was bad enough. I also am running a 7950x, 64GB RAM @ 6000mhz, and a 4090, with an NVMe drive for the game. I would think that setup would handle Ultra settings just fine. Guess not.\n\nAlso, echoing the other reviewers - it's a Paradox game. If you expect them to be kind to players with the DLC model and pricing, lower your expectations. In fact just take your expectations behind the chemical shed and put two through them. It's a kinder fate. We're not in the golden age of gaming anymore. Companies put profits above players now.\n\nAt least I got to try it during the free weekend. So there's that.",

I know there are mods, but this feels like something that should be part of the base game.

No city in the world does that.\n- Building grids are still on a bidimensional square, because real world has no irregular buildings that match a road curve or a non-straight junction.\n- It reuses the same stupid \"district painting\" mechanic, which was a patch C:S did to allow for DLCs that the game engine couldn't support otherwise.\n- The european theme is proof enough no Colossal Order employee has ever stepped on this continent, nor checked any picture online. The buildings could only be more american if they had the flag waving in the porch and kids shooting cans in the backyard.\n- The best part of any non-american city, you know, what they call \"the old town\"? Yeah, we don't do that here. Not happening in this game, not without 10 years of modders bypassing every single part of its engine.\n\nThis game is like Cities: Skylines 1, but with worse graphics (unless you have a beast of a PC) and proper road junction mechanics.

The game is generic. While it looks better, it has no character every city ends up looking the same as the last, even with things like detailer patches. The tools feel like one step forward, five steps back. You get line tools, parallel road tools, grid tools, and “intuitive” road mechanics… yet somehow, it still falls flat and shotty.\n\nZones break, even on perfectly straight roads. Road tools that are there like stopping left turns would be great, if cims actually followed them. The only two I can’t complain about are line tools and parallel roads out of all of it, those are the only tools you can’t mess up, basically the only reason i cant complain about them.\n\nThen there’s the biggest problem: performance. Unless everything is on low, even an upper average PC struggles to break 30 FPS in a small city of 10k. It arguably runs worse than the first game. Supposedly it runs worse because the simulation is better, but that “better” only works if you don’t look too closely at the holes.\n\nEven after all these years, this isn’t the Cyberpunk 2077 story of a broken on launch but fixed and beloved. It’s one of those broken games that never became what was promised and died in cold blood.\n\nFor context, the first game still has a bigger daily player base on Steam, not counting the console players still running their cities in CS1 because they cant play the second game.\n\nThis game sums up the era of bad sequels broken piles of trash. It lives a little higher but still right alongside Kerbal Space Program 2, Prison Architect 2, and the only thing that sets this game above those is the fact its not totally abandoned.\n\nI love Cities, but please stick to CS1 and its mods. I did, I made a modpack (CS1 Redux: The Remastered Cities Experience) and after this weekend, I’m at the point of pushing my hope for this sequel off a cliff and sticking with my better made and modded CS1.\n\nThanks for reading, and please don’t buy this if you want the best city builder.

      "review": "I played Cities: Skylines 2 during the recent free weekend — and long story short, I can’t recommend it in its current state.\n\nFor the past two years, I’ve been on the fence about buying it. I’m a huge Cities: Skylines 1 fan, but after seeing the dumpster fire that was CS2’s launch, I decided to hold off — and thank god I did. The free weekend confirmed what I suspected: this game wasn’t ready for release two years ago, and it’s still not ready now.\n\nThe game runs like a potato. Objects and textures often don’t render properly. I don’t have a high-end PC, but I can run CS1 just fine. The whole point of CS2 was to bring us a smoother, better-optimized version of CS1 — but right now it feels like it’s either horribly optimized or built for PCs from the future. Either way, it completely misses the mark.\n\nI didn’t play long enough to dive deep into the gameplay, but here are my quick likes and dislikes:\n\n👍 Likes:\n- The road-building tools are fantastic. I’m really glad they integrated these mods from CS1.\n- I like that you can choose the building theme (US or EU) without needing mods or custom assets.\n- The radio and Cim conversations are actually pretty charming — it adds a nice bit of life to the city.\n\n👎 Dislikes:\n- I can’t stress enough how much I hate the grid system. It feels outdated. I’ve been playing city builders since SimCity 3000, and it’s wild that in 2025, a major studio still can’t come up with a more flexible, realistic system. Manor Lords, an indie project, nailed it — so why can’t the “city-building experts” at CO?\n- Starting a small village and being forced to place massive landfills and cemeteries that take up half the town makes zero sense.\n- While I loved the new road tools, I hated that building a T-shaped roundabout deletes nearby houses — and if a road is too close to a building (like my giant cemetery), the game just refuses to place the roundabout because it needs more grid space.\n- I chose the EU Mediterranean theme, which looks great, but when I zoned 5x5, the game only spawned 2x2 or 3x3 buildings — leaving weird empty gaps. If that’s intentional, the game should at least explain it.\n\nAfter a few hours, I just didn’t feel like continuing. I’ve had way more fun playing Manor Lords for half the price — and that game admits it’s in early access. CS2, on the other hand, pretends to be a finished, full-price game when it’s clearly not.\n\nAt this pace, it’ll probably take another 5–6 years before CS2 feels worth its asking price — and by then, there’ll likely be better city builders out there. So my advice? Don’t buy into this. Don’t reward this kind of shady release strategy. Save your money and wait for a proper game — or a miracle patch.",

I held off for a while because of all the negativity around it, but decided to give it a shot during the free weekend (08/11/25). Honestly, I wish I hadn’t bothered downloading it.\n\nEven though the game looks visually stunning compared to vanilla CS1, the performance is shockingly bad even on a high-spec machine. The frame rate tanks everywhere, including the main menu, and the poor optimization completely ruins the experience.\n\nI’ll be upfront: I didn’t play long, as my short playtime shows, so I can’t fairly comment on the mechanics, simulation depth, grind, or monetization. But from everything I’ve read and now seen firsthand, the criticism seems justified.\n\nConclusion: Don’t waste your time, even during a free weekend or a sale. The negativity around this title isn’t exaggerated. There’s obvious potential here, but sadly, it feels like a failed title that I doubt will ever reach its full potential. A real shame.",

And now, after bike patch, my game started to be unplayable. Bikers destroyed traffic in my city, even if I banned them from some streets. Generally, traffic in this game is awfull, you can't do normal pedestrian underpass or bridge, as they need extremely large space and don't fit anywhere. For a long time, a hesitate to rate this game, because first C:S is one of the best games I ever played. But this is hell, sorry.",

No lag. No apparent problem. Nothing. My city wasn't even big. Load up the game. My city is gone. Why is this game 40$ when it's identical to the previous game, and just closes up. The game does not even autosave.",

If i was a new player, i would wait another year (Q3 2026) to see how the developtment is going.",
