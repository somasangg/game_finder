      "review": "Playing this after WWE 2K22, I have to say — it’s still the best one in the series. I’ve enjoyed WWE 2K24 and WWE 2K25 very much, However there are still dispite it going in the right direction ,still many flaws and outdated gameplay:\r\n\r\n✅ The Good:\r\n\r\n- Chain wrestling makes a return.\r\n- Massive roster.\r\n- New hairstyles in the Creation Suite (especially happy they brought back some older ones).\r\n- Graphics are really solid.\r\n- The AI is a lot smarter now — they actually complete taunts before going for moves, etc.\r\n- New game modes have been added and are a nice touch.\r\n\r\n❌ The Bad:\r\n\r\n- The Island content is limited to \"next-gen\" consoles — PC is next-gen too!\r\n\r\n- Creation Suite limitations:\r\nI’m pleading with 2K — please overhaul this mode. It’s extremely outdated, especially with the face scans and morphs. We need: More customization options, More hairstyles, More clothing options for female wrestlers, Fixes for attire parts that glitch based on hairstyles, Ability to customize in-game characters (hair, makeup, face paint, lip gloss, eyelashes, eyes, body morphs, etc.), This is such a core part of the game, and it’s overwhelmingly disappointing that after four games, there’s still no major improvement.\r\n\r\n- Universe Mode:\r\nWhat have the developers done here? Respectfully — it’s a mess. I want to build rivalries, pick actions, and shape stories. Instead, it’s repetitive, copy-paste matches with no triple-threat rivalries. Royal Rumble rivalries feel flat. They have all the tools to make this the best mode in the game — even better than Showcase. I want to feel like I’m running the company: booking surprise returns, hearing commentary react to comebacks or injuries. Please bring back custom promos — make them interactive! It doesn’t need voice acting, just immersion. You can do it, 2K. I believe in you.\r\n\r\n- MyFaction:\r\nTerrible. Full stop. Locked behind paywalls for “persona cards” that take forever to earn. It’s boring and pointless. We all wanted Road to WrestleMania (RTWM) — instead, we got this. Get rid of it. If you want monetization, just do a £10 battle pass for cosmetics — not this grindfest.\r\n\r\n- Showcase:\r\nIt’s okay. I’m a hardcore women’s wrestling fan (as you can tell from my Creation Suite rant), but that one random ladder match for MITB? Easily the worst Showcase match. Not terrible overall, but please — more women’s matches next time.\r\n\r\n- The Island (again):\r\nOh wait… we can’t even play it on PC. If you’re advertising a “new mode,” there should be a price difference if we can’t access it. I’ve watched gameplay and reviews — doesn’t look like we missed much though.\r\n\r\n- MyRise:\r\nFirst year I didn’t finish it. I just don’t like intergender wrestling — not because of the gender dynamic, but because it doesn’t happen in WWE now. Instead of two separate stories, they merged them lazily.\r\nHere’s an idea, 2K: stop releasing yearly games and actually spend time making something inventive.\r\n\r\n- AI improvements to matches and gameplay:\r\nManagers are hopeless at supporting during matches. Please amend the rope-break animations so the referee can always see them, and stop the referee from colliding with a wrestler’s head during pin counts — the ref should get there in time to make the count. Make managers interfere more dynamically: have them interact with each other, perform shady actions at ringside, and play believable win/lose reactions (e.g., an animation of disbelief when their wrestler loses a pin). In the Royal Rumble, members of the same faction shouldn’t be constantly attacking each other — they’re stablemates, not random opponents. Add more betrayals in Universe Mode (or at least give the option for storyline betrayals). Make Money in the Bank cash-ins more meaningful and better utilized by the AI. For example, with the AI scaled to high, I played the same match 10 times and the MITB briefcase holder only managed a successful cash-in on the 9th attempt. Please think more carefully about AI behaviour and match intent, 2K — come on.\r\n\r\n💡 Recommendations for the Next Game:\r\n\r\n- Creation Suite Overhaul: More hairstyles, makeup, clothes, attire pieces, customizable morphs, and body templates. Let us edit in-game superstars (hair, makeup, etc.).\r\n\r\n- Universe Mode: Needs a massive overhaul.\r\n\r\n- Create-a-Finisher: Please bring this back — it was so much fun!\r\n\r\n- Create-a-Story: Another immersive fan-favourite that should return.\r\n\r\n- RTWM: Bring it back — and get rid of MyFaction.\r\n\r\n- Separate Women’s and Men’s Showcases: Appease both fan bases.\r\n\r\n- Legends Contracts: Keep them active! If Kelly Kelly or Torrie Wilson aren’t in the next game, I’ll riot (kidding… mostly). Also bring back Jazz, Luna Vachon, Ivory, Retro Molly Holly, Retro Lita, Retro Trish, and AJ Lee.",

It's fun with friends, but beyond that, it's really not that entertaining.\n\nThe thing that absolutely sucks is the amount of characters that are locked from the start. If you want to play with friends, I'll remind you that there are only about 10-15 wrestlers that are actually good to choose from unless you get bundles or play through matches/showcases.\n\nGame looks.. decent. Animations are weird, they always suddenly cut into them and it never looks natural. Showcases are okay and the career is.. whatever.\n\nPrice is a big no-no and I can only recommend it if it's on sale and you have a couple of friends to play with.",

      "review": "Overall, an improvement on 2k24. Many positives added to improve the overall loop and speed everything up. And boy is the game faster. Matches feel faster, the game runs smoother and overall there is just more excitement to go around. I found the story mode to be a vast improvement to the 2k24 story, though maybe not as wild as the 2k23 story we were treated to. The showcase mode is actually one of the weaker ones with tons of content locked behind RNG heavy objectives that force you into a very grindy gameplay loop with the hopes of completing the objective. I gave up finishing this mode when they hid an unlock behind an objective to force 4 seperate characters to bleed in a match. Bleeding is a very RNG heavy mechanic and only happens with damage to the head so.... Not particularly fun to play honestly. The GM is there... I actually haven't played that mode yet. I know they added CM punk as a GM and a bunch of other variety characters there but... I just don't care about that. Universe mode is overall better, the promo feature is cool but unfortunately very very limited. Some things were improved but mostly more of the same of what we had last time. Finally, the card game mode or \"MyFaction\" is considerably improved upon from the previous game but still feels like an unneeded edition to an otherwise content filled game. I understand the need to want a live service model in a modern game but maybe just like... release skin packs instead of hiding them behind a still incredibly grindy game mode that is not particularly skill based and is also itself cluttered with like 5 different play modes like towers, and weekly challenges, and a roguelike mode, and a pvp mode. Not to mention the games actual PVP mode. basically MyFaction doesn't seem like it's needed in these games anymore. Finally, the PC version not recieving \"The Island\" game mode is a little disappointing. The growing issues between PC and console trying to coexist in this new era of crossplay are more apparent here then in most other places. A HUGE selling point of this game is just not available to a quarter of the games player base and that is a letdown. Overall, the game, at its base, is fine. a slight improvement in the core gameplay loop to the previous game. The new match types are cool, the updated roster is fine, and the character creator is ok. If I gave the previous game a 5/10, this game is a solid 5.5. \r\n\r\nA final note. With all 5(6) Dlc packs now out, a moment to reflect on those.\r\nUnfortunately, this game has the WORST DLC lineup amongst all the games. While Abyss and the Great Khali are welcome editions, the average wrestling fan does not give a crap about KSI in a prime bottle, Shaq or the disaster that was the Kevin Scott fiasco. Also, while the first DLC pack had plenty of women, the rest of the DLC was incredibly lacking in womens wrestlers. A huge letdown. NXT felt completely ignored in the DLC. and in general, the DLC for this game does not feel like it was made with the modern wrestling landscape in mind what so ever. No Joe Hendry? No Rusev? No Rey Fenix? Anyway, there's my gripe on the mess that was the DLC. \r\n\r\nPurchase 2k25 on sale if you want. at this point, with 2k26 only a few months from being announced, it may be best to hope that the next game in the series addresses the biggest issues this game brought about. One thing for sure, 2k26 will finally feature an update to WWE's roster to cut the dozen's of wrestlers no longer on contract like Indi Hartwell and Tegan Nox.",

The roster is stacked and feels alive thanks to strong presentation and entrances, and the gameplay finally threads the needle between sim weight and pick-up-and-play fun. Strikes feel crisp, grapples have satisfying snap, and reversal timing rewards practice without punishing newcomers.\n\nI do have one wish: please don’t sunset the online servers a year in. This entry deserves a long tail. Keep building on this foundation—tuning balance, adding match types, and supporting community creations—and 2K can keep the momentum rolling.\n\nVerdict: Best Showcase to date, amazing roster depth, and great in-ring feel. If 2K keeps supporting it, this could be the era-defining WWE game.",

First things first, these 2k games will never beat the old school wwe games like I mean cmon new graphics and new wrestlers give me a break who you kidding. Now what I love is that finally we can move freely around the arena and the entrances and getting real close up we can see the wrestlers getting more bruised, sweaty, and injured, thats dope. Lots of new matches and old ones, good good. Now these games always seem to remove features from the last game, why you keep doing that 2k? The entrance pyros are broken now, you have to time it just right for them to go off where you placed them. When will we get to upload videos and custom music for our caw entrances, CMON!??? 20 man battle royale?

The only caviot is that when I started playing this game, there were many cool generic entrance videos with matching barricade/ring and over head (forgot technical term for the mini strip movie) which were erased and the videos were moved to a terrible create a video menu. Some parts such as the spiky backwards hat I really liked is only available on female character thus preventing me from making a male lookalike twin for the character in question and cannot get the victory motion they show at the end of myrise when playing as mutiny member. Other than these caviots, I love the game for its great visuals, gameplay, story, and enough room to let ones creativity go wild and come to digital life! I highly recommend this game and hope that if a 2k26 is made, that they could forgo the create a video and put some generic options for entrance movies like the one they call traditional, stars, and voyager movies they had before moving them to create a video in this game.

Not just because I love gaming, but because WWE has always been my life, my dream, my fire.\r\n\r\nWhen WWE 2K25 first released, I couldn’t afford it. I watched gameplay videos, trailers, and fan reactions every night before bed. I used to imagine myself playing it, hearing the crowd cheer as my created superstar walked down the ramp. But reality hit — my wallet was empty.\r\n\r\nStill, I never gave up. I kept saving. And one day, when the Steam sale arrived, I finally bought it.\r\nThat moment — clicking “Purchase” — felt like winning a championship belt. I smiled so wide that day, not because of the game itself, but because it represented something bigger. It was a small victory for the kid who never stopped dreaming.\r\n\r\nBut this story goes deeper than a game.\r\nA few months ago, I had a terrible accident that tore the ligament in my left shoulder. I had to go through three surgeries just to fix it. Before that, I was actually training hard to become a real wrestler. I even sent my body pictures to a wrestling community, and they told me I had potential — that I could really join the WWE someday.\r\n\r\nI was so close.\r\nThey told me the only challenge was getting from Bangladesh to the USA. I was already thinking about how to make it happen — planning, preparing, dreaming. Then the accident came out of nowhere and destroyed everything I had worked for. The pain wasn’t just physical; it was emotional. I cried so many nights thinking about how I lost my chance because of something I couldn’t control.\r\n\r\nFor a while, I thought it was over. That maybe I was never meant to live that dream.\r\n\r\nBut then, I started playing WWE 2K25.\r\nAnd something changed inside me.\r\n\r\nEvery time I play, every time I hear the crowd roar, every time my character wins a match — I feel alive again. I feel like I’m in that ring for real. The graphics, the entrances, the movement, the commentary — it all feels so real that it brings me peace. I can close my eyes and imagine myself under those bright lights, raising my arm in victory again.\r\n\r\nThis game isn’t just entertainment for me. It’s a second chance — a way to keep my passion burning until I’m ready to step into the ring again in real life.\r\n\r\nBecause yes, I’m still recovering. My shoulder is healing. I’m getting stronger every day. And deep down, I still believe that one day, I’ll stand inside a WWE ring — for real this time.\r\n\r\nI don’t know what the future holds. Maybe I’ll make it, maybe I won’t. But one thing is for sure — I’ll never stop fighting.\r\n\r\nWWE 2K25 reminded me that the fire in my heart didn’t die — it was just waiting for a comeback.\r\n\r\nSo yeah… this isn’t just a review from a gamer.\r\nThis is a message from someone who lost everything, but found hope again through the thing they love most.\r\n\r\nThank you, WWE 2K25.\r\nYou gave me back a piece of my dream. ❤️\r\n <3",

Honestly, one of the least buggy and better developed 2K wrestling games (probably the best so far), considering the level of customization and the ammount of content in it. If you're a WWE fan or you simply enjoy a custom wrestling experience, I totally recommend this one.\n\nBAD things are the obvious ones... pretty much same ideas and problems from the previous 2K games, except this one's less buggy. However, the game focuses too much on graphics and too little on improving or inovating the main mechanics: weird reversals, weirder submission and pinfall mechanics, and overall weird model behavior (like objects getting stuck or characters not going exactly where you want them to). Difficulty tweaking may help fix most of the experience, but don't expect anything too different or mind blowing compared to the previous 2K releases. And, as always, online multiplayer is kinda laggy and few people play (plus who TF said timing mechanics was good for this game's online mode!?).\n\nSo... I DO recommend this game, out of all other 2K games. Be aware, tho, that you'll need MORE than the minimum requirements to properly run it.

      "review": "[h1] Things Need to Change [/h1]\n\nIf your're looking for improved game play then you'll get it here but, it's nothing major. You'll see more visual damage on wrestlers throughout the match and the chain wrestling is a nice addition but, it's not worth up for. I have played WWE games for over 20 years and understand the lack of major changes to the core game is normal for a few years so I'm not expecting that. \n\nThe issue is that the rest of the game doesn't feel any better. The universe mode is in need of a major change but, that didn't happen this year. The GM Mode they brought back in 23 still feels underwhelming. The MyRise is too difficult to play because the storyline is so horrible. The Smackdown vs Raw games had the right idea with allowing you to play as different wrestlers for a career mode. This one just feels like a waste of time. \n\nThe Showcase mode is easily the worse one of them all. The matches from the Samoan Bloodline weren't picked well. They missed out on an opportunity to have The Rock vs Brock Lesnar or Roman Reigns vs Brock Lesnar (The biggest feud of Reigns career). This is easily the most uninteresting Showcase of the WWE 2k series. \n\nI have major issues with this game as far unlockables. We used to be able to pay for everything unlocked. Now while I don't agree with charging fans for unlocks, I don't mind paying extra for it. Too many wrestlers are locked to MyFaction and MyRise. To unlock 2015 Randy Orton and Scott Steiner, you are forced to play through career mode. For certain wrestlers, you need to play through career mode twice. How is that fair? Why force that on players? \n\nThey recently brought John Cena 03 and modern Brock Lesnar back through \"Farewell Tour\" DLC. This was not worth the extra $15. I really wanted to play as Brock Lesnar again and so I picked this up. Brock Lesnar didn't come with wrestling attire and I had to download a community an attire from Community Creations. \n\nI even tried MyFation this year and unlocked 2010 John Cena and he didn't come with in ring attire either. I used the extra MyFaction points I got from the Bloodline Edition to get him and felt like I got ripped off. I hate this mode and I tried to push through to unlock things but, I stoppped because it's too much of a grind. They put retro AJ Styles on there but, I wasn't going to play for hours to unlock him and I already paid over $100 for the game so I didn't feel like paying extra. \n\nFor the first time ever, I bought some VC points to try and unlock Booker T 01. He's been a MyFaction exclusive for years. I will never buy VC points or touch this MyFaction mode ever again. It feels like a cheap mobile game and isn't fun at all. Some people wanted \"The Island\" on PC. The console version of the game made Goldberg an exclusive to that mode? So even if we did have access to \"The Island\" we'd have to grind through that mode to unlock him. \n\nThings have got ridiculous and I regret purchasing this game. Is the core game solid? Yes. Can you still have fun with it? Sure. I still can't recommend it because aside from locking wrestlers to these cheap modes, the overall game doesn't do anything special.",

      "review": "Overall, this game is pretty good, and to me it's the best wrestling game I've played in a while. I'm only able to compare it to 2k19 and 2k23, but it's good enough to get me to keep coming back and playing. I still wouldn't rank it above classic games or FirePro, but for a modern WWE game, it's not too bad with the exception of what must be a bug with Windows 11.\r\n\r\nI don't recommend the game on Windows 11 until a fix is available. Based on my research, this bug has been present since around the time of launch. What makes it frustrating is that consistently almost 15% of the time I launch the game, it completely freezes my computer. None of the tricks recommended have worked. For a while, I was able to press the windows key and eventually bring the game back up, but the freezing still occurs albeit on a possibly less frequent basis. I haven't played any other game that will force me to perform a hard reboot on my PC.\r\n\r\nI would buy this on sale, but I strongly recommend not buying it until the bug is fixed.\r\n\r\nRegarding the gameplay and everything else:\r\n\r\nI've loved wrestling games for my whole life. I feel like there still isn't anything comparable to the golden age of games on the n64 or ps2. I'm relatively new to the 2K series and disliked the last two games I played - 2k19 and 2k23. I think the controls in 19 were very foreign to me, and in 23 what really stood out was the roster and music plus the still confusing controls. For 25, the controls feel a bit more familiar and easier to pick up and play. That said, it is still difficult to get timing down on reversals and play on harder difficulties. This never felt like a problem in the Smackdown or even Smackdown vs Raw games where I would play on the highest difficulties as well as normal. \r\n\r\nSomething that stood out to me here was the story. It definitely felt better than in the other two 2K games I played. I thought myRise was fun, but it ended so soon. I also thought the twist in it was unexpected and kinda ruined my perception of the CAWs I made. It was surprising that I had to make two CAWs for the story mode, but that wasn't a problem as I generally make at least three CAWs each game. I would have liked a more open story mode or an option to do different things each time I replayed it. I don't plan on replaying this story mode and find it lacking.\r\n\r\nI don't like Showcase and generally don't play these modes where you are forced to be a specific superstar. I played a few but found it not that fun.\r\n\r\nI love the online creator suite and have enjoyed adding CAWs and brands into my Universe, but as others have mentioned, the PC is not currently considered a current gen system which is incredibly stupid. The steam release should definitely have access to the same content consoles have.\r\n\r\nGM mode was great. I loved being able to play as a brand and compete against friends. It's cool having a draft, and I wish this was in Universe. I think I would like a few more options to tweak budgets and contracts more. It can be pretty hard to move into a new year when talent leaves. I've caught the booking bug as a result of this and am looking forward to trying the other Steam booking games.\r\n\r\nI'm basically only playing Universe. It's fun to have your own shows and run everything simming and playing matches as you go. The biggest complaint I have is that I wish we could have away to have tournaments in the mode without having to have King of the Ring PLEs. It was hard at first to get used to the calendar and schedule events, but I recommend spending hours and removing all lives and PLEs and then making your own. It would be helpful to also have an easier way to copy match cards to other lives as the default is generally a few singles and tag matches, and this makes it rather cumbersome to make hardcore PLEs and lives.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely a barebones review, but I wanted to explain a few areas I like and dislike while calling attention to the buggy state of the game on PC.",

Bring back all the stars in one game rather than money grabbing with DLC's and removing stars and forcing people to just create their own. I'm talking Nation of Domination, Owen Hart, DX, classic Kane, Sting, Nature Boy Rick Flair, The Four Horsemen, APA, The Brood, The Giant (known as Big Show), the Bushwhackers, GOLDBERG and the list goes on. I understand that some stars are signed to other brands and some have passed on, but bring them back! If you're worried about roster space, STOP MAKING REPLICAS OF THE SAME STARS! We have like 5 John Cena's! This has been done for the last few years where you release every type of the same guy/gal imaginable. This adds nothing to the game. \r\n\r\nThe GM mode is just mindless match making. I have no idea who my number 1 contenders are or if certain superstars have faced off against each other. I have to keep a manual record of this. Not to mention, where's the Royal Rumble? Why can I not have a season of WCW shows where I can book each main event at the start of the season? Why am I limited? The \"promo's\" are just lame. Why can't I have a promo where one superstar wants to start a tag team with another or break up a tag team? This mode feels so lifeless.",

      "review": "This game is worse than the last one. The roster is the biggest and most locked behind paywalls and grindwalls. You go to play, and three-quarters of the fighter selection consists of question marks and grayed-out names, and you can only chose some modern, uninteresting wrestlers. All the legends are hidden behind the grindwall. SuperCharger DLC for unlock real wrestlers without grinding, overpriced as hell. The showcase is lazy and boring, there aren't even traditional cutscenes leading up to the fight—what a shame?! They obviously decided not to invest in this mode. The console and PC versions are separated by functionality! The Island mode is unavailable on PC, without which you can't get about 80 wrestlers, including Goldberg and Bella! Are you seriously doing this in 2025?? The graphics are worse than they were in 2024! The wrestlers look like rubber dolls; it's a huge downgrade, especially when compared side by side with the last game. That awful patchy hair again, like a PlayStation 3 game!  How can you release something like this in 2025? Can't you see what games look like now? Some fighters from the previous game were removed for some reason, like modern-day Steve Austin, who had a really cool skin in 2024. Why did they remove him? The improvements are very few and have little impact. They added an optional third-person mode, which is fun to play with, but it's inconvenient to use constantly due to the changing controls. Updated blood effects? Blood is completely unnecessary in this game; it looks out of place. Wrestlers now don't bleed like in the 1990s. The most they get is a little blood in the mouth from a split lip or minor abrasions. If the developers had done the same, it would have been much more realistic than those ridiculous gallons of blood all over the head and half the body. Those bloody streams on women look especially stupid. So I just turn off the blood. The updated bruises on the body also look unrealistic. Usually, wrestlers only get red spots on their bodies, not those maroon streaks all over, like they've been hit by a truck. Chain wrestling looks funny, but only the first time, and then it starts to get annoying, disrupting the dynamics of the fight. That minigame with finding a point and waiting for the red circle to fill is very long. The only interesting improvement is intergender matches, but that's not enough to justify the cost of the entire game. This could easily be added with a patch or a mod to any game in the series. This game is very disappointing to me; it feels like that failure that happened between 2k19 and 2k20. Unless 2k changes the engine, I will never buy another game in this series. I've had enough.\nThe myfaction mode is especially terrible. It's the height of stupidity. This idiotic management of colorful cards, all sorts of points, power-ups, and perks. Meanwhile, you're forced to play with weak bronze cards, with ridiculously understated fighters who choke after a couple of steps or a few hits, or get knocked out by one simple move. You get 150-180 points in a single match, while the prices in the store are incredibly high, reaching hundreds of thousands. Grinding is everywhere in this game; it's so intense that it practically should be FTP. I bought this game to play a couple of matches with my favorite characters from the 1990s and 2000s in the evening after work, but they're all locked behind a grindwall. Unlocking one legendary character costs 1000 points, a 5-star match gives no more than 225 points, and such a match lasts about 20 minutes. So, you need five 20-minute matches to unlock a single fighter, like Shawn Michaels. But I can't spend two hours a day on this game to unlock the fighters I want to play. And to avoid that, they're asking me to pay $15 for an unlocker. I'm not interested in all these modern nobodies who call themselves superstars; I want to play as real superstars like Kane, Holywood Hogan, Batista, Bret Hart etc. And they're forcing me to spend time or extra money to get what I originally bought the game for. And they're so lazy that they haven't even updated their game in years. Just look at FIFA now, and your pathetic game with its rag-like hair.",

I’ve bought every release, supported the game through all the ups and downs, and hoped each new entry would finally show that 2K listens to its community. But WWE 2K25 has proven that they absolutely don’t.\n\nLet’s start with the most frustrating part — the pricing and DLC situation. I purchased one of the most expensive bundles, thinking it would come with everything. For that kind of price, it should. But somehow, 2K still expects us to pay extra for DLC packs that are either delayed, incomplete, or split across different platforms. Console players get more content and certain perks, while others are left wondering why they paid the same (or more) for less.\n\nIt’s honestly insulting. Every year, 2K claims they “listen to the fans,” but the product says otherwise. Fans have been crystal clear about what we want: fair pricing, complete editions that actually include all future DLC, better communication about what’s included, and genuine gameplay improvements. Instead, we get the same recycled talking points and half-promises that never amount to anything.\n\nThe worst part is how tone-deaf the marketing has become. They hype up “loyalty rewards” and “special editions,” but it all feels like smoke and mirrors when the people who spend the most money still don’t get the full experience. There’s no consistency, no respect for long-time supporters, and no sense that 2K understands what makes this community passionate in the first place.\n\nGameplay-wise, sure, it’s fine. The core wrestling mechanics are serviceable, but after years of minimal innovation, it feels stagnant. The flashy trailers and minor tweaks don’t change the fact that this series has lost its soul. Instead of focusing on the player experience, it’s all about how much more they can charge us for things that used to come standard.",

      "review": "[h1] Things Need to Change [/h1]\n\nIf your're looking for improved game play then you'll get it here but, it's nothing major. You'll see more visual damage on wrestlers throughout the match and the chain wrestling is a nice addition but, it's not worth up for. I have played WWE games for over 20 years and understand the lack of major changes to the core game is normal for a few years so I'm not expecting that. \n\nThe issue is that the rest of the game doesn't feel any better. The universe mode is in need of a major change but, that didn't happen this year. The GM Mode they brought back in 23 still feels underwhelming. The MyRise is too difficult to play because the storyline is so horrible. The Smackdown vs Raw games had the right idea with allowing you to play as different wrestlers for a career mode. This one just feels like a waste of time. \n\nThe Showcase mode is easily the worse one of them all. The matches from the Samoan Bloodline weren't picked well. They missed out on an opportunity to have The Rock vs Brock Lesnar or Roman Reigns vs Brock Lesnar (The biggest feud of Reigns career). This is easily the most uninteresting Showcase of the WWE 2k series. \n\nI have major issues with this game as far unlockables. We used to be able to pay for everything unlocked. Now while I don't agree with charging fans for unlocks, I don't mind paying extra for it. Too many wrestlers are locked to MyFaction and MyRise. To unlock 2015 Randy Orton and Scott Steiner, you are forced to play through career mode. For certain wrestlers, you need to play through career mode twice. How is that fair? Why force that on players? \n\nThey recently brought John Cena 03 and modern Brock Lesnar back through \"Farewell Tour\" DLC. This was not worth the extra $15. I really wanted to play as Brock Lesnar again and so I picked this up. Brock Lesnar didn't come with wrestling attire and I had to download a community an attire from Community Creations. \n\nI even tried MyFation this year and unlocked 2010 John Cena and he didn't come with in ring attire either. I used the extra MyFaction points I got from the Bloodline Edition to get him and felt like I got ripped off. I hate this mode and I tried to push through to unlock things but, I stoppped because it's too much of a grind. They put retro AJ Styles on there but, I wasn't going to play for hours to unlock him and I already paid over $100 for the game so I didn't feel like paying extra. \n\nFor the first time ever, I bought some VC points to try and unlock Booker T 01. He's been a MyFaction exclusive for years. I will never buy VC points or touch this MyFaction mode ever again. It feels like a cheap mobile game and isn't fun at all. Some people wanted \"The Island\" on PC. The console version of the game made Goldberg an exclusive to that mode? So even if we did have access to \"The Island\" we'd have to grind through that mode to unlock him. \n\nThings have got ridiculous and I regret purchasing this game. Is the core game solid? Yes. Can you still have fun with it? Sure. I still can't recommend it because aside from locking wrestlers to these cheap modes, the overall game doesn't do anything special.",

      "review": "Overall, this game is pretty good, and to me it's the best wrestling game I've played in a while. I'm only able to compare it to 2k19 and 2k23, but it's good enough to get me to keep coming back and playing. I still wouldn't rank it above classic games or FirePro, but for a modern WWE game, it's not too bad with the exception of what must be a bug with Windows 11.\r\n\r\nI don't recommend the game on Windows 11 until a fix is available. Based on my research, this bug has been present since around the time of launch. What makes it frustrating is that consistently almost 15% of the time I launch the game, it completely freezes my computer. None of the tricks recommended have worked. For a while, I was able to press the windows key and eventually bring the game back up, but the freezing still occurs albeit on a possibly less frequent basis. I haven't played any other game that will force me to perform a hard reboot on my PC.\r\n\r\nI would buy this on sale, but I strongly recommend not buying it until the bug is fixed.\r\n\r\nRegarding the gameplay and everything else:\r\n\r\nI've loved wrestling games for my whole life. I feel like there still isn't anything comparable to the golden age of games on the n64 or ps2. I'm relatively new to the 2K series and disliked the last two games I played - 2k19 and 2k23. I think the controls in 19 were very foreign to me, and in 23 what really stood out was the roster and music plus the still confusing controls. For 25, the controls feel a bit more familiar and easier to pick up and play. That said, it is still difficult to get timing down on reversals and play on harder difficulties. This never felt like a problem in the Smackdown or even Smackdown vs Raw games where I would play on the highest difficulties as well as normal. \r\n\r\nSomething that stood out to me here was the story. It definitely felt better than in the other two 2K games I played. I thought myRise was fun, but it ended so soon. I also thought the twist in it was unexpected and kinda ruined my perception of the CAWs I made. It was surprising that I had to make two CAWs for the story mode, but that wasn't a problem as I generally make at least three CAWs each game. I would have liked a more open story mode or an option to do different things each time I replayed it. I don't plan on replaying this story mode and find it lacking.\r\n\r\nI don't like Showcase and generally don't play these modes where you are forced to be a specific superstar. I played a few but found it not that fun.\r\n\r\nI love the online creator suite and have enjoyed adding CAWs and brands into my Universe, but as others have mentioned, the PC is not currently considered a current gen system which is incredibly stupid. The steam release should definitely have access to the same content consoles have.\r\n\r\nGM mode was great. I loved being able to play as a brand and compete against friends. It's cool having a draft, and I wish this was in Universe. I think I would like a few more options to tweak budgets and contracts more. It can be pretty hard to move into a new year when talent leaves. I've caught the booking bug as a result of this and am looking forward to trying the other Steam booking games.\r\n\r\nI'm basically only playing Universe. It's fun to have your own shows and run everything simming and playing matches as you go. The biggest complaint I have is that I wish we could have away to have tournaments in the mode without having to have King of the Ring PLEs. It was hard at first to get used to the calendar and schedule events, but I recommend spending hours and removing all lives and PLEs and then making your own. It would be helpful to also have an easier way to copy match cards to other lives as the default is generally a few singles and tag matches, and this makes it rather cumbersome to make hardcore PLEs and lives.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely a barebones review, but I wanted to explain a few areas I like and dislike while calling attention to the buggy state of the game on PC.",

      "review": "Review of WWE 2K25 – What’s Good and What’s Not\r\n\r\nI've got sufficient time with WWE 2K25 on Steam to actually have a real opinion, and I've got to say this game is a weird blend of fun and outright frustration. On the fly it looks smooth, the presentation pops visually, and where everything comes together just right, it actually feels as though you are part of a WWE match. When you get past the surface and are spending time with a host of modes though, the flaws become evident all around you, at least on PC.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, the gameplay, because that’s the foundation of any wrestling game. Mechanically, it’s good. Animations are neater than years ago, strikes have a nice impact, and the timing of bouts feels more like you’d see on TV. Chain grapples chain together smoothly, reversals are quick, and at a casual level you can grab and go. But the AI this year is flat-out busted at times. They reverse nearly every grapple you attempt and try, and it doesn’t feel like masterful counter-wrestling, it feels like cheap scripting. You can whip the hell out of them for a good solid 15 minutes or however long and they still kick out at two like they just got off the bus at ringside. There’s no realism or balance to it and it kills the momentum. What should be dramatic near-falls become frustration because you know they are going to kick out no matter what. Difficulty needs to be earned and not rammed through via unfair mechanisms.\r\n\r\nMy other big letdown has been with MyRise mode. Always a high point of the series, build a character, progress through story modes, see how your decisions impact your career. But with 2K25 it seems trimmed back and dull. Cutscenes play through themselves much too quick, the branches of lore are not especially significant, and the sheer amount of material is much less with 2K25 compared with older games. It feels a step back and not a step forward. After a few hours I found myself tired of it and not eagerly looking forward to continuing. For a mode intended to keep you hooked long-term, that’s a big problem.\r\n\r\nOn top of everything else, being a PC player this year has felt like punishment. The Island mode, one of the biggest and most hyped new features, isn’t even an option through Steam. We pay console price and receive a console experience. We don’t receive the full package. It makes the whole version of the game a “last-gen port” and thus an improper release. All of that from one absent feature has the capacity to enrage some and honestly, I don’t fault them. And then consider that the Community Creations are locked off as well, so we can’t download the same custom wrestlers and arenas as console fans and it just makes the PC one seem second class. For a franchise that survives off of customization, it’s a setback.\r\n\r\nAnd then there’s stability. I’ve played through a number of crashes during games, and a couple of times the game has frozen my entire system and forced a reboot. In Windows 11, and especially since the 24H2 update, this seems like a common problem. It’s bad enough experiencing bugs while you are just playing the game, but having the game cause issues with your entire PC system is unacceptable. And don’t even get me started on Universe mode. Save resets, messed-up data, and shows malfunctioning are still part of the mix. It has a lot of promise as a mode, yet it always seems half-broken.\r\n\r\nMicrotransactions are also an unsightly part of the package. Accessing wrestlers, attire, or indeed basic customization items requires either grinding forever or paying more. I am okay with downloadable content as a choice if it adds seriously new content, but gating so much behind either out-of-control grind or additional payment just feels greedy. When you also consider that MyRise is shallow, it makes grinding all the more meaningless.\r\n\r\nNow, I don't mean this as a complete rant because you know what, I actually do feel that there are certain things about WWE 2K25 that are laudable. Graphics are good, entrances are great, and commentary, though still repetitive, has gotten better. With friends and especially with couch or with friends you know online, it's still a blast. It still has the magic of creating ridiculous custom fighters and sticking them in goofy stipulation matches. If you are strictly interested in the in-ring action and you don't mind about progression and lacking features and modes, it can still manage a good time. And that's the salvation of the game, it still feels like WWE at its core.\r\n\r\nBut the problem is everything peripheral to that core feels rushed out or half-finished at least on Steam. We are missing features, the AI is spotty rather than demanding, MyRise feels sparse compared to prior years, and stability at best. Console enthusiasts might be able to declare this one’s the best 2K game of years, but as a PC gamer, I am unable to say the same. It’s not that the player cannot play the game, hardly. It’s that it feels incomplete and somewhat disrespectful as a PC gaming release.",

Understand this, when you are getting a new character in a DLC, and then for some reason they cannot bring him, then they should replace is fast with a new character. They announced Aleister black and I was fine with it, but then they added black to another dlc pack, not as part of DLC1 and gave another persona of chad gable.. even that without a proper menu render. \n\nIt feels so fishy and wrong. Also, as PC is supposedly a last gen in their dictionary, you don't get to have access to CAWs on the latest consoles. I found whatever I could, but the quality of CAWs in 24 was 10x better because of this issue. \n\nA complete game mode, it doesn't matter if the mode is good or bad, was not served to pc gamers, and no replacement for that either. \n\nI made me regret purchasing deadman edition on full price. And I can't deal with such business practices, they don't deserve their game to be sold at full price, only on sale and a year later, that way even those numbers don't show up in their financial record on that very year, maybe then they will learn to not be arrogant and ignore the customer base.",
