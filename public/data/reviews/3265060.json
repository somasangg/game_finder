Would be great if there were some randomizing.\nThe difficulty increase doesn't feel as rewarding as it is in similar games such as Hades.  \nMediocre translation job, localization to English could use some work.\n\nOverall: 7/10",

      "review": "Tl;dr: Touhou Dystopian is a very good and cheap hack and slash that you should buy.\n\nI'm going to start off this review of Touhou Dystopian with the few negatives it has. First of all, there's nothing particularly special or out there compared to other hack and slashes or character action games, it's fairly simple. No tricks or extremely long, flashy combos you can pull off here. \nIt also doesn't have the best performance, I experienced many frame drops during the levels. Not enough to ruin the game, but it was still a disappointment.\nFollowing the performance, it has a \"standard good\" anime look in that it's more of a stylistic look. Which is more of a continuation of the frame drops con since I don't think there's anything in the game that should really warrant the performance taking a hit.\nFinally, there were some bugs that I think got fixed, but a particularly nasty one was when I messed up the timing for my dodge, I got hit, and I lost control of my character until I dashed again. Very bad bug.\n\nWith that out of the way, I can now sing the high praise I have for this game (and review).\nTouhou Dystopian is a roguelike/lite hack and slash, meaning almost all of the time you spend in this game is spent on gameplay. It's a Touhou game that focuses on gameplay. This in turn means you won't get much of the characters' personalities, something the Touhou fanbase loves to play around with. So let's move onto the gameplay since there's not much in the story/character department.\nIn Touhou Dystopian, you select 1 of 4 playable chars (Youmu, Flandre, Mokou, and Marisa) potentially take 1 of 4 companions (Koishi, Meiling, Reisen, and Reimu) to go through 3 levels of trash mobs into the next boss, which there are 9 of (Hina, Aya, Suwako, Cirno, Alice, Yuyuko, Patchouli, Sakuya, and Remilia). All of their difference movesets with different unique talents.\nNaturally as a roguelike, you have to unlock the other characters, companions, and upgrades. This brings us to the core gameplay loop, you pick a char (Youmu at the start) and you enter the game, you beat up some what appears to be plushies (no joke about the appearance) fight the boss, hopefully beat the boss, get dolls, and upgrade your char, rinse and repeat 9 times. The more bosses you beat, the more dolls you get that then unlock the features of the game. If you beat all 9 bosses, you can \"release seal\" which means higher difficulties.\nThe controls are pretty good and responsive. there's only slight button memory, so you won't have it remember input from 5 seconds (cough Dark Souls cough). The dash/dodge to proc the perfect dodge works as one expects, even allowing you to dodge into attacks that completely whiffed you since the bullets are still active hitboxes.\nThe playstyles are pretty fun between all of them, usually it's 2 main ones (meaning most of the upgrades buff \"intended\" attacks) with 1 or 2 sub playstyles (meaning on only a few upgrades to buff certain attacks).\nThe content is certainly not the most jam packed, it ran me about 10+ hours to unlock everything and 100% achievement the game. So, it's instead highly replayable thanks to the randomness and the fact that runs are pretty short, ranging from sub 20 minutes to 40 minutes or so. Only an Extreme Misfortune (the shrine is an unlock that lets you give buffs to you or the enemy) or no upgrades might make it last longer than that.\n\nSo what's its main strength? Well, like many good Touhou games, it's not that any particularly one part of the game is strong or mind-blowing, it's that almost all of the aspects are executed good. So if you like hack and slashes and/or roguelike/lites, I'd heavily recommend it. It's $10 which I believe is way underselling. If you truly are on the fence, give the demo a whirl, it even lets you keep some stuff you unlock there!",

I don't honestly know much about Touhou, but I've enjoyed my time in the setting despite having no background knowledge.\r\n\r\nMy biggest gripe with the game is that the pacing is really fast. You basically fight 3 short waves of enemies (usually less than a minute each) and then fight a boss for a few minutes. While there are many stages and bosses in a full run, I don't really feel the value of a lot of combat-changing upgrades since non-boss enemies usually die too quickly and boss enemies don't really give you many opportunities to get the most out of upgrades which give you new types of combo-extending attacks (due to hyper armor, etc.). I haven't played the final difficulty mode, so maybe the pacing makes more sense there and non-boss fight feels a bit more engaging, but it hasn't for the difficulties that I've played on so far. \r\n\r\nStill, I can't wait to see how the game grows as more content gets added in. And even if fights are pretty brief, they're fun for what they are.",

For the majority of the time it is interesting seeing what kind of builds you can make. \r\n\r\nThat is, until you start getting really into it, The main problem however is that it lacks the variety and interest of a rougelike. If there was a greater focus on the boss fights or more variety of the skills, that could be a huge improvement. The biggest issue is that for each unique skill the skill trees end up being quite shallow and you usually just do your best to recreate the same broken build every run. This is compounded with the fact that every boss and every level is exactly the same each run. You always know that you're going to get Suwako's damage check, you always know the world and dracula cradle are going to be a problem if you don't have stamina, everyone opens with the exact same attack first every time. \r\n\r\n8/12",

I love how fast-paced gameplay is, enter a room with enemies > get new perk > repeat and fight a boss every 4th floor. The Touhou theme is very loved here with the nice models, music, and attacks that fit each character. Each playable character is fun to play and not too hard to understand.\n\nMy only real complaint (which may be a positive to others) is that the permanent upgrades can turn the game into a cakewalk even on the hardest difficulty, bosses can also be a bit spongy on higher difficulties.

After 3 major bosses are dead you complete the game and unlock a new difficulty. Then you spend the currencies you earned during the run for new unlocks and you repeat that until you clear all difficulties and unlock all the stuff.\r\nNow this simple loop doesn't mean the game is bad. Quite the opposite actually - the combat is absolutely fantastic, it's meaty and crunchy, all the explosion effects and sounds combine together just right to make the hits feal heavy and inpactful.\r\nThe semi-random build making for each character feels very good as well, after a while you start noticing all the small design decisions for each character that works perfectly with certain abilities and you really start cranking up some insanely min-maxed builds.\r\nThe music is pretty good too, obviously all of the tracks are arranges of classic ZUN themes, bunch of them are really good, some are just ok but I don't think there is a single bad one\r\nStory is... a bit dumb but overall it's completely in the background and doesn't take away from the experience of just beating stuff up.\r\nMy biggest complain would be that after a while it gets a bit annoying that all bosses are always in the same order and all inbetween stages are packed with same types of enemies, a bit more randomness in that regard would be welcome, maybe some sort of endless mode where bosses and stages are randomized and you are just trying to go as far as possible. Mind you just because the encounters are non-random doesn't mean they ever get dull or easy, combat is always fun, but more unpredictability would be welcome.\r\nOverall - in my opinion in videogames gameplay is king and this is extremely gameplay-dense videogame. If you don't care about story and just want game with cute 2hus beating each other up this one is really good in that aspect, highly recommended.",

What you will get is a pretty nice controlling action game to waste some hours in, with a nice Touhou paint (the reason why most people will be interested).\n\nThe relatively low content offering (as of release) and the lack of real depth to any of the systems apart from the rogue-like randomizations make it hard to justify going back to it after so many playthroughs - an issue which a great deal of games in the rogue-like genre tend to fall into.\n\nThat doesn't mean you won't get any enjoyment out of it, because you definitely will. The game has a decent amount of polish and hitting things can be VERY satisfying (Flan or Mokou being the best examples imo). Just know what you're getting yourself into, and temper your expectations going in. You're getting a great game for the price.",
