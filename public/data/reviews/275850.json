      "review": "After spending hundreds of hours roaming the stars on console and now diving back in on PC, it's hard not to appreciate just how far No Man’s Sky has come. What started as an ambitious, if uneven, or some might say \"Abomination\" (I'm not kidding), spacefaring experiment has steadily evolved into one of the most rewarding and generosity-driven games out there. \n\nNow, returning to it feels a bit like coming home to a universe that’s grown up in all the right ways. and the credit goes straight to the team at Hello Games. Few developers commit to a vision as passionately as they have. Update after update—all free, mind you—they’ve expanded this universe with new mechanics, new modes, new stories, and new ways to play. Base building, living ships, deep-sea exploration, space expeditions, VR support… the list is long enough to feel like several new games stacked inside one. It’s rare to see a studio not only stick to its promise but overshoot it by a galaxy and a half.\n\nAfter all this years, the game still nails that feeling of stepping onto an untouched planet, hearing the low hum of alien winds, and thinking \"Alright, what’s out there this time?\"\n\nNow, the ecosystems feel richer, the colors more vibrant, and the handcrafted chaos of procedural generation somehow more believable than ever. Well, sometimes it throws out the odd weird planet that looks like someone dropped watercolor paint on a golf ball. But those quirks are easy to forgive when the universe is this massive, this welcoming, and this lovingly supported. Whether you're mining resources, uncovering ancient mysteries, or simply taking your starship for a joyride through a nebula, the game radiates a quiet magic.\n\nIn the end, No Man’s Sky is more than a comeback story—it’s a long-term commitment to players, a testament to how a game can grow when its developers believe in it wholeheartedly. And after spending so many hours across two platforms, I can confidently say this: there’s never been a better time to step into the stars.",

There are so many custom ships, freighters and now you can build your ship with pieces and parts you find and people have made some amazing ships.\nAnd while you can play solo or co op with your friends, the game makes it really easy to simply turn off seeing others, or pvp entirely. Oh, and just about all the creatures you encounter can be tamed and \"stored\" for safety. There's ways to hatch new combos or maybe you just want a paradise planet to do some quiet fishing on, its all possible now. You want to explore haunted freighters, looting precious cargo, this game can kinda turn into a tiny bit of dead space. I don't enjoy haunted anythings but NMS lets you put on brave pants and give it a go!\nThe only thing I wish they'd change is the price of the game.

HOWEVER, what is different now is that while yes it is still largely a cycle of go place, see similar stuff, leave, they've crammed quite simply a ridiculous amount of shit AROUND that loop. \r\n\r\nWhat's different on its face is that the game is a lot better at teaching you how it works, keeping you moving on purpose instead of \"uh idk man just keep warping\". \r\n\r\nLike yeah, once you see about 10 planets you've seen 90% of What It Is. You still mostly just point lasers at rocks and... that, a lot, but they just managed to make that more fun. \r\n\r\nIt's a vibe. You put on the music you point some lasers, you do one of a trillion missions that lead to all sorts of weird places, and... there's so much. \r\n\r\nOverall I think it's not ever going to be the world's best video game, but after like 10 years of new stuff being piled on top of the original hot mess, it's a good time.

I'm in, more so since it still stands out from many of the 'CoD In Space' games out there, for all its warts.\r\n\r\nIt's a good time to get in on the game if you've also held off. I've enjoyed not only building an absolute wreck of a rust bucket that smokes and probably rattles like hell through space to live out my solo submarine/Red Dwarf smuggler enjoyment off of, but also truly enjoyed the main storyline and late game content there. There's a fun, glitchy story in there, and it's a pretty one.

I very much enjoyed it, pockling around a few planets, talking to the different aliens, and exploring, quite aimlessly, what the game had to offer.  It was very quickly apparent that there wasn't an awful lot of game here.  It was exploration for the sake of moving on to the next planet.  Which honestly, I was fine with, even if many felt they had been misled by the developer's promises.  But I also felt done after about 10 hours.  It felt like I had seen everything I wanted to.\n\nNine years later I picked the game up again, and there was a lot more structure and drive.  There wa always something to do, in a way that there just wasn't before.  I've played about 80 hours since, and enjoyed it greatly.  The story was interesting, contemplative, and fit the game play loop very well.  With the content has come more shaving off of the edges, the content is smoother and more streamlined.  I've seen many more planets than my first playthrough...but I haven't felt that same sense of wonder from pure exploration.  For many this trade off will be more than worth it, even if it gives me a lingering sense of what might have been, had the worlds been a little more like the covers of the old sci-fi novels, rather than the same building and three species (which is explained in the story, but still glaring in a near infinite universe).\n\nAll in all, a very enjoyable experience.  The developers should be commended for their dedication to the game and releasing so many updates since launch.",

      "review": "It started as a void. A promise whispered into the static that broke upon arrival. But what followed is perhaps the greatest comeback story in the history of this medium. Where others would have abandoned the ship or sold the wreckage for parts, Sean Murray and Hello Games went silent. Not to hide, but to work. For years, they have been delivering massive, transformative expansions - all free of charge. In an era of aggressive monetization and unfinished \"live services,\" this level of integrity feels almost alien. It is a labor of love that borders on obsession. They didn’t just fix the game; they expanded the definition of what it could be.\n\nInside the simulation, the experience evokes a specific kind of loneliness - not the scary kind, but the clear, cold isolation of a deep diver. You are a speck of dust in a procedural engine, chasing signals across an infinite canvas. Visually, it oscillates between pulp sci-fi covers of the 70s and a modern screen-saver dream. It is beautiful, vast, and occasionally, oppressively empty.\n\nThe gameplay loop is hypnotic: mine, build, fly, repeat. It scratches the itch for order in chaos. However, the mask of the procedural generation eventually slips. After the hundredth [well, it depends] planet, you start seeing the patterns in the matrix, and the wonder fades into a comfortable routine. It is not a perfect universe; the combat often feels weightless, and the infinite breadth sometimes lacks infinite depth. But as a testament to developer loyalty and a sandbox for the mind, it is unparalleled.\n\nRecommended for those who respect the craft of world-building and find peace in the hum of a hyperdrive.\n\n[spoiler]16 // 16[/spoiler] 9/10",

The game was completely bug ridden, the infinite planets full of life turned out to be half broken, empty worlds, and everything looked well, pretty ugly. It felt like the whole vision collapsed under its own ambition. And yet despite the reviews, despite the backlash, despite everyone calling it dead Hello Games didn’t give up. That’s something you almost never see in this industry. They could’ve walked away, but instead they rebuilt the game piece by piece. Today, No Man’s Sky is almost unrecognizable. Worlds actually feel alive now, with ecosystems that breathe and move. The game gets fair, meaningful updates all the time. Everything looks polished, vibrant, and full of detail. They keep improving things, fixing old systems, reworking mechanics, and constantly adding new content things nobody even expected, and a lot more on top of that. This kind of dedication is extremely rare. It’s honestly one of the most impressive redemption arcs gaming has ever seen.

It's not hard-core so it's perfect to just sit back, relax and wind down after a stressful day. The amount of creativity it offers the player rivals that of games like Minecraft while also innovating and advancing its technology to allow incredibly seamless and immersive space travel and exploration. Bethesda can really learn a thing or two from Hello Games when it comes to space travel.\n\nThe game also offers seamless multiplayer that's integrated into the singleplayer experience so whenever you want to you can go from building your base and relaxing to playing and enjoying thrilling expeditions with your friends or other players. \n\nThe amount of activities you can do from fishing, farming, base building to building custom ships and doing multiplayer space expeditions and fighting space pirates, this game can easily rival some MMO games.\n\nI can talk for hours more about how good this game is and how much it deserves your attention but the best thing i can do is tell you that if you're looking for a game like this with relaxing space travel and survival, do yourself a favor and play No Man's Sky",

However, I wish they applied that same degree of dedication to polishing what they already put out, even if that doesn't result in immediate revenue spikes. This comes in two categories:\n\n1. Content itself. Upon discovering a new space station, of a completely different shape from the first space station I had encountered (COOL!), nothing killed my excitement faster than flying inside and finding a layout IDENTICAL to that of the first station, right down to the locations of crates that you can sometimes loot for a little bit of money. The next space station? The same. Derelict encounters in space? More copy-pasta. I believe this illustrates procedural generation's biggest intrinsic weakness, but it also represents a failure of the dev team to respond accordingly to that weakness by hand-crafting more content. Procedural generation is a tool to enhance the application of creativity to content creation, not a replacement for it. It should be used accordingly.\n\n2. Much of the UI is unintuitive or outright \"weird.\" Having to learn to hold down the mouse button and wait when changing options so that the change would activate before saving (a console/gamepad concession, perhaps, but still weird) was only the beginning.  I encounter various bugs somewhat regularly. Many small details demonstrate an obvious lack of polish. Some mechanics have been broken or rendered obsolete by game updates but not adjusted accordingly. Tutorials or other forms of onboarding are not robust and sometimes out of date. I could go on, but the short of it is that I spent FAR too much of my NMS-playing time with the game minimized and me searching online forums for answers to questions that should have been provided by the game itself.\n\nI played for about 20 hours, and I will say that I enjoyed those hours a great deal, but after taking a month-long break from the game for travel and coming back to its UI warts and overall repetitiveness, I found myself not wanting to play anymore. Perhaps in another five years or so I will give it another go from the beginning, with a brand-new character, if it looks like some of the above issues have been addressed. (6/10)",

E se você tem um hardware muito antigo pode ser que o desempenho seja bom mas, também pode ser que aconteçam alguns bugs gráficos e quedas bruscas de FPS.\n\nSe não fosse por esse problema eu diria que o jogo vale muito a pena mas, não é o caso. É muito decepcionante e irritante ter suas coisas sendo apagadas aleatoriamente pelo jogo. Por esse motivo desinstalei o jogo.",

Multiplayer is janky and trying to link up with friends is a pain, certain structures disappear in my bases, and worst of all, my corvette that I spent three days gathering parts for, building, and decorating was suddenly reset to a default orientation without remedy. I can't recommend this game right now, what with how hard it is to maintain progress due to bugs, but I certainly look forward to updating this review when it is hopefully fixed. Until then, I, personally, will be uninstalling.",

It's kind of aimless.  \n\nMy biggest issue with the game is the general lack of focus on player comfort and UX - it's a lot of form over function.  \n\nThe UI is flashy, clunky, vague, and exhausting to use.  Many item icons are nearly indistinguishable from one another (hope you like spheres).  Crafting by clicking empty slots is a bizarre flow.  Default UI scaling is way too big for a mouse interface.  Has an accessibility options menu, but no way to turn off or even reduce the excessive amount of parallax/motion that occurs when mousing through any menu in the game.  Maximum FOV settable in the menus is still very low even at \"120 degrees\" (horizontal I'm guessing, it's not even close to comfortable in first person).  Defaults to mouse smoothing and motion blur.  \n\nJust really odd and unergonomic design choices anywhere a menu interaction is involved.",

It's like the quote says : As wide as an ocean, as deep as a puddle.\n\nThe core gameplay loop feels insanely repetitive after only a few hours, every space station is the same, every planet has pretty much nothing to do on it except for pre-generated structures, the combat feels super strange and clunky with every single enemy i have met in about 24 hours of gameplay being a small copy and pasted robot, or space pirates where you just hold down left mouse and S to win. Making money is stupidly easy once you get your scanner upgraded and there's no reason to sell anything anymore. I went into the game expecting to make cool planetary mining facilities where i would extract ressources, process them and ship then to space for profit. And sure you can probably do that. But why would i do that if i can just land on a planet, scan a bunch of plants and animals and make hundreds of thousands immediately just because i got lucky and got a good scanner upgrade from a robot?\n\nI'm sure this game has a lot to offer, and i wish i could enjoy it because it initially gripped me immediately during my first few hours, but i feel like it's a game with 15 hours worth of content stretched to 150 hours by bloat and system management. (i literally spent a few hours of my playtime upgrading my inventory because it kept getting full, and it's the same process every single time... dozens of time. either buy it in a space station or do the exact same drop pod repair encounter.)\n\nIn conclusion this is truly a game where you have to find the fun, and it's not directly thrown at you. And while i can respect that, there's just too much repetitiveness in it for me to be able to find the fun for more than a few hours. I truly respect the devs for making an unplayable mess into an actual game that's enjoyed by many today, but it's just really not for me.",

      "review": "There's an overwhelming amount of stuff to do, objectives to complete and places to go, but none of it is truly engaging. So much time is spent in menus, managing currencies. The concept of ultimate freedom in a fully-realized galaxy is appealing, but most of the gameplay revolves around trudging slowly from one map marker to the next. Traversal is slow and boring. It's easy to get stuck somewhere in the middle of random nowhere with no way to refuel or teleport.\n\nThere is no physicality to anything around the player, making everything feel flat and hollow. Combat oscillates between an insurmountable hindrance to blasting away innocent Spore-style creatures. Its procedurally-generated environments feel samey almost immediately, as the creatures, terrain and constructs all just swap out limbs, color palettes and markings. Nothing is truly imposing, unique or memorable. The nonsense words accompanying new discoveries are a reliable source of hilarious double-entendres in other languages (a planet called \"Beans\", a plant named \"Itch\" or a mineral called \"Vomiting\").\n\nCrafting is streamlined fun initially, but gets overly complicated and finicky quickly. Resource and inventory management are a chore, there are too many disparate things, reagents, slots, upgrades and containers. The sense of exploration and discovery of unknown worlds is hampered by existing structures, settlers and generically-themed minimap markers with no discernable coherency. A new planet is littered with random artefacts, buildings, and constructed points of interest, exemplifying the tropes of open-world checklist-led blandness.\n\nThere is no sense of place and mystery, it's all just colorful, haphazard nonsense. The story is a convoluted mess of childish Space Adventure tropes, complete with Star Trek aliens (people wearing spacesuits and rubber masks). The tone is all over the place - a stranded astronaut exploring enigmatic anomalies one moment to rainbow fleets of ships and friendly vendors the next.",

There’s some cool stuff to find, but none of it is worth the time to me.\nHopefully Light No Fire will compel me with different storytelling or a more engaging world, but you can see all of this game in a couple hours and after that it’s just more stuff for the sake of there being more stuff.",

Waste of time. Right now I have 94 hours of gameplay. And honestly, I do not know where most of it went to. I do not feel this as quality time. Almost all time spent on resource grind, parts smelting, FEDEX missions.\n2. Poor game design. Like really poor. I am now on \"base story missions\". And nothing is more frustrating, than to receive techs as rewards... which you had already opened... by collecting numerous tech pods. Either lock these techs , put a note thay can be unlocked lately or lock them to progression tab. OR - compensate the spent nanites / tech units / industry units. I mean nothing is more frustrating you spent 2-3 days for nothing. Same goes to missions. In 100 hours I literally was only in 2 systems and 2 more exploring at the moment,\n3. LORE issues. Have a feeling that text is either not worked on, or promtly translated. A lot of inconsistencies. And after 100 hours of playing I still do not know who are GEKs, Corvax and reptiles. (I got it, use the obelisks, but..)\n4. Another time killer is language. Introduction of translators doesn't help. I feel time is wasted because every time you need to reopen dialog screens. I almost stop reading the texts. Just mechanical - Skip skip skip, Learn Dialect word. Skip skip skip, present. (repeat the number of presents you have). 3-4 language practice skills. So one person - around 30 - 60 second of clicking. Minimum. \n5. I understand freedom, sandbox, all that. But game pace is inconsistent. Because of how the quests are received, you have sometimes some events occuring faster than they should have been if progression was capped. I think Dune is a good example of how things should develop.\n6. Random generated worlds have no .. secrets. No special places to visit. No memories. Look at the screens. That is what you will not see, because you will always moving somewhere for something.\n7. Talking about visuals. I maxed out everything and have nothing even close to screens on quality OLED monitor.I assume the reason is in some issues with HDR processing. I am now considering trying to go either to HDR 200 or evend SDR.\n8. Another mechanics dump is recepies. Yeah, great, we have so many (especially for food, for reasons beyond my understanding). But we do not have normal use of these recepies. Food and basic ingridients are in two different logs. You can't just upload the recipee you want to use, so you need to keep in your head all the steps and ingridients. \n9. Weapon system and tooling.... I really wish it was better than cycling clockwise through available installments. Even having specialized tooling doesn't help. \n10 Exocraft controls.... honestly, this is the huge dissapointment. What somehow works for space (don't expect X / Elite. More like Freelancer game) , completely unusable on the ground. I use all this park just for storage. And I unlocked all exocrafts prior to the questline... Which again a poor game design.\n11. Villages came as dissapointment. Running around to build things, check what can be upgraded. Instead of doing it through the computer? \n\nOnce I wrote about Dune, that instead of game I received work. Well, here it is true as well. Maybe later game will open itself from a better side. I definitely hope so and not going to give up. Maybe even change review. But for now, I have just dissapointments and regret on spent time.",

      "review": "I have given this a lot of thought and I think it's finally time to give this my honest review, but after really REALLY wanting to like this game, I don't think I can recommend it.\n\nNow let me be clear, there are some REALLY amazing parts to this game that I love. For one, the community (in my experience) is extremely positive, generous (go AFK in the anomaly while you eat lunch to see what I mean), and helpful. Easily one of the best communities I've experienced in gaming. The fact that this game is almost 10 years old and still dropping massive free updates is incredible and a testament to the developer's commitment to their community. The worlds (and space) are expansive and beautiful with incredible sense of scale. There are tons of materials to craft with and endless ways to construct a base. Lots of cool ships, tons of cosmetics, etc etc. The experience of discovery early on the game is compelling, too.\n\nUnfortunately for me, it's the cons that drive me away. I bought this game with a friend to play together, as the game claims to be a multi-player co-op. It is not a multi-player co-op. It is a multi-player play-at-the-same-time-but-not-together. Above any other complaint that I might have, this really killed it for me. When you are playing with a friend, you can see each other, but you are playing two different games simultaneously. For instance, they will see an animal you don't see on your screen, they will occasionally have different weather than what you're currently experiencing even though you're standing next to each other, they will be fighting something that to you doesn't even exist or talking to an NPC who is not there to you, or mining resources you can't see. In my opinion, in their quest to make it so others could not affect your personal game, they ruined what could have made this the best multi-player game ever made. After one attempt at trying to play together, we decided instead to play solo, which I did for about two or three weeks straight, and where the rest of my issues come into play.\n\nAside from disappointing multi-player, this game is one of the buggiest games I've ever played to the point where it impacts the fun of the game. One example is I was fighting a sentinel capital ship in space, but whenever I got close enough to get under the shields to make an attack run, the ship would just blink out of existence. However, it was still there, because it was still attacking me. It would then randomly blink back into existence, and I was stuck somehow in the engine of the ship, taking constant damage, being unable to move very much as though I were stuck in the model of the ship. This happened multiple times with multiple sentinel capital ship encounters to the point where I stopped taking these fights altogether because they were so frustrating. I've clipped out of my freighter, I've been randomly launched out of my corvette into deep space, teleporting to a base with a corvette as your main ship places the corvette inside your base somehow making it impossible to move and sometimes forcing you to restart the game. These are a few of the many bugs I encountered, but they're the most frustrating ones. To HG's credit, they are active in addressing bugs, as they release updates fairly frequently, but some of these game breakers should just not exist in a game that's been out this long.\n\nFinally, I think the part that finally made me give up was the monotony. After you've done the same quest or seen the same building or talked to the same NPC enough times, the game becomes very... samey. When I was first beginning, I built a base on every new planet I landed on because holy crap a new planet! But after a while, visiting a new star system I found myself not even compelled to visit any planet at all, let alone establish a base. What was the point? Any resource I needed I could already get. There's no reason to really establish a base anywhere specific aside from mining. There is a wide variety of fauna that varies per planet, but after a while you realize every animal is just a compilation of a few parts and body models that are slapped together and scaled and given a random name, sometimes looking exactly like others on other planets. It kind of kills the immersion when every cave you go into has exactly the same minerals, or every ocean you go into has exactly the same flora. The monotony of opening up the same boxes over and over, going through the excruciatingly painful NPC talking loop, having every archaeological site be exactly the same as the previous one, every building of its type is exactly the same, every sentinel fight is predictably the same, spending vast time and resources on settlements for them to benefit you extremely little, having meaningless NPCs and NPC interactions, having squadrons that do literally nothing but maybe draw aggro in a fight... the list goes on. Additionally, you have a huge planet to explore, but there's nothing really to see once you've landed and explored your general area. Every planet surface is a singular biome (plus ocean and cave), so once you've seen one part of it, you've seen the whole planet. Sure there are points of interest, sure there are loot boxes and hidden treasures everywhere, but there's no real reason to explore the rest of the planet. The minerals, flora, and fauna, which can range from 0 to maybe 20 different instances of each, do not change as you move around the planet, which is catastrophically immersion breaking given how rich in biodiversity one might imagine a planet capable of hosting life to be. It's unfathomable to me how you can create a space game about discovering new planets and have no sense of poles, tropics, different mineral/flora/fauna on different continents or in different parts of the planet. Imagine if you could actually land on a single planet and spend hours discovering mineral/flora/fauna and know that you barely scratched the surface of what is available because you haven't even been north or south or to the opposite side.\n\nI wanted so much to love this game, I really really did, and I appreciate the effort put into making it so vast, but the tradeoff they made for breadth vs depth I don't think clicks for me. As a software developer by trade, I understand the limitations developers face making something so huge at scale and trying to keep it performant and interesting. But unfortunately I don't think they've succeeded outside of the initial maybe 30-50 hours, and they certainly dropped the ball with multi-player which is a huge disappointment. I would say that if they completely reworked how multiplayer works, (and maybe addressed some of the glaring bugs and tightened up some of the monotony, and maybe give some variety to planets), I would love to give this game another shot. But for now, unfortunately this is probably not going to see more playing time from me.",

For the kind of player I am, Minecraft in creative mode works a lot better.

[/h3]\nI played for 3 weeks. and i consistently stumbled upon bugs after bugs. clipping through textures in many places. flying objects, Base computer duplicating(can't delete them). visiting friend's base just to see it both powered and missing power simultaneously. Corvette starships clipping into each other in multiplayer hub and making parts of the ship invisible. Ground constantly reappearing in bases despite previously mining it out. and yet when i go to other place on the planet the mined ground stays mined for weeks after i dug out burried technology, so now every half a day of playing i have to destroy the ground again inside my base. Or having my planet data reset every day, both it's name and date of discovery, breaking the immersion of the game. \nworst part is a lot of these bugs have been in the game for a long time and haven't been fixed.\n[h3] Game is full of issues [/h3]\ndo you want to build a base? well now you have to deal with the most insanely stupid issues like: building parts jumping between different places they want to snap to while also not being able to snap to so many places where you want to place a block that you have to figure out a workaround just to place one block.\nyou want to build a specific type of windows and wall for your base? well you can't because the game decides for you what kind of wall you get. specifically most annoying is anything made of Timber. as any wall type block that's the highest is turned into a different version that you can't change. \nthere are building shapes you can't even rotate upside down if you wanted to get creative with blocks.\nplayers who want to get into base building very quickly just learn to abuse bugs to get the shapes they want that they'd otherwise were unable to get normally. \ncommunication stations are this funny building block that once you put down you can't ever destroy and can be used to grief any place and it's been in the game for years now\nthis game desperately needs Quality of life features.\n[h3] pointless boring grindy content [/h3]\nPoints of interest are copy pasted across all planets and there is so little variety for them that if you visited 1 or 2 of them you basically have seen all Points of interest of the type. once you see crashed freighter, every time you see it again you know exactly where to go for the loot, there is only 1 version of Crashed Freighter and the only difference is few lines of text that give a brief backstory of the freighter before it crashed. the rewards? materials, everywhere just materials. it's grind on top of grind with boring repetitive POIs that make at least me feel like i just wanna get over the grind part already / get all the things i need to grind so i can stop doing it.\n\"why can't you just not do it if you don't enjoy it? it's a sandbox game you can do whatever you want in it\" no i hecking can't just skip the grind. there is so many things locked in this game that i need to unlock through the grind that i got 40hours in this game just running around doing chores. all the planets are procedurally generated, so why couldn't the POIs also be procedurally generated? \ncrafting is incredibly simple, just get the right resources and craft it in your inventory. no crafting stations needed. game offers station to unlock crafting recipes that you barely use because you have all the recipes in Anomaly ( multiplayer hub place) \nlearning languages serves barely any purpose. you don't need to understand alien languagues to buy and sell stuff to vendors. and all the other npcs all have the same 3 options: 1. learn a new word 2. use a word in conversation for a reward or punishment 3. offer a gift, which always raises your friendliness with alien race by 1 and is just grindy sink for all the special items you find cuz you can just dump all of them on one singular NPC and get that +1 for each of them. \ngame is filled with RPG rng mechanics that work like a Sink for your time cuz you can always gamble to get better anything and for what?\n[h3] FOMO Expeditions [/h3]\nexpeditions are this quirky time limited event where you can replay entire game from 0 up to the Anomaly to get rewards. there is no reason why you couldn't replay any of the expedition you like any time other than FOMO from the Devs. new expedition happens you have 3 weeks to finish it if you don't well good luck maybe it will come back in Redux at the end of the year.. or maybe not, you know but you'd rather not miss out on the content you payed for right? not everyone has time to log on just to grind up time limited event in a sandbox game.\n[h3] Exploration is Grind and gambling [/h3]\nfor a game that puts so much emphasis on exploration there is so little to explore. all the planets are procedurally generated. there is a bank of all possible parts that can make up a planet and every planet has it's own unique Seed that arranges those parts together which makes for near limitless amount of worlds to visit. i gotta say the game makes you feel small in a massive endless vast space. it's very climactic especially when you can traverse that space with your own spaceship even better with a spaceship you built yourself! Corvette! what's the problem then? well the bank of all possible parts that can make up a planet is small. despite the massive size game weights barely 15 GB and it's not a good thing. planets are very similar to each other, too similar to each other. yeah you can still try to search for perfect world aesthetically but it's gonna be barely different from any other planet.  that combined with all the POIs being repetitive makes exploration feels less like exploring the unknown and more like Grind. grinding for POIs loot.\n[h3] Multiplayer=bugs [/h3]\nmultiplayer is buggy laggy and has no sense of comparison of progress between players as you can change difficulty settings at any point of time so much you can play both hardcore and full creative mode on the same save file, so if you're grinding and want to feel progression you are only doing it for yourself, your own satisfaction and if you don't care you can just settings on to make everything free. \n[h3] exocrafts [/h3]\nexocrafts feel like toys more than useful vehicles/tools for player to use. considering a bug-turned-feature Punch jump is faster than any exocraft and you can just use your spaceship, there is no point for using exocrafts other than because you can. which just makes them feel like pointless filler so there is content.\nwhich is better than not having them at all... but i don't have such low standards.. i wish exocrafts were actually useful on top of being fun to use.\n[h3] Campaign / main story line... [/h3]\n... serves more as a tutorial than actual story mode, it's pretty shallow. you learn more lore from exploring and reading all the texts from all the different POIs than playing the story. it just introduces you to all mechanics and has some basic sense of structure but it's not captivating. no special cinematics, no voice acting.\n[h3] New Updates / New Content [/h3]\nHello games adds a lot of really cool new fun stuff to play with in new updates, i gotta say, i love Corvettes. being able to build and customize my own spaceship that i can walk in as it has actual interiors while my spaceship is flying to a different planet on autopilot is Incredibly Climatic. \nsadly all the new updates are more like throwing cool shiny rocks into an empty ocean. yeah it's a cool shiny rock to play with. and 100+ hours of additional grind finding all the neccesary body parts for corvette cuz you can't just buy them, that'd be too easy :) .... but new updates barely address issues with the Core of the game. they mostly just add stuff on top of a half-baked base game. \nwould i recommend it to someone else? no\nif i had the experience i have now after 75hours of playing back when i was deciding if i wanna buy it or not, i wouldn't buy it\n\ngame poorly tells players what's available in the game to do.",

Tried to fly around in it, landed near my settlement, noticed that the landing pad doesn't allow you to autoland when you're in a corvette. Thought to see how the rest of my bases will behave with corvette. Teleported to my base and lo and behold - immediately after teleportation I am standing inside my corvette that is situated on top of my base building. With it's landing gear stuck inside the building. I'm getting in the cockpit and realize that my corvette is continuously taking damage. I'm sitting in place - I'm taking damage, I'm trying wiggle my way out of this mess - I'm taking damage. And since the landing gear is stuck I can't even land. Therefor I can't get out of the cockpit. So I'm stuck taking damage and there is nothing I can do until I die.

I wanted to give some time to this game, that's why I played it even this long, but it was not fun enough.\nIt is very annoying that you cannot buy whatever you want - in the age of galactic trade terminals where goods may be instantly teleported even to your base. Let there be certain price variation between space stations, but for ...... sake it's a freaking free economy, right? So It's very random and limited what you can buy in certain places. I guess it's a lame mechanic to force you to go to other space stations, etc. \"Explore\" the \"same, same, but different\". Also, after building my first galactic trade terminal it was very annoying to find that I can buy even less things than from a space station. No, I don't enjoy trying to buy things from random NPC-s.\nSo even if you need some basic material and would have money, in most cases you have to go to a planet, go to several deposits, mine and possibly process them, so boring chores ...\nTrading even with NPC-s, they give little money for your stuff, but of course you have to pay full price if you want to buy anything from them (well maybe I did not experiment with this enough).\nAlso the NPCs you are trying to make some deal with (e.g. buy their ships) just disappear after a very short time, very annoying. At least I had this issue in an expedition save.\nSpace fights are annoying and not enjoyable at all, maybe because I still have a C class, because well, did not grind enough or something or did not research off the gameplay how to make money fast.\nSpeaking of which, ah by the way, for some things to learn about the game I had to ask ChatGPT quite a lot of questions (again, have to do something instead of playing an enjoyable game).\nAnd yes, while you can get used to galactic map, it's also quite unintuitive at first. Forget about mouse wheel zoom in and out (at least by default). They did not even care to display all the keys and mouse button presses to the screen which could help to work easier with the galactic map. When I wanted to find youtube videos about the galactic map, I found 2 freaking xbox videos. I don't care about consoles, at all.\nIn this expedition at least the \"freighter digging\" missions are buggy, even if I opened all the containera (which is quite tedious and boring as everything in this game), nothing happened, I did not complete the task.\nSentinels are a pure annoyance, and you can't beat the .... out of them (at least in early game then who knows) and escape, even if you take the time to shoot down their interceptors in the space you won't be able to escape easily in some cases.\nThere is not any feeling of progression in the game, at least early on. You may repair ships, you may expand your inventory space, you may build some bases, you may get some new tech, but it did not give me any satisfaction or fun, but felt like chores. Also to fully repair a damaged ship may require big amount of materials and effort.\nEarlier I tried to finish some \"story\", but it's not too engaging, just these stupid messages all the time, go there, do that, whatever.\nLearning words, etc. - also not for me. You have to click through the annoying conversations all the time and maybe a few words will be translated. I did not try to invest much to translators though.\nOK, enough ranting, but wanted to balance out a bit the \"very positive\" hype.",

Everyone has a giant head...\n\nIt has everything I want in a game, yet, it is missing so much and what it does have is just a little too tedious. That is the word I constantly have for this game. Tedious.\nEverything is just ever slightly too tedious to do. Everything is a slight chore, in service of....what goals? These activities are not inherently interesting, I need some context. There is action but no reaction. \n\nI recognise this game has come a long way and has a good customer friendly practice. It has many qualities. I praise it for that.\n\nI wish I could like it, yet it is a drag.\n\nSorry.",

      "review": "It feels so empty. Quests are chaotic AF. Go to random location. Go back to the Anomaly. Go back to that random planet. Go back to the Anomaly. No need to do such thing with player's time. \n\nThere are a shitload amount of unnecessary modules or technologies which give us false sense of multiple options to choose from. No. A lot of those are just random fillers. It is chaotic, unfulfilling, beta-ish sandbox. \n\nIf you want to explore literally the same planets (wow, this one is red, has a tons of fire and that one is more of green/brown ... rocky thing with radioactive atmosphere) and do your standard \"gather X to make Y then get 10 Y to get Z, so you can fire/walk/fly faster\" then you will enjoy this one.",
