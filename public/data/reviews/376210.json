Youtubers like Metta really grew my interest in this game far before I ever tried it out. \r\n\r\nBeing a bit of a dino nerd, do I wish the raptors had feathers? Yeah, I do. I honestly think raptors could look even more terrifying as terror chickens. That aside, lets talk gameplay:\r\n\r\nIs the Isle perfect? Nope, far from it. I've also tried some of the competitors to the Isle, and yet I keep coming back here and uninstalling the competition. Why? Because the other games give me lots of arcade vibes, where this one just feels more real. And that immersion is what keeps me here. \r\n\r\nIts a fun game that has kept my attention pretty well, its fun to play with friends. And first and foremost I love the dinos. \r\n\r\nOne thing I will recommend is to avoid the public servers. Cheaters and Mixed packers are much more prevalent there. Mixed packing absolutely destroys immersion.",

Only offical servers on Evrima and they have a lot of hackers, because there is no moderators like the legacy had with public servers. There is no report system either for hackers. Map is too big for such little amount of players, but they make up for it by adding AI slightly higher spawn rate then legacy had. A lot of my negatives are for the evrima version and being truthful. They removed the global chat, so players can't find each other or talk. Finding your own species is incredibly hard to even talk to anyone. I've been playing \"The Isle\" since it was first developing and released on Steam and it was sad to watch it go down.",

For the most part they are fairly accurate to the fossil record and the parts that are in-accurate have clear reasons for being so (like adding variation to playstyle or the raptors being Jurassic park clones instead of small animals). The map is also beautiful and i've enjoyed many sunrises and even thunderstorms whilst laying on a hillside digesting food. \r\n\r\nIt's not without a few minor issues. Staying alive as a predator can be particularly difficult (especially as small predators) as finding users small enough to prey upon is very tough and the 'NPC' creatures are few and far between. The game is still in development (and has been for a long time) so things do get trialled and changed but if you imagine it as a 'true to life' battle to stay alive (certainly what many dinosaurs would have experienced irl) then it is endless fun. \r\n\r\nI had heard that there was lots of cheating and a 'nasty' player base but honestly 30+ hours in i haven't experienced that at all. In fact i have met a few lovely people through the game and regularly log in to play with them. Just don't trust strange dinosaurs too much and be ready to make a quick getaway if you meet a user playing agressively. \r\n\r\nBut instantly became a favorite game for me. Love it and would happily recommend it.",

      "review": "Positive review, but buy at your own risk! And not just because there are some weird players having a kink with mating dinos...\r\n\r\nIf you love dinos and games that can be both spooky and suspenseful, this game is for your. The only purpose of the game is to grow your dino from a cub to a full grown adult (and later to elders, when the update drops). There's no other objective than to survive as long as you can. You'll eventually die and start over.\r\n\r\nI wrote buy at your own risk for 2 reasons: the playerbase and the devs. Cheaters aside (official servers are plagued, community servers are fine), most people I've talked to, either in game or in discord, are very nice and very helpful. But rarely have I seen a playerbase with such a \"love-hate\" relationship with both the game and the devs. And that's because the devs are weird. There's a long history of conflict between players and the team leader, which I'm not too aware of so I won't go into the details.\r\n\r\nThat said, the devs tend to drop updates plagued with bugs and don't want to fix it. Like, how come the AI isn't fixed yet? There will monthly dev blogs about what's coming up, which is nice of course, but when will it come out? We don't know. What about bug fixes? We don't know. All we know is that they're cooking a lot of great stuff, but we don't know what's really happening.\r\n\r\nAt least this is how it feels to me. Others might disagree.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nTo wrap this up, if you're looking for a purely survival game (no crafting, no building, just grow, eat, and die) and/or a game with dinos go for it and set your game to the \"Evrima\" dev branch. You'll enjoy it.\r\nBut, you might also find everything around the game itself weirdly handled by the devs and playing with people who will tell how crap the game is while still playing the heck out of it.\r\n\r\nJust as weird as a male Pteranodon players asking you, a female Ptera, if you're really a woman IRL and if we could talk live to be sure the Ptera genres are properly distributed between the 2 players.

      "review": "REALLY good game, some pros and cons though (Evrima):\n\nTL;DR \nOverall the *idea* especially is fantastic, it's very unique, very different to games like path etc, but there's just a lot of issues that the dev team needs to fix both with the game itself and the playerbase. I really recommend this game, but don't get it if you're not willing to put up with all the issues it's got atm, it's fair enough if that's not for you, but I think it's still a lot of fun regardless. \n\nPros:\nFun gameplay, beautiful map, many different playable dinosaurs (which have amazing paleoaccurate models and beautiful skins, as well as amazing calls/sounds), multiplayer, very replayable, survival realism oriented (nothing like quests or clans/points etc, no in game currency), Elder system is really cool, I really like that people and groups can host unofficial servers with their own rules, makes the game way more customisable bc it gives a lot more options for how you can play/helpful for gameplay that actually abides by rules (no mixpacking allowed in a lot of unofficials etc), really fun to play with friends, you can meet and have fun with random people you might never see again. A lot of love was put into the visuals of this game.\n\nCons:\n- Spaghetti code seems to also be affecting Evrima which means every other update we get a new rotation of the same old bugs (ai being buggy as f, pounce bugs 💀, grab and eat bugs, the list goes on)\n- I personally don't like the essentially 'click to win' button through pin and pounce being put on dinos like allo and rex, I think it kindof sucks bc you can spend however many hours growing your dino, and then it's just gone and you literally can't do anything, not even the illusion of being able to fight back\n- HACKERS. Literally everywhere on HT servers and just regular main branch servers, makes the game miserable for everyone else and there's nothing you can do to avoid them except play on unofficials, the anticheat is doing f all to stop them on officials and so are the devs. I love spending 10+ hours growing a dinosaur only to get one tapped by a baby carno sliding around at mach fuck.\n- Mixpacking is *so* irritating on officials especially, it completely destroys the realism aspect the game is aiming for and turns it into 'if you run into a mixpack megapack you're cooked' simulator (again this can be mostly avoided on unofficials luckily).\n- Elder system is great in theory but frail elder and frail prime elder (anything that gets weaker than regular fg in official branch atm) kills the replayability, I don't want to spent multiple hours growing my dinosaur just for it to get slower and worse stats, and only worth it if I get prime for like, ten minutes. Devs please don't punish players for spending hours on your game, I'd love to be able to play on one adult dinosaur for a lot longer than have to regrown a new one each time I get 100% immediately. \n\nI really love this game and I'm going to keep playing it but there's so many issues with it right now, I really hope this stuff gets fixed in the coming years because it's frustrating to have to deal with all these issues in an otherwise really awesome game/concept. I know it's still 'early access' but it's been a very long time now (Evrima is 5 years old and Legacy is like 10 or something), and I understand that games take a long time to be made, especially good quality ones, but I feel like things like the ai bugs especially should not still be happening, it's dissapointing. Idk about other players but I'd be happy to wait longer for things like new dinosaurs and new things on HT if the older bugs and issues can be properly and finally addressed. I really hope this game improves in the next few years because I have a lot of fun on it.",

How am I the ONLY Dino Around, you'll run around for 45 minutes until a chicken is chasing you for some reason and then you'll FINALLY get some food but like....what's the gameplay loop? im supposed to eat certain dino's so i can get mutations but where tf are the dino's? if it was like ark where they're spawning everywhere that'd be awesome, I got a map that was supposed to show AI spawn locations but i go there and nothing is to be seen, I don't get it? I played on a populated server and got headbutted by two pachy players, fine, i get it the community in these types of games are always toxic but i thought that was funny\n\nIm going to play it some more because i truly want to like this game and get good at it but the ZERO AI dino spawns is driving me up a F****** wall",

Rather than PVP existing solely for its own purposes, such as gratification or a score, PVP exists due to the nature of carnivores needing food to survive. Further, due to how many hours are invested in growing your dinosaur to adulthood, encounters are approached (usually) with caution which, again, tends to mimic natural encounters.\r\n\r\nThere are some balancing issues and in particular the AI is inconsistent with its behavior and how / when it spawns (this is mostly important for carnivores). \r\n\r\nCheating does appear to be somewhat of a problem and can absolutely ruin what is otherwise an engaging experience.",

If you find it hard to eat and grow play some unoffical servers with high AI spawn, until you understand the game. Dino-den is a great way to ease into the game but make sure to  connect to discord for extra help. You will need to know areas that are best for your dino and diets they need. The online websites with maps is great for learning the navigation. There is not many youtube videos that will explain how to get it to work. Very touch and go and learning like real dinos \r\n\r\nTIPS:  if your having problems playing the EVRIMA go into properties and hit beta and find beta testing EVRIMA if it wont load due to anti cheat once you switch beta from SPIRO to EVRIMA once downloaded if there is a issue starting due to anti cheat you can go into system files from the game settings on steam through the cog icon and search files until you find file named  *install anti cheat* hit it then you can install and it will work.  once that works I made the install anti cheat my game launcher icon on desktop to avoid the pop up hope it works and hope to see you in game!",

      "review": "After a couple thousand hours and several years on this game, I finally broke. I've always had a soft spot in my heart for this game and have always wanted it to succeed. I've even went as far as to practice PvP combat extensively at a point in time. However, time and time again I am left immensely disappointed by several issues with the game itself and the developers working on it.\n\n- This game is NOT beginner friendly. You must grow for several hours, and depending on which species, can be around 6-9 hours assuming you know how to achieve the ideal growth bonuses(which new players will not) and one mistake(or cheater) will reset you to square one in an instant. In its current state there are no tutorials, virtually no hints at what you are to do as a new player, and has one of the most toxic and petty communities I've personally ever seen in gaming. In this game, there are players who will group up with you, chat with you, sometimes for several hours and then betray you on a dime when you least expect it. You basically need to hide from your own species. You can trust nobody. The solo experience is absolutely miserable in it's current state. Mixpacking(herbivores and carnivores teaming up, usually in huge clans of 6 or more individuals) will absolutely mercilessly witch hunt any solo player they find, and often will arrange teams of dinosaurs to intentionally have a tactical setup as if they are playing Valorant. Pachys and Raptors to slow down the enemy, Ceratos, Tenos and Carnos to apply pressure so you can't turn around to fight back and some sort of apex to catch up and finish the job. I would personally not ever recommend this game to any new player who plans to play solo unless you plan to play on one of the limited unofficial community servers which tend to be heavily ruled and much of the time ran by some questionable individuals.\n\n- Cheating. As many of the other reviews have expressed by now, cheating is absolutely RAMPANT in this game!! I'm not even sure why this is, as there is nothing to gain from paying extra cash for cheats other than solely wanting to ruin the experience. There is a disproportionate amount of cheaters running around on the official servers with ESP(wallhacks), many of the time also in the huge mixpacking clans mentioned above. The cheaters also get unbelievably creative in this game. This has to be the first game I've ever seen a cheater be able to fling entire servers of dinosaurs into the sky and watch them all die to fall damage. This has been patched recently, but don't worry, I'm sure they will come up with something else as they do every Tuesday. New hacks appear on this game as quickly as wildfire spreads. It is absolutely atrocious and unfortunately will always be a huge issue as there are not enough programmers to catch it in a timely manner.\n\n- Mixpacking. I've already mentioned this earlier. It is very, very hard to play on officials without being in a large group that can protect you. Even then, there's a 50/50 their group is larger than yours. It is also becoming more common. Not quite on par with day of dragon clans yet, but oh boy we're getting there. A solution is in the works, but I have doubts it will deter them much.\n\n- Bugs. There are several persistent and annoying bugs in this game that have not been patched for nearly 4 years, such as when grabbing a piece of meat it will get stuck on your face with no way to get rid of it and you will not be able to eat or drink until it rots and falls off.  A lot of the time other players will be able to smell it. Bodies will literally fall through the ground with no way to get them back. The raptor's entire kit is basically a bug. Playing the game is basically the same as running naked through a forest. As fast as you run you will not escape the never-ending bugs\n\n- Balancing. There are some dinosaurs in this game that have the most insane balancing decisions being made behind their kits I've ever seen. The Ceratosaurus for instance has an ability in which he can simply hold right click to get a stun reduction and deal around 345 damage instantaneously, make your dinosaur vomit(soft stun) and do incredible bleed with no stamina cost and virtually no punishment to missing whatsoever. The community has been expressing issues with this for several months as it mows through the rest of the roster rampantly with ease and the developers responded by buffing it several more times and then adding more even more broken dinosaurs with the most unengaging abilities you've ever seen. Pins, which are basically free-win buttons where you basically watch your dinosaur die after the opponent presses right click at you are becoming very prominent in the balance of the game recently. Not to mention many dinosaur abilities are being shifted away from skill and more towards easy to land devastating abilities which require little effort and outrageous reward. The combat is becoming rather stale with a large margin of the dinosaurs having insta-win abilities such as long knockdowns and pins in a singular mouse click.\n\n- Desync. Desync in this game is hands down the worst I've ever seen. It has been like this for years. You will be several meters away from abilities and get hit, knocked down or even oneshot by them. Small playables are incredibly frustrating because of this due to the low healthpool. Hitboxes are also insane as a whole.\n\n\n- Developers. The developers in this game really do not seem to be very receptive to community feedback, or rather they cherry pick which feedback to take. Very often the community will warn against something or beg for change in areas where it is plain unfun or unnecessary and the developers will clap back by arguing with individuals in their discord or flat out ignoring the feedback and power through with whatever they want. The discord is a whole other can of worms. No, early access isn't an excuse after almost 10 years. Smaller dev teams have accomplished more with less funding faster.\nThe man who owns this game has an absolutely atrocious attitude and demeans his community actively and openly dislikes a large margin of the community that doesn't agree with his changes and has publicly went on tangents calling his audience \"brainless zombies\" etc on stream. The overwhelmingly negative attitude and public disdain for his community is outrageously unprofessional.\n\n\nOverall, it's definitely... an experience, but honestly it does break my heart how much potential this game has yet fails time and time again to seize. It's fun sometimes, but that high wears off quickly after you lose several hours to bugs, desync, or straight up cheating. If this game ever improves in a meaningful way, I will be the first to remove this review and praise it. But for now, I implore you to spend your time and money on games that will value and appreciate your contribution and feedback to their product!!",

Most of the community is terrible (i moderated for isla nublar)\n\n2. The devs are aggressive, not helpful and toxic (all though i havnt kept up with the dev drama in some years)\n\n3. It takes too long to grow certain dinos \n\n4.the newest pin Combat witch you cant do anything about is terrible infact most dinos being able to do stun because of weight seems a good idea on paper but a game play point of view its the worst (theres a reason games like overwatch took out the stun mechanic)\n\n5. the cheating is terrible (maybe dont have a bunch of chinese servers to boost your numbers hidden in the back ground very dodgy)\n\n6.the game play for juvi and growing up is boring they still havnt sorted out the im gonna sit in a bush for hours and only come out of a bite to eat and sip of water (even with the diet system)\n\n7. there still isnt rising water levels, or floods or really bad storms (storms that can alter terrain witch was promised back in V3 map)\n\n8. i see more progress in the last year but there is so many false promises and things not being done witch they said they would do but havnt and have taken too long to do other things in the past\n\n9. not updated there steam page why?\n\n10. 10 years of being in Early access with 3 re works of the game\n\nOk now for my View on the game\n\nI loved the game when it was V3 Map the combat was more basic but it took allot of skill to be a good player (now its just pinning and stuns), i made quite a few friends threw the isle and lost some, i was a moderator for the server Isla Nublar at one point the biggest realistic server on the isle but my god it could be toxic, honestly back then Development was good they game was flying threw we had so many Dinos to choose from and they were teasing Hypo dinos.\n\nBUT!! \n\nThe game wasnt withought its Dramas, with a Dondi the Game owner who was really Toxic all the time telling players to F OFF and banning peoples IPs for expressing there opinion on the game (negative opinions) and youtubers who would investigate people and accuse them of being the big P (to do with kids) the whole feeling around the drama for me was do i really want to be associated with this game? but i still played because i tried to focus just on the game its self even though in the server i was in being a moderator  the drama leaked in to our server.\n\nBut for the game side of things honestly the game looks Beautiful, but game play wise its the worst its ever been, yes the animations are amazing, textures are great, Diet system is pretty cool but still if your a carni its more luck now, get big or go home, eat enof food and then hide in a bush most of the time and for herbs, man its easy find a corner of the map no carnis go eat then sit in a bush for a literal hour at a time, but the herbs have one good thing though, who ever did there fighting animations top noch man they got allot more love than the carnis did allot more fitting styles and things to do, but that being said whats the point when a big rex or something bigger than you just walks up and says im gonna pin you and you can do nothing, if your a stego or trike you cant run away as rexs trot is so fast, (trike shouldnt run away though as its not too hard to kill a rex with its new combat system) i think thats the only bit they got right in combat.\n\nOverall i think that the way the isle is going with the stun locks is not good i think if they got rid of stun locks it would make it more interesting combat this game is not designed for me a adult who has a job its designed for people mainly kids who have allot of time to kill or chinese people who are probably paid to hack who knows but wat dosnt look good is having a load of hidden chinese server to boost the population of the game,.\n\nif you want to play a game with less graphics but still the same risk for reward but a better growth system then beast of bermuda is good for that/\n\nif you want to play a game with the old style isle graphics but polished and a cross between isle new combat minus the stuns and the old combat then path of titans is good \n\nbut if you want to play right now a game that is dominated with cheaters and stun lock combat but is beautiful and dosnt in my eyes have the best graphics (if its optimised properly) then the isle is good too \n\nbut as for me with 1516 hours in the game been playing for almost 10 years since V2 map ive played all the dinos (i miss pew) im saying this game is no longer a good game for me ive given up on the constant back turning, bad decision making, toxic situations, too long pay sessions to justify playing this game anymore, i hope it gets better and becomes the game they promised to make but i dont think it will make it there too much terrible things have happened to make this game a good game.\n\nThank you for reading",

You spend 1-6+ hours growing a dinosaur only to die because latency. Fighting is all about timing and it's impossible to play well when you attack someone's back only to die from an unseen attack. \nLastly,  map to server size makes the game feel empty unless you know the hotspots. If you're lucky, you'll come across a spot with some AI animals,  or you'll just starve to death. It can take over an hour just to run across the map and the servers hold 100 players. Half of those players you won't see because they're in the water, the sky, or they're just very small and hiding.\n\nSide notes: \nMix packing is frustrating.  I get it if it's temporary to take down a common foe but these guys are running around the whole game. \nTo spawn in solo as a carnivore you have to get lucky and find help or an abandoned meal. Otherwise, it's highly likely you'll just starve to death.\nThe waterways are not connected or close together so traveling as the crocodile dino is very difficult.\nAI attacks from boars and deer are broken. They will hurt or kill you as a new spawn without any animation. Pouncing with a troodon or raptor is much more reliable,  but good luck killing them unless they get stuck.\nChickens and rabbits are incredibly fast. While they're the smallest land AI you'll find, good luck catching them as a tiny carnivore. \nMany players on NA west servers are from Asia. This includes at least Thai, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. I know this because I had someone from each country in a single group. This makes latency worse and communication difficult.\n\nAlright.

      "review": "Oh my, where do I even begin with this absolute dumpster fire of a game. In this review I will be talking about both Legacy and Evrima branches and why I'm giving this game such a low review. Lets start with Legacy first. In the Legacy branch of the game, you are pretty much cooked if the dinosaur that you are fighting has a smaller turn radius than you. What exactly do I mean by that? I mean that if you are an apex dinosaur like a rex, giga, or trike you can easily be outturned and killed by something as small as a utahraptor because of its sharper turn radius. Some dinosaur matchups are completely unfair, those matchups being spino vs shant/trike for example. As a trike or shant, you almost CANNOT kill a spino. Why is that? Even though both shant and trike deal a lot more damage and have more health than spino, it is almost impossible to kill one due to the spino's insane turn radius, and trike/shant's lack of such. My overall point is that if your dinosaur has a wider turn radius than the one you are fighting, you are pretty much fried. How should a utahraptor that can be grown in an hour be able to kill a rex or giga that takes 6? I will now be talking about drag biting and sniping. Drag biting and sniping are combat exploits that certain dinosaurs are able to do such as rex and giga. By doing these exploits in combat, you can reach dinosaur hitboxes that you shouldn't be able to from VERY far away, and it just makes combat extremely unfair for new or unaware players. My next problem with Legacy is how unbalanced the roster is. Some dinosaurs have absolutely no chance of fighting or even escaping others. Some prime examples include the suchomimus, ankylosaurus, and stegosaurus. These dinosaurs are too slow and weak to properly and fairly defend themselves against an incoming rex or spino. The sucho is extremely slow and can easily be caught by any apex, being 1 or 2 shot by them. As for stego and anky, they are almost always outclassed by the apex they are fighting. You cannot kill a spino/rex as a stego/anky. They should've at least implemented a way for these 2 herbivores to defend/avoid rexes and spinos. If you are an anky/stego and you see a rex/spino, you might as well just logout. My next point will be concerning how OP some dinosaurs are. I'm mainly talking about the spinosaurus and therizinosaurus. The spinosaurus has EXTREMELY high health. The only thing that can kill a spino is another spino or a rex. Anything else has no chance of fighting or escaping it, as the spino is too tanky to kill. As for the theri, it is wayyyy too fast for what it is, being able to run down allos and dilos effortlessly. My next point will be about the two maps, V3 and Thenyaw. V3 is WAYYYYYYY too large for the amount of players that can fit on the server. Most V3 severs have a max limit of around 100-150 players, sometimes even less. V3 is vast and overwhelming, and you can sometimes go LITERAL HOURS without encountering a single player. If you are going to make a map that large, you should at least increase the player count on the server. Thenyaw is better, but still has problems of its own. Legacy also has virtually no anti-cheat, making speed/stamina hacking and ESP users very, very common. My overall rating for Legacy is a 3.5/10. I've met some cool people and formed some good memories on this game, but they game itself is absolutely atrocious. Thats the only reason why I'm not giving it a 0/10, because you do have the chance to meet some nice players. I understand that Legacy is unfinished and thats why its so unbalanced, but at that point why is it even available to play?\r\n\r\nI will now be talking about the Evrima. The Evrima branch of the game is somehow even worse than the previous version. Evrima is absolutely terrible for the reasons I'm about to talk about. First reason being the unbalanced roster. The roster here is SLIGHTLY more balanced than Legacy's dumpster fire, but it is still awful. One example being the troodon, my main dinosaur. Troodon is WAYYYYY too slow for what it is. A dilo/omni/carno can easily catch a troodon. The troodon is much smaller and weaker, so shouldn't it at least be faster? I guess not according to these developers. I've seen that a juvi rex is somehow faster than a carno but I don't even want to think about that right now. Evrima's lack of global chat also makes it very difficult to communicate with other players. Lets talk about why it takes so long for a SINGLE dinosaur to be released. Rex and allo havebeen showed and teased to us for the past year, and it is still not available in regular Evrima. I don't understand what is taking so long as I personally know others who code these kinds of games, and they assure me that it doesn't take this long. The mutation system in the game is also very unfair and unbalanced. A cera that has the right mutations can literally one shot other ceras of the same growth. The entire mutation system needs reworking. Now lets talk about Dondi. I feel that Dondi has no regard or passion for this project, and should really give or sell ownership of the game to someone else how may be able to improve its future. Dondi is very sensitive and unwilling when it comes to constructive criticism. He will actively tune out and even belittle fans that offer advice and support. Dondi is entitled and lazy, taking OVER A YEAR to release just one dinosaur. Dondi, if you ever happen to read this please, please get your stuff together. If your game continues down this dark path, your game and fanbase WILL DIE. In conclusion, both branches of the game have tons of problems, the game is full of drama and unfairness, and this is a title that should just be skipped for now.",

I have played on so many servers, and it's either buggy as hell or just non-existent. Literally played on a \"High-AI\" server (which at this point I feel like is just click bait to get people to join their dumb server), and didn't find a single AI, anywhere. And then you try to find corpses or something, because you're a starving infant Raptor, and a damn Herrera jumps on me from a tree as I try to eat. Doesn't do anything with my corpse, nope literally just circles around me and climbs back up on the tree. \n\nThe idiotic trolls of this game will say \"skill issue\", but it's just plain toxic. Everyone just KOS's without any reason, and it's just full of degenerate f*cks that were bullied as a child and feel the need to ruin peoples fun in a video game, because they can't find happiness in real life. Yes, I know it's a dinosaur game, yes Carnivores kill for food, and sometimes even \"stockpile\" it... But KOS'ing just to kill and then pulling the \"Well I might eat you later\" bullsh*t, is just that. Bullsh*t and you looking for a way to hide the fact that you're just a toxic POS that wants to bully people. And you purposefully go and kill baby dino's of all things, because if that dino was full grown, your a** would run away with your tail between your legs, like the PAB (use your imagination) you are.\n\nAnd it's the same thing with Herbivores. KOS, even from other Herbivores. And this game has become a liberal social friend group cesspool, where if you don't fit in, or are not part of their friend group (which most servers these days are just idiots and their friends/social groups or communities, and hardly welcome new people), they will either literally kill you and talk sh*t, or completely ignore you and threaten you if you \"get too close\". Even if you say you're friendly, 9 times out of 10 they kill you and laugh at you and talk sh*t. Absolutely ridiculous.\n\nAside from all that it has the potential to be a great game (It WAS a great game), but needs a serious update. Which the devs have been holding back for way too long at this point. And the performance state right now shows. But there needs to be some serious management in these communities, because it just chases people away. Like why would I waste my time playing, if I just get killed every time I encounter another player? And the immediate answer would to be to just avoid players, which would be nice and easy IF AI WOULD JUST F*CKING WORK!!!\n\nLike I said... Save your damn money.",

I have invested time and money and every time something happened I bit my tongue and kept my head down. I tried to get involved in the community and I have tried to provide feedback and assistance to people in that community but there are so many glaring problems, so many red-marks that can no longer be ignored that I can not support it anymore in its current state and in fact if I didn't have the patience of a tibetan monk and an autistic hyperfixation with dinosaurs I would've tossed this game a long time ago.\n\n1. First of all, nothing is up to date up front. If you notice, almost everything here in the trailer and promotional isn't up to date, most of the pictures are from legacy the previous game, they provide updates for what they are doing monthly which is good but everything they are doing is for Evrima and Hordetest completely different things than what is on the front. So what you see here is only kind of what you're getting which is confusing and infuriating. They also don't tell you that up front and provide almost nothing to help you even get there. So in order to even play the thing they are working on you need to decipher a backwards riddle from the beginning.\n\n2. Secondly, the \"Community\" I can deal with rediculous people and in a hardcore survival game you're going to have rust-like experiences. This is kind of like Ark but you're the dinos. The problem is you cannot ask questions or you get flamed. You are expected to know everything straight off the boat and if you don't you will be cannibalized by the members of the community. You will also be literally cannibalized as a dinosaur anyways because this is the wild wild west. That can make things interesting but it is also a double edged sword. It can be infuriating to travel an hour, make calls across an island thinking your going to meet a new buddy only to discover hes paler than a ghost, drooling, wearing a bib and rubbing a knife and fork together. \n\n3. Aspects of gameplay. One of the first things I noticed is that something is always broken. Whether it is the ai, the weather, the dinos themselves, or something else there is always something broken. This is forgiveable to a certain degree because it is in beta technically and if you're in hordetest its the beta for the beta but sometimes it feels like the issues are just actually ignored. I have spent hours of in real life time starving to death because it is so dark you cannot see in front of your face, or starving because the ai is bugged, or starving because there is no ai. In fact many players refer to this game as \"Starvation Simulator\". So there could be an ai issue thats glaringly obvious and everyone is starving to death and it feels like it is ignored for 7-10 business days and then a patch is released and then the weather breaks. Not even to mention the rollbacks and random unannounced wipes. So you could spend 10 hours (yes literally 10 hours) growing a crocodile to epic proportions by sacrificing your soul to Sobek avoiding getting eaten by other crocodiles while eating everything that isn't nailed down only to lose it suddenly when the server without warning is rolled back or wiped and no you don't get it replaced. Its musical chairs of bugs and enough frustration to make anyone want to throw their monitor out the window or sell their house and change their name.\n\n4. Hackers and Mixpackers. I have been murdered personally by a flying baby carnotaurus and by a cannibal rex with the all seeing eye of sauron and while that is funny out of context and when you're outside the situation, when you spend 6 hours (yes literally 6 real life hours because growing dinosaurs in this game takes forever) growing a dinosaur just for it to be obliterated in a second with a one tap and not have it refunded or anything you take a step back and go wait a minute. Now sometimes you just get eaten, some days the dragon wins, and that's part of the game and I guess life in general. But what is a serious problem is not even the hacking issue (which is an ongoing problem) but a phenomena called mixpacking. Going in if you're anything like me you want to be a triceratops and eat vegetables all day and hang out and say hi to the stego across the river and if a rex shows up you think \" I'm fine theyll meet the business end of me horns.\" The problem is that when that rex shows up and you look toward the stego (someone who should have been your ally against a meat eater) it turns out that they are working with the rex! Meaning this rex and this stego formed a game of thronesian alliance behind your back just to smite you and you lose everything and they gain nothing but benefit. The stego gains the benefit of having a rex buddy and the rex gets to eat you incentivizing this to happen again. So what occurs is an infinite loop of you spending hours and hours and hours of your time growing only to be smited by a random hacker or massacred by a roving gaggle of any random combination of dinosaurs.\n\nSo you may say well here's an easy fix let me just mixpack I'll get a couple of buddies and we will just do it and everything will be fine. Well sure there you go, you became the villain to protect yourself against one aspect of the game, but what about all the other issues and at what cost? The cost of your soul? I tried mixpacking too and it was fun for a while. But in the end it leaves you hollow inside; and if the mixpack doesn't get you the starvation will, and if the starvation doesn't get you the looney toons suddenly falling off the face of the earth landing on the ground and having your pelvis shoot into your chest falling damage will and if the the looney toons suddenly falling off the face of the earth landing on the ground and having your pelvis shoot into your chest falling damage doesn't get you then you will without a doubt get stuck in a random rock in the middle of nowhere and scream and die.\n\nSo in conclusion this game is a messy combination of unbalanced gameplay, starvation, a toxic community, devs that are either overwhelmed or under-care making random changes and ignoring glaring issues as well as silencing people who bring attention to certain problems. I am very very saddened to have to let this game go and I will miss my 43rd triceratops as I really genuinely believe this game was something and could be something again but without addressing the issues outlined here I cannot recommend anyone pick this game up. This is the moment in the story where the hero can live if he takes the crazy hermits advice but if you really want to waste your time and money and lose your hair go ahead, be my guest, but in the end you'll come to see things my way.",

      "review": "I used to love this game back in Legacy, and even at the start of Evrima. \n\nBut ever since Gateway Evrima, it has taken nothing but a constant nosedive. The graphics are good, but the servers often are filled with rubberbanding and lag. The map currently is FAR too big for only 100 players and rarely functioning AI. So majority of the time, you'll waste your time playing starving simulator until you die, never seeing another player or AI spawn.\n\nAnd the times you do find another player? Usually its a giant mixpack that kill everyone in sight to take over a server, or for sport killing sprees. Or a hacker, on a baby creature that one taps you even if you're a full grown creature with hours put in. Another problem I recently have run into aside from the mixpackers and hackers, is on the rare chance you find one of your own species, people that join groups as the same species, then group kill you the second they have the chance, for no reason. I personally have had this happen on Omniraptor, Carno and just tonight Herrera. Which was my last nail in the coffin for giving this game the benefit of the doubt any longer and trying to stay hopeful about the community and game. \n\nThen unless you specifically are from the USA or Europe, you can't play on Unofficials/Community servers because they are region locked. As a Canadian player I tried multiple popular and good reputation Community servers such as Petits Pieds. That I had been excited to try, to see if it would keep my want to play this game and find any good in it, only to be locked out of it from USA only region lock on a supposedly 'NA' server. \n\nSo I cannot whatsoever recommend this game in it's current state. Unless the Developers actually start doing something about the massive amounts of hackers, The AI never spawning, mixpacking groups that take over servers, and consistent group killers, on Official Servers. \n\nIf you're looking for a Dinosaur Survival game, I highly recommend looking elsewhere. The Isle is no longer a fun multiplayer survival game, but a frustrating and disheartening shell of what it once was.",

In this game you spend real time hours, sometimes 6 to 7+, growing different species of dinosaurs. Hackers are teleporting around with damage hacks, length of attack hacks, speed, stamina, anything you can think of that a survival game uses. In my personal experience, I've seen the same hacker live for weeks, if not months, on the same server with players reporting their steam ID and video proof, and nothing will be done about it.\r\n\r\nIt's a fun game at its base but they need people that have the time to go thru the game and ban hackers as their job. Currently to my knowledge, when the frustration with them (the hackers) is brought up in the official discord, the reasoning behind hackers taking time to be dealt with it because the admins are volunteers who do it when they can. Which is a nice thought and nice of them to do but completely inefficient when it comes to proactive banning of hackers in real time which is what this game desperately needs. Admins also have the power to regrow your dinosaur to the growth you had when you died to the hacker, but even with video proof, I personally have never seen or heard of it being done, though I can't speak for everyone. It is stated it is not guaranteed, to be fair, but still, at 700 hours in the game, I haven't heard of it happening once.\r\n\r\nTLDR: You invest real time hours for hackers to come along and 1 tap you, admins offer little support.

Growing herbies, fighting carnivores (vise versa) & nesting babies in. 10/10 experience if you can find cool people to play with. No special \"mutations / buffs\", no extra movement speed, extra damage, extra damage on bleed.. or cannibal mutations altering gameplay.. Legacy version has some communities still around, but with evrima now its slowly dying. Mostly chinese servers up. \n\nLegacy is PURE raw dino on dino gameplay. Gore & Plants highlighted to show food & water, Footsteps showed for tracking. Was almost perfect aside from the graphics / animations. Best thing on Legacy is the community servers & those who actually make the game fun.\n\n\nEvrima - (A WHOLE MESSED UP BETA): 5 years \"open development / early access\" ............................. lol.\n\nGood points: Has decent graphics, Better Animations than legacy. Now running (Unreal Engine 5) somewhat okay... Gameplay is better than legacy, fighting wise & easier movement. You have diets, to either speed your growth or slow your growth without filling them. Added mutations which bring in many different advantages / challenges, Offering increase damage, Bleed, swimming speed, sex change, slower digestion rate .. list goes on.  Added an elder system which you have to play the game according to how they think you should play, you basically follow and undisclosed checklist of things they want you to do. Upon doing so, you become an elder. A dino who is bigger / stronger than the rest of non primes.\n\nBad points: Developers are trash, Dondi (owner) is a huge POS who doesn't take the game development seriously or the feedback from the community. He mocks his community & those who buy his game.\n\nServers in-game should read  (Deathmatch, Hacker Survival).\n\nBetween the dev's / admin team, they have major issues. For starters lack of communication between Mods, Admins & the Devs.. They don't relay any issues to one another. For example, 2 outof 12 servers on (horde testing) were running for 1 week, the dev's didn't fix it and didn't relay any information to Dondi (owner) telling him about these issues. The admins will tell you as a community member to file a bug report when you have 1800 people in the discord saying the game is broken. \n\nOntop of that, the Team Hires LGBTQ admins who dont even know what gender they are, who are soft in moderating the discord, they are extremely biased with their viewpoints, admins highly favor those with nitro / pink names who bend their knees and constantly support them.\n\n\n** HACKERS **\nThe game is riddled completely with hackers. They use the cheapest * EasyAntiCheat *. yet will say only 1 out-of 100 hackers get through the system. Youtube shows just how easy it is to obtain these hacks. Every server you join on main branch / horde test you will run into them as hard as you try not to.. The hackers will find you. They will find you hidden in a bush & walk you down across the entire map.. They do nothing to ban the hackers / clean up the servers as they dont IP ban. So they just buy another washed steam account & come right back in.\n\nPeople have multiple accounts where they spawn in dinos to feed themselves to stay alive or come back to fight you after you killed them, knowing you're damaged. \n\nThe games performance is atrocious... Running Ryzen 9 with 4060 and 32 GB ram, Video issues & game crashes constantly.. Lag / rubberbanding is through the roof. The rain and weather animations completely freeze up and cause the game to be super choppy going under 15 FPS when i run 60+.... When it rains you literally cant hear anything.. There are 2-4 hours of complete darkness at night where you cant see 1ft infront of you.. yet someone finds you & kills you. (hackers)\n\nThis game is not beginner friendly. These dinosaurs, some take 1 hour to grow.. others 12+.... You will spend 12+ hours growing smart & safe, just to be walked down & chased by someone running hacks or a group of hackers.\n\nThis game is going to die before its \"released\"..",

Think a tiny baby dino killing something 10 times its size with a single peck. OVER AND OVER AGAIN.\n\nHackers are brazen and prolific, and apparently simply left to roam the servers freely without consequences. The official server admins are volunteers \"with lives and jobs\" who clearly cannot manage. An endless stream of hacking reports on official discord is met with admin responses like \"just stay away from hotspots, and you should be okay.\" The game has been early access for 10 years, which I think has become a tired excuse for \"don't expect anything polished.\" I'm sorry, but at the moment, it's not even playable. With the hacker problem out of control, it has ceased to be a game, and is merely a concept. \n\nGameplay is indeed an 'Afterthought' here. That would be fine if it were free, but I paid money for this on the promise it was playable.

However, I have never seen such a game swarmed with cheaters as the isle. If you are not getting one shot by a baby dinosaur as a full grown triceratops you are running into a mixpack of 3 trikes, 2 stegs and 3 ceras that run you down which is not how the game should be played nor is it enjoyable for anyone. This could all get swept under the rug if the developers were not completely ignorant to their fans and do nothing in regards to bans/ban requests. If you try to complain or reveal the locations of the hacker or mixpack in the discord guess what your comment is deleted or you are silenced from the discord. It is a game that is truly one of the best in terms of ideas but the developers as well as the discord operators are so ignorant and unfair that it makes playing it almost impossible. Not to mention how buggy the game also is whether its getting stuck in walls, your dinosaur getting completely wiped which you spent hours on with no option to regain it or whether the ai is completely bugged and you starve to death. This game truly needs the devs to either be fired or a new studio to pick it up in its current state it is not worth buying.",

Dead. Empty.\nThe servers claim to have high player counts, yet every time I join one, it feels completely deserted.\n\nI’ve spawned as a raptor three separate times now — each time it’s the same experience:\nSpawn, run around looking for food, find nothing, starve to death. There’s no AI anywhere to sustain you (even though there’s supposed to be), and I’ve never seen another player while playing.\n\nI’ve checked Sanctuary, “favourite food” hotspots on the compass, and migration zones — all completely empty. There’s literally no way to survive in what’s supposed to be a survival game, because there’s absolutely nothing alive on the map. It’s just a big, empty world with nice graphics and nothing to do.\n\nHonestly, don’t bother with this crap. I also bought Beasts of Bermuda recently, and even that game — despite its flaws — at least gives you AI or some way to sustain yourself without needing other players around.\n\nBoth games don’t have great reviews, but at least Beasts of Bermuda feels like it tries.

I know it's in early access, but after the latest update I can't even  play on Hordetest servers because I'm stuck on the character selection screen without a cursor or any other way to select anything. This is just one of the many inconveniences I've encountered while trying to play this game (performance issues, AI creatures not spawning, lack of in-game tips, etc.). The reason I play on Hordetest is that, among other things, the fish AI didn't work on the Evrima branch, so I decided to switch to the Hordetest branch, which in my opinion worked better than Evrima. I can't recommend buying the game, especially considering that it's been in development for a decade. Just to clarify, this is a review of the newest version of the game, the one that's actually in development.

That, to me, completely destroys the argument that The Isle is “more realistic” than Path of Titans (which, in my opinion, is the superior game anyway).\n\nAnother confusing thing is that, after installation, the game launches in the Legacy version — which is mostly used by Chinese players and is no longer being developed. The current version is Evrima, but you have to manually switch to it in Steam’s beta options. However, there’s also another branch — hordetesting — which is basically a beta of a beta.

They only care about themselves. Instead of investing in the game he's been working on it for over a decade by himself and some other guy which is now a team of 18 today. Let's not forget that The Isle used to be much different back when it first came out and how it kept changing over the years. The previous guy who worked with him and coded vanilla litterally quit after a dispute with him and made Path Of Titans cause this guy is just some dumb ass scamming people. It's trully just another scam amongs the Early Access genre and does not deserve the positive reviews that it's getting. He even had to make Evrima to avoid using the guy's code and design.\n\n There is plenty of videos on youtube to tell and show you why and why this game is not worth it. The man behind it simply do not care. You don't need 1000+ hours to know that this game is litteral trash when you look at the state that it's in and how it's been in early access for this long with no sign of actual decent progress towards a final product. This game will never be anything because they will never provide us with the promissed final product which early access games are supposed to be about.\n\nPeople buy this game in order to found it. If they don't invest and provide any decent development after selling 2 million units, it's nothing but a scam. Updating the game, adding dinos and fixing some bugs here and there at an extremely sluggish pace is just a way to keep us hoping for something that we will never ever get. If you read this do not buy this game and if you did and know this to be true. Leave your own negative reviews so that they either get to work or stop giving us false hopes by shutting it down completely.\n\n What we need is fluidity and playability. They can work on skins and map designs once they fix and polish the gameplay, mechanics and add some balance to this chaotic shit show of a game. This is nothing but a starvation simulation filled with glitches, bugs and hitbox desyncronisations that will make you question every seconds that you invest into this game. That's without mentioning the cheaters. It can be fun and amazing at times. But 95% of the time you will be facing these issues and other starving players or herbivors that will kill you on sight. This game is absolutely toxic and cringe and I wish they could make it a more enjoyable experience.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ2b01yemCY\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S9fDAzvDPI&t=8s\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/theisle/comments/1b5onue/a_reminder_that_the_devs_are_first_and_foremost/",
