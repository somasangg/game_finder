      "review": "I’ve spent some time with this game and honestly, it surprised me in a way I didn’t fully expect. I don’t want to sound dramatic, but there’s something oddly satisfying about how everything fits together — not in some perfect, polished “advertisement” way, but more like a game that knows exactly what it wants to be and just… goes for it.\n\nThe first thing I noticed is the atmosphere. Every part of the game — the visuals, the sound, the pacing — kind of blends into this feeling that you’re actually inside its world, even if you’re just casually playing. I know that sounds a bit cliché, but it’s true. Sometimes it’s chaotic, sometimes slow, sometimes you’re just wandering around thinking “ok, what now?” but that’s honestly part of the charm. The game doesn’t try to rush you unless it actually needs to.\n\nGameplay-wise, it has this mix of familiar elements and small twists that keep things from feeling stale. Nothing groundbreaking, maybe, but it all works together in a way that feels natural. There were moments when I thought “yeah, I’ve seen this in other games,” but then the game throws in tiny details or unexpected interactions that make it stand out just enough. It’s the kind of thing you only notice after a few hours, when you start connecting the dots.\n\nPerformance has been mostly fine. A little rough spot here and there, but honestly, show me a game these days that doesn’t have something weird happening once in a while. Nothing game-breaking on my end, at least. You can clearly tell the developers put effort into this, even if a few edges are still a bit sharp. Again — part of the charm.\n\nWhat I really appreciate is that the game gives you space to play the way you want. Some people will rush through every objective, others will take their time exploring or messing around, and both approaches actually feel valid. I like games that don’t punish you for not following some “correct” path.\n\nOverall, I’d say this is one of those titles that grows on you the longer you play. It doesn’t try too hard to impress in the first five minutes — instead it slowly builds its identity, layer by layer, until you suddenly realize you’ve been playing way longer than you planned. If you’re looking for something that balances comfort with challenge, familiar mechanics with fresh touches, and a world that’s just fun to be in, then I genuinely think this one is worth giving a shot.\n\nWould I recommend it?\nYeah, I would — maybe not to everyone, because no game is for everyone, but definitely to anyone who likes getting lost in a game for a bit and discovering things at their own pace.",

      "review": "My In-Depth Review of Clicker Heroes\n\nI’ve spent a good amount of time playing Clicker Heroes, and I wanted to give a proper, honest review from my own experience. Even though it’s been around for years, it still holds up surprisingly well as one of the most addictive idle games out there.\n\nWhat Clicker Heroes Is All About\n\nAt its core, Clicker Heroes is an incremental “clicker” game where you start by clicking on monsters to kill them and earn gold. You use that gold to hire heroes who deal damage automatically, which means the game can keep running even when you’re not clicking. Over time, you unlock new heroes, abilities, ancients, and eventually a prestige system called Ascension, where you reset your progress to gain “Hero Souls” and grow stronger for the next run.\n\nIt sounds simple, and it is — but that’s exactly why it works.\n\nWhat I Think the Game Does Really Well\n\n1. Super Easy to Get Into\nYou can literally start playing in seconds. The feedback loop is instant: click, kill, earn gold, upgrade, repeat. It’s the kind of game that scratches that “satisfying number-go-up” itch immediately. Even if you leave it running in the background, it still feels like you’re making progress.\n\n2. Surprisingly Deep Mechanics\nAt first, it’s just clicking. But as you get further, there’s a lot more strategy than you’d expect. You start learning which heroes scale better, how to optimize your damage per second (DPS), and how to balance idle vs. active play styles. Once the Ancients and gilding system unlock, it becomes more of a management game than a simple clicker.\n\n3. Perfect for Playing Casually\nThis game is great for multitasking or just zoning out. You can play actively for a while, then leave it idle and come back to see how far you’ve progressed. It’s also completely free, and you can enjoy the full experience without spending a penny.\n\n4. A Great Example of an Idle Game Done Right\nThere are tons of idle games out there now, but Clicker Heroes really set the standard. It’s polished, easy to understand, and weirdly relaxing. The simple art style and upbeat music give it a kind of charm that never really gets old.\n\nWhat I Don’t Like (and What Can Get Frustrating)\n\n1. It Gets Repetitive After a While\nThere’s no escaping the fact that it’s the same loop over and over — click, level up, reset, repeat. Once you’ve hit Ascension a few times, the sense of progress slows down a lot. If you’re not into grinding or optimizing tiny details, it can start to feel stale.\n\n2. The Mid-Game Wall\nAfter a certain point, progression really slows down. You can hit a “wall” where it takes ages to move forward unless you ascend again. It’s part of the design, but it can feel like the game is dragging just to stretch out playtime.\n\n3. The Microtransactions (Though Not Terrible)\nThere’s an in-game currency called Rubies that you can buy with real money. To be fair, the game never forces you to spend, but it’s still there, and some people might find that annoying. Personally, I never needed to buy anything to enjoy it.\n\n4. It’s Not for Everyone\nIf you like story-driven games, fast action, or complex mechanics, Clicker Heroes will probably bore you. It’s literally about watching numbers get bigger — that’s the whole point. It’s weirdly addictive if you like that sort of thing, but mind-numbing if you don’t.\n\nHow It Holds Up Today (in 2025)\n\nEven now, the game has a loyal player base and still gets decent attention on Steam and mobile. The graphics and interface are dated, but the core gameplay loop is timeless. With how many idle games have come and gone, Clicker Heroes remains one of the few that still feels rewarding.\n\nThat said, the lack of major new updates makes it feel a bit frozen in time. It’s not a live-service game with constant events or new content — it’s just the same loop that’s been perfected over years.\n\nMy Final Verdict\n\nFor what it is, Clicker Heroes is a fantastic idle game. It’s easy to play, oddly satisfying, and has enough layers to keep you coming back. It’s not deep in the traditional gaming sense, but it nails that feeling of endless progress.\n\nIf I had to rate it:\n⭐ 8/10 — great fun if you’re into incremental games, but repetitive if you’re not.\n\nPros:\n✅ Addictive and rewarding gameplay loop\n✅ Lots of hidden depth and strategy\n✅ Free to play, no paywall\n✅ Relaxing and simple\n\nCons:\n❌ Can feel grindy and repetitive\n❌ Progress slows down over time\n❌ Minimal visual or gameplay variety\n\nOverall:\nClicker Heroes is one of those games that you don’t play for the story or action — you play it for that satisfying sense of progression. It’s the perfect “background game,” something to click while watching YouTube or doing something else. Even after all these years, it still stands as one of the best examples of how to make an idle game both fun and addictive.",

You start off mildly curious, clicking a slime, and suddenly you’re obsessively calculating quadrillions of damage per second while your mouse quietly files for divorce. Heroes explode into gold, numbers skyrocket, and somehow hiring a hero named King Midas feels morally correct despite the chaos. It’s addictive, ridiculous, and perfect for anyone who wants to feel powerful without doing literally anything. 10/10, my fingers hurt but my ego is huge.",

      "review": "I’ve spent some time with this game and honestly, it surprised me in a way I didn’t fully expect. I don’t want to sound dramatic, but there’s something oddly satisfying about how everything fits together — not in some perfect, polished “advertisement” way, but more like a game that knows exactly what it wants to be and just… goes for it.\n\nThe first thing I noticed is the atmosphere. Every part of the game — the visuals, the sound, the pacing — kind of blends into this feeling that you’re actually inside its world, even if you’re just casually playing. I know that sounds a bit cliché, but it’s true. Sometimes it’s chaotic, sometimes slow, sometimes you’re just wandering around thinking “ok, what now?” but that’s honestly part of the charm. The game doesn’t try to rush you unless it actually needs to.\n\nGameplay-wise, it has this mix of familiar elements and small twists that keep things from feeling stale. Nothing groundbreaking, maybe, but it all works together in a way that feels natural. There were moments when I thought “yeah, I’ve seen this in other games,” but then the game throws in tiny details or unexpected interactions that make it stand out just enough. It’s the kind of thing you only notice after a few hours, when you start connecting the dots.\n\nPerformance has been mostly fine. A little rough spot here and there, but honestly, show me a game these days that doesn’t have something weird happening once in a while. Nothing game-breaking on my end, at least. You can clearly tell the developers put effort into this, even if a few edges are still a bit sharp. Again — part of the charm.\n\nWhat I really appreciate is that the game gives you space to play the way you want. Some people will rush through every objective, others will take their time exploring or messing around, and both approaches actually feel valid. I like games that don’t punish you for not following some “correct” path.\n\nOverall, I’d say this is one of those titles that grows on you the longer you play. It doesn’t try too hard to impress in the first five minutes — instead it slowly builds its identity, layer by layer, until you suddenly realize you’ve been playing way longer than you planned. If you’re looking for something that balances comfort with challenge, familiar mechanics with fresh touches, and a world that’s just fun to be in, then I genuinely think this one is worth giving a shot.\n\nWould I recommend it?\nYeah, I would — maybe not to everyone, because no game is for everyone, but definitely to anyone who likes getting lost in a game for a bit and discovering things at their own pace.",

You can earn the p2w currency by playing the game and just clicking the goldfish that appears every few minutes. Another way of getting the currency is using mercenaries  that may have ruby missions that can be time skipped. The last way to get rubies is to participate in guild battles. you can get a couple hundred a day or more by fighting AND killing the guild boss. So whether you find an active guild( like Palworld) or you create a solo guild, you can get rubies if you lock the boss level within the health range that you and your guild can one shot it. \r\n\r\nIf you are ever going to use a time skip, make sure to look at your mercenaries before and after to mitigate the rubies being spent. \r\n\r\nMy main complaint about this game and its nothing new to the developers or the community..... memory leak. If you plan to play this game, do not leave it alone without monitoring your pc every so often. I left the game minimized and it went from 500MB of ram (excessive for a game that is a quarter of that size) to 24 gb of ram in an 8 hour period. I know clicker heroes 2 was taken off the steam market place but respectfully, this game should also be taken off because a game should not be able to reach the ram size that is 200 times the actual game size.
