      "review": "[h2] 😸 Fishers Fishing Journey Review 🎣 [/h2]\n\nFishers Fishing Journey is an incredibly addictive and adorable idle game! Your job as Fisher is to collect fish of different types, grades, and even special quest items to help her friends. While fishing, you can also discover cute decorations.\n\nLet’s talk fish! There are plenty of them to catch, and each of the five fishing areas has its own unique species. The game makes it easy to keep track of everything with a well organized fishpedia sorted by category and location. Some fish require specific bait or weather conditions, and the weather system itself is really fun, each map has its own patterns that affect what you can catch. While exploring new areas, Fisher will meet new friends. Each zone has two NPCs you can help, and completing their quests rewards you with useful fishing buffs or adorable RV decorations.\n\nSpeaking of the RV… This is Kiki’s domain! She’s a tiny mouse (I think?) who runs the shop where you’ll buy bait, unlock new areas, upgrade bag space, purchase chums, and collect decorations for Fisher and your fish tanks.\n\nAh yes, the fish tanks! I absolutely love games with fish tanks. Your main magic tank is the most important one, as it generates money depending on the fish you place inside. Adding multiple of the same type boosts earnings, but mixing different fish can also be beneficial, it’s entirely up to your strategy. There are also extra decorative tanks to store and display fish however you like. I used one just to keep rainbow shiny fish for an achievement, and it was perfect.\n\nA quick note on a small glitch: I ran into a visual bug when leveling up Kiki’s shop. Sometimes the required fishpedia completion percentage doesn’t appear in her dialogue bubble, you only see the coin requirement. If the shop isn’t leveling up even after you’ve earned the right amount of coins, you probably just need to increase your fishpedia percentage. It’s harmless, just a bit confusing at first.\n\nFishers Fishing Journey is a delightful and relaxing idle game. Early on, bag space requires some attention so Fisher doesn’t stop to take “tea breaks,” but upgrades fix that over time. The achievements are straightforward and very doable, though completing the fishpedia can take a while. I’m 160 hours in and still hunting down a few rare fish, even with max rod upgrades, luck and patience are key.\n\nEnjoy your time, Fishers!!🐟\n\n[quote]Tip: If you want to find more reviews like this, check out our curator page [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/41527689/]Moon's Tea House[/url][/quote]",

      "review": "[h2] 😸 Fishers Fishing Journey Review 🎣 [/h2]\n\nFishers Fishing Journey is an incredibly addictive and adorable idle game! Your job as Fisher is to collect fish of different types, grades, and even special quest items to help her friends. While fishing, you can also discover cute decorations.\n\nLet’s talk fish! There are plenty of them to catch, and each of the five fishing areas has its own unique species. The game makes it easy to keep track of everything with a well organized fishpedia sorted by category and location. Some fish require specific bait or weather conditions, and the weather system itself is really fun, each map has its own patterns that affect what you can catch. While exploring new areas, Fisher will meet new friends. Each zone has two NPCs you can help, and completing their quests rewards you with useful fishing buffs or adorable RV decorations.\n\nSpeaking of the RV… This is Kiki’s domain! She’s a tiny mouse (I think?) who runs the shop where you’ll buy bait, unlock new areas, upgrade bag space, purchase chums, and collect decorations for Fisher and your fish tanks.\n\nAh yes, the fish tanks! I absolutely love games with fish tanks. Your main magic tank is the most important one, as it generates money depending on the fish you place inside. Adding multiple of the same type boosts earnings, but mixing different fish can also be beneficial, it’s entirely up to your strategy. There are also extra decorative tanks to store and display fish however you like. I used one just to keep rainbow shiny fish for an achievement, and it was perfect.\n\nA quick note on a small glitch: I ran into a visual bug when leveling up Kiki’s shop. Sometimes the required fishpedia completion percentage doesn’t appear in her dialogue bubble, you only see the coin requirement. If the shop isn’t leveling up even after you’ve earned the right amount of coins, you probably just need to increase your fishpedia percentage. It’s harmless, just a bit confusing at first.\n\nFishers Fishing Journey is a delightful and relaxing idle game. Early on, bag space requires some attention so Fisher doesn’t stop to take “tea breaks,” but upgrades fix that over time. The achievements are straightforward and very doable, though completing the fishpedia can take a while. I’m 160 hours in and still hunting down a few rare fish, even with max rod upgrades, luck and patience are key.\n\nEnjoy your time, Fishers!!🐟\n\n[quote]Tip: If you want to find more reviews like this, check out our curator page [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/41527689/]Moon's Tea House[/url][/quote]",
