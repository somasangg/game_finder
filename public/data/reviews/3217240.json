For example, there are many flaws in the gameplay — your player sometimes performs acrobatic moves, and most of the goals end up being headers, which adds an unrealistic element to the game. There are also players who score up to 60 goals per season, which is also a bit unrealistic.\n\nHowever, the game has its positives too. For instance, the interface is simple (in my opinion, even better than Football Manager 24). Transfers and player scouting are also simplified and enjoyable. I would also like to see the removal of player \"boosts,\" as they make the game less realistic and add a bit of a pay-to-win element.\n\nOverall, as a free football manager game, it’s not bad — I’d give it a solid 7 out of 10.\nOn the PC version, there are also no ads, which is great compared to the annoying ads on mobile.",

It has many things that you need to do as a manager, so it is realistic. There is a glitch with corners, as sometimes the ball gets stuck in the players hand and when they score it is still in the corner kick takers hand. Aside from the few bugs, it is a very good game with good potential. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a free-to-play soccer/football manager.",
