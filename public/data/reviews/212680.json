      "review": "\"To boldly go where no man has gone before.\" – Captain James T. Kirk\r\n\r\nFTL manages to immerse you in a brand new story every single time you set out in a shiny new ship. As you’ve probably gathered from other reviews, you will die often and spectacularly. Your crew will suffocate to death, be eaten by giant mutant space spiders, get beaten to death by rock aliens or mantises, burn up while flying too close to a sun, or be wiped out by a virus. Over and over again. FTL is brutally hard, and that’s exactly where its beauty lies. Your ship and crew improve gradually, and every loss hurts. When a beloved slugman, human, or android gets sucked into the cold abyss of space, it stings every time. Few games manage to create such an intricate, random, and volatile universe as FTL does. The tactical sacrifices you’ll be forced to make will make you cringe, curse your luck, and swear vengeance on the rebel fleet all while pushing you to keep going for just one more run.\r\n\r\nThe combat system is deep enough to deserve its own Wikipedia page. Every weapon, ship upgrade, character ability, and subsystem has its own strengths and weaknesses, and understanding them along with those of your enemies is key to survival. Balancing your ship’s limited power between weapons, shields, and other systems is one of the most brilliant mechanics ever designed. You never know what the next FTL jump will bring, so every decision feels like a gamble whether you’re spending scrap to upgrade your shields, repair your hull, hire new crew, or buy a beam drone. The game is smart, punishing, and completely engrossing.",

      "review": "Reviewing (mostly) every game (or DLC) in my library, part 496:\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️☆☆☆ (7/10)\n\n[i]FTL: Faster Than Light[/i] is a tense, thrilling space roguelike that rewards strategic thinking and punishes mistakes mercilessly. You take control of a starship traveling through hostile sectors of space, trying to deliver vital information to save the galaxy. Every run is different, with randomized encounters, varied ship layouts, and unpredictable enemies. The game thrives on its emergent storytelling: a ship on fire, a panicked crew member, a sudden boarding party, or an alien distress call can completely change your course of action and test your tactical skills. While I had some fun, it just doesn't have any staying power for me. Still, it goes on sale often—and for a cheap price!\n\n[b][h2]Pros:[/h2][/b]\n✅  Strategic depth and resource management. Every decision matters—do you divert power from weapons to shields to survive a surprise attack? Should you send a crew member to repair the engine mid-battle, or keep them at their station? You also focus on crew placement, skill specialization, money, and system upgrades.\n\n✅ Randomized events! From encounters with hostile ships and rebels to mysterious planets and distress calls, the unpredictable nature of the great galaxy keeps you guessing. I felt rewarded for every decision I made, even the little ones.\n\n✅ Immersive atmosphere/UI. I'm not usually a fan of pixel art, but every square is so clean and clear, it's easy to see everything. You can see ship layouts, enemy positions, and damage. The music is pretty great, very space-y. I only had to hover over icons to see any details. Not a lot of hidden menus like in other roguelikes. \n\n✅ Still works on Mac!\n\n[b][h2]Cons:[/h2][/b]\n🟥 Limited long-term staying power. The core mechanics are excellent but for me, it's not something I would go back to. Not sure why!\n\n🟥 Resource micromanagement can be stressful. I played on Normal, and the jump up from Easy in difficulty was noticeable. Managing fuel, missiles, drone parts, and repairs while juggling combat and system failures creates tension, but it can feel overwhelming, especially during longer, multi-sector runs. Mistakes can be punished harshly. \n\n🟥 Minimal narrative depth. The game tells stories emergently through its events, but I don't think there's any overarching narrative beyond your mission. But I could be wrong.\n\n[hr]\nIf you enjoyed this review, please check out my curator page to find more: [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45814768-Verdict-Play-or-Pass/]Verdict: Play or Pass.

      "review": "FTL: Faster Than Light is a masterpiece in strategy, game design, and world building. Despite its rather old age, this game remains as one of my top favorite strategy games of all time. The game is not afraid to be brutal and cruel, especially when the going gets tough and you find yourself backed in a corner with no supplies, no fuel, and not enough shields or weapons. This game does not pull its punches, but if you focus, learn, and make the right choices, you can find yourself as an unstoppable beast that can destroy anything in your path. This game can be dopamine incarnate if you sit on it long enough, and it is worth every second of me playing it.\r\n\r\nNow typically, I HATE, keyword, HHHAAATTTEEE strategy games. My brain loses all function and starts to panic at even the smallest mistake, and any time something doesn't go the way I planned or I get screwed over by RNGesus, I want to do nothing except hit the \"retry\" button, or get bored quickly and rush towards the quit button. I don't know why, I don't know how, but FTL somehow just works for me. It feels tough, but fair. Yes, it has RNG. Yes, it can REALLY screw you over at times. Yes, you WILL get angry occasionally and want to throw your keyboard at your cat (maybe don't do that). But despite all of that, FTL remains fun and enjoyable.\r\n\r\nYou may be wondering how exactly FTL does things better than a lot of other strategy/resource management. Frankly, there is no singular answer. The story is vague yet interesting enough to get you hooked on the characters, different races, different factions, and how they coexist with one another. Every time you play a run, it's as though you learn a little bit more about the vast universe you find yourself in. The gameplay is deep and how you play or what items or weapons you get will change every time, you are never guaranteed to get the same thing or setup every run, and that is what makes each run feel special and like your own little adventure across the cosmos.\r\n\r\nThe UI relays all the details you need and want, without requiring you to opens several other menus or use your keyboard like a piano every time you want to do actions quickly. However, if you have played the game, you might think the last statement is rather false if you use the several different keybinds to do your separate actions. That is where the almighty pause button comes in, allowing you to pause time and plan your attacks accordingly at the enemy ship or swap your reactor power around to your other systems of importance.\r\n\r\nAs for the rest of the gameplay and mechanics... the tutorial will teach you most of what you need to know. It's recomended you play on Normal for your first run to get a feel for the game. Don't feel tempted to change difficulty lower if you feel frustrated, you will learn what you need to do with time, but do what you want! If you want to play on Easy (like I do) then it is entirely up to you!\r\n\r\nFTL is a playground of space jokes, Star Trek/Star Wars references, and deep philosophies that will make you think if your next decision is worth potentially destroying your entire ship and your crew along with it at the chance of getting a little extra scrap, the currency throughout FTL.\r\nPatrol the universe, escape the Rebel Fleet, deliver the information, destroy the Flagship, be prepared.\r\nGood luck Captain, the fate of the entire Federation lies within your hands. And remember, giant alien spiders are no joke. ;)",

There's just nothing like it and it left an itch that has not been scratched without a sequel. I just recently played VoidWars which is like a respectful clone of FTL, and Multiverse which is a Mod that adds a story on the scale of Lord of the Rings to the epic game mechanics created by Subset games. \n\nVoidWars changed the aesthetic and feel so much, with the weird Old English letters, and calling everything ancient that the game was hard to play. FTL had this very Starwars/ Indiana Jones-esque feel to it as you raced across the universe and encountered unexpected, exciting, and mysterious adventures, ancient artifacts, creative technology, and ominous mysticism. Voidwars did not get that. However the creators of the Multiverse Mod did. They created something that deserves so  much credit. It's not unlike what Obsidian did when they took over Fallout and made New Vegas.\n\nWhat was lacking from Subset's FTL, that you feel after you beat it, was that there wasn't much of a story and the game was a bit too short. Multiverse really hit the spot with what they did. It's kind of sad that many people may not even play it because it's considered a mod rather than an actual sequel, yet the experiences was like playing New Vegas and Zelda 64. It was a sequel that kept all the best elements of the predecessor, but added beyond the amount of content a gamer would hope for, in all the innovations they implemented in the game from the amazing story to what seemed like and endless list of new races and ships. What a joy it was to play FTL years ago and then Multiverse this week, which is basically a free mod if you purchase FTL.",

If I could rate it on a scale of 1-10, I'd give it a 7.5\n\nI am writing this review as someone who has literally obtained every single achievement, in-game and out, in FTL, at the hardest difficulty. I have pumped countless hours into the game (my actual hours are a quite deceptive because I left it running a number of times overnight).\n\nAnd yet I realize that with the dawn of modern rougelites, FTL simply no longer holds up anymore. It has two fundamental problems that many modern games of similar type simply don't have anymore, which significantly hampered my interest in the game in the later stages of my 100%ing, and, though I only realize in retrospect, caused me some serious frustration throughout my entire playtime.\n\nRNG:\nFTL has a serious RNG issue. One of the more fundamental aspects of the game is \"evasion,\" or a % chance for you and the enemy to entirely avoid shots. Add this together with the enemy AI that randomly targets rooms, and you get a recipe for disaster. You can get completely screwed over even when you've been playing incredibly well by an enemy repeatedly hitting and landing shots on your most necessary systems and/or you repeatedly missing the opponent. Of course, true randomness is the single most fair thing in the world. You're bound to get lucky just as much as you get unlucky. The problem is that, in FTL, getting lucky is very very similar to average luck when it comes to evasion and enemy AI. Landing 100% of your shots is pretty damn similar to landing 80%. Getting slammed by no missiles is pretty similar to getting slammed by one in an empty room. This leads to an experience where most of the game feels normal and fun, and then every now and then you get hit by varying degrees of frustrating, terrible luck without ever truly feeling the benefits of good RNG. With one exception where you can get lucky: equipment.\n\nBALANCING:\nFTL has a wide variety of fascinating and interesting equipment, that I would love to use. But it has one MASSIVE issue. 80% of it is simply not very good. You realize very quickly if you play the game more than a few times that by far the best equipment is the least interesting. Burst lasers. Beams with no special traits. Standard ions. Flak (more RNG yippee). The most interesting equipment, like missiles that pierce shields and have ammo economy, utility bombs that can do things like repair your own systems or heal your crew, attack drones that swarm the enemy ship, interesting variants of base weapons that get stronger over time or charge multiple projectiles, and boarding drones that breach into the enemy ship, are all almost useless. To be clear, if you have the weapons power and the weapon, there's no reason NOT to run the equipment. But if you want to win the game, your biggest priority should be to get to a shop and replace the interesting equipment with some more mundane, effective equipment. And this is so sad to me. Because these problems could have easily been solved with a couple rounds of equipment balance over the course of a single week.\n\nINTO THE BREACH:\nI said that many of the problems in FTL have been solved by modern rougelites, so I should probably follow through with an example. And what better example is there than a game by Subset Games themselves. Into the Breach is Subset Games' second game after FTL, and is probably my favorite game I've ever played. It doesn't FULLY succeed at everything FTL fails at, but it significantly improves on the equipment balancing aspect and completely erases the RNG concerns. Go buy it. Unless you hate strategy games. But even then. Maybe.\n\nAll of this being said, I feel compelled to reiterate, FTL is not a BAD game, it's just a game that, as the review suggests, I would not personally recommend in 2025, due to there being far better alternatives out there.

On the PC, I gave it enough time to show me that my initial thoughts on its design were accurate.\r\n\r\nThe potential is there, but because of poor game design, the potential is just wasted.\r\n\r\nThe game does some things well.  You travel through a series of progressive sectors, accumulating upgrades and currency (scrap metal).  You have to consider your current and future needs in the face of limited resources.  All of that is awesome, and this is why I wanted to like the game.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that instead of giving enemy ships legitimate tactics and strategy, the only way the developers can make the game a challenge is with a childish random luck scheme.  In the end, it just feels like a sophisticated game of roulette, where you have no control over the RNG (luck) of the situation that determines whether you succeed.  Sure, if you go through 6 out of 7 jumps where you hit empty stars or just intruders without reward (4 of the 7 mentioned), then that will likely make the game difficulty increase.  But why make the game difficult in that way?  Why not just make the game smarter and more balanced?  If the difficulty can only be achieved by a lack of balance.. well, that statement makes its own case.\r\n\r\nShip combat is dreary because the enemy is lazy and stupid.  When enemy ships have the ability to shut down my systems (hack), they can either target something critical to me, or something I don't need to defeat them.  They often shoot out useless ships systems.  I would have preferred if the developers had created a challenge for you by giving the opponents some semblance of tactical intelligence.  Sure, give it a hack to shut down my critical system, and then nerf it somewhere else.  Don't just nerf the enemy ship's ability to use the hack.  The random (and stupid) ways that enemy ships use their systems tells me that there was literally no thought put into enemy tactics.\r\n\r\nSo, in the absence of good design, the various difficulty levels use resource scarcity and random sector fails to make the game hard.  In the end, whether you win or lose, you feel like it was little more than a good or bad set of dice rolls that got you there, not something you had much control over.  They could only make the game difficult by placing important resources in ways that you cannot obtain what you need, or offering you things you will need later, but couldn't possibly afford on the second jump of the game (looking at you, cloaking device).\r\n\r\nI realise this game is 12 years old or so now.  But they could make better computer opponents than this in the 90s.  \r\n\r\nAgain, I really wanted to like this little game.  This is just a cautionary tale for anyone looking at the game.

      "review": "This is genuinely the worst roguelike I've ever played, and it baffles me how the team who went on to make Into the Breach, which is quite possibly the best roguelike ever, made this piece of space junk.\n\nThis game is not only based on RNG for each run's events, as most roguelikes are, but is entirely dependent on it in its gameplay. I can enjoy RNG in a game like Into the Breach because my choices still have consistent weight to them, even if the rewards I get or the enemy movements I get are not up to me. If you do not get lucky in this game, you will lose and no amount of skill or knowledge will ever save you. Random hit chance on both sides is absolutely cancerous on this game's fun, as it makes at ABSOLUTE MINIMUM one out of five shots completely useless. I do not know who came up with this, but it's absolutely infuriating to watch an enemy dodge literally everything you throw at them and then get hit with a billion rockets in a row. And it's not like player ship dodges are satisfying either, because you can never rely on dodging or build into it due to how poorly engine investment scales.\n\nThis isn't the end of the RNG fest too, since this game's upgrades are not only random so you can never actually play the build you want to play, but are so easy to miss that you will often have your progression thrown into a choke hold if you play an even remotely specialized ship until the game decides you're allowed to have the items that you can use. It's absolutely awful compared to games like Into the Breach, a game made by the same studio, where upgrades are guaranteed at the end of every area and are so generalized that any team can use at least one thing they're offered.\n\nThis does not feel like a roguelike, or at least not like a good one. This feels like being blindfolded, spun around, and then forced to roll a dice repeatedly until either it lands on a one and get your brains blown out or you reach the end and get allowed to leave. Yes it has a charming aesthetic, yes it has good worldbuilding that is both interesting and deep, but if all of that is attached to a complete abomination of a gameplay loop, I can't recommend engaging in this game beyond reading the lore online and watching youtube videos about it. \nIn short, go play Into the Breach, it's actually fun and rewards you for thinking, and is a much better showing from Subset.",

It doesn't FULLY succeed at everything FTL fails at, but it significantly improves on the equipment balancing aspect and completely erases the RNG concerns. Go buy it. Unless you hate strategy games. But even then. Maybe.\n\nAll of this being said, I feel compelled to reiterate, FTL is not a BAD game, it's just a game that, as the review suggests, I would not personally recommend in 2025, due to there being far better alternatives out there. Had this review been made back in 2015, this absolutely would have been a recommendation.",

On the PC, I gave it enough time to show me that my initial thoughts on its design were accurate.\r\n\r\nThe potential is there, but because of poor game design, the potential is just wasted.\r\n\r\nThe game does some things well.  You travel through a series of progressive sectors, accumulating upgrades and currency (scrap metal).  You have to consider your current and future needs in the face of limited resources.  All of that is awesome, and this is why I wanted to like the game.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that instead of giving enemy ships legitimate tactics and strategy, the only way the developers can make the game a challenge is with a childish random luck scheme.  In the end, it just feels like a sophisticated game of roulette, where you have no control over the RNG (luck) of the situation that determines whether you succeed.  Sure, if you go through 6 out of 7 jumps where you hit empty stars or just intruders without reward (4 of the 7 mentioned), then that will likely make the game difficulty increase.  But why make the game difficult in that way?  Why not just make the game smarter and more balanced?  If the difficulty can only be achieved by a lack of balance.. well, that statement makes its own case.\r\n\r\nShip combat is dreary because the enemy is lazy and stupid.  When enemy ships have the ability to shut down my systems (hack), they can either target something critical to me, or something I don't need to defeat them.  They often shoot out useless ships systems.  I would have preferred if the developers had created a challenge for you by giving the opponents some semblance of tactical intelligence.  Sure, give it a hack to shut down my critical system, and then nerf it somewhere else.  Don't just nerf the enemy ship's ability to use the hack.  The random (and stupid) ways that enemy ships use their systems tells me that there was literally no thought put into enemy tactics.\r\n\r\nSo, in the absence of good design, the various difficulty levels use resource scarcity and random sector fails to make the game hard.  In the end, whether you win or lose, you feel like it was little more than a good or bad set of dice rolls that got you there, not something you had much control over.  They could only make the game difficult by placing important resources in ways that you cannot obtain what you need, or offering you things you will need later, but couldn't possibly afford on the second jump of the game (looking at you, cloaking device).\r\n\r\nI realise this game is 12 years old or so now.  But they could make better computer opponents than this in the 90s.  \r\n\r\nAgain, I really wanted to like this little game.  This is just a cautionary tale for anyone looking at the game.

      "review": "As a preliminary statement, this review never would have been a recommendation, but I wouldn't have left a review at all (positive or negative) if I didn't want to reach people interested in the problems others see in the game. If I could rate it on a scale of 1-10, I'd give it a 7.5\n\nI am writing this review as someone who has literally obtained every single achievement, in-game and out, in FTL, at the hardest difficulty. I have pumped countless hours into the game (my actual hours are a quite deceptive because I left it running a number of times overnight).\n\nAnd yet I realize that with the dawn of modern rougelites, FTL simply no longer holds up anymore. It has two fundamental problems that many modern games of similar type simply don't have anymore, which significantly hampered my interest in the game in the later stages of my 100%ing, and, though I only realize in retrospect, caused me some serious frustration throughout my entire playtime.\n\nRNG:\nFTL has a serious RNG issue. One of the more fundamental aspects of the game is \"evasion,\" or a % chance for you and the enemy to entirely avoid shots. Add this together with the enemy AI that randomly targets rooms, and you get a recipe for disaster. You can get completely screwed over even when you've been playing incredibly well by an enemy repeatedly hitting and landing shots on your most necessary systems and/or you repeatedly missing the opponent. Of course, true randomness is the single most fair thing in the world. You're bound to get lucky just as much as you get unlucky. The problem is that, in FTL, getting lucky is very very similar to average luck when it comes to evasion and enemy AI. Landing 100% of your shots is pretty damn similar to landing 80%. Getting slammed by no missiles is pretty similar to getting slammed by one in an empty room. This leads to an experience where most of the game feels normal and fun, and then every now and then you get hit by varying degrees of frustrating, terrible luck without ever truly feeling the benefits of good RNG. With one exception where you can get lucky: equipment.\n\nBALANCING:\nFTL has a wide variety of fascinating and interesting equipment, that I would love to use. But it has one MASSIVE issue. 80% of it is simply not very good. You realize very quickly if you play the game more than a few times that by far the best equipment is the least interesting. Burst lasers. Beams with no special traits. Standard ions. Flak (more RNG yippee). The most interesting equipment, like missiles that pierce shields and have ammo economy, utility bombs that can do things like repair your own systems or heal your crew, attack drones that swarm the enemy ship, interesting variants of base weapons that get stronger over time or charge multiple projectiles, and boarding drones that breach into the enemy ship, are all almost useless. To be clear, if you have the weapons power and the weapon, there's no reason NOT to run the equipment. But if you want to win the game, your biggest priority should be to get to a shop and replace the interesting equipment with some more mundane, effective equipment. And this is so sad to me. Because these problems could have easily been solved with a couple rounds of equipment balance over the course of a single week.\n\nINTO THE BREACH:\nI said that many of the problems in FTL have been solved by modern rougelites, so I should probably follow through with an example. And what better example is there than a game by Subset Games themselves. Into the Breach is Subset Games' second game after FTL, and is probably my favorite game I've ever played.

If I could rate it on a scale of 1-10, I'd give it a 7.5\n\nI am writing this review as someone who has literally obtained every single achievement, in-game and out, in FTL, at the hardest difficulty. I have pumped countless hours into the game (my actual hours are a quite deceptive because I left it running a number of times overnight).\n\nAnd yet I realize that with the dawn of modern rougelites, FTL simply no longer holds up anymore. It has two fundamental problems that many modern games of similar type simply don't have anymore, which significantly hampered my interest in the game in the later stages of my 100%ing, and, though I only realize in retrospect, caused me some serious frustration throughout my entire playtime.\n\nRNG:\nFTL has a serious RNG issue. One of the more fundamental aspects of the game is \"evasion,\" or a % chance for you and the enemy to entirely avoid shots. Add this together with the enemy AI that randomly targets rooms, and you get a recipe for disaster. You can get completely screwed over even when you've been playing incredibly well by an enemy repeatedly hitting and landing shots on your most necessary systems and/or you repeatedly missing the opponent. Of course, true randomness is the single most fair thing in the world. You're bound to get lucky just as much as you get unlucky. The problem is that, in FTL, getting lucky is very very similar to average luck when it comes to evasion and enemy AI. Landing 100% of your shots is pretty damn similar to landing 80%. Getting slammed by no missiles is pretty similar to getting slammed by one in an empty room. This leads to an experience where most of the game feels normal and fun, and then every now and then you get hit by varying degrees of frustrating, terrible luck without ever truly feeling the benefits of good RNG. With one exception where you can get lucky: equipment.\n\nBALANCING:\nFTL has a wide variety of fascinating and interesting equipment, that I would love to use. But it has one MASSIVE issue. 80% of it is simply not very good. You realize very quickly if you play the game more than a few times that by far the best equipment is the least interesting. Burst lasers. Beams with no special traits. Standard ions. Flak (more RNG yippee). The most interesting equipment, like missiles that pierce shields and have ammo economy, utility bombs that can do things like repair your own systems or heal your crew, attack drones that swarm the enemy ship, interesting variants of base weapons that get stronger over time or charge multiple projectiles, and boarding drones that breach into the enemy ship, are all almost useless. To be clear, if you have the weapons power and the weapon, there's no reason NOT to run the equipment. But if you want to win the game, your biggest priority should be to get to a shop and replace the interesting equipment with some more mundane, effective equipment. And this is so sad to me. Because these problems could have easily been solved with a couple rounds of equipment balance over the course of a single week.\n\nINTO THE BREACH:\nI said that many of the problems in FTL have been solved by modern rougelites, so I should probably follow through with an example. And what better example is there than a game by Subset Games themselves. Into the Breach is Subset Games' second game after FTL, and is probably my favorite game I've ever played. It doesn't FULLY succeed at everything FTL fails at, but it significantly improves on the equipment balancing aspect and completely erases the RNG concerns. Go buy it. Unless you hate strategy games. But even then. Maybe.\n\nAll of this being said, I feel compelled to reiterate, FTL is not a BAD game, it's just a game that, as the review suggests, I would not personally recommend in 2025, due to there being far better alternatives out there. Had this review been made back in 2015, this absolutely would have been a recommendation.",

And it's not like player ship dodges are satisfying either, because you can never rely on dodging or build into it due to how poorly engine investment scales.\n\nThis isn't the end of the RNG fest too, since this game's upgrades are not only random so you can never actually play the build you want to play, but are so easy to miss that you will often have your progression thrown into a choke hold if you play an even remotely specialized ship until the game decides you're allowed to have the items that you can use. It's absolutely awful compared to games like Into the Breach, a game made by the same studio, where upgrades are guaranteed at the end of every area and are so generalized that any team can use at least one thing they're offered.\n\nThis does not feel like a roguelike, or at least not like a good one. This feels like being blindfolded, spun around, and then forced to roll a dice repeatedly until either it lands on a one and get your brains blown out or you reach the end and get allowed to leave. Yes it has a charming aesthetic, yes it has good worldbuilding that is both interesting and deep, but if all of that is attached to a complete abomination of a gameplay loop, I can't recommend engaging in this game beyond reading the lore online and watching youtube videos about it. \nIn short, go play Into the Breach, it's actually fun and rewards you for thinking, and is a much better showing from Subset.",

      "review": "I can definitely see the appeal. However, my biggest gripe is that the core gameplay loop doesn't feel engaging. When making choices or battling ships I'm just clicking buttons, watching numbers go up and down. Which would be fine, but the numbers game isn't that engaging at all here. Combat is just too slow and it feels like chipping away, which isn't fun for me. Also, the SFX and music sound super spacey generic and bland but that's not enough to sway my opinion on the game. Buy the game and play for an hour and you'll know if you'll like it or not.",

      "review": "As a preliminary statement, this review never would have been a recommendation, but I wouldn't have left a review at all (positive or negative) if I didn't want to reach people interested in the problems others see in the game. If I could rate it on a scale of 1-10, I'd give it a 7.5\n\nI am writing this review as someone who has literally obtained every single achievement, in-game and out, in FTL, at the hardest difficulty. I have pumped countless hours into the game (my actual hours are a quite deceptive because I left it running a number of times overnight).\n\nAnd yet I realize that with the dawn of modern rougelites, FTL simply no longer holds up anymore. It has two fundamental problems that many modern games of similar type simply don't have anymore, which significantly hampered my interest in the game in the later stages of my 100%ing, and, though I only realize in retrospect, caused me some serious frustration throughout my entire playtime.\n\nRNG:\nFTL has a serious RNG issue. One of the more fundamental aspects of the game is \"evasion,\" or a % chance for you and the enemy to entirely avoid shots. Add this together with the enemy AI that randomly targets rooms, and you get a recipe for disaster. You can get completely screwed over even when you've been playing incredibly well by an enemy repeatedly hitting and landing shots on your most necessary systems and/or you repeatedly missing the opponent. Of course, true randomness is the single most fair thing in the world. You're bound to get lucky just as much as you get unlucky. The problem is that, in FTL, getting lucky is very very similar to average luck when it comes to evasion and enemy AI. Landing 100% of your shots is pretty damn similar to landing 80%. Getting slammed by no missiles is pretty similar to getting slammed by one in an empty room. This leads to an experience where most of the game feels normal and fun, and then every now and then you get hit by varying degrees of frustrating, terrible luck without ever truly feeling the benefits of good RNG. With one exception where you can get lucky: equipment.\n\nBALANCING:\nFTL has a wide variety of fascinating and interesting equipment, that I would love to use. But it has one MASSIVE issue. 80% of it is simply not very good. You realize very quickly if you play the game more than a few times that by far the best equipment is the least interesting. Burst lasers. Beams with no special traits. Standard ions. Flak (more RNG yippee). The most interesting equipment, like missiles that pierce shields and have ammo economy, utility bombs that can do things like repair your own systems or heal your crew, attack drones that swarm the enemy ship, interesting variants of base weapons that get stronger over time or charge multiple projectiles, and boarding drones that breach into the enemy ship, are all almost useless. To be clear, if you have the weapons power and the weapon, there's no reason NOT to run the equipment. But if you want to win the game, your biggest priority should be to get to a shop and replace the interesting equipment with some more mundane, effective equipment. And this is so sad to me. Because these problems could have easily been solved with a couple rounds of equipment balance over the course of a single week.\n\nINTO THE BREACH:\nI said that many of the problems in FTL have been solved by modern rougelites, so I should probably follow through with an example. And what better example is there than a game by Subset Games themselves. Into the Breach is Subset Games' second game after FTL, and is probably my favorite game I've ever played. It doesn't FULLY succeed at everything FTL fails at, but it significantly improves on the equipment balancing aspect and completely erases the RNG concerns. Go buy it. Unless you hate strategy games. But even then. Maybe.\n\nAll of this being said, I feel compelled to reiterate, FTL is not a BAD game, it's just a game that, as the review suggests, I would not personally recommend in 2025, due to there being far better alternatives out there. Had this review been made back in 2015, this absolutely would have been a recommendation.",

Then you have to tell them to do the crap you want to do multiple times in order to get them to move somewhere\r\n\r\nThis is when you haven't started a new game, and immediately jump into the first location being a TPK\r\n\r\nAdded that there is no \"abandon game\" functionality in this. Resulting in you having to watch a doomed play through slowly die, and make all those \"do something now\" noises to make the whole thing even more irritating. I cannot do anything in this situation, and you urging me to do something when nothing can be done is just mega stressful\r\n\r\nAnd half the \"unwinnable situations\" comes from me telling the crew to do something--and they just act like nothing fscking is happening, despite me trying to select them and move them like five times before they _MIGHT_ even acknowledge what I am doing once\r\n\r\nOr how sometimes you just get stuck with the weapon cursor selected--and there is nothing to target... and you cannot just get out of that\r\n\r\nLike--I get the whole hard as nails things, sure. But I want my fsck ups to be MY FSCK UPS. I want to be able to go, \"yeah--I could have done something differently there\"--even if I don't currently know what. I don't want to have to be constantly pissing about with an interface that has me lose, because the controls IGNORED WHAT I TOLD THE GAME TO DO MULTIPLE TIMES\r\n\r\nIt is also VERY MUCH not clear what your cursor is trying to do when selecting stuff--and it kind of ends up being a weird \"well, you clicked the wrong pixel over that way\". Which is a dick move in a point'n'click type game without a timer. In a game like this where you have several things counting down, the whole \"ope, you died because you clicked a pixel too far over, and now you are opening doors instead of selecting a crew and telling them to get medical treatment--and we aren't going to make too big of an effort to tell you what current mode the cursor is currently stuck in\"\r\n\r\nHonestly, a simple fix would be to have me use the crew dialog stuff on the left side of the screen to tell them what to do. As right now, that dialog is mostly just taking up space being about as useful as tits on a submarine hull",
