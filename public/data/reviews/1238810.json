It's not perfect, but it's damn close—and way better than grinding battle royales for skins. 9/10, would storm Omaha Beach again. same struggling to reach peak in Iwo Jima mountains, welcome to rice field in wild forest dark deep nature solomon islands total wild and more and more the maps like rotterdam & operation underground in cities area literally BFV delivers every possible beautiful scenery.The single-player War Stories are a mixed bag—short\nbut yes you will enjoy doing achievements in those but BF1 war stories are much more rich.\n\nGameplay wise: Those heart-pounding \"oh crap, I'm surrounded\" moments. Gunplay is buttery smooth.\nThat signature Battlefield \"pop\" on headshots that just feels right.Medics chaining revives like a boss. This game also introduced with  Ray-tracing via DLSS, modern machines can really enjoy the beauty of this game.\n\nCurrent state: Still servers are full of players 64/64 most of the times. Met new people doing achievements with them are fun very much enjoyed every bit of this game.\n\nMust recommend 100% ❤️grab it on sale it's an absolute steal for what it offers.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3606747380",

      "review": "Campaign review: The first two acts are ok, if you like over the top melodramatic writing with very little realism or character development. Acts 3 & 4 are a huge improvement on this, with more large scale battles, better character development and some help from allied soldiers. It really does look and sound phenomenal too, huge props to the sound design team especially. DICE just made some odd choices with the campaign design.\n\nOverall, there’s just too much stealth in a game that's clearly not designed for stealth. Just let us play Battlefield please! Give us some teammates and large scale historical WW2 battles, not solo commando runs with broken stealth. \n\nFirstly, enemies have super human detection abilities, so you’re constantly forced to go solo guns blazing when every single encounter devolves into a brainless shooting gallery once stealth goes to pot. Also, why does every other German soldier carry a heavy machine gun, a rocket launcher and seemingly endless grenades? And don’t even get me started on the pointless hypothermia mechanic they randomly introduce for 5mins of gameplay in the second act. Just some odd choices across the board. \n\nI also encountered some weird glitches, like getting stuck with the binoculars or not being able to change weapons without mashing the weapon swap button a few times first.. very annoying when you’re out of ammo in the middle of a firefight.\n\nDon't buy this for the campaign unless it's significantly discounted. 6/10.",

Upgrade paths are good, creative and complex, especially the vehicles in which u can choose which type of cannons for your tanks. In-battle vehicle driving is pretty cool cuz u can switch to both fpv and tpv, but fpv while driving cars with yo squadmates on gives you the power of friendship and dive into the heavily fired area just to be slaped by a tank from 300 meters away. but overall, planes to planes, ground to ground, boats to boats, or of course, mixed, those interactions makes the game more alive\n\nAlso the definitive edition is enough cuz completing weekly missions are enough to get you in-game currencies to get the skins you want, no need for additional spendings cuz this game isn't pay to win anway.\n\nthe game runs good at med settings 1080p more than 160fps on my dumbass rtx 3050 6gb vram laptop, one can say if u wanna play bf6 but your lap bouta explode, then bfv is a good alternative\n\nsurprisingly I rarely see hackers (YES meaning I met some, but not to a certain level that the game is unfkable), and also I aint see no bots cuz those enemies keep sitting on my face ragebaiting after killing me, welp, pretty alive cuz I did em first.... and I love it\n\n> If ure looking for mass shooting games, welp give the franchise a chance, or if ur done playing bf6 and wanna look for other similar games, bfv and bf1 are good choices\n\neven tho the player base gradually drops, there are no bots in any game i have played so far (more than 100 matches, not counting those that I rage quit), usually fully 64 mindless dudes, so just dw abt it\n\nyea more than 100hours aint gonna certify me to be trustful to give all good reviews about this game and without any bad shi\nmaybe one bad shi is that the tanks are too overpowered\n\nagain, just watch ytb to have a better view, thats all",

      "review": "Battlefield V is a first-person shooter developed by DICE and published by Electronic Arts. Released in 2018, it returns the series to World War II with an emphasis on squad-based gameplay, large-scale battles, and environmental destruction powered by the Frostbite engine. It follows the Battlefield 1 formula but focuses on mobility, customization, and team coordination.\n\nGameplay combines infantry combat with vehicle warfare across massive, dynamic maps. Gunplay feels tighter than in previous entries, with noticeable recoil control and weapon differentiation. The new attrition system limits ammo and health regeneration, forcing players to rely more on support classes and resupply points. The emphasis on teamwork makes lone-wolf play less effective but adds tension and realism to coordinated fights.\n\nVisually, Battlefield V is outstanding. The lighting, particle effects, and destructible environments create a cinematic battlefield atmosphere. Maps range from snowy Norwegian fjords to North African deserts and urban ruins, each designed for both scale and tactical depth. The destruction system remains one of the best in the genre, altering cover and sightlines dynamically as battles progress.\n\nThe single-player “War Stories” campaign offers short, self-contained narratives from different perspectives of the war. These missions are well-produced but limited in scope and replay value. The writing aims for empathy and diversity rather than historical accuracy, resulting in mixed reception among players expecting a more traditional portrayal of WWII.\n\nMultiplayer is the heart of the game. Classic modes like Conquest and Breakthrough return alongside the evolving “Tides of War” live-service system that added new maps, weapons, and cosmetics over time. The lack of content at launch hurt its initial reception, but updates later expanded it into a more complete experience.\n\nTechnically, the game performs well, though early versions suffered from bugs and balance issues that were gradually resolved. Sound design is exceptional—gunfire, explosions, and voice chatter create immersive battlefield chaos. The engine handles large-scale physics and destruction efficiently on modern hardware.\n\nIn summary, Battlefield V is a visually stunning and mechanically refined shooter that captures the intensity of large-scale warfare. It’s not the most historically grounded or content-rich entry at launch, but its core gameplay and presentation remain among the strongest in the series. For players seeking dynamic, teamwork-driven battles with top-tier audiovisual fidelity, it remains a solid and evolving installment in the Battlefield franchise.",

But I would have wished for a bit longer time-to-kill or less accurate weapons to create a more intense shootout experience rather than a meatgrinder.\n\nI kind of regret not picking this up earlier, like a year after launch, when it would’ve been possible to get some friends on board, because playing with random squadmates is also a complete coinflip in terms of skill and general game awareness.\n\nOh, and the campaign is quite poor. Linear corridors where they take some puzzling liberties in re-telling mostly unknown tales from WW2. As a Norwegian who has been told about the Rjukan-operation since I was I child, I can't get why they didn't just go with the real life story rather than making up their own. \n\nWhy DICE even bothers wasting resources on making campaigns when they’ve never managed anything better than \"okay+\" in the Bad Company games is something I'll never understand.\n\n8/10 for the multiplayer.\n5/10 for the campaign.",

      "review": "The setting of World War II being revisionist history'd into oblivion. There were NOT equal amounts of female soldiers in the Wehrmacht as there were men. There were NOT equal amounts of females in GIs with elite weaponry storming Normandy. This game is a disgrace that shits on the memory of people who were dragged from their homes to die shrieking alone and in agony on foreign soil to save the world.\n\nMaybe women were in plenty of modern wars, but I for one am sick of seeing the heroics and sacrifice of men being credited to everyone instead of those who actually fought and died for it. Women suffered in WWII, it's certainly true, but men fought it. Let's not keep teaching new generations lies until noone remembers what happened.\n\nI know this is like saying the sky is blue, but shame on you, EA. I really want to switch from the slurry COD has become back to Battlefield but you're making it hard with this kind of pandering. The game is mechanically fine in every way! Really, it's fantastic, and aesthetically it's beautiful, with excellent scenery, music, satisfying weapons... but the disingenuousness and lack of morals in inexcusable. Whether this is being done soulely for profit or if there's dangerous social engineering at play as well, straight-facedly trying to sell this Bizarro World rendition of WWII as a realistic shooter is erasing a sufferage that was purely men's burden and torture: being drafted back in the most brutal days of oldschool war where you were likely to get your shit bayonetted out. This isn't even something as mild as denying a woman's issue like the paygap, for example: these men lost every day of every year of the rest of their lives and every tender moment with a loved one, every song and joke they'd ever hear and every hot meal they'd enjoy to go get hacked apart and burned alive after waiting in some miserable freezing trench or in the guts of plane after plane after ship to get to the front, and it happened to an incomprehensible amount of male lives. Brainwashing a new generation to believe otherwise is like writing any of the other atrocities like black slavery, the british occupation or the Rwandan Genocide out of history using media intended to entertain. \n\nI know some bloody redditors are sitting there saying 'yeah, but all of what happens in Battlefield is fiction anyway because the characters aren't real!' Sure. That's true, but there's a difference between setting a james bond fiction in the real world with a few fake characters and rewriting that whole world in a subtle but vast way and portraying that as though that's how the setting really was back then to a huge audience, many of whom are bound to buy it. Meanwhile you'd have to have a single-digit IQ to take for granted that the characters in CoD are all faithfully recreating real people.\n\nMovies and games might seem like they're just for entertainment, but entertaining media has always been used to airbrush away horrible things people did. Uncle Remus just loved being a slave in Song of the South and all the Indians are just so stoked to be serving their abusive British bosses as they get kicked around and screamed at in It Aint Half Hot Mum. You know what the brits did in India? It wasn't good.\n\nAnd save your clown stickers, hysterical lefties: I'm not advocating that women be left out of war settings, I'm advocating for the truth: that we should tell history as faithfully as we can. Yes, by all means write a fiction, but it should never masqurade as anything but a fiction in matters as grave as tremendous amounts of people dying horiffically, especially within living memory. You might as well write an alternate history where the holocaust never took place and present it as real for how vile and revisionist it'd be.",

      "review": "The setting of World War II being revisionist history'd into oblivion. There were NOT equal amounts of female soldiers in the Wehrmacht as there were men. There were NOT equal amounts of females in GIs with elite weaponry storming Normandy. This game is a disgrace that shits on the memory of people who were dragged from their homes to die shrieking alone and in agony on foreign soil to save the world.\n\nMaybe women were in plenty of modern wars, but I for one am sick of seeing the heroics and sacrifice of men being credited to everyone instead of those who actually fought and died for it. Women suffered in WWII, it's certainly true, but men fought it. Let's not keep teaching new generations lies until noone remembers what happened.\n\nI know this is like saying the sky is blue, but shame on you, EA. I really want to switch from the slurry COD has become back to Battlefield but you're making it hard with this kind of pandering. The game is mechanically fine in every way! Really, it's fantastic, and aesthetically it's beautiful, with excellent scenery, music, satisfying weapons... but the disingenuousness and lack of morals in inexcusable. Whether this is being done soulely for profit or if there's dangerous social engineering at play as well, straight-facedly trying to sell this Bizarro World rendition of WWII as a realistic shooter is erasing a sufferage that was purely men's burden and torture: being drafted back in the most brutal days of oldschool war where you were likely to get your shit bayonetted out. This isn't even something as mild as denying a woman's issue like the paygap, for example: these men lost every day of every year of the rest of their lives and every tender moment with a loved one, every song and joke they'd ever hear and every hot meal they'd enjoy to go get hacked apart and burned alive after waiting in some miserable freezing trench or in the guts of plane after plane after ship to get to the front, and it happened to an incomprehensible amount of male lives. Brainwashing a new generation to believe otherwise is like writing any of the other atrocities like black slavery, the british occupation or the Rwandan Genocide out of history using media intended to entertain. \n\nI know some bloody redditors are sitting there saying 'yeah, but all of what happens in Battlefield is fiction anyway because the characters aren't real!' Sure. That's true, but there's a difference between setting a james bond fiction in the real world with a few fake characters and rewriting that whole world in a subtle but vast way and portraying that as though that's how the setting really was back then to a huge audience, many of whom are bound to buy it. Meanwhile you'd have to have a single-digit IQ to take for granted that the characters in CoD are all faithfully recreating real people.\n\nMovies and games might seem like they're just for entertainment, but entertaining media has always been used to airbrush away horrible things people did. Uncle Remus just loved being a slave in Song of the South and all the Indians are just so stoked to be serving their abusive British bosses as they get kicked around and screamed at in It Aint Half Hot Mum. You know what the brits did in India? It wasn't good.\n\nAnd save your clown stickers, hysterical lefties: I'm not advocating that women be left out of war settings, I'm advocating for the truth: that we should tell history as faithfully as we can. Yes, by all means write a fiction, but it should never masqurade as anything but a fiction in matters as grave as tremendous amounts of people dying horiffically, especially within living memory. You might as well write an alternate history where the holocaust never took place and present it as real for how vile and revisionist it'd be.",

I wasted the first 30 minutes figuring out why my game was running at negative FPS, only to discover it was somehow set to DX12… bruh.\r\n\r\nWhen I finally queued up for a match, I got completely destroyed. There’s no way to push the objectives because a huge alley gives the enemy free line of sight to mow us down, so we lose with zero chance. And to even stand a chance, you need better weapons, but to unlock those, you have to kill enemies using the garbage starter weapons. It’s a vicious cycle that makes the game unfun from the start.\r\n\r\nVehicles don’t help either. If you somehow get one, you’re still doomed because the enemy team always has maxed-out tanks and pilots with 7,240 hours in War Thunder.\r\n\r\nOverall, it’s a miserable experience, and I’d much rather play Battlefield 1.
