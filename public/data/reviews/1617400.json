I have played the game from the very beginning and I must say every euro spent was a good one. The team tries to listen to the audience and they update the game very often. The heroes are locked behind a paywall, which is the only downside, because us fans were promised no paywalls at all. They have made many changes, such as battlepasses, where you would have unlocked new items, but you would get them after the battlepass ended and you could have bought the items for the game currency, which was available, but the meta was changing a lot and the new items were very strong. So because I understand that the game cant be totally free, I think the simple payment for the game and then you can treat new heroes as dlcs. The game is not that competitive, and it is not that hard to get to the biggest rank, cause they increased the amount of rank gained from wins. It is interesting to see the game develop and I think the game as it stands is very great, at what it tried to do. The only downside is the really large sum for buying skins, like the arena skins are far too expensive.",

This game is truly a masterpiece with its design and characters that make the replay-ability nigh infinite. Although at the time of writing this there is no other new characters we know about, the ones that have released since launch (Mak/Stelle/Jules) have all been a breath of fresh air with their mechanics or the types of items/builds that their hero focuses on. And while they don't always release in a well balanced state (typically too OP) they tend to get the balance right within the next couple of weeks and create this wonderful diversity in the game. That along with their constant balance changes make it truly a game to always come back to even if you've taken a break from it. \n\nBIg props to Reynad and the Tempo Team for what they created.

      "review": "[h1]The Bazaar is a crazy place[/h1]\n[hr][/hr]\nThe Bazaar is an auto battler, or a hero builder like the game designer would call it, but not like any other game. It has a unique gameplay loop and executes it masterfully, centered around the idea of visiting themed shops and meeting unique characters in different encounters and events to get you ready for a confrontation with a player at the end of each in-game day. The goal is to win as many PvP battles as possible, ending at 10 wins or until you run out of prestige, which I’ll get into later.\n\n[h2]Gameplay and mechanics[/h2]\nA genius mechanic of this game is the [b]asynchronous PvP[/b]. You’re not locked in a match with 7 other players for a match like in most auto battlers. This allows you to leave at literally any point during the run without losing any progress, which is amazing if you don’t have the time for a full run but still want to play. The decisions can take any amount of time you want, and the battlers work like this: when the time comes to battle a player, you will face what a real player had on the exact day you’re at: a snapshot of his character at the time, or ghosts as we call them. After you face that ghost, it is removed from the pool and now your ghost substitutes your opponent’s, so someone else will fight the ghost you left.\n\nThe essence of the gameplay in The Bazaar is to make the most of the situations you get. This means it’s not possible to always play the same build, which is something I personally love about the game. Because the item pool of each character is quite big you’ll quickly learn that fishing for a specific item is usually a bad idea. The diversity of vendors and events will make you think on your feet and assemble a set of items that can work now, while still having to plan for future days.\n\nThere are currently 6 characters, each with their pool of over 100 different items. A character can get items from another character through some rare vendors and encounters, but usually get their own items on display at regular vendors, 3 at a time and grouped by category. Items can activate on a cooldown or be passive, and have tons of different uses. There are damage items, healing, shielding, damage over time inflicting, items which destroy others and so on. They vary in size and you’ll have a board of 10 slots to fill with them.\n\nTying the item mechanic to the different characters, the win condition for a battle is to survive, not necessarily beat the opponent, which is really flavorful because the game can have characters that are traders, chefs, engineers and not only characters that can fight and their items reflect this. For example, the merchant-like character has properties which can shield and heal them, and you can win a run without ever dishing out a single point of damage.\n\nEach in-game day has 6 hours, with the battle against another player being the last hour. The third hour is always a battle with a themed character from the bazaar, so it’s known exactly what items, skills and general difficulty it is. You get three choices of NPC characters to battle with varying experience and gold rewards based on its difficulty and since you get one of their items or skills if you defeat them, you’ve got to choose your opponent wisely.\n\nPrestige basically means how many losses you can withstand in a run. It starts at 20 and each loss against a player costs a point multiplied by the day you lost in, meaning early losses aren’t that costly to the Prestige meter. There’s even a sweet comeback mechanic that when any player would run out of prestige, they get a second chance with game changing upgrades to choose from, so even a bad run can be turned around with this second wind.\n\n[h2]Art and World Building[/h2]\nI’m constantly surprised by the high quality of the art assets, they’re easily as good as the best in class, like you would expect from a AAA game. I would extend this compliment to world building too. The characters you’ll find have cool voice lines, themed items, interesting related skills and feel very natural in the world of The Bazaar.\n\nThere are cosmetics like different boards, money stashes, alternate character arts and so on. Every item also has a shiny version of it. All of these are obtainable by just playing the game.\n\nThere are plenty of details for immersion or just some extra fun, like elaborate animations for some key items with huge effects like The Boulder or like having one of your items change the outcome of an event. It’s full of flavor like that, enhancing the experience quite a lot.\n\n[h2]The ghosts of the past[/h2]\nThe Bazaar had some stumbles along the way with monetization, bad standalone launcher before Steam, having no patch notes at all, performance issues and some shockingly amateur development work.\n\nAbout monetization, although I would like for the game to have some sort of free to try angle, like having only one character available, maybe with some other limitations, it’s on the best spot it’s ever been for the current players. It might be a little expensive, but regional pricing on Steam got us covered. My only fear is it’ll be harder to attract new players, since the studio also does no marketing at all for it. After seeing the studio shooting themselves in the foot with pay to win mechanics, I’m glad to say it’s in the past now.\n\nPerformance seems to be much more stable on Steam without their custom launcher, with noticeable server improvements too. Communication also greatly improved from the early launch days, back to the transparency of pre-release. My complaints with the development is specifically about the implementation of the item changes, which commonly had problems like enchants not being updated to the point of making some enchants literally useless or not testing some skills that were not working at all. It happened multiple times per patch, but it seems that they are getting a grip on it and not repeating these rookie mistakes.\n\nAll in all, it was a pretty rocky road and while there are still things that should be worked on like the UI, it seems most of these problems are behind us now.\n\n[h2]My Experience[/h2]\nI have around 400 hours of playtime using their own launcher in addition to the Steam hours. I like to visit this game regularly, usually a match every day, and never get bored of it. Even after all this time I constantly get surprised by how endless the build possibilities are. Sometimes you’ll see an opponent with something you’d never have thought of, but it’s not too rare you can assemble boards like these too, because of how many events and opportunities there are. This is why I play the game, it fills me with joy creating a build that’s really hard to replicate because of a series of specific outcomes from the many events I encountered.\n\nI can’t overstate this enough, because it’s a much bigger deal than it might seem, but [b]even the losses are very fun[/b]. I think I only had a couple of runs that I didn’t have fun, maybe because I didn’t adapt too well or got really unlucky with offerings and matchups. I think there are two big factors that contribute to this, which are the comeback mechanic I explained before and also the win “goals”. If you win 10 battles against players, that’s it, you’ve got a gold win if you lost some prestige along the way or a diamond win if you didn’t lose any. But there are other breakpoints too, which also give rewards, being the bronze win at 4 and the silver win at 7. Obviously I’ll always shoot for the 10 wins, and it requires a lot of skill and a bit of luck to do them consistently, but a silver win never bothered me and felt like a nice goal to have.\n\nAfter following the game’s development for years, I can definitely say they hit the mark and I have a ton of fun playing this game. Easily one of the best games I’ve played and it’s constantly being improved on. If you ever need to do some shopping, consider coming to The Bazaar.",

Issue comes from studio and head of studio.\n\nUnreasonable amount of hate towards reddit (when they had a really bad monetization period and subreddit criticised it, head of studio claimed \"well if reddit says its bad, it must be good\"), weird monetization policies initially that changed multiple times.\n\nOutside of game, head of studio's weird claims (go search it yourself).\n\nGame initially planned as an NFT game, then turned to multiplayer game. Initial monetization was buy it, buy gems to play ranked, or have a daily free ranked. Free mode does not give any cosmetics but if you win you get another rank play right. You could grind gems and purchase characters.\n\nThen they removed daily free ranked and being able to win playing rank matches from normal matches. Added battle pass, premium subscription, and an expansion at end of battle pass. Expansion is to be free to everyone after season ended. \n\nNow game, has unlimited ranked play, no more subscription, there is battle pass but it is free. You can buy gems to get daily cosmetics or earn them yourself. Free mode also gives cosmetics chest but ranked mode gives double. You cant buy new characters with gems now. Not sure if characters going to be free for everyone after a season or something but seems to be you need to buy each non main character you want separately. \n\nMain method of monetization seems to be expansion (new playable character basically) to be added periodically.\n\nSo current state of game's monetization is good, game is really fun to play BUT with past history of the game, hard to say it is going to stay like this.\n\nHence, tentatively recommend.\n\nEdit: Realised I have 30 hrs or so at Steam but have played about above 500hr the game since I got it during closed beta.",

      "review": "Really good game, I purchased it recently and have been liking it a lot, it's the funnest rogue-like deck-building auto battler that I've played. It's basically a rogue-like auto-battler that feels a lot like Hearthstone. \n\n--- What you get from your purchase and payment model ---\n\nYou get 3 characters with the base-game, and any additional character costs money in the form of a DLC that cost $20 each. You have access to the ranked and normal games immediately for the 3 base characters. \n\n--- Gameplay ---\n\nEach run, the progression is about getting as much wins as possible, with 10 at maximum. This is also signified as each 'day', whether you win or lose, you progress to the next day. At the beginning of each day on your run, you have two randomized options (such as a skill, free card (item), or access to a shop), then a monster fight, then two more randomized options again, before you're put forward to face an actual player and the first 'day' ends. The players are just decks of people who started a run recently also, but you're not fighting against the player live, I believe it just takes the deck of a player that they made on the same 'day' as you.\n\nYou have a lot of variety with your gameplay and a ton you can be creative with, because you often get access to other players cards too and you can make interesting combos.\n\nHigh learning curve - this game has a much higher learning curve than Hearthstone imo (unless you play Wild ofc). You have to remember a ton of cards because they are randomized, you can get a card from your character, a neutral card OR a card from another character too. So keeping in mind all of those can be tough. It's easy to pick up but hard to master. \n\n--- Visuals and Sound ---\n\nNothing much more to say except that this game's graphics are great. It has Hearthstone inspired graphics, but better. You can still click around and interact with the map, which I like. The art on the cards is amazing. The sounds are good, music is pretty cozy too.\n\n--- Rewards ---\n\nAll rewards you will get from your runs are just in the form of cosmetics. I do think that the cosmetics are really good in this game, there's a ton you can mess with and you get a lot of cosmetics for free.\n\n--- My issues ---\n\nI still like this game, but it does have it's plethora of issues.\n\n1. The game is still buggy visually, to the point that there is literally a huge 'report bug' button in your game. But it hasn't bothered me a ton because the visual bugs don't happen that often for me. But if you're someone that expects no visual bugs then it might bother you.\n\n2. New characters are overpowered. \n\nSame as other people said, if you're playing ranked upon release of a new character, and you're playing with a base character forget it, you're getting stomped. Such as the case with Jules right now. DON'T buy this game if you think that you can be on fair grounds competitively with just the base game. You will get stomped by the new character release. Not saying you can't compete with the base characters but.. you will be the underdog. \n\n3. Payment model. \n\nI don't mind it, as long as they put the DLCs on discount every so often.. because $20 permanently for a character seems excessive. $10 is still a lot but I'd buy one here and there if there's a discount, since I know this is what supports the devs too. \n\nBut I don't think it makes sense that 'The Bazaar' button is just ONE cosmetic item per day, that you can spend with the in game currency. What if you're not playing every day and miss it? Why not make the payment model more about cosmetics and have the big in your face \"The Bazaar\" (literally called after the game) button be a catalog of items? \n\nInstead, cosmetics are given out a ton freely for playing games. Which I like but, if I had to choose between having access to all characters upon buying the game versus not having as many cosmetics, I'd choose the first option.\n\n4. Last but not least, there's no speed up button. If you're playing a few runs in a row, it feels tedious having to wait through the fight with the monsters each time. I think it makes sense to add a game speed up button for the monster fights, and leave it off for the player fights. But even there I see why not add one for the player fights.",

The amount of variety in skills, event choices etc ensures that every run is different, even if you might be using the same items. The feeling of getting a 10 win run is really euphoric as you stitch together a board that runs like a well-oiled machine with all the synergies that are available. As of writing there are 6 heroes as well, each offering a different playstyle and unique items.\n\nThat being said I cannot be completely positive on this game, or rather the management of it. If you are not glowing about this game and are even a little questioning about Tempo's actions you will get banned from either their subreddit or Discord. I only dabble in Discord, sometimes posting my 10 win runs and commenting about it, but when you ban your most vocal, enfranchised users from having a voice, they will go elsewhere, and so the game ends up with far fewer players than it otherwise might have.\n\nA bit more on this, Tempo has changed and iterated on their monetisation systems multiple times between Open Beta and Steam release, which honestly would be fine, but the fact that they gave little advance warning and screwed existing customers who were already paying for existing subscriptions is nothing short of scummy. Even with the Steam Launch they announced one thing and then changed to another thing no less than 6 times. Here is a brief history of Steam announcements and pricing:\n\n- 8 August: Bazaar \"will be sold as a set with a launch price of $45\"\n- 12 August: Bazaar \"will launch on steam for $39.99\"\n- 13 August: Bazaar sold for $13.33 (-67% Discount) (in the $19.99 \"3-DAY LAUNCH SPECIAL\" with Stelle)\n- 17 August: Bazaar sold for $39.99, sales crash\n- 19 August: Bazaar sold for $13.33 (-67% Discount) (in the $19.99 \"SECOND WIND LAUNCH SALE\" with Stelle)\n- 10 September: Bazaar sold for $19.99 (Price permanently halved)\n- 29 September: Bazaar sold for $9.99 (-50% Discount) (Autumn Sale)\n\nHonestly I would wait until another sale to pick up this game, if you are interested, just a cautionary word for anyone who wants to interact with the \"official\" community on Discord and Reddit.",

      "review": "As someone who enjoyed both Hearthstone’s rogue-lite PvE mode (Solo Adventures) and its auto-chess-style PvP mode (Battlegrounds), I found this game’s rogue-lite structure to be a very refreshing experience. It successfully captures the strengths of both systems while offering its own unique take as a single-player board-game-like roguelite. Overall, I had a great time playing it. However, the late-game phase—around Days 7–8—starts to feel overly monotonous. This seems largely due to the limited opportunities to purchase items, which in turn narrows the range of actions available to the player. I hope the developers consider ways to diversify gameplay after Day 6, such as increasing bag size or item-purchase opportunities.\n\nAfter Day 7, the available choices become almost predetermined, shifting the gameplay from strategic decision-making to simply executing a fixed sequence of steps. Currently, both the field and the bag have 10 slots, which is just enough to manage two decks: one structured deck for field battles and a set of items in the bag for preparing a secondary build. However, the chances to purchase items are very limited. Even if the player encounters every merchant and uses all reroll opportunities, the maximum is roughly 4 shops × 2 pages = 8 item pages. As a result, the gameplay from Day 7 onward mostly becomes checking shop inventories for field-deck upgrades or for items that support an alternative build stored in the bag. In a roguelite—where variability is a core source of fun—this repetitive and highly deterministic loop becomes a significant drawback.\n\nI believe the experience could be improved by expanding players’ strategic flexibility in the late game. For example, starting from Day 8, increasing the bag size to 15 slots or allowing players to spend large amounts of leftover gold for up to three additional rerolls would meaningfully increase item-purchase opportunities. This would make it viable to manage up to three decks and switch between them depending on the situation, resulting in far more dynamic and engaging gameplay.\n\n하스스톤의 로그라이트식 PvE인 1인 모험과 오토체스류 PvP인 전장 시스템을 모두 즐겼던 유저로서, 이 게임의 로그라이트 구조는 둘의 장점을 반영하면서도 독창적인 1인 보드게임으로 여겨져 상당히 즐겁게 플레이했습니다. 하지만 대략 7-8일차 이후의 후반 플레이는 지나치게 단조롭습니다. 아마도 아이템을 구매할 수 있는 기회가 제한적이어서 플레이어가 선택할 수 있는 액션의 폭이 좁기 때문으로 여겨집니다. 6일차 이후 플레이 패턴 다양화를 고민해보면 좋겠습니다. 예를 들어 가방 크기나 아이템을 구매할 수 있는 기회를 늘리는 식으로요.\n\n7일차 이후에는 행동 선택이 거의 정해져 있어, 전략적인 선택보다는 시간을 들여 이미 정해진 과정을 수행하는 느낌이 강해집니다. 현재 필드와 가방 슬롯이 각각 10칸으로 구성되어 있는데, 이는 전투용으로 구성된 메인 덱 하나와, 보조 빌드를 준비하기 위한 아이템을 담아두는 가방 정도, 즉 두 개의 덱을 관리하기엔 딱 맞는 수준입니다. 하지만 상점을 만날 수 있는 기회는 매우 제한적입니다. 플레이어가 모든 상인을 만나고 모든 리롤을 사용한다고 가정해도, 최대 4개의 상점 × 2개의 페이지 = 8개의 아이템 페이지 정도에 불과합니다. 그 결과 7일차 이후의 플레이는 운영 중인 필드 덱을 업그레이드 아이템이 있는지, 혹은 가방 속 예비 덱을 위한 아이템이 있는지 정도만 확인하는 단순 반복 작업이 되고, 변동성이 재미의 큰 요소인 로그라이크에서 이러한 패턴은 치명적인 단점으로 느껴집니다.\n\n게임의 후반부, 8일차부터 가방 슬롯을 15칸으로 늘리거나 남은 골드를 많이 사용해 추가 리롤을 최대 3회까지 할 수 있게 하는 등 구매 기회를 늘려서, 플레이어가 최대 세 개 정도의 덱을 전략적으로 관리하며 상황에 맞춰 덱전환을 할 수 있다면 더 재밌어질 것이라 생각합니다.",

Although this game contains PvP battles, the battles do not occur at the same time for the opposing player.

The game does not provide a preview of enchanted items.\n    [*]New DLC characters have been incredibly strong upon release. However, balance patches have been common. New DLC characters are usually toned down within a week.\n    [*]You have no control over which players you are about to fight, and you do not know their board.

But once you do finally break away, it calls to you like the Green Goblin mask. \r\n\r\nI love it, but it's very, very dangerous.\r\n\r\nExperimenting with unfamiliar and goofy items is just as fun as praying for your favorite builds. And with several opportunities for characters to cross-pollinate their pools, as well as regular content updates with new items added altogether, it never really gets stale. And that's coming from someone who hasn't really left the comfort of the default character in over 100 hours.\r\n\r\nLike anything these days, your mileage will vary from update to update. Certain meta-builds can become quite oppressive and exhausting, but Tempo does well enough at issuing changes as-needed. It's also worth noting that Tempo has fumbled and struggled with monetization in the past, but aside from the larger price tag for individual characters, it seems to be in a decent spot as of now. \r\n\r\nIf I had any complaints, it'd be that a third-party website is practically necessary in order to see the effects of different enchantments before you apply them to your items. This should be doable in-game.\r\n\r\nBut otherwise, I'm just very happy to finally have an auto-battler that just clicks; It's comprehensible, aesthetically-pleasing, well-paced, and most of all asynchronous, so you can pause, suspend, and reintegrate into your social network as needed.\r\n\r\nSo long as you have the self-control, that is.",

It had previously flirted with F2P models, and even, briefly, with using NFTs. Even now, it's $20 per DLC character, a desperately optimistic price point. The only thing its pricing models have had in common is how much the audience hated them. The devs overcommunicate and their communications always make things worse.\r\n\r\nAnd absolutely none of that should matter to you as a player.\r\n\r\nTo my mind, this is the full-stop best digital card game in the world. Yes, even better than Slay the Spire. Even modded Spire. It is, essentially, a roguelike deckbuilder in which the bosses and elites are the decks of other players, giving it unprecedented enemy variety.\r\n\r\nThe build variety is oceanic (even when you don't use Aquatic items), the balance is very good, the content is deep and rich, the aesthetics are superlative. The balance of asymmetrical PVP against other players' decks and PVE against consistent computer-generated enemies gives you clear benchmarks without making each run a carbon copy.\r\n\r\nEach of the game's six characters has a unique playstyle and signature mechanics, and you get to dip just enough into the others to inject variety into your runs.\r\n\r\nThose $20 character DLCs? Most Steam players won't buy them and I don't blame them, but they are effectively a full expansion for a digital CCG in the form of a beautifully illustrated character and collection of cards. I can understand why they're worth that much even as I doubt they'll sell well as a result.\r\n\r\nEven if you only get the base game, you'll still have access to three extremely fun characters and dozens or hundreds of hours of incredible gameplay.",

      "review": "Dear Developers,\n\nI think you know how unique this game is. From the very beginning, it promised something many of us hoped and dreamed for. And now, after a year of pathfinding, you have found the right direction—finally delivering on those promises.\n\nSo what makes this game special?\n\nThis game is a live-service game, and yet it is not.\n\nThis game is a competitive game, and yet it is not.\n\nThis game looks like one where you have to grind (reward chests, daily quests, weekly quests, etc.), but in reality, you don’t.\n\nThis game could easily have demanded constant play in order to “keep up with the meta,” but it doesn’t.\n\nThis game could have been ruined by endless changes to characters, purchasable cards, season passes, and all that, but it is not.\n\nThis game could have created FOMO with seasonal rewards, but it does not.\n\nIt is the perfect co-op game—yet it doesn’t even have a co-op tag.\n\nThe Bazaar takes the best aspects of live-service and competitive gaming, without the downsides.\nYou are never angry when you lose, and there is no toxicity from opponents.\nThe greatest advantage of a live-service game is expansion—and, in the best case, doing so without breaking the core game.\n\nIn other words: this game has everything it needs to become a timeless classic, with the added bonus of a new hero now and then.\n\nI believe The Bazaar can be compared to single-player games just as much as to online titles.\nI love classics like Diablo 2, Heroes 3, and my favorite single player Steam game: American Truck Simulator. ATS is a perfect example of expanding a game the right way: every new DLC simply adds more content while leaving the core formula untouched.\n\nIn contrast to what seems to be the general philosophy of modern live-service games, I think change is not always good.\nAs a League of Legends beta player, whenever I think of that game, I can’t help but say: “Look how they massacred my boy.”\nI truly believe The Bazaar can be a game where you don’t have to relearn everything after a long break. \n\nThe Bazaar is a great co-op game too.\nThe game gives me the exact same feeling I had 20 years ago, sitting in front of the same CRT monitor with a friend, calculating whether we should attack that stack of black dragons. It is the perfect old-school co-op experience.\n\nThe joy is in making those decisions—and making those decisions together.\n\nHere’s some good news for anyone over the age of 16:\nThis is a puzzle game, so you don’t need any dexterity at all. No hand-eye coordination, no fast reactions—none of that nonsense. And yet you are on the edge of your seat every single minute.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe Bazaar is a near-perfect game.\nIt’s essentially a single-player experience, yet with the excitement of knowing that another person crafted the enemy you face with their wit and luck. The fact that you can quit anytime is almost too good to be true (although it does require willpower).\nThe endless combinations and possibilities mean unlimited replayability.\n\nWhenever I think I’m not in the mood to play, or I’m unsure which hero to choose, that feeling disappears the moment I face my first decision. From that point on, the game pulls me in completely. I forget everything: past runs, future hopes—everything. I’m in a state of flow, building the next best character ever with full attention, with not a single trace of boredom.\nI don’t know many PC or tabletop games that can do this to me.\n\nWith all that said, I’m baffled by the negative reviews aimed at pricing. Let me return to the beginning and say that the monetization model The Bazaar has right now is the best thing that could have happened to it.\nYou pay a little, and then you can play unlimited games with the exact same opportunities as everyone else. If you think the newest character is overpowered, then buy it, try it—and see how many older heroes will still kick your butt with their game-breaking combos.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, with a bit of luck, you can create a brilliant combo with any hero and watch it unfold with glee.",

But yeah, getting there might be a little frustrating. \n\nFrustration is the reason you're seeing so much negative reviews for a game that people play so much. \nPeople were told that the game would be one thing then devs completely change direction, every 6 months.\nPeople want always more from the game but they don't want to spend 20$ for the shiny new character. \nPeople don't know their character well enough then complain that new ones are OP (they aren't, every Jules build is beatable by every character).  \n\nIf you're grown enough to manage your own frustration, The Bazaar is maybe one of the very best games you'll play. Ever. (I play games since the late 80s).\nI find it very akin to Diablo 2. It's one of those games that don't need content, they're just so fun by themselves you'll play for years. Every run is different. You can stick to a single character for hundreds of hours and still learn new things, just have an insanely high roll find that will transform a run and what the items you used so many times before do in ways you never expected.\nIt's actually pretty finely balanced which is so rare in the online space. In any live game there'll always be a skill, a character, a specialisation, a sub-class that's unplayable. Here every character is viable, any build. Some are indeed harder to pull off but there will always be THE run where stars align and allow you to do THAT build that you had in the back of your mind and always wanted to do.  \nProd values are top notch. Art, audio, animation, narrative design (I especially love the care put into every merchant, every pve encounter) just put to shame behemoths like Blizzard or Riot...   \n\nIt's a divisive game, obviously not for everyone. But it seems to be tailored exactly for my taste and that deserve an honest positive feedback.\n\nEdit: Just made it my goty for 2025.",

      "review": "300+ hours in, still hooked.\n\nThe Bazaar is a vibrant, strategic Hero Builder set in a galactic marketplace where every run feels fresh. You draft wild item combos, upgrade skills, and outwit opponents in asynchronous PvP, which is a godsend for dads and busy folks like me who can’t commit to long, uninterrupted sessions.\n\nThe core loop is all about choosing a hero, navigating shops, and building around high-impact items. There’s a learning curve, sure. Understanding when to pivot, where to shop, and how to counter builds takes time. But once it clicks, it’s endlessly satisfying. The game strikes a beautiful balance between strategic fundamentals and chaotic fun. Sometimes you gamble, sometimes you outplay, and the best runs do both.\n\nThe art is stunning. Every character feels distinct, with unique playstyles and visual flair. The music? Fantastic. You can unlock albums from chests that change the vibe entirely,  a small touch that adds a lot of charm.\n\nI’ve logged over 300 hours and I’m still discovering new builds. The game’s infinite replayability comes from its dynamic drafting and ever-evolving meta. Sure, new patches and heroes can throw balance off, but the devs are quick to respond, faster than most games I’ve played.\n\nBugs exist, but they’re minor and rarely impact gameplay. More importantly, they get fixed fast. I haven’t interacted with the devs directly, but their responsiveness shows.\n\n$20 for hundreds of hours of fun? No-brainer. Especially for players who want depth without time pressure.\n\nMy favorite moments are the absurd builds that somehow work, the kind that make you laugh out loud. My only gripe is that some items or encounters are consistently ignored because better options exist. It’s a minor balance issue, but worth noting.\n\nVerdict:\n\nIf you love strategic games with high replay value and need flexibility in your schedule, The Bazaar is a gem. I’d especially recommend it to parents and anyone juggling real-life responsibilities, this game respects your time while still delivering competitive depth.",

Except that each character costs the same as the base game now! And even if that wasn't the case, $20 for a dlc while may not be utterly outrageous, I expect more from it, a single character should be $10 max, its only made more egregious by the base games reduction\nBalance - I understand its hard to get a competitive game with so many options balance right, however, when I see a dlc character, I know my chances of winning go from a high margin all the way down to the gutter, because dlc is WAY too overtuned, which isn't helped by the fact that the newer characters have less items, which in turn makes their powerful synergies easier to come across\nMatchmaking - A bit of a weird subject here, but the bazaar has asynchronous matchmaking, which essentially means you get paired with the ghost of another player as opposed to playing live. This system works for any game like this, what doesnt work, is when you get past day 5 (approximately) all of your opponents become giga broken meta builds which definitely haven't been made in 5 days, this was improved on somewhat, recently, but its still in a poor state as is\n\nTl;Dr - The bazaar is not worth picking up in its current state, and if you do, don't bother with the characters unless they get cut in price",

I sincerely apologize for discarding your input on this game. This game has it's own little niche following from whom they've sucked dry in the form of subscription fees and their version of DLC. I didn't get on board until a few months before the game was available on Steam. So, I avoided all that BS. But it's that niche following that refuses to call the game what it is: Trash! with some very good ideas ruined by more trash. Such a good idea held back by arrogance and ignorance.\r\n\r\nEvery review of the game outside of Steam was negative and touched on points of overall cost (stretched out over time), blatant mis-balancing of gameplay, and the overwhelming disgust with developers not only dismissing player/customer input, but making sure anything they posted about the game was removed on any of their platforms. \"No communication\" has been the top complaint for as long as this game has been offered to the public. Stories of people spending HUNDREDS on this game - just to keep up - were everywhere, and are still relevant. I bought the Steam version for $20 and loved the idea of the game, so I threw another $20 at it to get the 4th character. About a month later, a new character was introduced and I was still casually enjoying the game so I threw another $20 at it for the 5th character. After $60 spent on the game in a matter of 3ish months, I was at the point of  \"these kids are dumb and will complain about anything\"...\r\n\r\nThen the game reset! I was one decent run away from reaching Gold... All the sudden, I was at Bronze V (all the way back to the very beginning). I read the patch notes and it seems that I should've retained at least a high bronze ranking, but my entire progress was wiped! The battle pass in which I was at level 96/100 was reset to level 0. So, I started climbing again. And then came the introduction of Jules, the 6th character, for another $20. I won't be paying for Jules. I been burned by the first $60 spent, so why would I spend more? In addition to the gotcha-farming of your money, there's also the fact that Jules, like the other characters as they were introduced, is purposely WAY overpowered especially in the early game. I have seen this commented on in past releases of new characters. Developers make the new one super OP to try and garner sales of the new addition. Then later, small amounts of balancing take place over a long period of time until the majority of the player-base has forked over their $20 for the new OP character - only to have it nerfed into a completely different meta. I'm getting my ass handed to me in every match-up with Jules. Yes, she's beatable, but most builds don't stand a chance in her current state.\r\n\r\nI don't mind getting beat by good, solid builds that other players come up with. They're fun to learn and fun to watch when played out. But the new release of a character is beyond ridiculous and they keep doing it. Obviously it's profitable and people will continue to fork over more money. Kudos to the development team for honing in on their 3rd world scamming techniques. I mean, if it works.... right? But I, personally, will drop off in play time considerably, and won't participate in future DLC transactions. They got $60 out of me and I can honestly say I enjoyed about $35 worth. So, if you're into games with rolling upgrade$ and costly deckbuilding mechanics, then this will be one of your favorites. If you're a casual player, you will grow very frustrated with the entire project. The game, the updates, the development team... they all have promise, but they all fall short and it certainly seems on purpose. Weird! Bad practices! Unfortunate :(",

And despite clocking some crazy amount of hours in the game, I can't say I can recommend this game as it is. There is no way for you to unlock characters just by playing. I don't even care if that amount would be something absurd, but there is just no way of doing so at the moment which irritates me to no end. Sure you can sit there and be like, \"Yo dumbass. You clocked 300+ hours in the game for $20. That's a steal in value.\" But you gotta consider that each character at the moment is $20. In the future there will be more. Am I to expect to drop $20 over and over just to keep up with game updates? 10 or 20 characters down the line, am I expected to drop $200+ to play all the new characters that drop? I hate to say it, but I would actually much rather they release all the characters to everyone, put some attention into a battlepass, and drop it for $10 to let people opted in when they want to support the game. However, as the way the game is monetize, I can't say I would recommend it to people which is a sad thing because the game itself is super fun and interesting. It scratches that itch of \"just one more run\". Maybe in the future the devs will figure out a monetization that doesn't gate new characters behind paywalls then I can come back and revise this review to praise its glory.",

However, each additional character costs the same amount as the base game! Its outrageously priced. Especially when each character can play so differently and you will have no idea if you will even enjoy the character or not. If they significantly reduce the cost of new characters (by making them at least 1/3rd of their current cost) I will not have this same complaint.\n\nThey have also changed their monetization practices and strategy several times over the past year and while some, like the removal of pay-to-win item acquisition mechanics have been removed, there has always been a sense that they are just trying to squeeze as much money as they can out of the player base instead of focusing on making a solid product. Which brings me to my other issue.\n\n*** Lack of Direction ***\nThis game has gone through several different cycles over the past year of the devs drastically changing how it is played. It is clear that they are still trying to figure out what their gameplay is and how to build new characters and content.

The game very often has to \"reconnect\" to the servers forcing you to wait for a bit twiddling your thumbs doing nothing.\n\nThere also is no matchmaking whatsoever, you can be matched against a legendary final boss while being at bronze rank or you can face the worst build you have ever seen in your entire life. This will at least be changed in an upcoming patch, but at the moment its the wild west out here.\n\nThe words of the developers are not to be trusted. They have lied or misled many times in the less than a year that this game has been available to the public and they will most likely continue to do so in the future. The monetization has already changed four times or so, with the most recent change being the pay-to-play release on steam. The cosmetic system has also changed and one of the core parts of it, the marketplace, has been completely cancelled. In the past the monetization has also been very predatory, with clear pay-to-win mechanics. The \"expansion packs\" with new cards were always way overtuned which encouraged players to purchase them immediately instead of grinding xp to unlock them before they got nerfed. This has since changed, but should be kept in mind regardless.\n\nCritics of the game are constantly getting banned on reddit, discord and the steam forums for simply expressing dislike for radical changes to the monetization system etc for being \"trolls\". \n\nThe game underneath all this is still very fun with amazing art and fully voiced characters, but its difficult to enjoy something when you dont know if its core systems will be overhauled in a month again. This game almost feels like its still in an open beta or early access release even though it has been fully released for months now, which is a real shame.\n\nIf i could give a mixed review i could, but at the moment the $40 dollar pricetag combined with the $20 dollar character dlcs are just too much to recommend.",

With that being said, these developer/s have burned every bit of trust a lot of the community had in them. \n\n[b] The Pros: [/b]\n\nThe game by itself is a ton of fun. All the characters are amazing and fun to play (even if not all of them are fun to play against). While there are some mechanics that can annoy the hell out of you, it's ultimately a fundamentally strong game.\n\n- Fun game\n- Build diversity options\n- Unique designs (When it doesn't look like AI)\n\n[b] The Cons: [/b]\n\nBasically, they pulled the rug under everyone who was waiting for the steam release. They ended up making a free game cost 40$, and made every character an additional 20????. This alone is already enough to make me not want to support them, but then they also f*cked over the initial beta testers. If you had spent anywhere from the 60-120$ that was required to get into the early beta, you STILL had to pay an additional 40-60$ just to get the game on steam + with stelle. Also if you bought the game back when it was 40$, you havent received any compensation for the 20$ price drop!!!!!! So if you buy it now and they lessen it again (which they fking better), you still wont get anything!!!!!\n\nInitially on Tempo Launcher, you could buy EVERYTHING with gems. Those gems were also obtainable by opening chests and, as advertised, eventually could be obtained by selling on the promised \"players market\" for duplicate skins. Out of nowhere, they pulled the idea COMPLETELY. Now duplicate skins will be converted into gems, and gems are effectively useless. You can't use them in place of ranked tickets to play ranked (tickets are also gone and were converted into gems!!!), you cant use them to buy characters, and you cant use them to buy expansions. It's gross business practice and sketchy from everyone involved.\n\nNext, if you wanted to speak OUT about how you thought it was unfair, immediate bans from the reddit and discord. If you made a youtube video about it, mass dislikes. You can't even comment on their steam announcements without them sifting through it and trying to get rid of every last bad rep available to the public. \n\n[b] - Sketchy business practice\n- Screwing over community\n- Suppressing any opposition\n- Terrible Price + all characters cost 20$?????\n- Game is very unstable. You will frequently lose runs to server de-sync because of random crashes.\n- Very RNG dependent, but that's every roguelike so don't think too much about it. \n- Sh*tty company [/b]\n\nThank you for coming to my ted talk. please don't buy this game unless they drop the price of everything, including characters.",

      "review": "Played this A LOT before it came to steam. The devs couldn't figure out a way to do this game's monetization and switched it up a bunch of times before they apparently settled on this and released it here.\n\nThe game is quite fun. It's a fairly unique autobattler, each character feels very distinct from one another and there's tremendous build variety. The production value is also through the roof and everything looks pretty. Those are the positives.\n\nThe negative aspects of the bazaar are what had me stop playing. \n\nFirst off, I'll come back to the monetization: What they settled on is terrible for the game imo. You can buy the base game with 3 characters, and each new character costs the full base price of the game, so you'd have to pay 4x the base cost to get all the characters, and this is the only way to acquire them, with cosmetics being what players can get by playing the game (but those can also be purchased using real money, of course). The initial cost stops new players from trying out the game (which has a fairly steep learning curve), since it requires an upfront payment with no way to even check out if one enjoys it via a demo or free trial. It alienates potential new players, which to me drastically reduces the game's reach and general sentiment. Finally, I believe not having all the characters to play around with makes learning the game more difficult, as every character explores different aspects of the game, which would also teach how to make builds that more generally succeed against the builds other characters may create, if one had the opportunity to even try other characters out without having to shell out more money.\n\nMoving on to the gameplay, I feel the game doesn't care one bit about the player's time, with drawn out animations and long transitions, and no way to speed up fights (which admittedly feel pretty good to watch regardless). On top of that, despite the game's good looks, everything feels janky and slow to move around. Just interfacing with the game feels like I'm fighting against a lack of polish and the fact that every single action has to be authenticated server-side. Things snap where I don't want them to, buttons aren't as responsive as they should be, and every run has a slight feeling that I'm wasting my time, even after I got more used to the game's needlessly slow pace. Balance never felt too off, although some decisions made by the devs over the course of the game's updates were just absolutely puzzling, since the entire community could, at just a glance, tell what was broken and what was unusably nerfed.\n\nI had a great time with the bazaar, but as time went on the people behind it showed time and time again they care more about making money and censoring criticism, than making an actually good and accessible game beyond all the beautiful art and animations. They even had plans to have an NFT-like in-game trade market at some point... it got scratched but I think it's something important to point out.\n\nI believe there are plenty other autobattlers out there that are just as fun, if not more, that also respect one's time and money. So given the issues I take with both the game and the way the team managed things, I can't recommend this in good faith.",

      "review": "If I could give a mid rating for the bazaar, I would, because as a game, its really fun.\nEach character is really well thought out and offers different playstyles which are unique to each other, but the game is held back by so many issues that I can't really *recommend* it, as much as I like it\n\nThe biggest issues to me are:\nPricing - The game was originally completely free, then they made it $40 with $20 characters, then have since reduced the base games price to $20 which is more acceptable (than $40)... Except that each character costs the same as the base game now! And even if that wasn't the case, $20 for a dlc while may not be utterly outrageous, I expect more from it, a single character should be $10 max, its only made more egregious by the base games reduction\nBalance - I understand its hard to get a competitive game with so many options balance right, however, when I see a dlc character, I know my chances of winning go from a high margin all the way down to the gutter, because dlc is WAY too overtuned, which isn't helped by the fact that the newer characters have less items, which in turn makes their powerful synergies easier to come across\nMatchmaking - A bit of a weird subject here, but the bazaar has asynchronous matchmaking, which essentially means you get paired with the ghost of another player as opposed to playing live. This system works for any game like this, what doesnt work, is when you get past day 5 (approximately) all of your opponents become giga broken meta builds which definitely haven't been made in 5 days, this was improved on somewhat, recently, but its still in a poor state as is\n\nTl;Dr - The bazaar is not worth picking up in its current state, and if you do, don't bother with the characters unless they get cut in price",
