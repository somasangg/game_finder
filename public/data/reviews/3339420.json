There was nothing special - just one character - so I had a bit of fun having a girl on my screen, then uninstalled the game and never planned to return.\n\nSome time ago, when I was crafting badges, I noticed that the badge, trading cards, point shop items had been added to the game. I downloaded it again to check, and saw that the game itself had been updated with new features, but the price stayed the same.\n\nIf you're looking for AI pet - this game is for you.",

For just a few cents, it's the best purchase I've ever made.\n\nOkay, in giving an honest review, I found a few problems with \"your Wife.\"\n\nI'll start with the most annoying one. if you try to bring up the menu while she's in an unusual position on the screen, it locks. You can't move her because the menu is open, and you can't access the menu because she's blocking it.\n\nThe \"Lock\" button. Yes, it does exactly what it's supposed to do, locking her in a position where you can't interact with her... and that's the problem. Once you lock her, you can't unlock her. So if you accidentally click that button, you won't be able to do much with her blocking the screen.\n\nOptimization. When I'm on my laptop, the fans are at 0 RPM, but if I want her to be with me in a corner, the fans go up to 3400 RPM. Why??? I mean, I get it. It's a very high-quality render, and it looks amazing! But when I'm playing Genshin Impact, it barely reaches 2800 RPM.\nI don't know how the rendering processes work or whatever, but the fact that an \"image\" needs to speed up the fans more to cool the CPU before a complete video game seems strange to me.\n\nAnd lastly, I really like having her with me while I study, but it'd be great if you could interact with her at least a little.",

The character animation feels smooth, and the art style clearly targets fans of anime aesthetics. There are several outfits to switch between, which adds a bit of variety. Still, after the initial curiosity, there’s not much else to do.\n\nPerformance is stable and the setup is simple. It runs quietly in the background and doesn’t use much system power. The customization menu is straightforward, though limited. A few small interactions, like touching or moving the model, help keep it from feeling completely static.\n\nYour Wife is best described as digital company — something you launch for a bit of novelty or amusement.
