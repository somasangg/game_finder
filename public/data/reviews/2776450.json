To me, the biggest downside, is the lack of info about certain aspects, you can make assumptions and some you can confirm via testing.\r\n\r\nNot an idle game but with certain idle mechanics.\r\nI think this is an excellent game for those who like RPGs, min/maxing gear (not just your group but sub teams), getting all the characters, running dungeons, etc..\r\n\r\nNot for everyone, but I certainly enjoy it.",

It has the perfect ratio of auto-combat elements (when you need to grind easy stages) and manual combat (for harder boss fights or clearing new stages). There is a lot of content from what I can see. The premise of the game is also pretty interesting and reminds me a lot of those xianxia novels I used to read. The only critique I have is the character art. And no, it's not because it's AI, it's because it is unrefined AI. I don't want to tell the developers what to do with their game, but if they used \"face detailer\" and an \"upscaler\" when creating new art it would look much better without any extra effort. The other thing I would want to see very much is the ability to add my own art to the game and swap the existing character sprites. Aside from that, the game is very addictive and I totally recommend getting it.",
