With the right group, it’s pure chaotic entertainment.\n\nIf you enjoy deception games and big drama moments, Liar Bar is absolutely worth playing.",

The recent graphical revamp is a major win — not only does it polish the atmosphere, but it also fixes practical issues that improve the overall experience.\n\nIf you enjoy party games with a psychological twist (and you don’t mind the occasional bug, given it’s in Early Access), Liar’s Bar is absolutely worth checking out. The tension, the art, the risk — everything comes together to make a truly memorable bluffing playground.",

      "review": "I think the game is cool, some modes are occasionally frustrating but that's just the nature of the game. But I don't recommend it for its price and here's why:\n\n- Too few players for matchmaking: The game has around 600-800 active players. Most of them are not from the same region so matchmaking inevitably cross-matches players. This leads to bugs and renders the voice chat obsolete\n\n- Game breaking boundary mechanics: Some mechanics completely break a match or provide a second chance to players who should've lost. I'll list some below:\n      - In liar's deck if someone calls liar just before their timer runs out, they will call liar to the cards that they  threw. This allows them to throw a lie and call their own lie to make the next player take a shot. Though not commonly used, it is an issue that exists.\n      - In Liar's poker if someone leaves just after showdown but before the gun loading starts, other players who had inferior hands will never initiate the gun loading and get another chance. Supposedly this was fixed in the most recent hotfix but it still occurs. Maybe the devs didn't patch some alt+f4 cases. I don't know...\n      - In Liar's poker, someone can just switch a card and go all in. Most of the time they make a one-pair with whichever card is in the flop and already get a >85% chance of winning. Either the switching mechanic should be removed or all the players should get an opporunity to switch before deicing whether to go all in or fold. 25% chance is too high to fold every single time.   \n     - In Liar's poker there is a rare but possible boundary case where if someone disconnects just before showdown happens, the new hands get distributed but the remaining players throw their NEW hands in the middle for all players to see. Effectively giving a free round to those who folded.\n\nI think the game should go on a big sale to encourage an increase in player base.\n\nAnd instead of adding goon gamemodes, maybe make an airtight system first. Also speed up some animations, the game feels very chunky.\n\nAnd lastly, optimize the game. Getting 45-50fps with a gtx1650ti in a unity game with very small environments is just not a good look.",

The gameplay is overall fun (especially Liar's Deck) and the character designs are good but the community was pretty toxic. I remember during my few hours playing that I saw a blatantly racist lobby name in the US server and 1/3 of the players I played with were toxic jocks that would curse at me if I ever got lost with the controls (which happened a lot since I was still new) or stopped to try to type in chat since I wasn't comfortable using my mic. Overall, I haven't played this one in a year for a reason and if the community is still the same now as it was then, I would HIGHLY recommend you only play the game with friends, not strangers. Liar's Bar, for the brief period I played it, was the worst voice chat experience I ever had. I can't give a Neutral in terms of recommendations so I'll settle on No.",

But I don't recommend it for its price and here's why:\n\n- Too few players for matchmaking: The game has around 600-800 active players. Most of them are not from the same region so matchmaking inevitably cross-matches players. This leads to bugs and renders the voice chat obsolete\n\n- Game breaking boundary mechanics: Some mechanics completely break a match or provide a second chance to players who should've lost. I'll list some below:\n      - In liar's deck if someone calls liar just before their timer runs out, they will call liar to the cards that they  threw. This allows them to throw a lie and call their own lie to make the next player take a shot. Though not commonly used, it is an issue that exists.\n      - In Liar's poker if someone leaves just after showdown but before the gun loading starts, other players who had inferior hands will never initiate the gun loading and get another chance. Supposedly this was fixed in the most recent hotfix but it still occurs. Maybe the devs didn't patch some alt+f4 cases. I don't know...\n      - In Liar's poker, someone can just switch a card and go all in. Most of the time they make a one-pair with whichever card is in the flop and already get a >85% chance of winning. Either the switching mechanic should be removed or all the players should get an opporunity to switch before deicing whether to go all in or fold. 25% chance is too high to fold every single time.   \n     - In Liar's poker there is a rare but possible boundary case where if someone disconnects just before showdown happens, the new hands get distributed but the remaining players throw their NEW hands in the middle for all players to see. Effectively giving a free round to those who folded.\n\nI think the game should go on a big sale to encourage an increase in player base.\n\nAnd instead of adding goon gamemodes, maybe make an airtight system first. Also speed up some animations, the game feels very chunky.\n\nAnd lastly, optimize the game. Getting 45-50fps with a gtx1650ti in a unity game with very small environments is just not a good look.",

I played it a few times with some friends and found it quite fun, but the game is too \"cluncky\", not only the gameplay itself, but also the menu interface and stuff (still don't know why the game won't save my graphics/ audio settings) and VERY BAD optimized, in fact, it's so bad that it crashed my stream on Twitch twice (I've played quite heavier games and it never happened). If you want to buy it, be sure to have friends to play with and wait for a sale, definitely not worth full price.",

On top of that, half the time the rules don't even stay consistent in a single round of a given game mode, whether do to bugs or just secret mechanics that are unlisted.",

The gameplay is overall fun (especially Liar's Deck) and the character designs are good but the community was pretty toxic. I remember during my few hours playing that I saw a blatantly racist lobby name in the US server and 1/3 of the players I played with were toxic jocks that would curse at me if I ever got lost with the controls (which happened a lot since I was still new) or stopped to try to type in chat since I wasn't comfortable using my mic. Overall, I haven't played this one in a year for a reason and if the community is still the same now as it was then, I would HIGHLY recommend you only play the game with friends, not strangers. Liar's Bar, for the brief period I played it, was the worst voice chat experience I ever had. I can't give a Neutral in terms of recommendations so I'll settle on No.",
