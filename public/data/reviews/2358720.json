      "review": "EN:\r\nBlack Myth: Wukong is for me a game that sits somewhere between God of War for its mythological, grandiose side, with giant symbolic environments, and the Souls-like school for certain mechanics. But make no mistake: it is not a pure Souls-like.\r\n\r\nVisually, the game is simply stunning. The panoramas are gorgeous, the environments have real personality, and there’s this “living mythology” feeling that clearly echoes God of War: everything is huge, theatrical, and loaded with symbols. You can tell the game wants to blow you away visually, and on that front, it absolutely delivers.\r\n\r\nGameplay:\r\n\r\nYou do find some Souls-like mechanics: altars that serve the same purpose as bonfires in Souls, dodge rolls to evade attacks, and bosses with patterns to learn, but the overall feeling is much more action-adventure, story-driven, almost beat’em up. It doesn’t have the usual difficulty curve of a classic Souls-like, and it’s not built the same way structurally either. At its core, it’s mostly a big boss rush: the adventure is paced around boss fights, which really sit at the center of the experience.\r\n\r\nQuests are less cryptic than in a Souls-like, even if the game keeps a somewhat similar style in how it tells its story and guides the player forward. And if you like exploring everything, combing through areas, talking to NPCs, and hunting for secrets, the game has very solid length. I’d say around 30 to 40 hours, knowing there is a New Game Plus to keep leveling up your little monkey and go back to what you might have missed.\r\n\r\nNegative:\r\n\r\nOn the downside, I’d mainly point out: very corridor-like level design at times; lots of invisible walls; and some inconsistencies with jumps. Sometimes you think you can’t go somewhere… but you actually can. Other times it’s the opposite: you want to jump to a spot that looks totally logical, and the game just won’t let you. It breaks immersion a bit.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n\r\nWhether you’ve read Journey to the West or not, Black Myth: Wukong is absolutely playable and enjoyable on its own. The game tends to take place more or less after the events of the original story and revisits some moments in its own way, so it’s not mandatory to know the source material. But if you do have the references, it’s clearly a plus: you’ll get more out of the nods, the characters, and certain scenes that hit harder.\r\n\r\nA very good game, something that’s becoming increasingly rare among big AAA titles.\r\n\r\nFR :\r\nBlack Myth: Wukong est pour moi un jeu qui se place quelque part entre God of War pour son côté mythologique et grandiose, avec des environnements géants et symboliques, et l’école des Souls-like pour certaines mécaniques. Mais attention : ce n’est pas un Souls-like pur et dur.\r\n\r\nVisuellement, le jeu est tout simplement sublime. Les panoramas sont magnifiques, les environnements ont une vraie personnalité, et il y a ce côté “mythologie vivante” qui rappelle clairement God of War : tout est immense, théâtral, chargé de symboles. On sent que le jeu veut en mettre plein les yeux, et de ce côté-là, c’est une réussite.\r\n\r\nGameplay :\r\n\r\nOn retrouve quelques mécaniques à la Souls-like : des autels qui remplissent le même rôle que les feux de camp dans un Souls, des roulades pour esquiver les attaques, et des boss aux patterns à apprendre. Mais le ressenti global est beaucoup plus action-aventure, centré sur l’histoire, presque beat’em up par moments. On n’est pas sur la difficulté habituelle d’un Souls-like classique, et la structure du jeu est différente. Au fond, c’est surtout un gros boss rush : l’aventure est rythmée par les combats de boss, qui sont vraiment au centre de l’expérience.\r\n\r\nLes quêtes sont moins cryptiques que dans un Souls-like, même si le jeu garde un style un peu similaire dans sa manière de raconter et de faire avancer le joueur. Et si on aime tout explorer, fouiller les zones, parler aux PNJ, chercher les secrets, le jeu a une très bonne durée de vie. Je dirais entre 30 et 40 heures, sachant qu’il y a un New Game Plus pour continuer de monter en niveau avec notre petit singe et revenir sur ce qu’on a pu rater.\r\n\r\nNégatif :\r\n\r\nCôté défauts, je pointerais surtout : un level design très couloir par moments ; beaucoup de murs invisibles ; et des incohérences sur les sauts. Parfois on pense qu’on ne peut pas passer… mais en fait si. Et parfois c’est l’inverse : on veut sauter vers un endroit qui semble parfaitement logique, et le jeu ne le permet pas. Ça casse un peu l’immersion.\r\n\r\nConclusion :\r\n\r\nQue tu aies lu La Pérégrination vers l’Ouest ou pas, Black Myth: Wukong reste totalement jouable et appréciable en lui-même. Le jeu a tendance à se situer plus ou moins après les événements de l’œuvre originale et revisite certains passages à sa manière, donc ce n’est pas indispensable de connaître le matériau d’origine. Mais si tu as les références, c’est clairement un plus : tu profites davantage des clins d’œil, des personnages, et de certains passages qui gagnent en impact.\r\n\r\nUn très bon jeu, ce qui devient de plus en plus rare parmi les gros titres AAA.",

Each boss moves were difficult with high damage. Many hidden quest are there to complete its not that easy. \n\nWukong’s journey through each chapter—especially the quest to acquire the six relics—felt meaningful and immersive, making every step feel like part of a destined path. The Chinese traditional music and sound design complete the experience, giving battles and quiet moments alike a unique emotional atmosphere.\n\nBy the end, the final cutscenes left me both amazed and genuinely sad that the journey had finished. It’s honestly surprising how this game didn’t win Game of the Year—it absolutely deserves the title.\n\nHuge thanks to Game Science for creating this incredible masterpiece. I’m already excited for the upcoming DLC and hopefully the next game, Black Myth: Zhong Kui.\n\nI highly recommend this game is worth to play 10/10.",

Bosses hit hard, punish mistakes, and force you to actually learn their patterns instead of just spamming buttons.

The sound design is fantastic as well. The love and care that went into this game strikes you immediately, from the level design to the end-of-chapter tapestries and cutscenes. You can tell this game was a labor of love for the developers.\n\nAbove all else, what I love about the game is the combat. It's an excellent blend of fast-paced action and tactics. When you get the hang of the \"see-through\" mechanic, you can weave in and out of attacks like a boxing fight or a dance with your opponent. Truly an adrenaline rush and addicting! At its height, the combat is second to none, in my view.\n\nIf you can put aside the Unreal Engine 5 quirks, which are there, I think you should definitely give this game a shot. It is a very demanding game that will push your hardware to its limits, even top-end hardware.\n\nBut all in all, this is simply a game made for people that love video games.

The story is engaging, the world feels alive, and the characters you meet along the way are genuinely memorable, Ma Tianba especially… if you know, you know.\n\nThe soundtrack is incredible too. Chapter 2 with the Headless Monk had me vibing every single time he appeared.\n\nThe gameplay is fun, smooth and surprisingly versatile. You have multiple combat styles to try out, a bunch of cool-looking combos to learn and every fight feels satisfying. The bosses strike a great balance between not being too easy but not being frustrating either. A few of them can be annoying at first, but beating them feels so rewarding that you forget the pain instantly.\n\nI also love how the mechanics are designed. The game is filled with secrets that are actually enjoyable to discover, the weapons are fun to use and not extremely hard to obtain, and some of them even require New Game+, which gives you a real reason to start another run. The whole progression system, from unlocking abilities to collecting equipment, feels well thought-out and very satisfying.\n\nOverall, Black Myth: Wukong is an awesome experience from start to finish and I recommend it wholeheartedly.",

That’s Black Myth: Wukong. It’s like the world said “relive the legend,” and the game said “bet — I’ll turn you into a monkey god with a Ruyi Jingu Bang.”\nYou can spin-staff into a 12-hit combo, morph into a cicada to dodge fire, clone yourself for 360° chaos, and parry a boss so hard it staggers. And there’s one Destined One, fur flying, leaving a trail of shattered yaoguai behind. It’s raw. Beautiful, mythic raw.\nThings I love:\n• China’s myths feel alive — every temple, every fog, every peach tree\n• Staff goes THWACK-CRACK-BOOM\n• Bosses make you git gud (80+ of ‘em, no mercy)\n• Transformations = power-trip crack\n• You can rock golden headband drip and no one judges you\nThings I don’t like (but I still love it anyway):\n• Sometimes frame drops when 20 enemies explode at once\n• Gotta grind spirit shards like a monk on caffeine\n• One dodge too late = yeeted off the map… it was funny but also rude\nFinal Words:\nI’m 40 hours in, still dying to the same bull king, still laughing when I finally parry his charge and he flies into the wall.\nIf you want kung-fu, myths, and bosses that humble you, play this.\nSmash everything.

The art department cooked harder than anything I've ever seen and it blew me away every step of the way. \r\n\r\nMy only gripes are that the difficulty is rather mild and places its' self below fromsoft and Khazan. Also the equipment is all fantastic looking but the gearing system is flawed and mostly under-utilized. You often skip most weapons/armors because they are miniscule upgrades or just straight up worse.\r\n\r\nA gaming experience nobody should skip, and with a few tweaks to their combat and gear system it, like Sun Wukong, can too reach nirvana.",

It also offers a decent challenge while playing great. Some bosses can feel overwhelming at first, but learning and using the mechanics will see you prevail every situation. \n\nNo distracting forced messaging about modern day tropes and nonsense. Just a focus on story, gameplay and fun, the relevant things that make gaming great.\n\nThe true game of the year of 2024, absolutely no question here.

      "review": "tl; dr: Recommended\nHours Played: 100+ hrs (PS5 & Xbox & PC)\n\nAn Unforgiving Masterpiece (But Maybe Not For Everyone)\n\nLet’s get this out of the way first: Black Myth: Wukong is easily one of the most visually stunning and artistically rich games I have ever played. The world, the creature designs, and the sheer spectacle of the boss fights are nothing short of extraordinary. It feels like a true next-gen experience that respects the source material (Journey to the West) with incredible detail.\n\nHowever, I have to be critical here: this game is NOT for the faint of heart.\n\nWhile it’s an absolute 10/10 in presentation and combat feel, the difficulty curve is steep. If you are a general gamer expecting a hack-and-slash adventure like the older God of War titles, you are going to hit a wall. There is no difficulty slider, no map to guide you through the confusing level layouts, and some bosses will punish you relentlessly for hours. The invisible walls in exploration can also be frustratingly immersive-breaking.\n\nPros:\n• Combat: Fast, fluid, and incredibly satisfying once you master the stances.\n• Visuals: Absolutely drop-dead gorgeous environments and character models.\n• Boss Variety: Every boss feels unique, with their own personality and terrifying movesets.\n\nCons:\n• Accessibility: It is punishingly hard for the average player. There are no \"easy\" modes or assist features to help people just enjoy the story.\n• Level Design: Getting lost is easy due to the lack of a mini-map, and the levels—while beautiful—can feel a bit restrictive with invisible barriers.\n\nVerdict:\nThis is an awesome, extraordinary game that defines what an Action RPG can be, but you need patience and grit to get through it. It’s not a casual romp.\nThat being said, Game Science has proven they are a top-tier developer. I am already strapped in and hyped for their next project. Bring on Black Myth: Zhong Kui! I can't wait to see how they handle the ghost-catching god next.\n\nRating: 9.5/10",

      "review": "Currently in Act 5 of the game, and feel I can leave a review of the gameplay as of now. Short answer is, I love this game. It's graphics are really amazing, even on my lower end system with a RTX 4070 card, It runs very smooth and looks beautiful. I really enjoy the story, and boss battles the most. It seems like there's no end to the amount of bosses in this game, it has ton's and they're almost all unique and creative. The bosses can be somewhat difficult and gives it that Dark Souls kind of boss battles we love and crave more, each and every time we overcome and beat one. Unlike Dark Souls games, there is not a lot of trash mobs nor are they overly difficult, there's plenty of places to rest (shrines). They also don't punish you in this game for dying, so you don't lose your ability to purchase things or level up like you would in Dark Souls. They also allow you to re spec for free and an unlimited amount of times at any and every shrine you rest at. I do enjoy these aspects about this game, it allows trying out new specs and ability's much much much more frequently. Back to bosses they're really fun, and some can be very challenging, even in the first act you'll find some nice challenges, some are optional, some are required to progress. I haven't come across a boss that proved as difficult as Promised Consort Radahn or Malenia in Elden ring, but some have come a little close, such as Scorpion Lord, Yellow Long to name a few. I think my one and only complaint about Black Myth Wukong is how linear the game can be. Unlike most Dark Souls games, you cannot really go of the beaten path and jump up obstacles or terrain etc. to find unique hidden areas or ways to access areas that you normally couldn't. It's pretty much a straight line game and the lock your path on the straight line. There was many areas that appear to look like you could jump right up to reach unexplored terrain but the game wont let you. This makes it kinda hard to find some hidden areas as every now and then they will allow you to go off the beaten path, and a majority of the time you can't. This can cause you to miss items sometimes as you think it's not possible to explore. With all that being said though, this game is really a worthy investment and provides plenty of game play, (50hrs) so far for me and two acts left to go, and it a rewarding gameplay that addicts you after defeating a hard boss, which is what I love about Dark Souls like games.",

Something else to praise about the game is the boss battles, there are many and most of them are a blast! If you're new to souls like or games like god war this game will defentiley test you, for me it was very hard but super rewarding. The ending was pure cinema and left me satesfied. \r\n\r\nSome things to note, make sure to explore everything there are certain things in the game that are missable and locks you out from unlocking if you are not careful! This is one of the few annoying things about the game. Furthermore for some bosses the camera is not on your side whatsoever which is a bit of a issue. \r\n\r\nBut would highly recommend the game to anyone who likes these types of games, while it has some minor issues its certainly worth it!",

      "review": "iIf you’ve ever wondered what would happen if you mixed Dark Souls, a bit of Journey to the West, and an absolute ton of “I can’t believe this is real” moments, then look no further than Black Myth: Wukong. This game is like a fever dream where you play as the legendary Monkey King, Wukong, and let me tell you, it is wildly fun.\r\n\r\nFirst off, the visuals? Absolutely stunning. The game looks like a piece of high-art cinema, but without all the pretentiousness. The environments are so beautiful that I spent more time staring at the foliage than actually fighting (and probably getting killed because of it).\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of combat... let’s just say it’s as satisfying as hitting a piñata full of angry candy. Wukong’s ability to transform into different forms—like a giant rock-fisted demigod or a really angry cloud—will have you questioning all your life choices up to this point. You feel like a complete badass, and honestly, who doesn’t want to feel like a god-like monkey at least once in their life?\r\n\r\nThe story is engaging, the combat feels fluid, and the characters are a mix of hilarious and epic. I found myself laughing out loud at some of the banter, while also clutching my controller in sheer terror as I fought mythical creatures that should have never been allowed to exist outside of nightmares.\r\n\r\nOverall, Black Myth: Wukong is a rollercoaster of emotions: one minute you're laughing like a monkey, and the next you're crying (because you got obliterated by a giant boss). But in the end, you keep coming back for more. It's got everything: epic mythology, jaw-dropping graphics, and a protagonist who's way cooler than your average hero.\r\n\r\n10/10. Would absolutely get my butt kicked by mythical beasts again.",

I Hardly used incantations or spells in Elden Ring, I basically never used prosthetic tools in Sekiro, Only started using tools and silk skills in Silksong and even then never as much as I use the tools in this game and I think I finally figured out why. The demanding difficulty in those games right out the gate made it very difficult to add things to the core combat loop because doing so really threw off the flow and felt like more of disadvantage when trying to utilize them for the first, often resulting in you taking damage. In wukong the flow is excellent and all your spells and transformations feel intuitive and easy to add in the mix of a fight. You could try, experiment and mess up while not loosing half your health bar. It doesn't punish you for not immediately mastering every new tool the first time you use it. \r\n\r\nThe game is balanced, it hardly ever felt unfair and the progression made sense. Good engaging story that ties in nicely with NG+. Midway through I didn't think I was gonna do another cycle, maybe because I didn't get the same feeling when I first played elden ring or when combat finally clicked in sekiro but somewhere around hour 30 when I finally started paying attention to the mechanics and the few bosses I actually had to pay attention to I realised how much fun I was having and how much I was missing out on. In the finally chapter, although at first it felt a little directionless compared to the previous it caught itself quickly and pulled me back in.

      "review": "6.5/10 overall. Very overrated game that takes inspiration from a lot of action games but doesn't do well in any department. No unique ideas. It is just an okay high production action game. Missing items that are impossible to know exist without guides really ruins the experience alongside immersion-breaking invisible walls and inconsistency in how skills work; some boss fights are horrible because of the camera, FPS drops and de-sync hitboxes. Overall looks solid and visually stunning in some areas but underneath it is sloppy and inconsistent. \n\nGameplay: \nVery average. It doesn't feel solid and refined. Light attacks can't be easily canceled and you will often trade hits; you have to wait for openings but some enemies have very short ones. Some counter moves don't work well. Balance is all over the place where some abilities are nearly mandatory if you want to do decent damage. Enemies have weird animations in some cases with instant startup. Projectile deflecting move is very clunky. Invisible walls are horrible and immersion breaking. There isn't much variety in gameplay and it is mostly boss rush with some elite enemies scattered around. Gameplay loop is okay overall but nothing significant.  A lot of abilities/spirits are not practical. The camera is really bad and there are major collision issues with enemies. \n\nAlso, some secrets, puzzles and quests are easily missable and they are hard to keep track off. I had to reload a save once from a backup because I killed a duo boss by mistake in the wrong order, \n\nLevel design: \nBiggest issue with the game. Most paths look the same as if they were procedurally generated; it is easy to get lost and confused because everything looks like a maze. Invisible walls suck and the game feels like a bunch of corridors. \n\nStory: \nI don't know what is happening. Just an ape that is the chosen one. The journal is even more confusing. Presentation is very generic. There are souls-style NPCs that you run into but their stories are not impactful so far. \n\nGraphics and performance: \nThe game looks really good in some places under direction sunlight but some areas have very low res textures. Sometimes Path tracing bugs out and you get dark shadows. Performance is bad and you need frame gen if you want to run the highest GI implementation. A lot of stuttering and FPS drops from some particle effects. \nGameplay: \nVery average. It doesn't feel solid and refined.

      "review": "I'm largely feeling that this game just isn't for me. I've played DS1-3, Bloodborne and Elden Ring, so I'm not a stranger to difficult games, but I'm just not having fun with this one. \n\nIt's very boss oriented and it's quite clear the devs didn't care about the stuff between the bosses as much as the bosses themselves. Trash mobs that require little to no strategy or pattern learning to beat and very little variety in a given area. The environmental design is nice to look at (although water effects leave something to be desired), so it's a bit of a shame that there's not more of it between bosses to wind down and experiment safely with the new things you got from the last boss. In one area, there's new enemies which quite easily and quickly poison you, which the game will tell you that you can heal using a specific item that you can buy at a vendor. The caveat being that the one shop you buy them at has limited stock and doesn't refresh until set points in the game, so if you buy and use them all, you're shit out of luck. You can try grinding for them from enemy drops but they're not guaranteed. \n\nThe graphics are beautiful if you have hardware that can handle it too, but it's a taxing game. Framerates could be better and this game is yet another one that requires heavy use of upscaling, something which soured the visuals a bit in my experience, where I noticed noise mostly in reflections which was quite jarring to me. For reference, I'm using what the game recommended, which at 4k with a 5080 was DLSS balanced. One thing the game could've benefitted from was HDR. A modern AAA game pushing graphics should really have it, especially one which uses a quite wide range of colours and brightness levels.\n\nThe bosses are a challenge, some more or less than others (especially depending on the order you do them, looking at you Wondering Wight), but I'm not getting the same feeling that I have in the past with the soulsborne games when I finally figure out a boss. There's no elated feeling of success, just relief that it's over, only to remember that there's going to be another boss within the next 10 minutes (frequently less than that) which quickly turns relief into dread. This isn't helped by bosses feeling like a slog, at least partially due to inputs feeling delayed at times and outright ignored at others. Dodges frequently not happening, lack of cancelling in some scenarios, heals just not happening when windows for them are often just large enough to fit one in, uncharged heavy attacks taking a second before they actually start which gives the impression that they might've been ignored or cancelled until it's too late. This game clearly wants you to play in a methodical, less spammy way, but in this implementation, it's to the detrement of feeling like I'm in control all the time.\n\nI'm probably dropping this one, maybe after another boss or 2. The last one used the whole \"but wait there's more\" second phase with a new health bar crap which kinda sets the tone further in the negative direction. I've heard things open up in chapter 2 with more exploration, but there's 4 bosses until then apparently and I don't know if I care enough about this game to bother pushing to that point.",

      "review": "Black Myth: Wukong did not land for me. The controls felt sluggish from the start, which made combat less satisfying and movement less responsive. The world itself often felt empty, lacking the sense of immersion or interactivity you would expect from a modern title of this scale.\r\n\r\nI also encountered several issues running the game on PC, including bugs just to get it started. While the graphics are solid, they are not on the level of older releases such as God of War (2018), which is disappointing given how much more recent this game is.\r\n\r\nThe main character lacked personality, and there was little narrative depth to keep me invested. The marketing and community buzz emphasized the game’s difficulty, but in practice it was not nearly as challenging as advertised. The game leans heavily on boss encounters, with very few breaks between them, but those fights themselves were not demanding.\r\n\r\nThe armor system also fell short. There are many armor sets, yet only one or two feel genuinely useful, making the rest feel unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe one element I appreciated is the Wukong story itself, but that credit goes to the source material. The narrative foundation already existed, and the game simply adapts it rather than building something truly original.\r\n\r\nOverall, Black Myth: Wukong felt like a missed opportunity. Despite the strong mythology behind it, the gameplay, character design, and overall execution did not deliver the experience I was hoping for.",

      "review": "This review will give me a big headache. Black Myth Wukong is not a bad game per se. In fact it is quiite good, but from my perspective there are lots of things that annoyed me. \r\nIn the end some decisions even let me abandon the game and I will not play it again soon.\r\nIn the following I will pin out some of these aspects.\r\n\r\nFirst  point of critic relates to the world design. I have seen few games that were so beautifully crafted that I wanted to explore the entire map. The bushes and forests are green, lush and colorful. The desert is dry and you've got the feeling you could count every single grain of sand. Unfortunately the whole scenery is just a facade. You often run against a invisible wall one after another. The route is clearly predetermined. You will run from one boss fight to the next one. \r\nAs soon as you reach chapter 2 the game world opens up steadily. However up to this point exploring is still almost non existent. In the worst situation you will not be able to tell if a path leads to another invisble wall or if it is the path to the boss fight.\r\n\r\nSecond point of critic applies to the gameplay. I am not sure if I would describe the gameplay similar to a souls-like. The difficult level for sure is quite the same. You have a light and a heavy attack, different skills etc.  That is okay and not an issue. The real problem lies in the animation of the attacks. As soon as the attack animation of your playable character is executed, you are not able to cancel it. If the boss or other pawns attacks you during the execution of the  player animation you are not able to dodge or block the enemy's attack. Due to Sun Wukong excessive rod swinging, the full animation takes too long and you will get hit for sure. The gameplay/animation feels delayed and not well-conceived. On the other side I could imagine the reason for this decision. It should probably prevent button smashing. \r\n\r\nLast but not least some bosses are not well designed. [spoiler]In chapter 3 you will meet a dragon for example (I forgot already his name). The boss is not particulary hard and he do not make a lot of damage like others, but he is continously flying in the air so you have to wait until he is reachable for an attack attempt [/spoiler].\r\nIn my eyes something like that is artificially raising the difficulty.\r\n\r\nI feel a little bit sad about Black Myth Wukong.  The game has potential and many people will enjoy it for sure. I also want to enjoy Wukong but the aforementioned points and some other strange design aspects made it hard for me to appreciate the game.",

      "review": "[h3][b]Probably the most overrated game I’ve ever played[/b][/h3]\n\nLet me start off by saying that this game is absolutely gorgeous. The visuals are incredible, the environments are stunning, and the sheer spectacle of the game’s events are breathtaking. This game brings the legend of Sun Wukong and the Journey to the West to life in video game format which is honestly amazing and very impressive. However, this is where the glazing stops.\n\nI 100%’d this game and I’m glad I did just so I know I’ve seen all it has to offer before judging it, and let me tell you this game is absolutely obsessed with itself. I’ve never seen a game so far up its own ass. Everything is a set-piece. Everything has to look cool first and foremost. Gameplay be damned. Reading and reacting to enemy attacks takes a backseat to how cool an enemy attack looks visually. Nothing needs to make sense, nothing needs to be fun, but everything MUST look cool.\n\nThe combat loop offers a moderate skill ceiling if you REALLY go out of your way to make it challenging. Almost all of the time it just comes down to dodging and cycling through your cooldowns. In fact, you are heavily incentivised to loop your tools in such a way that the opponent/boss does not get the chance to retaliate. You need go no further than youtube to see what I mean. A lot of the combat showcases consist of stunning the boss > big bonk that takes half his health and knocks him down > boss wakes up into clones that whittle him down for you > by that point he meets his damage threshold to get knocked down again or your stun comes off cooldown and you can just wail on him to finish him off. Resource gaming at its finest.\n\nBoss fights are not signposted at all, so you will randomly stumble into one while exploring. Oh did you use your healing flask and your cooldowns in combat while exploring? That’s too bad, now go into this boss fight disadvantaged and die, only to run back to it once you know it’s here and breeze through it now that you have all your resources.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of the bosses will have some kind of attack that forces you into a dodging simulator, i.e. Boss flies up into the sky and becomes invulnerable while unleashing bullet hell on you. It’s very repetitive and obnoxious.\n\nMany of the bosses have a little aura farming mode that they go into where they will just stroll through the arena and stare at you menacingly. I personally enjoyed these and played along by aura farming a little myself, but it feeds further into the design philosophy of: spectacle first, gameplay later.\n\nThe game is also perfectly fine with fucking you over and pulling the rug out from under you in service of the spectacle;\n[list]\n[*]Oh did you get the boss to half health? Here take this scripted sequence/cutscene in which you take forced damage which you will have to heal back once the cutscene is over.\n[*]Did you use one of your major cooldowns just before the forced cutscene? That’s really unfortunate, it’s now on cooldown and you wasted it. \n[*]Did the boss have a stun bar or some kind of secondary resource that you were whittling down? Unlucky fam, the boss has now turned into a big invulnerable gold statue and all resources are restored after this awesome choreographed sequence. [*]Was the boss in the middle of a hard stun animation when you reached the health threshold for the scripted sequence? Fuck you sweetie, it’s cutscene time.\n[/list]\nUnlike most of the clueless casual apes that called this a “souls-like”, I didn’t go into this game expecting it to be a souls-like just because it has bonfire-style checkpoints. I went into the game assuming it would be an action adventure with a focus on melee combat like God of War or Ghost of Tsushima, but just like the casual apes I was mistaken. This is a mostly linear boss rush with a little bit of incidental combat and pretty scenery to break it up.\n[olist]\n[*]Find the boss fight\n[*]Suicide and run back with all your cooldowns ready\n[*]Rotate all your cooldowns with just a tiny bit of dodging in between. \n[*]Die because you didn’t coordinate your cooldowns around the scripted sequences and cutscenes.\n[*]Run back and demolish the boss easily because now you know when the scripted sequences happen.\n[*]Rinse and repeat for 6 chapters[/olist]\n11/10 visuals\n3/10 gameplay\nSave yourself the trouble and watch it on youtube. Never played AstroBot but I’m glad it won.",

      "review": "\"their precision will be auto-corrected no matter how many steps you take around them.\"\n\nI love the immersive atmosphere that this game provides, except the battle mechanics are poor. very poor. The fight mechanics in this game remind me of Red dead redemption 2, lots of auto aim, just timing. You can't simply run out of any enemies attack, as most enemy attacks aren't given a limited turn speed or range of auto-aim. So the spear thrusts and almost every other attack in the game needs to be mechanically dodged with the dodge button or the rock spell. Which means there's no intuitive dodging here, if you will, it's timing based no matter how you move you will need to dodge. The game is built to please reptile brained people rather than people with a high fight IQ.\n\nYou will see over and over again even if your opponent couldn't have physically turned around during their thrust that since there feet aren't actually physically interacting with the ground, like real life, that it wont matter where you have moved to after they begun to swing, their precision will be auto corrected no matter how many steps you take around them. So, for me since the fighting just seems like a big gimmic just like WoW, I give this a thumbs down for trying not to be one, but it is. Your enemies wont feel real. You'll feel like you're fighting robots.",

      "review": "I'm largely feeling that this game just isn't for me. I've played DS1-3, Bloodborne and Elden Ring, so I'm not a stranger to difficult games, but I'm just not having fun with this one. \n\nIt's very boss oriented and it's quite clear the devs didn't care about the stuff between the bosses as much as the bosses themselves. Trash mobs that require little to no strategy or pattern learning to beat and very little variety in a given area. The environmental design is nice to look at (although water effects leave something to be desired), so it's a bit of a shame that there's not more of it between bosses to wind down and experiment safely with the new things you got from the last boss. In one area, there's new enemies which quite easily and quickly poison you, which the game will tell you that you can heal using a specific item that you can buy at a vendor. The caveat being that the one shop you buy them at has limited stock and doesn't refresh until set points in the game, so if you buy and use them all, you're shit out of luck. You can try grinding for them from enemy drops but they're not guaranteed. \n\nThe graphics are beautiful if you have hardware that can handle it too, but it's a taxing game. Framerates could be better and this game is yet another one that requires heavy use of upscaling, something which soured the visuals a bit in my experience, where I noticed noise mostly in reflections which was quite jarring to me. For reference, I'm using what the game recommended, which at 4k with a 5080 was DLSS balanced. One thing the game could've benefitted from was HDR. A modern AAA game pushing graphics should really have it, especially one which uses a quite wide range of colours and brightness levels.\n\nThe bosses are a challenge, some more or less than others (especially depending on the order you do them, looking at you Wondering Wight), but I'm not getting the same feeling that I have in the past with the soulsborne games when I finally figure out a boss. There's no elated feeling of success, just relief that it's over, only to remember that there's going to be another boss within the next 10 minutes (frequently less than that) which quickly turns relief into dread. This isn't helped by bosses feeling like a slog, at least partially due to inputs feeling delayed at times and outright ignored at others. Dodges frequently not happening, lack of cancelling in some scenarios, heals just not happening when windows for them are often just large enough to fit one in, uncharged heavy attacks taking a second before they actually start which gives the impression that they might've been ignored or cancelled until it's too late. This game clearly wants you to play in a methodical, less spammy way, but in this implementation, it's to the detrement of feeling like I'm in control all the time.\n\nI'm probably dropping this one, maybe after another boss or 2. The last one used the whole \"but wait there's more\" second phase with a new health bar crap which kinda sets the tone further in the negative direction. I've heard things open up in chapter 2 with more exploration, but there's 4 bosses until then apparently and I don't know if I care enough about this game to bother pushing to that point.",

      "review": "Black Myth: Wukong did not land for me. The controls felt sluggish from the start, which made combat less satisfying and movement less responsive. The world itself often felt empty, lacking the sense of immersion or interactivity you would expect from a modern title of this scale.\r\n\r\nI also encountered several issues running the game on PC, including bugs just to get it started. While the graphics are solid, they are not on the level of older releases such as God of War (2018), which is disappointing given how much more recent this game is.\r\n\r\nThe main character lacked personality, and there was little narrative depth to keep me invested. The marketing and community buzz emphasized the game’s difficulty, but in practice it was not nearly as challenging as advertised. The game leans heavily on boss encounters, with very few breaks between them, but those fights themselves were not demanding.\r\n\r\nThe armor system also fell short. There are many armor sets, yet only one or two feel genuinely useful, making the rest feel unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe one element I appreciated is the Wukong story itself, but that credit goes to the source material. The narrative foundation already existed, and the game simply adapts it rather than building something truly original.\r\n\r\nOverall, Black Myth: Wukong felt like a missed opportunity. Despite the strong mythology behind it, the gameplay, character design, and overall execution did not deliver the experience I was hoping for.",

      "review": "This review will give me a big headache. Black Myth Wukong is not a bad game per se. In fact it is quiite good, but from my perspective there are lots of things that annoyed me. \r\nIn the end some decisions even let me abandon the game and I will not play it again soon.\r\nIn the following I will pin out some of these aspects.\r\n\r\nFirst  point of critic relates to the world design. I have seen few games that were so beautifully crafted that I wanted to explore the entire map. The bushes and forests are green, lush and colorful. The desert is dry and you've got the feeling you could count every single grain of sand. Unfortunately the whole scenery is just a facade. You often run against a invisible wall one after another. The route is clearly predetermined. You will run from one boss fight to the next one. \r\nAs soon as you reach chapter 2 the game world opens up steadily. However up to this point exploring is still almost non existent. In the worst situation you will not be able to tell if a path leads to another invisble wall or if it is the path to the boss fight.\r\n\r\nSecond point of critic applies to the gameplay. I am not sure if I would describe the gameplay similar to a souls-like. The difficult level for sure is quite the same. You have a light and a heavy attack, different skills etc.  That is okay and not an issue. The real problem lies in the animation of the attacks. As soon as the attack animation of your playable character is executed, you are not able to cancel it. If the boss or other pawns attacks you during the execution of the  player animation you are not able to dodge or block the enemy's attack. Due to Sun Wukong excessive rod swinging, the full animation takes too long and you will get hit for sure. The gameplay/animation feels delayed and not well-conceived. On the other side I could imagine the reason for this decision. It should probably prevent button smashing. \r\n\r\nLast but not least some bosses are not well designed. [spoiler]In chapter 3 you will meet a dragon for example (I forgot already his name). The boss is not particulary hard and he do not make a lot of damage like others, but he is continously flying in the air so you have to wait until he is reachable for an attack attempt [/spoiler].\r\nIn my eyes something like that is artificially raising the difficulty.\r\n\r\nI feel a little bit sad about Black Myth Wukong.  The game has potential and many people will enjoy it for sure. I also want to enjoy Wukong but the aforementioned points and some other strange design aspects made it hard for me to appreciate the game.",

      "review": "[h3][b]Probably the most overrated game I’ve ever played[/b][/h3]\n\nLet me start off by saying that this game is absolutely gorgeous. The visuals are incredible, the environments are stunning, and the sheer spectacle of the game’s events are breathtaking. This game brings the legend of Sun Wukong and the Journey to the West to life in video game format which is honestly amazing and very impressive. However, this is where the glazing stops.\n\nI 100%’d this game and I’m glad I did just so I know I’ve seen all it has to offer before judging it, and let me tell you this game is absolutely obsessed with itself. I’ve never seen a game so far up its own ass. Everything is a set-piece. Everything has to look cool first and foremost. Gameplay be damned. Reading and reacting to enemy attacks takes a backseat to how cool an enemy attack looks visually. Nothing needs to make sense, nothing needs to be fun, but everything MUST look cool.\n\nThe combat loop offers a moderate skill ceiling if you REALLY go out of your way to make it challenging. Almost all of the time it just comes down to dodging and cycling through your cooldowns. In fact, you are heavily incentivised to loop your tools in such a way that the opponent/boss does not get the chance to retaliate. You need go no further than youtube to see what I mean. A lot of the combat showcases consist of stunning the boss > big bonk that takes half his health and knocks him down > boss wakes up into clones that whittle him down for you > by that point he meets his damage threshold to get knocked down again or your stun comes off cooldown and you can just wail on him to finish him off. Resource gaming at its finest.\n\nBoss fights are not signposted at all, so you will randomly stumble into one while exploring. Oh did you use your healing flask and your cooldowns in combat while exploring? That’s too bad, now go into this boss fight disadvantaged and die, only to run back to it once you know it’s here and breeze through it now that you have all your resources.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of the bosses will have some kind of attack that forces you into a dodging simulator, i.e. Boss flies up into the sky and becomes invulnerable while unleashing bullet hell on you. It’s very repetitive and obnoxious.\n\nMany of the bosses have a little aura farming mode that they go into where they will just stroll through the arena and stare at you menacingly. I personally enjoyed these and played along by aura farming a little myself, but it feeds further into the design philosophy of: spectacle first, gameplay later.\n\nThe game is also perfectly fine with fucking you over and pulling the rug out from under you in service of the spectacle;\n[list]\n[*]Oh did you get the boss to half health? Here take this scripted sequence/cutscene in which you take forced damage which you will have to heal back once the cutscene is over.\n[*]Did you use one of your major cooldowns just before the forced cutscene? That’s really unfortunate, it’s now on cooldown and you wasted it. \n[*]Did the boss have a stun bar or some kind of secondary resource that you were whittling down? Unlucky fam, the boss has now turned into a big invulnerable gold statue and all resources are restored after this awesome choreographed sequence. [*]Was the boss in the middle of a hard stun animation when you reached the health threshold for the scripted sequence? Fuck you sweetie, it’s cutscene time.\n[/list]\nUnlike most of the clueless casual apes that called this a “souls-like”, I didn’t go into this game expecting it to be a souls-like just because it has bonfire-style checkpoints. I went into the game assuming it would be an action adventure with a focus on melee combat like God of War or Ghost of Tsushima, but just like the casual apes I was mistaken. This is a mostly linear boss rush with a little bit of incidental combat and pretty scenery to break it up.\n[olist]\n[*]Find the boss fight\n[*]Suicide and run back with all your cooldowns ready\n[*]Rotate all your cooldowns with just a tiny bit of dodging in between. \n[*]Die because you didn’t coordinate your cooldowns around the scripted sequences and cutscenes.\n[*]Run back and demolish the boss easily because now you know when the scripted sequences happen.\n[*]Rinse and repeat for 6 chapters[/olist]\n11/10 visuals\n3/10 gameplay\nSave yourself the trouble and watch it on youtube.

The fight mechanics in this game remind me of Red dead redemption 2, lots of auto aim, just timing. You can't simply run out of any enemies attack, as most enemy attacks aren't given a limited turn speed or range of auto-aim. So the spear thrusts and almost every other attack in the game needs to be mechanically dodged with the dodge button or the rock spell. Which means there's no intuitive dodging here, if you will, it's timing based no matter how you move you will need to dodge. The game is built to please reptile brained people rather than people with a high fight IQ.\n\nYou will see over and over again even if your opponent couldn't have physically turned around during their thrust that since there feet aren't actually physically interacting with the ground, like real life, that it wont matter where you have moved to after they begun to swing, their precision will be auto corrected no matter how many steps you take around them.

      "review": "I'm largely feeling that this game just isn't for me. I've played DS1-3, Bloodborne and Elden Ring, so I'm not a stranger to difficult games, but I'm just not having fun with this one. \n\nIt's very boss oriented and it's quite clear the devs didn't care about the stuff between the bosses as much as the bosses themselves. Trash mobs that require little to no strategy or pattern learning to beat and very little variety in a given area. The environmental design is nice to look at (although water effects leave something to be desired), so it's a bit of a shame that there's not more of it between bosses to wind down and experiment safely with the new things you got from the last boss. In one area, there's new enemies which quite easily and quickly poison you, which the game will tell you that you can heal using a specific item that you can buy at a vendor. The caveat being that the one shop you buy them at has limited stock and doesn't refresh until set points in the game, so if you buy and use them all, you're shit out of luck. You can try grinding for them from enemy drops but they're not guaranteed. \n\nThe graphics are beautiful if you have hardware that can handle it too, but it's a taxing game. Framerates could be better and this game is yet another one that requires heavy use of upscaling, something which soured the visuals a bit in my experience, where I noticed noise mostly in reflections which was quite jarring to me. For reference, I'm using what the game recommended, which at 4k with a 5080 was DLSS balanced. One thing the game could've benefitted from was HDR. A modern AAA game pushing graphics should really have it, especially one which uses a quite wide range of colours and brightness levels.\n\nThe bosses are a challenge, some more or less than others (especially depending on the order you do them, looking at you Wondering Wight), but I'm not getting the same feeling that I have in the past with the soulsborne games when I finally figure out a boss. There's no elated feeling of success, just relief that it's over, only to remember that there's going to be another boss within the next 10 minutes (frequently less than that) which quickly turns relief into dread. This isn't helped by bosses feeling like a slog, at least partially due to inputs feeling delayed at times and outright ignored at others. Dodges frequently not happening, lack of cancelling in some scenarios, heals just not happening when windows for them are often just large enough to fit one in, uncharged heavy attacks taking a second before they actually start which gives the impression that they might've been ignored or cancelled until it's too late. This game clearly wants you to play in a methodical, less spammy way, but in this implementation, it's to the detrement of feeling like I'm in control all the time.\n\nI'm probably dropping this one, maybe after another boss or 2. The last one used the whole \"but wait there's more\" second phase with a new health bar crap which kinda sets the tone further in the negative direction. I've heard things open up in chapter 2 with more exploration, but there's 4 bosses until then apparently and I don't know if I care enough about this game to bother pushing to that point.",

      "review": "Black Myth: Wukong did not land for me. The controls felt sluggish from the start, which made combat less satisfying and movement less responsive. The world itself often felt empty, lacking the sense of immersion or interactivity you would expect from a modern title of this scale.\r\n\r\nI also encountered several issues running the game on PC, including bugs just to get it started. While the graphics are solid, they are not on the level of older releases such as God of War (2018), which is disappointing given how much more recent this game is.\r\n\r\nThe main character lacked personality, and there was little narrative depth to keep me invested. The marketing and community buzz emphasized the game’s difficulty, but in practice it was not nearly as challenging as advertised. The game leans heavily on boss encounters, with very few breaks between them, but those fights themselves were not demanding.\r\n\r\nThe armor system also fell short. There are many armor sets, yet only one or two feel genuinely useful, making the rest feel unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe one element I appreciated is the Wukong story itself, but that credit goes to the source material. The narrative foundation already existed, and the game simply adapts it rather than building something truly original.\r\n\r\nOverall, Black Myth: Wukong felt like a missed opportunity. Despite the strong mythology behind it, the gameplay, character design, and overall execution did not deliver the experience I was hoping for.",

Some things seem to have been \"inspired\" a bit too much from other games, such as their very own version of the Irithyll dungeon except much more obnoxious. After I beat it I don't see myself revisiting it.",

      "review": "This review will give me a big headache. Black Myth Wukong is not a bad game per se. In fact it is quiite good, but from my perspective there are lots of things that annoyed me. \r\nIn the end some decisions even let me abandon the game and I will not play it again soon.\r\nIn the following I will pin out some of these aspects.\r\n\r\nFirst  point of critic relates to the world design. I have seen few games that were so beautifully crafted that I wanted to explore the entire map. The bushes and forests are green, lush and colorful. The desert is dry and you've got the feeling you could count every single grain of sand. Unfortunately the whole scenery is just a facade. You often run against a invisible wall one after another. The route is clearly predetermined. You will run from one boss fight to the next one. \r\nAs soon as you reach chapter 2 the game world opens up steadily. However up to this point exploring is still almost non existent. In the worst situation you will not be able to tell if a path leads to another invisble wall or if it is the path to the boss fight.\r\n\r\nSecond point of critic applies to the gameplay. I am not sure if I would describe the gameplay similar to a souls-like. The difficult level for sure is quite the same. You have a light and a heavy attack, different skills etc.  That is okay and not an issue. The real problem lies in the animation of the attacks. As soon as the attack animation of your playable character is executed, you are not able to cancel it. If the boss or other pawns attacks you during the execution of the  player animation you are not able to dodge or block the enemy's attack. Due to Sun Wukong excessive rod swinging, the full animation takes too long and you will get hit for sure. The gameplay/animation feels delayed and not well-conceived. On the other side I could imagine the reason for this decision. It should probably prevent button smashing. \r\n\r\nLast but not least some bosses are not well designed. [spoiler]In chapter 3 you will meet a dragon for example (I forgot already his name). The boss is not particulary hard and he do not make a lot of damage like others, but he is continously flying in the air so you have to wait until he is reachable for an attack attempt [/spoiler].\r\nIn my eyes something like that is artificially raising the difficulty.\r\n\r\nI feel a little bit sad about Black Myth Wukong.  The game has potential and many people will enjoy it for sure. I also want to enjoy Wukong but the aforementioned points and some other strange design aspects made it hard for me to appreciate the game.",

Definitely needs to be nerfed and tested on multiple boss battles with different strategies instead of making a game with a particular strategy.  Dodging something still gets you hit from hit boxes, an the frame rate is terrible at times, experienced black screens, and slow downs like crazy especially on chapter 6.

      "review": "[h3][b]Probably the most overrated game I’ve ever played[/b][/h3]\n\nLet me start off by saying that this game is absolutely gorgeous. The visuals are incredible, the environments are stunning, and the sheer spectacle of the game’s events are breathtaking. This game brings the legend of Sun Wukong and the Journey to the West to life in video game format which is honestly amazing and very impressive. However, this is where the glazing stops.\n\nI 100%’d this game and I’m glad I did just so I know I’ve seen all it has to offer before judging it, and let me tell you this game is absolutely obsessed with itself. I’ve never seen a game so far up its own ass. Everything is a set-piece. Everything has to look cool first and foremost. Gameplay be damned. Reading and reacting to enemy attacks takes a backseat to how cool an enemy attack looks visually. Nothing needs to make sense, nothing needs to be fun, but everything MUST look cool.\n\nThe combat loop offers a moderate skill ceiling if you REALLY go out of your way to make it challenging. Almost all of the time it just comes down to dodging and cycling through your cooldowns. In fact, you are heavily incentivised to loop your tools in such a way that the opponent/boss does not get the chance to retaliate. You need go no further than youtube to see what I mean. A lot of the combat showcases consist of stunning the boss > big bonk that takes half his health and knocks him down > boss wakes up into clones that whittle him down for you > by that point he meets his damage threshold to get knocked down again or your stun comes off cooldown and you can just wail on him to finish him off. Resource gaming at its finest.\n\nBoss fights are not signposted at all, so you will randomly stumble into one while exploring. Oh did you use your healing flask and your cooldowns in combat while exploring? That’s too bad, now go into this boss fight disadvantaged and die, only to run back to it once you know it’s here and breeze through it now that you have all your resources.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of the bosses will have some kind of attack that forces you into a dodging simulator, i.e. Boss flies up into the sky and becomes invulnerable while unleashing bullet hell on you. It’s very repetitive and obnoxious.\n\nMany of the bosses have a little aura farming mode that they go into where they will just stroll through the arena and stare at you menacingly. I personally enjoyed these and played along by aura farming a little myself, but it feeds further into the design philosophy of: spectacle first, gameplay later.\n\nThe game is also perfectly fine with fucking you over and pulling the rug out from under you in service of the spectacle;\n[list]\n[*]Oh did you get the boss to half health? Here take this scripted sequence/cutscene in which you take forced damage which you will have to heal back once the cutscene is over.\n[*]Did you use one of your major cooldowns just before the forced cutscene? That’s really unfortunate, it’s now on cooldown and you wasted it. \n[*]Did the boss have a stun bar or some kind of secondary resource that you were whittling down? Unlucky fam, the boss has now turned into a big invulnerable gold statue and all resources are restored after this awesome choreographed sequence. [*]Was the boss in the middle of a hard stun animation when you reached the health threshold for the scripted sequence? Fuck you sweetie, it’s cutscene time.\n[/list]\nUnlike most of the clueless casual apes that called this a “souls-like”, I didn’t go into this game expecting it to be a souls-like just because it has bonfire-style checkpoints. I went into the game assuming it would be an action adventure with a focus on melee combat like God of War or Ghost of Tsushima, but just like the casual apes I was mistaken. This is a mostly linear boss rush with a little bit of incidental combat and pretty scenery to break it up.\n[olist]\n[*]Find the boss fight\n[*]Suicide and run back with all your cooldowns ready\n[*]Rotate all your cooldowns with just a tiny bit of dodging in between. \n[*]Die because you didn’t coordinate your cooldowns around the scripted sequences and cutscenes.\n[*]Run back and demolish the boss easily because now you know when the scripted sequences happen.\n[*]Rinse and repeat for 6 chapters[/olist]\n11/10 visuals\n3/10 gameplay\nSave yourself the trouble and watch it on youtube. Never played AstroBot but I’m glad it won.",
