      "review": "[h2] Good but flawed [/h2]\n\nI've only played the original Assassin's Creed upon release before this. I hoped the series had grown quite a bit since that first game.\n\n[h3] The good [/h3]\n\nThe world is quite expansive and mostly beautifully designed. As soon as the story gets underway and you get command of the ship the scale of possible things to do skyrockets. The base game loop on the ship is very solid, and fighting/boarding/chasing other ships can be very entertaining. Atmosphere on the ship is top notch as well. With the wind in your sails and your crew singing their shanties it just puts a smile on your face. The controls of the ship are well realized.\n\nEven in 2025 the game still looks good. In some moments it can even be gorgeous (The ship at sea and some levels).\n\nThe cast of characters is quite diverse, though most are pretty foreseeable and/or rather bland. The story is serviceable, though nothing to write home about. Some enemies, especially the legendary ships you can face, offer a nice challenge.\n\nThankfully none of the achievements force you to scour the whole world for all the collectibles, for there are many. \n\n[h3] The bad [/h3]\n\nThe biggest problem to enjoy the world more is the artificial intelligence. While ships behave decently and the towns are well populated and at least try to simulate a bustling city in the age of sail, the actual enemies on foot are dumb as a rock. They're mostly deaf (Only gunshots and explosions seem to pierce into their brain) and their eyesight is very selective. They can spot you pretty easily in the darkest of nights, but don't see their buddies getting murdered in front of their face, if said buddy is standing in a bush up to his knees. Missing colleagues and searching for them is out of the question. Dead bodies don't always gather the attention they deserve. So the AI isn't very challenging and very easily exploited. The variety of enemies is also very poor. Except of a late game group every faction you face has the same 3-5 boring enemy types just in different uniforms.\n\nThe \"irl\" office story is forgettable and not worth its time, IMO. As it was in the original game.\n\nSome side activities are too repetitive and get boring fast. The open world activities have a significant \"designed by Ubisoft committee\" feel. Some levels aren't fully accessible in certain situations, which makes some collectibles inaccessible. Which the game annoyingly doesn't mention.\n\n[h3] The ugly [/h3]\n\nThe controls can be infuriating at times. The console roots are clearly visible and can be frustrating when speed is needed. Every action such as pick up/drop/loot/whistle for example is mapped to one button. Which means that actions are only available in certain situations, which limits your ability to play as you wish greatly. How I wanted to pick up a body, but only picked up his weapon. Or wanted to whistle but couldn't since I was not sitting in a bush.\n\nAnother control problem is the characters almost magnetic draw to climbing and hiding. Multiple times during chases the character jumped into hiding spots instead of running past them. Said hiding spots can be very buggy as well, literally kicking you out 2 seconds after you hid in them. Some QTE sessions give a flashback to a strange time. Breaking an enemies defence is a mechanic that only works sporadically.\n\nThe checkpoint system can be very punishing and unreliable. Reloads reset all enemies in a level and can forget successfully completed secondary objective, which can be tedious.\n\n[h3] The worst [/h3]\n\nThe multiplayer in 2025 is a shit show. Troubleshooting its connections issues took quite a while. Adding players/friends into a match failed 9 out of 10 times even after fixing it, which leaves only matchmaking. Which is horrific in its own way (Kicks players very fast, jumps into populated games of a mode you didn't choose. Disconnects are plenty as well). You'll spend hours trying to find players and matches.\n\nThe base game loop in the most played mode (Wolfpack) gets very boring fast. Cool skills that you actually want to use unlock very late.\n\n[h3] Conclusion [/h3]\n\nIMO this is a great addition to the series, but some parts really leave a bitter aftertaste. It still has some mechanics of the first one, which should've been improved by now. YMMV.\n\n[h3] Freedom Cry DLC [/h3]\n\nThe DLC has some issues as well. One mission (Gathering info) is quite bugged and can't be done with both secondaries in one go. The Blunderbuss is a cool weapon but its range leads to some issues during ship boarding (The range is too short to shoot the scout on the other mast). Plantations are interesting (The harvest songs sung feel authentic). The missions are okay, but the \"mini games\" of freeing slaves feel like Ubisoft is making light of the plight on the world that was the slave trade.",

      "review": "Developed and published by Ubisoft, Assassin’s Creed Black Flag is an open world, third person action-adventure game with emphasis on exploration, was released in 2013.  \n\nAs a newly hired employee for Abstergo Industries movie department, you have the opportunity to dive into Edward Kenway’s memories, extracted from subject 17’s genetic memory, and follow his maritime adventures as a buccaneer in the golden age of piracy in the early 18th century, all while collecting footage for an explosive possible movie. As a special request from the higher ups, you are also incentivised to seek out an artifact, called “the observatory”. \n\nLike previous games, this one is divided into the memories you explore in the Animus and present-day exploration, both intertwined to weave an engrossing story, filled with all the aspects that have been presented so far in the other games of the series.  \n\nA new aspect introduced in Black Flag is the seamless world exploration, with an impressive map filled with new collectables, activities and new missions to take part in, making an already impressive game series even more engrossing with a vibrant world, filled with mysteries to unravel. \n\nLike the previous game introduced, hunting and gathering materials to upgrade your equipment makes a return, being tied together with the new exploration segments, making it a rewarding experience. Also present are steam achievements. \n\nThe game can be controlled with either a combination of mouse and keyboard or with a controller. There are plenty of graphical options and language and subtitles, to better customize your experience. \n\nMarking a new arch to the story, Assassin’s Creed Black Flag combines all that worked in the previous games and improved upon them, making it a fluid, rewarding, and dynamic experience, with a character development that feels right for the story presented. \n\nFor all those reasons I highly recommend this game for anyone that considered playing any AC game or even any adventure game in general. \n\nIf you enjoyed this review, I would like to invite you to visit [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/44722081/] [u]Backlog log[/u] [/url] my curator page for more recommendations and reviews.",

      "review": "Simply one of, if not, the greatest Assassin's Creed games of all time. Whenever this game first game out back in 2013, I was instantly hooked and it has remained one of my favorite games I've ever played. They did such a good job representing the pirate era and new game companies need to take some notes on this game to see how to make a beautiful pirate game. \n\nI always loved the soundtrack to this game and the sea shanties. There's nothing like just sailing around in-between islands and singing a good ol' shanty with the crew. As per usual, Brian Tyler killed it on the soundtrack and it is one of the many reasons this game is such a beauty. \n\nThere's so much exploration this game has to offer. Luckily for achievements they were really generous and you don't have to do as much as you'd think. Compared to other AC titles, on Black Flag you don't have to obtain all collectibles, you don't have to craft everything, you don't have to 100% explore every island, you don't have to complete all viewpoints, etc. Now don't get me wrong, you'll still have to play for a good bit. Say if you're going for 100% achievements, you will have to spend around 50h-60h minimum I'd say. One thing that can cause you to take a very long time is if you wanna go for the multiplayer achievements. There's 9 of them and considering the game came out 12 years ago, you bet the servers are dead and it's near impossible to find games. \n\nIf you're looking to play every AC title, note that Freedom Cry is sold with the game and there's achievements tied to it. Therefore, there's no reason to buy Freedom Cry independently because if you buy Freedom Cry separately, you're gonna need to play it through twice. Which isn't that big of a deal because it doesn't take any longer than 5 hours.\n\nWhen I first tried to start the game for the first time I was having a hard time. I'd open the game and then the game wouldn't start. I ended up fixing this by running the game in compatibility mode for Windows 8. Then once I got the game to work, a problem I always had that I never really \"fixed\" was the problems with full screen after tabbing out. After I'd tab out, if I tried to go back to the game sometimes it would take forever for it to load. Sometimes I fixed this by doing Alt + Enter, but most times I just waited for about 20 seconds and it eventually would load. Just annoying if you're watching something on the side or following a guide and having to wait every time you tab out. Additionally, the other issue I had was with Kenway's Fleet. The only reason you need to do Kenway's Fleet as far as achievements is for the Elite Fire Barrel Storage plan. I couldn't get Kenway's Fleet to load at all and I fixed this by reverting my game to an older version. The Steam guide I used to do this is by \"amne3iya♥\".\n\nIf you're a fellow achievement hunter, you're probably familiar with Steam Achievement Manager (SAM). It is worth nothing that on a lot of these old Ubisoft games the achievements are protected through the Ubisoft servers so SAM does not work. Instead, you can use the \"Uplay Achievements Tool\" by Steam006. It is just these 2 files that you download and it is very simple to do. I used this to get my remaining multiplayer achievements because I was having a hard time finding people to play with. However, if you have a few people that can help you or you're lucky enough to find strangers to help, then the multiplayer achievements aren't that bad at all. \n\nWith the few issues and annoying multiplayer achievements out of the way, this game is truly amazing. I wouldn't pay the full Steam price of $40 though. During a sale, you can get the game for less than $20. Black Flag will always be a top 3 AC game for me and will always be a game I'll remember for years to come. I recommend any AC lover to play Black Flag if you haven't already and if you already have.. play it again. You won't regret it.",

      "review": "By the way, this my first opinion for the game!ːbigstretch2024ː\r\nOblivion in the waters: nostalgia for AC Black Flag:brainout\r\n\r\nThere are games that you just go through. And there are those that you immerse yourself in, which forever remain in your heart not as a set of pixels and quests, but as a living, breathing memory. For me, the legendary Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag will always remain such a game.\r\n\r\nIt was one of my first really big trips into the world of video games. And what a journey it was! This is not just \"my first game\" — it was my first truly open world, even if it has flaws, bugs, gameplay cons, don't sit in the bushes, don't fidget, and so on, but it didn't bother me.It was 2017ːfoxyFurryː, my growing up year, and I was given a licensed CD of this masterpiece. It was not just a project from the old Ubisoft (I love their limitations), not just a map with dots, but the endless, free-breathing Caribbean Seas. When you first board the Jackdaw and see in front of you the boundless emerald ocean dotted with golden islands, floating clouds and a ship on the horizon, this feeling of absolute, unlimited freedom cannot be expressed in words. This world was not the background, but the main character: he sang with storms, whispered with breezes and called over the horizon...\r\n\r\nAnd how magical these Caribbean pirates were! This is not an embellished fairy tale, but a lively, rude, drunken and singing saga, and what a soundtrack the game has, literally all the songs I added to my playlist. I wasn't just doing assignments—I was living the life of a legendary pirate. Imagining the smell of gunpowder, the creaking of wood, the roar of cannons, the sound of the hero's footsteps on the roofs shouting \"Let them board!\" — all this created a unique atmosphere that no other project could repeat for me personally...\r\n\r\nAnd at the center of it all is Edward Kenway. Not an assassin with a cold calculation, but an ambitious man, hungry for fame and fortune, but gaining honor and wisdom through loss and betrayal. They immediately make it clear to us that a fictional character with a clear motive-to make money with the developers made a clear bias on this, with his chips and charisma, it's easier for him to empathize, a dashing guy who differs from the main characters of the past Assassins (1,2,3) - everything was too serious in them...\r\n\r\nFor me, Black Flag is not just a childhood game. This is a whole era of games of that time in the 2013's, a rollicking song in the night and the taste of rum. This is the case when the first game turned out to be real, eternal and the most vivid!\r\n\r\nIt was my first big adventure. And it was great...\r\nIt's a pity that after playing 100+ hours, I realized that I was dead online, because after trying to collect a stack and go online pvp, it didn't work...☹️\r\n\r\nYes, the game was not without its drawbacks, but it satisfied my wishlist and graphics with its atmosphere.The line-up, especially the various songs on the ship in the open ocean-there's nothing like it in the 12 years since the release, for me it's like far cry 3.ːBurnː\r\n\r\nːnecrocrownː\r\np.s. I also have a 2013 collectors CD of her, which I still have.It was wonderful...",

      "review": "Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag — The Pirate Adventure of a Lifetime\n\nBlack Flag is easily one of my favorite entries in the entire Assassin’s Creed series. And Edward Kenway stands right alongside the legendary Ezio as one of the best protagonists the franchise has ever had.\n\nWhat I love most is that this isn’t really a game about assassins — it’s a full-blown pirate fantasy, and that’s exactly why it works so well. The open world is gorgeous, the islands are full of charm, and few things in gaming feel as satisfying as sailing across the ocean with your crew singing “Drunken Sailor”.\n\nThe naval gameplay is outstanding, and exploring the Caribbean at your own pace is pure joy. Even simple moments — the wind, the waves, the shanties — feel unforgettable.\n\nHowever, not everything shines. The DLC starring Adewale is rather weak, and the Liberation crossover DLC with Aveline de Grandpré also feels underwhelming compared to the main story. On top of that, the DLCs that are supposed to speed up the Jackdaw upgrades don’t work properly, and neither does Edward’s fleet system. Because of that, I wasn’t able to fully max out the Jackdaw to 100%, which was very frustrating.\n\nStill, despite its flaws, Black Flag remains a masterpiece — a swashbuckling pirate adventure full of freedom, atmosphere, and some of the best naval gameplay ever made.",

      "review": "[h1]Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag Review[/h1]\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Overview[/h1]\nOne of the coolest and most loved entries in the series. Black Flag sticks to classic AC fundamentals and adds best-in-class pirate fantasy. Ship combat sings, exploration is addictive, Edward Kenway carries the story, and the Caribbean is a joy to roam. It easily outshines many newer pirate titles.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Story Overview[/h1]\nYou play as Edward Kenway, a bold privateer who turns to piracy in search of fortune and fame. His quest for success draws him into powerful forces shaping the Caribbean, pushing him to confront what freedom, ambition, loyalty, and the price of a pirate’s life.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]World[/h1]\nA sprawling Caribbean sandbox made of cities, cays, jungles, plantations, forts, and shipwrecks. Every island feels like a mini hub with animals to hunt, viewpoints to sync, secrets to grab, and routes to chart. Havana, Nassau, and Kingston anchor the map with distinct vibes. Sea shanties, weather shifts, and wildlife make sailing feel alive.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]On-Foot Combat and Stealth[/h1]\nClassic AC timing based fighting with counters and finishers. You can carry multiple pistols for flashy chained shots, plus a solid stealth toolset for social stealth and multi target takedowns. It is simple and familiar rather than innovative, but slick animations and dual swords keep it stylish.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Naval Gameplay[/h1]\nThe star of the show. Broadside cannons, swivels, mortar arcs, ramming lines, and boarding flow are all snappy and readable. The upgrade loop for the Jackdaw steadily opens tougher targets like man-o-wars and legendary ships. Storms, rogue waves, and dynamic encounters keep voyages tense and cinematic. Crew shanties are pure serotonin.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Progression and Customization[/h1]\nLoot ships, dive wrecks, craft gear from animal parts, and invest plunder into Jackdaw upgrades. Cosmetic options for sails, figureheads, and Edward’s outfits let you theme your pirate fantasy. Side activities are plentiful without blocking core progress.\n\n[hr]\n[h1]What Works[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Huge Caribbean with varied islands and cities that reward exploration\n[*] Best in series naval combat with a satisfying upgrade ladder\n[*] Edward is a charismatic lead with strong character moments\n[*] Sea shanties, storms, wildlife, and ambient audio sell the fantasy\n[*] Stealth remains dependable for assassination focused missions\n[/list]\n\n[hr]\n[h1]What Falls Short[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] On-foot combat stays basic and does not evolve much\n[*] Once the Jackdaw is maxed you can trivialize sea encounters\n[*] Present day segments slow the pace and feel skippable\n[*] PC port can be finicky on some setups\n[*] Legacy multiplayer exists mostly for old achievements and is hard to populate\n[/list]\n\n[hr]\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nMassive thumbs up. Black Flag blends classic Assassin’s Creed with a top tier pirate adventure. The Caribbean is worth exploring end to end, naval combat stays fun for dozens of hours, and Edward’s journey lands. If you like AC or you simply want a great pirate game, this is essential.",

The music and ocean sounds make the world feel alive, and the attention to detail is incredible.\n\n⭐ 10/10 – A pirate adventure done perfectly, full of freedom, action, and unforgettable moments.

This is wholly unacceptable. I don't care that cloud saves aren't advertised, you put this kind of DRM/Launcher combo on, you can do basic things.\n\nNow I digress. If you really REALLY like Assassin's Creed, you've already left a jester and bought the upcoming remake (which I won't be). Otherwise, if you can stomach ~4 hours of slog and still like the game for the brief flash of brilliance I saw when I hit \"New Game\", then go for it. I couldn't.",

I bought it TWICE on steam and Ubisoft does what Ubisoft does best: take your money and tell you to buzz off when you need help.  I haven't played a single second of this game on PC because Ubisoft Connect is a trash boot loader that only exists to spy on you and to sell you more games.\n\nNever again Ubisoft.  Never again.",
