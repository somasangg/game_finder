Field battle strategies are brilliant and devastating. Which is fun. What it lacks is the more in depth dynamics of grand strategy scheming you can pull off in RTK 13.

You can also use friendship connections and start a civil war with most of the generals turning against your lord.\n\nYep, it has its ups, it has its down but over all. It is a decent game. The problem is...\n\nKOEI gave it a ridiculous price tag at full price that it doesn't deserve. Even at 40% sales price tag. It still feels low effort.\nIn this day and age.

These day, even at this sales price tag. I can easily get way better game, made with more effort and passion, better graphics better game mechanics and all that Jazz. \n\nThis game isn't bad, probably buggy at release but it is definitely better than RTK 14. While I never tried RTK 8, it reminded me a lot about RTK 13, which I like a lot. You can create your own entire family tree of original characters to play with. Interact like you would in RTK 13 but missing some features but had other different features that make it good. \n\nBattles are turn base and very much traditional. Field battle strategies are brilliant and devastating. Which is fun. What it lacks is the more in depth dynamics of grand strategy scheming you can pull off in RTK 13. In RTK 13, you can trick 2 factions to go to war with one another. You can also use friendship connections and start a civil war with most of the generals turning against your lord.\n\nYep, it has its ups, it has its down but over all. It is a decent game. The problem is...\n\nKOEI gave it a ridiculous price tag at full price that it doesn't deserve. Even at 40% sales price tag. It still feels low effort.\nIn this day and age. A small team of developers would most likely make a game better than this one in all aspect at the same price they are offering even on sales.\n\nWhat are we really paying for? Japanese branded Developers? Just because it is made in Japan? What a joke.",
