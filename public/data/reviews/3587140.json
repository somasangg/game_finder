Also, once you get  pretty decent way into the main campaign, at around the time you meet Ith, the game's story is actually pretty interesting, too! (Just ignore most of the stuff before that (And most of the stuff after that. Really, Ith is the only interesting part)). \nIt does fall into a lot of the same trappings as the others, like there being so much nudity overload that it loses and and all punch, and you grow numb to it, and barely any the women actually look like humans due to their comically oversized proportions, but there's some promise here, and it's really enjoyable!\nOne small note; Why the FUCK do the Three Stars have unique designs? Most games like this just go for the most basic, and generic shit imaginable for it's \"Common\" tier characters, for a reason. In this game a lot of the Three Stars in this game have such fun and appealing designs that are genuinely WAY better than the Four and Five Stars, and that really sucks, since there's basically no way to actually interact with most of the Three Stars. Why? Why put your best, cutest, most appealing characters behind the Three Star lock so we can't interact them?!?! I want to do more with them than ANY of the Four or Five Stars, and I can't! What the hell? I mean, Belyn, Olga and Cindy are all FANTASTIC, I just wish I could DO something with them!\nAlright, but seriously though, this is pretty solid, and does stand out from the crowd with a number of unique ideas. It takes a bit of time to get into it, but it's pretty solid.\nOh, and credit where it's due, this is the first F2P NSFW game I've seen where the shop ISN'T insanely overpriced.",

The free characters are fine, and as long as you can just build a proper party, spend your currency on promote materials. I wont deny their will always be some wall, but its a free to play game, I've been playing for months \" played before steam launch\" and maybe spent 0.99 I'm still progressing just fine.  Also the art and animations remind me of Destiny child. Not literally, but it gives me the same vibe, Some of the best in the genre in my opinion.\n\nSo dont overextend your resources, Focus on a core 4 characters and be patient.",

Also, once you get  pretty decent way into the main campaign, at around the time you meet Ith, the game's story is actually pretty interesting, too! (Just ignore most of the stuff before that (And most of the stuff after that. Really, Ith is the only interesting part)). \nIt does fall into a lot of the same trappings as the others, like there being so much nudity overload that it loses and and all punch, and you grow numb to it, and barely any the women actually look like humans due to their comically oversized proportions, but there's some promise here, and it's really enjoyable!\nOne small note; Why the FUCK do the Three Stars have unique designs? Most games like this just go for the most basic, and generic shit imaginable for it's \"Common\" tier characters, for a reason. In this game a lot of the Three Stars in this game have such fun and appealing designs that are genuinely WAY better than the Four and Five Stars, and that really sucks, since there's basically no way to actually interact with most of the Three Stars. Why? Why put your best, cutest, most appealing characters behind the Three Star lock so we can't interact them?!?! I want to do more with them than ANY of the Four or Five Stars, and I can't! What the hell? I mean, Belyn, Olga and Cindy are all FANTASTIC, I just wish I could DO something with them!\nAlright, but seriously though, this is pretty solid, and does stand out from the crowd with a number of unique ideas. It takes a bit of time to get into it, but it's pretty solid.\nOh, and credit where it's due, this is the first F2P NSFW game I've seen where the shop ISN'T insanely overpriced.",
