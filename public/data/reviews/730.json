Valve does not care about the quality of it game, all of their focus is shifted toward the skins market and creating new cases for bots to freely farm in deathmatch. also I think that the useless VAC is being powered and optimized by only one lazy overpaid developer. yet we all still play and enjoy cs2, how masochistic.",

Your average random teammate, random frame drops, cheaters absolutely infesting the higher level Competitive and Premier queues even with the “New VAC”, Inferno, If I were to go on to list every thing that is wrong with the game I’d run out of space real quick but main point, the farthest thing from a perfect game. That being said, there is not another shooter where getting a headshot or pulling off a clutch feels more satisfying, some of the most iconic and beautiful in game cosmetics of all time sit in that CS Market, hitting a really cool skin out of a random case feels so incredible it created an entire generation of little gambling addicts. While 90% of your random teammates are bound to be either lobotomites or furries, the other 10% of the community is where I have had the most goofy interactions with randoms, and met more real cool buddies in the past few months on CS than I have in several years on a wide variety of other video games, it’s like the old days of forced game chat on Xbox live. If feeling lonely try out some CS being social is basically a requirement of the game if you want to get out of Silver. It is one of the few standing legacy esports remaining where money has been unable to buy success, and 25+ years later the esports scene is still by far and away the most electric and entertaining one in existence, and I expect it to still be 25 more years from now. To wrap it all up Counter Strike kinda sucks. But it is absolutely the greatest competitive shooter of all time. 10/10",

It’s a team-based challenge at its best when everything clicks, it’s incredibly satisfying and keeps your heart racing.\nBut let’s be real for a moment. CS2 still has that classic Counter-Strike frustration built in. You never quite know if you’re getting outplayed, having a bad day, or just sharing the server with someone who downloaded “talent” from a shady website. And then there are the people who completely lose their minds the moment things aren’t going their way. Those matches can make you rethink all your life choices or at least make you wonder why you’re still holding W.\n\nEven with all that, there’s something about CS2 that keeps pulling you back. The skill ceiling is high, the teamwork can be amazing, and when a coordinated push actually works, it feels legendary. It’s a game that tests your patience, skill, and sometimes your sanity… but in a weird way, that’s part of its charm.\n\nI stopped playing for a while because the cheaters and frustration got to me, but I still appreciate what CS2 tries to be: a competitive shooter that rewards focus, communication, and learning from your mistakes. When you get a good match, it reminds you why this series has been loved for so long.\n\nOverall, CS2 can be both infuriating and fantastic, a game where the highs are really high, and the lows make you question everything. But if you enjoy fast-paced, team-based challenges, it’s still worth a try… just bring patience, and maybe a sense of humor.",

      "review": "Yes, I recommend this game.\r\nWith over 6700 hours invested in Counter-Strike 2 — the vast majority spent in Zombie Escape — I can say without hesitation that this game has become a cornerstone of my gaming life. While CS2 is widely known for its competitive bomb defusal mode, the real magic for me lies in the community-driven chaos and camaraderie of Zombie Escape. It’s not just a game mode — it’s a living ecosystem of creativity, challenge, and adrenaline.\r\nZombie Escape transforms the Counter-Strike formula into something entirely different. Instead of tactical 5v5 combat, you’re thrown into massive cooperative survival scenarios where dozens of players must work together to outrun, outsmart, and outlast waves of player-controlled zombies. The tension is constant: one misstep, one mistimed jump, one missed trigger — and the entire team can fall apart. It’s a mode that demands coordination, map knowledge, and nerves of steel.\r\nEach map in ZE is a unique experience. Some are cinematic, with scripted events, boss fights, and multi-stage escapes. Others are pure movement challenges, testing your ability to strafe, bunny hop, and time your jumps with precision. The best maps blend both — offering a narrative arc, environmental hazards, and clutch moments that feel like scenes from an action movie. Whether you're escaping a collapsing facility, sprinting through a haunted castle, or battling a giant monster, the immersion is real and the stakes are high.\r\nWhat keeps me coming back is the community. ZE servers are filled with regulars who know the maps inside out, newcomers eager to learn, and admins who keep the experience smooth and fair. There’s a rhythm to it — the pre-round banter, the mid-round panic, the post-round celebration or groaning. It’s a social experience as much as a gameplay one. And when you survive a brutal map with just seconds to spare, the shared victory is electric.\r\nCS2’s Source 2 engine has brought visual upgrades that enhance the ZE experience. Lighting effects, particle systems, and smoother animations make escapes feel more cinematic. However, there are still technical challenges. Some custom maps push the engine to its limits, causing frame drops or server instability. Hit registration can be inconsistent under load, and certain legacy ZE features haven’t been fully optimized for the new engine. But the community is resilient — mappers adapt, server owners tweak configs, and players learn to work around the quirks.\r\nOutside of ZE, CS2 retains its core strengths: tight gunplay, high skill ceiling, and competitive integrity. But for me, those are secondary. Zombie Escape is where the game truly comes alive. It’s where you learn the value of teamwork, where you develop map-specific strategies, and where you experience moments that no other game can replicate — like baiting zombies into a trap, clutching a trigger that saves the team, or making a jump with a horde on your heels.\r\nIf you’re new to CS2, I urge you to try Zombie Escape. It’s not just a novelty — it’s a thriving subculture with its own legends, metas, and rituals. And if you’re a veteran, you already know: there’s nothing quite like the rush of surviving a map you’ve failed a dozen times before.\r\nAfter 6700 hours, I’m still learning, still improving, and still hooked. Counter-Strike 2 isn’t perfect, but Zombie Escape makes it unforgettable.",

The engine upgrade gives the game smoother movement, better lighting, and more readable visuals. Gunplay remains tight and skill based, and when a match flows, it feels incredible. Valve kept the core intact, which is good, but it also means the game doesn’t try to innovate much.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that CS2 launched with missing features and still carries some rough edges. Hitreg can feel inconsistent, server ticks are a constant talking point, and anyone coming from CS GO will instantly notice the differences in movement and utility behavior. Sometimes it feels like Valve rebuilt the house before finishing the furniture.\r\n\r\nStill, CS2 has potential. It already looks better, runs better for many players, and the foundation is strong. If Valve keeps iterating, this can turn into the definitive version of Counter Strike. Right now, it is solid, but not fully at its peak yet.",

      "review": "Im quiting cs2, thanks valve for cs:go.\n\nUnfortunately the game went to the point where is unplayable.\nI stopped playing for ranks months ago after seeing how rank system is useless because:\n\n1. Their \"skill\" based matchmaking is useless, you are getting filled with people in enemy that have the same rank on this map BUT they are LE+ on their most played maps, and they play like LE+ not like player on my rank.\n2. Amount of cheaters. Imagine this, You are back in home after a day and you queue for a match to chill out right? yeah you will get clear accounts in enemy team having reaction time higher than avg pro player, scanning you thru smokes, walls etc. Valve's solution? Vac live which bans only people that are using high range aimbot or just fast aimbot and never people prefiring with normal reaction time, or just people with too fast reaction time\n3. Teammates. Yes you will get teammates on \"same\" rank but they WILL NOT be at your level, they either grief, or just play 10x worse than your enemy team.\n\nSo, i switched to grinding weekly rewards on prime accounts, it used to be fun for couple of months, i even earned +10 prime accounts from weekly rewards. But of course it became impossible too, I started to experience every of these problems mentioned above and there we go to another topic\n\nNone of the game modes are usable for XP.\n\nAs i said above my only reason to keep playing this game were weekly rewards and service medals but it came to the point where i cannot even do this without getting pissed off by this game. I will now tell ALL the game modes and problems making them useless, unplayable\n\n1. Competetive -> Cheaters, stupid teammates, Huge rank gap between team and enemy, very shit xp with combining all those problems, For ex. You get 1 cheater in enemy blatantly raging you win 0 rounds = You get 0xp for 15 minutes of playing this game. (i wanna remind that to get weekly reward you need 5000xp), same goes with dumb team or huge rank gap you WILL win some rounds but still get like 500xp for 30 minutes which is around 5 hours to get weekly reward for avg 1 euro or less.\n\n2. Wingman -> Same problems as above with difference that there is higher chance to get cheater in enemy\n\n3. Deathmatch -> Completely unplayable due to having game filled with human bots doing insta headshots once you peek.\n\n4. War games -> Worthless, you will get shit xp and it will take you HOURS to get weekly reward\n\n5. Casual -> A lot of clear accounts with wallhack\n\n-- Trust Factor System --\n\nIn short, its terrible. If you are on clear account due to shit ranking system no matter what you will do, you will always end up in silver 1/2 AND you will get reported a lot because enemies will start think you are cheating (no shit sherlock, someone with 10x more hours comes to play against people with less than 100h). Which will of course result in terrible trust factor, and your every game for next 200h will look live hvh server experience, people with blatant wallhack(they will of course before toggling call you a cheater, because i wanna remind you they still are silver and if you are better than them it means you must be cheating right?)\n\n-- Content Updates --\nI will compare in this stage CS:GO to CS2\n\nIn first 3 years of CS2 we had:\n\n- Armory pass (useless, for some reason small group of people count this as operation, no quests, no new maps, only skins made by community)\n- 2 Cases\n- Terminal Case (Which i have no idea which dev decided that it will be amazing idea to implement a case where you need to pay for case and then for skin, im not gonna mention the fact that the skins from terminal are cheaper on market than just buying it from terminal)\n\nIn first 3 years of CS:GO we had:\n- Skins were added\n- Operation Payback(It gave you coin for playing the operation, came with 7 maps)\n- Operation Bravo(You also got coin, came with 10 maps, Added 2 new skins collections, As pass user you could drop bravo case)\n- Operation Phoenix (You also got coin, came with 8 maps, Added new case)\n- Operation Breakout (You also got coin, came with 6 maps, 3 new skin collections, missions)\n- Operation Vanguard (You also got coin, came with 7 maps, 1 new case, campaign)\n- Operation Bloodhound (You also got coin, came with 7 maps, new case, 2 campaigns)\n\n There is a lot more to mention but you get the point.\n\nI would like to point out also that last operation we had was riptide back IN 2021. Which was 4 years ago at this point. Why should i keep playing this game if devs cannot fix the problems since cs2 release (which was 2 years ago btw) and cannot add any new content that will make both sides happy.",

      "review": "How do you even review a game like Counter-Strike 2 without just repeating what countless others have already said or already know about it? Because this game, if you think about it, is not *just* another iteration of a long line of games in the same franchise with a number tacked on the end like Battlefield or Call of Duty are, but is a culmination of over 25 years of progress and building on top of a solid foundation to make something that I would argue is a juggernaut that dwarfs most other first person shooters, for better or for worse.\r\n\r\nFor some people, Counter-Strike isn't even a game, but an entire second life. It's the game they've played since childhood, or the game they follow religiously on the e-sports scene. For some people it's their entire social circle's go-to hangout spot. And there's certainly a lot of meat on the bones here to warrant the game fulfilling such roles.\r\n\r\nFor me, it's a daunting testament to a youth with many hours spent in front of the screen getting to know people online and hanging out with friends, playing user created maps that allowed you to ski around crazy slopes by abusing the game engine's wonky physics and playing unique new game modes like Gun-Game and Scoutknivez, but all of that was nearly 20 years ago. The Counter-Strike of today is a much different beast. It's far more streamlined, its rough edges smoothed out, the jank removed and replaced with professional furnishing. It's also far more clear about what you're meant to do, and what you should and shouldn't do. The Counter-Strike of old felt more like a playground or a sandbox where the owner of the server could set the rules, including round timer, health, gravity, what guns were allowed or not, which maps were available, what sounds could be played, and so on, whereas Counter-Strike 2 has none of that nonsense and focuses solely on the rules set by the game itself. The weapons menus are also much improved from previous versions. I still remember having to manually buy reserve ammunition with a hot-key in 1.6 and Condition Zero, and thank goodness that has become a thing of the past. \r\n\r\nBut enough ruminating about the past, what is Counter-Strike 2 actually like these days? In short: Very intense. Because of the renewed focus on the actual game modes the game was created with in mind, it has become a lot more competitive, a lot more \"professional\", and as a consequence a lot more hostile to a casual audience. The primary game mode, Bomb Defusal, sees two teams of 5 players pitted against each other where one team has to successfully plant a bomb and have it explode, while the other team has to stop them from doing so. It is round based, where it is best out of 24, and each round can last up to 2 minutes (plus an extra 40 seconds if the bomb is planted at the last second, as it extends the timer until detonation). This also means that a match can last anywhere between 30 minutes and up to 1.5 hours, depending on how unbalanced the teams are. There are other modes in the same vein like Hostage Rescue, but these are rather unpopular and aren't played nearly as much. But considering this game still breaks player number records all the time, even these unpopular maps and modes see plenty of activity. I don't think it's even possible not to get a match going in any of the available modes. Speaking of other gamemodes:\r\n\r\nThere are also smaller gamemodes like Arms Race (the official version of Gun-Game), Wingman and Retake, which are all focused on smaller teams, being 2v2 or 3v4, and there is also Deathmatch which pits everyone against each other and it's just about who can score the most points before the round ends. So if you don't want to play the sweaty try-hard Competitive mode, there are other options. But honestly at that point, there are plenty of other video games out there that do these gamemodes far, FAR better, so why bother with this one?\r\n\r\nWith Competitive (and the pseudo-tournament-like \"Premier\") being the main attraction, Counter-Strike 2 has also become the kind of beast where, in order to be truly good at it, you either have to devote your entire life to mastering it, or you will be forever mediocre. And I am personally not that type who would want to do that, especially when there are literally [b]thousands[/b] of other games out there that I would argue are a better experience. In particular when it comes to the shooting. For let me tell you something: I do NOT like the shooting in this game at all.\r\n\r\nThe shooting mechanics in Counter-Strike 2 feel like a relic of a bygone era. There is no aim-down-sights (apart from two very specific weapons), no weapon customization with attachments like grips and scopes and stocks, laser pointers, flashlights, you name it. There is also an extreme emphasis on recoil and learning to counter-act it. Not only that, the sniper rifles do not have a crosshair dot like all the other weapons, despite the fact that they still shoot exactly in the middle of the screen even while unscoped. Why not just put the dot there like most other games do? It honestly feels like a design decision made purely out of stubbornness, or spite. And don't get me started on the rounds-based economy. Because that makes no sense whatsoever in *any* context.\r\n\r\nAllow me for a moment to get a little ludo-narrative dissonant here, but who in their right minds decide to send an anti-terror strike force to a sensitive location with active terrorists and a live explosive without arming them to the teeth or even giving them body armor? Why do they have to buy that out of their own pocket like an American teacher shopping for school supplies? That stuff should be supplied to them as part of their job. I can kind of understand it for the terrorists as they aren't there in any official capacity and likely had to buy their stuff off of the black market, but then there's also the question of why the actual hell does a wine bottle with some petrol and a rag cost 400 ****ing dollars? That shit can be cobbled together for 10 or 20 dollars at most, depending on the brand of wine. It is once again one of those gameplay designs that seems like a relic of the past, when they were still trying to figure out how the game was supposed to work, and they've just kind of stuck with it since.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I have come to resent about this game is its slow but steady transformation into becoming more of a skin gambling casino than an actual video game. I don't think I am completely wrong when I hypothesize that almost half of Valve's entire income is solely from the skins economy from this one game, and the skin trading industry that has sprung up around it. Valve takes a cut every time a skin is bought and sold on the Steam market, and Valve gets all the profits every time one of those skin crates is opened, and I can't even imagine how many thousands of those are opened every single day by doe-eyed hopefuls crossing their fingers for a rare skin, and 97% of the time ending up disappointed in the result. And you don't need any of these skins to play the game, but that doesn't stop people from chasing that elusive 1000+ dollar rare item, and gamble away their entire savings on getting it. I don't like this change to Counter-Strike, but it's the natural evolution of what Valve started with the supply crates in Team Fortress 2 all the way back in 2009, so it feels like it was inevitable either way.\r\n\r\nIt might just be my preferences shifting as I grow older, but I have definitely drifted away from these kinds of PvP games. And these days I am more fond of casual and PvE games. Because this kind of game that demands your undivided attention for hours at a time, and punsishes you if you don't have the time to keep your skills honed and meta-knowledge up to date just eats away too much of my precious free time, and with over 50,000 games on Steam, there are certainly many more interesting things to play than this.",

Or in other words, not good.\n\nFor those who actually read:\n1. CS was never my go to shooter but I enjoyed the gun play, generally.\n2. The community is so toxic to new players that COD, League of Legends and Overwatch combined stare in awe.\nSo where are my issues?\n1. The gun play in CS 2 feels like my mouse is constantly on ice, my left mouse button has a delay of 25 decades and the hit registration feels like the servers run on half eaten potatoes and praying but what you can call \"\"\"\"\"\"Server-Admins\"\"\"\"\"\"\n2. Cheating. I don't have to explain more now do I? This game has almost as many cheaters as MW2 back in the day which is not a record you want to hold.\n3. The movement feels like I am skating on ice mixed with soap with a scooter whose wheels haven't been changed since 2001. Or in other words, it's fluid yes, but the wrong kind of fluid. The one where you end up about 25m behind where you actually wanted to walk.\n4. The community is not helpful like in some other games because I can't see if I play with a person who just installed CS for the first time before the start of the game or if this is a veteran with 2 Quadrillion hours. This is not a good thing.\n\nOverall I can say that CS 2 is worse than GO, probably the worst multiplayer shooter I have ever played. The \"FoCus On GuNpLaY\" can't work if I have a ping of 23 and yet the input is taken 25ms later because the tickrate is worse than anything I have ever experienced in Gaming.\n\nSo the game is not recommendable, unfun, not new player friendly, not focused on Gun play and I would rather play Spectre Divide than whatever Valve produced with Source 2, even though it's actually a great engine.",

Welcome, you now have hackers nearly everywhere because the anticheat is non-existent for F2P players. To top that off too, you've also got no other way of reverting to CSGO. Quite funny how Valve managed to fuck up a game this glorious that it revolutionised first person shooters. New developers I guess, they come and go.\r\n\r\nI feel as if Valve cut off CSGO, replacing it with CS2 on purpose because they knew how bad the game would be with the graphics & optimisation that people would've just moved to the better, more efficient game: CSGO. Really just wish Valve actually re-released this game because it's better for low-end devices & it's surprisingly BETTER than CS2. Don't even get me started on the agents, maps and more.\r\n\r\nCSGO has had diverse factions in it's lifespan, having different types of factions go against each other looked very great, as it set the mood of the environment. You had FBI agents up against hostage takers in Agency, which was actually accurate. IDF in Dust II against terrorists, etcetera--you get the gist of it. Unlike this, CS2 had the worst mechanics & details known to man. You always have the same two factions fighting each other with the same voicelines and models. All the same; and you now have to buy these different agents in CS2 with money to look \"different\". \r\n\r\nValve also managed to crash the fucking Russian economy from their most recent arms dealer update, (which actually made gambling worse than opening crates) and with even more bad updates. I don't play this game as much as I used to, even with friends but I feel like its gotten the same. No actual rewards with normal Competitive, you've gotta get prime for you to get the CHANCE to have a free item.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Valve really fucked this \"remaster\" up (or whatever it is nowadays, lol) because they're so sucked up in their own circlejerk of skins where they can't even fix their own game--all they do is care about crates & money making. They either should've never remastered this beautiful game, or just made the remaster and kept the original CSGO on the steam market.",

I know this doesn't apply to everyone but half of my games are people who are either miserable or people who think they are funny when they're really not. You really have to hate yourself to play this game. Why do I still play this game? Honestly, I enjoy the mechanics and the sound of getting a headshot. The vote kicking system is cool but then there are people who abuse this and just kick for no reason. Team damage makes the game realistic but again players will abuse this and just kill you for no reason. Overall, great mechanics but toxic community.",

For me, a fan since CS 1.6, the original Counter-Strike is now dead.\nRegular bullets fly around corners like homing missiles. My teammates seriously stare at the enemy through walls and laugh that the developers can't do anything about cheaters. The enemy stretches into a terrifying three-meter-long worm with legs behind the wall. Random people insult me for no reason, interfere with my gameplay from the very start, don't communicate, and say they deliberately logged in to ruin everyone else's life. And for this \"premium\" game mode, I paid the equivalent of two full workdays' wages. Don't do what I did and don't buy this game. This is current as of 11/2025.\n\n2) Я потратил на это немалые деньги. Мне обидно. Для меня, фаната со времён КС 1.6, оригинальный Counter-strike теперь мертв. \nОбыкновенные пули летают за угол как самонаводящиеся ракеты. Игроки моей команды всерьёз смотрят через стены на противника и смеются что разработчик не может ничего сделать с читерами. Противник вытягивается в страшного трёхметрового червяка с ногами за стеной. Случайные люди оскорбляют ни за что, мешают играть с самого старта, не общаются и говорят что нарочно вошли в игру чтобы портить другим жизнь. И за этот \"премиальный\" режим игры я отдал деньги соизмеримые с зарплатой за два полных рабочих дня. Не поступайте как я, не покупайте эту игру. Актуально на 11.2025.",
