It does not rush you. It lets you explore and breathe.\r\n• The turn based combat is simple and satisfying. Boss fights can be frustrating at times, but every win feels earned.\r\n• The story starts small and slowly grows into something emotional, heartfelt and surprisingly heavy.\r\n• Characters feel genuine and stay with you long after the game ends.\r\n• Yuji Horii’s design feels timeless. It proves that a JRPG can be traditional and still feel magical.\r\n• Akira Toriyama’s art direction gives everything a comforting charm that modern games rarely try to capture.\r\n\r\nFor players who enjoyed Expedition 33 or anyone curious about the roots of the JRPG genre, this is a perfect place to start. Dragon Quest XI is not just a reminder of classic gaming, it is a reminder of childhood and the kind of stories that stay with you quietly for years.\r\n\r\nFinishing this game felt like closing a chapter I abandoned as a kid.

Its vibrant world, colorful Dragon Ball art style, and uplifting soundtrack create an inviting atmosphere. The turn based combat is classic but polished, offering smooth, strategic encounters. Characters are likable and distinct, adding humor and emotional depth to a story that begins traditionally but grows more surprising over time. While the pacing can slow in the late game and the game rarely takes risks, its warmth, polish, and sense of adventure make it an easy recommendation for anyone who enjoys traditional, comforting role-playing experiences.",

It's not trying to reinvent the wheel - it's just perfecting the art of the traditional JRPG and wrapping it in some of the most charming graphics I've ever seen. Every town is a postcard, every character is memorable, and every slime needs booping.\n\nThe Definitive Edition is the way to play, with the orchestral soundtrack that makes the already excellent music absolutely soar. The story takes some genuinely surprising turns (no spoilers, but buckle up for Act 2 and beyond), and the party members are all delightfully quirky.\n\nCombat is turn-based the way the Good Lord intended. None of this action RPG nonsense - just good old fashioned \"hit the slime, heal the tank, cast the big boom\" gameplay that never gets old.\n\nThe pacing can be leisurely - this is a marathon, not a sprint - but if you're looking for a cozy adventure with heart, this is your game. Akira Toriyama's legacy lives on in every frame.\n\nGrab a Double-Double, settle in, and prepare for a lovely adventure, bud.",

It features a sprawling world to explore, the party members are a lot of fun, there's a decent amount of customization present for each character, the story is epic and contains a couple of nice surprises, Akira Toriyama's art style is iconic and the soundtrack is wonderful.\r\n\r\nThe main campaign took me about 60 hours, which is a nice length without overstaying its welcome. However, there's a big postgame which acts like a third and final chapter to the game's story and I didn't care for it at all. It requires a ton of grinding, and the story kind of undoes everything you've been working for up to that point. Frankly, it's best to enjoy the game up to the credits and ignore everything that comes after. You'll look back at the game more fondly that way.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong though, this is a great JRPG with an excellent main campaign and challenging but fair gameplay. The amount of humorous and emotional moments make this one truly special. It's just a shame that the postgame feels so tacked on.\r\n\r\n[i]Score: 8/10[/i]",

      "review": "I am pretty conflicted about whether I should recommend this game or not, and overall, I think this is one of those cases where there should be a “mixed” option when writing a review, since my recommendation is VERY conditional: \r\n\r\nTo start, this is a traditional, turn-based JRPG that feels 30 years old in many ways, and as far as I know, this was fully intentional, since “Dragon Quest is not supposed to change” or something like that... \r\n\r\nFor me, the beginning of the story was very slow - it felt like it took forever to actually get somewhere, but the game had this sort of “charm” that made it hard to fully put down, so I ended up playing through it over a couple of months, and my opinion is that if you go in knowing what kind of experience to expect, this can be a rather fun playthrough. \r\n\r\nStory-wise there is not much to (even accidentally) spoil, the game is very by-the-book, and it does not try to reinvent the wheel. In its own way, this can be somewhat refreshing, since even old cliches can seem new if most stories you encounter nowadays try to avoid them. \r\n\r\nThe first 2 Acts of the game are fine and mostly tell a complete story, with some questions left unanswered. Act 3 is (somewhat) optional, and I personally think you do not lose a lot if you just watch the remainder of the story on YouTube, since Act 3 requires a significant amount of repetitive grinding if you want to get through it.  \r\n\r\nSome of the companions have quite interesting character arcs, but I have a very negative opinion of the way they handled the main character, since he's an odd mix between a premade character with personality and a character you can make choices for. Problem is, he is neither. The Luminary has seemingly no personality, and the only sounds he makes are limited to grunts in pain or confirmation, and other than these, he has no voiced lines. Also, you only have Yes/No options, and even then, the game railroads you into the choice you have to pick to progress the plot, meaning that your companions scold you if you make the “wrong” choice, and force you to pick the “right” option. \r\n\r\nGraphically, this is a stylized game with somewhat anime-like aesthetics, and while I was not exactly a fan of most of the character designs, this is a very subjective topic, and you might like them. \r\n\r\nEnvironmentally, most areas look fine, and there are some quite beautiful standouts. \r\n\r\nThe music... I was not a fan of. At best, I can call it serviceable, but it was very repetitive, and the quality of most tracks was substandard.  \r\n\r\nAround 15 hours into my playthrough, I found out that you can change the exploration music to the music from Dragon Quest VIII, and those tracks were a lot more pleasant to listen to. \r\n\r\nOverall, I do not think that there is much of a point in me rating this on a 0 to 10 scale, since I have very, very mixed opinions, but I also do not think that a 6 or a 6.5 is fair. My recommendation is that if you go in knowing what kind of experience you are going to get, then you can have some fun, and maybe even experience some nostalgia if, in the past, you used to play older-style JRPGs similar to this. Also, in case you need something to unwind to while you are listening to podcasts in the background, even Act 3 can be enjoyable, but I do not recommend playing through that part of the game, or trying to 100% it without a “second-monitor activity” for the grinding parts.",

It's not trying to reinvent the wheel - it's just perfecting the art of the traditional JRPG and wrapping it in some of the most charming graphics I've ever seen. Every town is a postcard, every character is memorable, and every slime needs booping.\n\nThe Definitive Edition is the way to play, with the orchestral soundtrack that makes the already excellent music absolutely soar. The story takes some genuinely surprising turns (no spoilers, but buckle up for Act 2 and beyond), and the party members are all delightfully quirky.\n\nCombat is turn-based the way the Good Lord intended. None of this action RPG nonsense - just good old fashioned \"hit the slime, heal the tank, cast the big boom\" gameplay that never gets old.\n\nThe pacing can be leisurely - this is a marathon, not a sprint - but if you're looking for a cozy adventure with heart, this is your game. Akira Toriyama's legacy lives on in every frame.\n\nGrab a Double-Double, settle in, and prepare for a lovely adventure, bud.",

It features a sprawling world to explore, the party members are a lot of fun, there's a decent amount of customization present for each character, the story is epic and contains a couple of nice surprises, Akira Toriyama's art style is iconic and the soundtrack is wonderful.\r\n\r\nThe main campaign took me about 60 hours, which is a nice length without overstaying its welcome. However, there's a big postgame which acts like a third and final chapter to the game's story and I didn't care for it at all. It requires a ton of grinding, and the story kind of undoes everything you've been working for up to that point. Frankly, it's best to enjoy the game up to the credits and ignore everything that comes after. You'll look back at the game more fondly that way.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong though, this is a great JRPG with an excellent main campaign and challenging but fair gameplay. The amount of humorous and emotional moments make this one truly special. It's just a shame that the postgame feels so tacked on.\r\n\r\n[i]Score: 8/10[/i]",

I had no idea it gonna be such an awesome game.\r\n\r\nFor me... the most important thing in rpg games -at least personally- is the story, the events, the dialogue, the writing. many rpg games have solid gameplay but terrible stories and dialogue, especially those games that try way too hard to make the characters funny or Likeable, but instead just make you cringe with tons of dumb, lifeless, and straight up annoying dialogue.\r\n\r\nBut this game..  the story, the events, the writing all of it was done well, hard to get boring, the plot is quite well put together, it unfolds with a satisfying balance between tension and revelation, and it didn’t feel like the writer was trying hard to flex his writing skills -especially those damn MFs writers who try so hard to make the characters funny, I’ve had enough of that crap and i cant handle it anymore- But here tho It ain’t impressive but it just flows naturally like normal dialogue which is good compared to many jrpg games, the characters actually felt unique and full of personality and the story itself and the events was good.\r\nThe world is beautiful, and the cities you visit are all so different and amazing, Every city got its own story, it feels like u'r living several short dramatic stories, in general I literally felt like I was in a real odyssey.It gave me that same joy I used to feel playing classic jrpgs back in the day. It’s not like some cringe, girly AAA jrpg nowdays.\r\n\r\nThe only complaint here IMO is the music, It’s very average, and there’s not much variety, you keep hearing the same three or four tracks over and over in almost every zone. also the battle theme should be way better . \r\nKinda crazy that it’s made by Square Enix yet they still havn’t taken notes from the legendary Final Fantasy VII OST.",

The story is not very original, a classic save the world from the evil boss dragon quest story with some interesting twists that make it slightly more captivating. However be aware that this game will take a lot of time to see that story through and does require grinding to level up at times (at least for me, kind of a novice at JRPGs still).

I had to actively force myself to play this game, not out of hate or because I disliked it. But because I genuinaly wanted to love this game so badly. The beautiful art direction that almost made me feel like I was inside a Ghibli Film, with all of its vibrant colors, and its cartoony artstyle. The beautiful music that introduced me to the whole Dragon Quest Soundtracks (top 3 best soundtracks in any video game series), the charming caracters, and amazing world that felt so real at times. \r\n\r\nBut everything was dragged down by its gameplay. I don't know if I was just playing it wrong, or its just how the game is designed, but I HATED the combat. The character building was fine, but the whole turn based system was boring, and very grindy. I don't have issues with grinding as long as I'm having fun, I love grinding in Shin Megami Tensei, or other turn based games... But this one? it felt so boring. I was doing fine, farming \"just enough\" to continue with the story, but there was a point where it felt I was just falling behind the enemies, plus I felt that I was alwaing using the same attack (the one that dealt most damage at the time). Things became more interesting by the end of the game, once I had a somewhat decent build for my characters, but still... Compared to other turn based games... This one is definitely the worst I've ever played.\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite my deep hatred for this game's combat, I can't recommend this game enough to any RPG fan out there, maybe you will understand the combat, maybe you will have a better time that I did, maybe you will understand what the game wants you to do. This game was such a wonderful experience from beginning to end, and while I'm missing the prologue of the game, I am confident the game will deliver. \r\n\r\nThis was my first Dragon Quest, and I'm sure it wont be the last (looking forward to Dragon Quest VII Reimagined, and the eventual Dragon Quest XII).",

It doesn't have that charm.\nSeems like It was rushed so its missing quiet a bit of polish. (minus the casino slot games for some reason)\nThat and it seems like they couldn't think of what to fill the game with.\n\nThe voice acting is bad, people poke fun at FFX but this is much much much worse.\nI found the attempts at accents laughable.

He is incredibly flamboyant and calls everyone pet names including the Sultan after just waltzing into the palace of the foreign country he was visiting.  He was so annoying to look at and listen too in the cut-scenes that i just stopped playing the game.",

      "review": "Thanks for the awards :)\n\nTLDR: Not recommended, would not try this as  your first game in the series either.\n\n\nI would personally rate this lower than Dragon quest 8.\n\nOtherwise to anyone with zero knowledge of dragon quest games.\nThis is a very  generic boiler template with dragon quest paint and sound.\nIt doesn't feel very passionate to the series. It doesn't have that charm.\nSeems like It was rushed so its missing quiet a bit of polish. (minus the casino slot games for some reason)\nThat and it seems like they couldn't think of what to fill the game with.\n\nThe voice acting is bad, people poke fun at FFX but this is much much much worse.\nI found the attempts at accents laughable. Honestly couldn't tell what some of them were going for.\nThe music is very repetitive, you might need to add a mod to change this up. \nCut scenes are done poorly, the awkwardness sets in/ just straight odd choices for a cut scene.\nMy god all of the NPC's are the same. Not very much variation there either not that it holds up the experience.\nMost RPG's reward real wit in combat, here its just make sure your the right level otherwise if your low level you don't have enough hp to fight anything. It didn't really matter what gear I had. \n\nWhy do I play/ my hour counts go up? I'm just forcing myself through the slog in the hopes of it getting better.\nSo far there isn't much hope. Ill update if anything story wise changes. This is no expedition 33 though so Ill keep my expectations slightly above ground level. So far I just look at my hours played with regret. \n\nThere are a ton of great games out there that are new. I'd recommend you to play those.",
