The PvE and PvP is without a doubt the best in this game compared to all other monster collecting games, now of course as all monster collecting games are, they're grindy there's no exception but with the \"Tomorrow\" update coming its going to help New and Returning players a lot to catch up to the mid to late game players that have all the best runes etc. If you do get stuck and dont know what to do just ask in the many channels, however not everyone will be nice and will be a dick for no reason but you will most definitely find someone that will give you advice.",

      "review": "summoners war is a game that has stood the test of time, and for good reason. The sheer variety of monsters, strategic turn-based combat, and the thrill of building teams for different situations make it incredibly engaging. The PvP arena, guild battles, and raids offer a lot of depth and replay value, while the constant events and updates keep the game feeling fresh even after many years. The progression system is satisfying, and pulling a new monster you’ve been waiting for always feels rewarding.\n\nThat being said, the game is not without flaws. The grind can be very intense, especially for new players who may find it overwhelming to catch up with veterans. Summoning rates for high-tier monsters are notoriously low, which can sometimes lead to frustration rather than excitement. Additionally, while the game is free-to-play friendly in some ways, it is undeniable that spending money can speed up progress significantly, which may discourage purely F2P players.\n\nOverall, Summoners War is a fantastic strategy RPG with a dedicated community and years of content to explore. It’s a game that rewards patience and persistence, but it can also test both due to its heavy reliance on RNG and grind.",

      "review": "First sentence of the review and i wish to impress the fact that i am trying to walk a line of neutrality here. It's a gacha game. There's not really much depth or story to engage with. i play mainly on the phone at work. Very tedious game. haven't found a better replacement for this with better tits yet. It's a harsher grind than a concrete plant. I've worked concrete and felt cleaner being coated in rock powder than playing this game. Really just a background thing to set and forget these days.\n\nReal leery about these kinds of games. You always have to keep at the front of your mind that the game is waging psychological warfare against you with every menu press. im rank 55 and haven't spent a dime. i can play end game content only because I hoard all the freebies, events, and handouts like potions in skyrim. Never drank, always ready to use. I don't bother summoning anything but trash mobs as grist for the evolve mill anymore. events are the best ways to get better monsters. And there are plenty of those events throughout the year. The fusion system is easy enough to understand. It's a pyramid scheme. the best monsters on the fusion list require you to churn out thousands of low tier trash to upgrade the star ranks of the material monsters required for the fusions.\n\nMy point being, If you have time to waste, This is about as good as any. If you value your time more, try something else maybe. My thumbs up should be taken with a large grain of salt. The game certainly isn't for everyone. This one takes a lot of patience.",

I spend a lot of time in this game farming and grinding until you can't sleep enough for fear of missing out on time (double exp or event). Never spend money on this game (F2P). Then I stop playing this game around 2020 something. Now I play again there are a lot changes on game mechanic itself such as save a lot time on grinding, it's easier to play than before plus more collab and fun events, easy to get Nat5 (5 Star Monster), last time my only 5 Star Monster are from Fusion only (No luck I guess). You can be better F2P player faster than last time.\nNow I just chill and enjoy the game alone, chasing again the 2014 vibe when I was a kid play along with my friends, comparing every line up monster and rune combos we had plus some competitive on arena ranking. \n\nIGN : Feirisu.\nServer : Asia",

The gameplay loop feels great, and they’ve been improving the monster graphics a lot too — I really like where the game’s heading.\n\nI get why some people spend money, but I mostly play for the PVE side, not PVP. Over time, the game gives you some really solid 3- and 4-star monsters that can actually compete. Most players aren’t too tough, but once you start facing veterans who’ve been around for years, it definitely gets harder — which makes sense.\n\nThe devs are also adding a new PVP mode that’s supposed to help close the gap between new and long-time players, which sounds awesome. Overall, it’s a great game — just don’t spend money you don’t have (even the content creator say that).",

The amount of events the game gives you giving you all sorts of things like different scrolls to summon monsters and a lot more items and quality of life features that are in the game and are coming with the \"Tomorrow\" update make the game a lot more enjoyable compared to the rest. The PvE and PvP is without a doubt the best in this game compared to all other monster collecting games, now of course as all monster collecting games are, they're grindy there's no exception but with the \"Tomorrow\" update coming its going to help New and Returning players a lot to catch up to the mid to late game players that have all the best runes etc. If you do get stuck and dont know what to do just ask in the many channels, however not everyone will be nice and will be a dick for no reason but you will most definitely find someone that will give you advice.",

I don't think it's ever been a gacha in the sense that gachas are in the 2020s but the premium currency is definitely encouraged if you have no patience to play for longer than a week. \n\nIf you want to progress, you're not actually going to be touching the phone for a while. It was like this in 2014, too, consistently. I have picked this game up now 4x since i started playing over 11 years ago and the grind to collects summoners/monsters/currencies/mats is the same as it was when i started. Regardless of what you think you're going to do in this game, you're primarily going to be running auto mode runs for sets and monsters/summoners. \n\nThis is a mobile game. period. just because it is on the computer now does not mean it's changed. Expect early 2010s mobile game energy and you're going to be ecstatic with this game. Play this game expecting a pc game and youre going to be underwhelmed and annoyed. you can easily play this game and raise ranks without commiting 10k hours, but youre not going to raise ranks any time soon. sorry. it was like this in 2014 and it's like it now. \n\nYou might even decide that you want to reset your account progress a time or two because you realize how much time is going to take to regather the buff set you just placed on your garbo summoner instead of saving it for a rare drop you get in two months. this game will punish you -easily- for not saving your stuff. \n\nits fun. buy it. dont buy it. it's a mobile game; if you go into the game thinking it's anything but then you're gonna waste time playing. it doesn't change. the first 5 minutes of your game time is 100% of the experience you will have. run the dungeon, run against a person using the exact same mechanics, buff your team, switch out your team. \n\n\nidk what else to say other than it hasn't drastically changed in the last 10+ years and i don't think it ever will.",

Com2us (the creator's) always have new events, content and even new monsters every month. The premium crystals are actually obtainable through these events, so you don't have to pay to win.

All matches come down to 2 factors: the people who either sink tens of thousands of dollars into the game or have been playing non-stop for a decade who are impossible to catch up to, and the RNG spam from vio runes, which immediately flip entire winnable battles into automatic losses. There is no strategy involved. It's all down to hoping your vio runes proc more than the enemies vio runes. It's ridiculous.",

There's no excuse it just kind of sucks you in and before you realize it ridiculious prices start to not look so bad and look like good deals. That's why it's called GACHA. It's really gambling in a sense. Anyway, I've definitely spent in the ballpark o $4,000 to maybe $7,000 max and one day they had this weird easy to do option to reset your account. But that button was placed near another button and I pressed it one day by accident. So I emailed them multiple itmes and thye just kept sayin they can't help. Over the years time and time again I see an ad and remember my account and some nice characters I had but when I emailed them they say too much time had passed. \n\nYour time energy and money is all useless here. It will always be for nothing. These people do not care about your account. And you will spend UNGODLY amount of time trying to get into this game. it's insane how many hours you can sink but it's definitely not healthy or productive. It's like the gamers version of gambling now that I think about it. Go play a game from a company that cares about you. Also, it is very likely you'll lhit a wall for much of the content unless you devote 10+ years of your life to still be incredibly behind and not at all competitive with p2w players. Your time energy AND money is NOT valued here at all.",

Any and every sign-up method and 'account safety measure' proved useless and I'm not alone.\n■ The company disrespects its users every turn. Met many people who blew a lot of cash on it without getting any notable reward.\n\nIt's not worth it. Don't get tempted.",
