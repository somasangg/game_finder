What surprises me is that even though the game is old, it still feels “alive”: the city moves, the missions don’t get boring, and there’s always something to do online. I often plan to hop in for a few minutes, and suddenly half the evening is gone. It’s just one of those games that keeps its charm for years and doesn’t fall apart over time. And the best part is that even though I know it inside out, it can still surprise me sometimes.\n\nAnd yeah, I’m really waiting for GTA 6. I know it won’t come to PC right away, but I’ll still wait for my turn. And even when the sixth game finally releases, I’ll still come back from time to time to cruise around Los Santos — the game just has its own kind of comfort.",

But if it was a 5 star rating i would only give it a 3-star. Its a fun game. Be prepared to work for your money ....don't beg!! There is plenty of ways to make cash. There will be plenty of \"greifers\" playing to annoy you to tears. Don't carry cash so they don't get a bonus for killing you. Auto insurance is free so don't get bent out of shape when they blow you up. Dust yourself off and move on! Go to the casino every day to spin the wheel for goodies, cash and RP.

And somehow, even after all that time, GTA still feels like coming home.\n\nLos Santos was the first open world that truly felt alive to me. I grew up with this game — from staying up late doing missions I was way too young for, to jumping into GTA Online with friends, to returning years later and finding that spark all over again.\n\nIt’s not just a game at this point. It’s nostalgia, chaos, comfort, and memories all mixed together.\n\n10/10 — Thank you, GTA V, for growing up with me.",

The map is massive, the graphics are still beautiful, and the freedom you get in the game is insane. I love how you can switch between Michael, Franklin, and Trevor, and every mission feels exciting instead of repetitive.\r\n\r\nBut the part that made me fall completely in love with the game is LSPDFR. It literally turns GTA V into a police simulator. You get to pull over cars, respond to robberies, chase criminals, and use actual police equipment. Sometimes it feels so real that I forget I’m playing GTA. For me, LSPDFR makes the game feel like two games in one—story mode + a fully different experience as a cop.\r\n\r\nEven after so many years, I still keep coming back to GTA V because there’s always something new to do. Mods, missions, exploring, just messing around… it never gets boring. If you love open-world games or want to try something unique like LSPDFR, GTA V is 100% worth playing.",

This variety makes Los Santos feel alive and gives you plenty to do even after the story ends.\n- Dynamic Open World: The city reacts to your actions — from police chases to NPC interactions — creating a sense of realism and unpredictability.\n- Heist System: Planning and executing heists remains a standout feature, offering multiple approaches and rewarding replayability.\n- Driving & Shooting Mechanics: Vehicles handle smoothly, and gunplay feels responsive, making both combat and exploration satisfying.\n\n⚠️ Weaknesses\n- Outdated Visuals: Compared to modern titles, textures and lighting in Legacy look dated, especially in crowded areas.\n- AI Limitations: NPCs can feel repetitive in behavior, and enemy AI sometimes lacks challenge.\n- Online Grind: GTA Online (in the Legacy version) often requires excessive grinding to unlock content, which can frustrate players who prefer faster progression.\n- Performance Quirks: On newer systems, occasional stutters or compatibility issues remind you this is an older build.",

The heist missions are particularly satisfying, and switching between characters mid-mission never gets old.\n\nLos Santos itself is a stunningly detailed recreation of satirical Los Angeles. Every corner has something to discover, every radio station is perfectly curated, and the attention to detail is absurd. I've spent entire sessions just driving around and listening to the radio.\n\nThe \"Legacy\" edition on Steam is essentially the single-player experience, which is honestly the best part of the package. No shark cards, no grinding, just pure chaotic sandbox fun.\n\nWith only 11 of 77 achievements, I clearly have more mayhem to cause. If you haven't played this yet, honestly, where have you been?

Set in the fictional state of San Andreas, the game follows the intertwined stories of three protagonists—Michael De Santa, a retired bank robber living a troubled suburban life; Franklin Clinton, a young hustler seeking opportunity; and Trevor Philips, a volatile criminal with a chaotic past. Players can freely switch between the characters during gameplay, each offering unique skills and perspectives.\n\nThe game features a vast, detailed open world inspired by Southern California, including the sprawling city of Los Angeles (reimagined as Los Santos), desert hinterlands, mountains, and coastal areas. GTA V combines third-person shooting, driving, stealth, and role-playing elements, allowing players to complete missions, explore the environment, and engage in numerous side activities such as skydiving, stock trading, and competitive multiplayer.\n\nIts online component, Grand Theft Auto Online, offers a persistent world where players can team up or compete in heists, races, deathmatches, and custom game modes, continually expanded with new content since its 2013 launch. Known for its sharp satire, cinematic storytelling, and technical polish, GTA V is one of the best-selling and most influential video games of all time.",

I don't think that I will buy another rockstar game because of this crappy service. It feels like they are stealing my games, because I don't see a reason why all of my backuped emails from 2014, when I created the account, until last year, recipes of multiple buys, and screenshots from my steam and epic account are not enough to validate me as the owner of those games and this rockstar account.

Also do not expect a story on Sopranos level - here you will be probably disappointed as well.\n\nPersonally, I think this game is incredibly boring and I do not understand the hype around it at all.

I went down a rabit hole reading about this problem online. At least hundreds but more then likely thousands of players who have paid their money via steam for the games needing the Rockstar laucher cant play it because Rockstar like to be in control of linking and unlinking steam accounts. \n\nFor example: You didnt play a rockstar game you bought years ago for a while now and you forgot the login or mail to rockstar launcher. Congratiulations! All your Rockstar games on your steam account are worthless now! Even the ones you buy after it. Can you unlink? Yes you can, but they ask the most ridiculous information which almost nobody has laying around anymore. Who does remember the exact moment and date the laucher was linked to the steam account...?  They ask a lot. People who can actually collect the information that is asked to unlink a steam profile often have to wait weeks or months to get a final reaction from Rockstar. I sended a mail 3 times and only got a response once after about 5 weeks. \n\nSo if you buy a Rockstar game and find yourself in this situation with not being able to link an new rockstar launcher account to your existing steamaccount, just return the game. \n\nFor those who are still brave enough and want Rockstar to unlink, you can get a support ticket for this on their website. Steam cant do anything about this, its all a rockstar problem. You could also keep making steam accounts to link to new launchers and keep buying the same games again and again. It seems like Rockstar want you to do that xD",
