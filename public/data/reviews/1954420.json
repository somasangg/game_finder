I also really like that your bond with whatever character you chose grows after every match instead of just when you give gifts. The academy that quizzes you is helpful and fun too and there are multiple exercises to do. I also like that all characters voice their yaku at the end of the round instead of having to unlock that through bonding.\n\nOne last comment. Riichi City has the better character visual designs IMO but an objectively worse table and tile design. The tiles look so small in the discard piles and the text on them is even smaller.

I know there is a SFW-mode which defaults to the standard outfit, but some of these are still really lewd either way. While I know it's a stretch, I wish there was an SFW version of each outfit.\n- Some of the menu choices are confusing, especially at first. Board setup/decor plan is hidden in the corner of the char tab when it could have been together with layout/background setup for instance.\n\nAnd a final tip: The prices are better if you go directly on the riichi city website, plus you build bonus points.",

The music bops too (and you can't hear it loop like in MJS.)\n- Gives you a fair share of freebies.\n\nCons:\n- There's a lot of lewd characters. I know there is a SFW-mode which defaults to the standard outfit, but some of these are still really lewd either way. While I know it's a stretch, I wish there was an SFW version of each outfit.\n- Some of the menu choices are confusing, especially at first. Board setup/decor plan is hidden in the corner of the char tab when it could have been together with layout/background setup for instance.\n\nAnd a final tip: The prices are better if you go directly on the riichi city website, plus you build bonus points.",

Mahjong Soul is definitely the standard, but I really like that Riichi City has more daily quests so I feel like I'm getting a little more out of playing more matches. I also really like that your bond with whatever character you chose grows after every match instead of just when you give gifts. The academy that quizzes you is helpful and fun too and there are multiple exercises to do. I also like that all characters voice their yaku at the end of the round instead of having to unlock that through bonding.\n\nOne last comment. Riichi City has the better character visual designs IMO but an objectively worse table and tile design. The tiles look so small in the discard piles and the text on them is even smaller. Not sure why reviews are so negative, but I only just started playing it and it seems perfectly fine.",

It gives away gacha tickets much more frequently than MS so your chances of getting a new character is that much hugher. This game's ~9GB while MS is ~3GB so obviously this is a higher budget game.
