      "review": "PICO PARK: Classic Edition is a *“cooperative action puzzle game for 2–10 players”* which is a very gentle way of saying:\n\n> A chaos generator where you discover which of your friends should never be trusted with a jump key.\n\nYou and your buddies are tiny cats whose only goals are:\n\n* Get the key\n* Reach the door\n* Not murder each other in real life\n\nYou will fail at at least one of these.\n\n---\n\n### Pros:\n\n* Supports up to **10 players** on one screen, which is less “video game” and more “localized riot.”\n* Simple rule: *everyone* must reach the door. Actual experience: one guy grief-jumping on the stack so no one can.\n* Every level’s gimmick is designed around cooperation, which is adorable considering no one you play with knows what “cooperation” means.\n* Now free forever on Steam because the dev accidentally flipped the “free” switch and can’t turn it off again, which is the most PICO PARK thing imaginable.\n\n---\n\n### Cons:\n\n* “Psychological Horror” tag is a joke… until you play with 9 people and realize it’s actually accurate.\n* One (1) person mistimes a jump and the whole team dies. Repeatedly. For 15 minutes.\n* Voice chat devolves from “okay, you jump now” to pure dolphin noises in under three stages.\n* You will absolutely push the troll button just to see what it does. You will not be forgiven.\n\n---\n\n### Peak PICO PARK Moments:\n\n* Carefully building a cat tower, then someone moves one pixel and scatters the entire stack like Jenga with feet.\n* Level starts, everyone sprints right, key is left. Immediate, collective shame.\n* “Nobody move, just let ONE person push the block.”\n  *Everyone moves.*\n* Finishing a level and instantly queuing the next one because your friend is still mad and you’re not done yet.\n\n---\n\n10/10\nIt’s free, it’s simple, and it turns even the calmest friend group into a full co-op meltdown.\nWould form a 10-cat totem pole, fall in a pit, and blame literally everyone else again.",
