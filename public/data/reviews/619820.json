      "review": "Genuinely a delight to play, especially when you send a juiced up lightning bowling ball down a hallway and wipe dozens of enemies out. Each class and specialization feels fun and unique, and the meta-progression from leveling classes and donating resources makes each run feels like you are making meaningful overall progress, even when you're leveling alternate characters. I particularly enjoyed the feeling of progression as the town grew and evolved as I upgraded each building, providing buffs and allowing me to add modifiers to my future runs. The game is fun to play solo and in groups, and personally speaking, every finished match had me itching for just one more run. \nMy only complaint with HoH2 is that while the tiles themselves are randomly generated and different from run to run, the tilesets and the order they appear in are fixed, I think that the game desperately needs some more variety on that front. \nDespite that small nitpick, I think that Heroes of Hammerwatch II is a very good game and easily worth the sticker price given how much enjoyment I've gotten out of it.",

This game perfectly blends the nostalgic charm of classic pixel art with that dopamine-fueled sense of meta-progression, allowing you to permanently develop your town after every single run. Even though you'll die a lot in the dungeons, the crafting system, the sheer variety between different classes (and subclasses!), and the constant feeling of working towards a new upgrade will have you saying \"just one more run\" indefinitely, whether you play solo or in co-op. The endless replayability, satisfying combat, and the joy of continuously powering up your character make this an unmissable adventure for fans of the genre!",

You start a \"camp\" and then dive into the dungeon. Most players will probably get stopped at the first boss their first run with above average individuals making it to the 2nd boss. I have heard whispers of truly skilled masochists beating the game with no meta progression but that just sounds boring and painful. Eventually you will beat the big bad at the top of the tower and \"beat\" the game. For some thats where the fun will begin, for others it will be 20-30 hours well spent.\n\nThis game has some very impactful Metaprogression. Each class has a title bonus applied to all characters so leveling and trying them out helps your whole roster. The gear you earn helps alot with you survivability and damage. Earning resources to upgrade your town unlocks all sorts of ways to improve your chances in the citadel. Eventually you will get strong enough that winning New Game is a given, But NG+ and beyond unlock new trinkets and even a way of infinite stat progression. There are also three unique side dungeons with their own map and boss that you can eventually farm for ore and epic gear.\n\nThings that i think could be better. Character kits and subclasses. Each character has 2 skills and a passive and subclasses have an active and passive skill. Personally this made builds feel too simplistic to me. I'm sure there will be members of the community who like this, but i would love to have more skill options to choose in the main tree and the subclasses.\n\nTLDR: a fun dungeon crawler roguelike in which you get a little stronger every time.",

The runs take a long time. Even without the -40%, your rewards are pretty minimal and after a run you're still in a similar spot as you were an hour ago. It feels like the game time-locks mid game from me even when I won my first run, because there are so many things to upgrade in the town that give minimal character upgrades.\n\nThat all said, the game is fun. I might be a little masochistic, but the annoyance helped me get to late game out of spite. I'm not sure when it clicked but mid game was very enjoyable. Getting the hang of the flow, knowing what to keep and what not to, finding new trinkets. I can't tell if i love the gear system or not; You can find enchant blueprints in the dungeon to learn to put on any of your current and future weapons forever. sounds great right? The catch is that there are up to 7 equip slots and they all have separate enchants. Finding those blueprints is up to rng (and pretty rare, MAYBE 1 that wont be useful a run). On top of all that, there are other blueprints to be found, like drinks(run starting buffs) and trinket upgrade blueprints. This creates a sense of regret once you upgrade those buildings that allow you to find the blueprints because I want to get enchants for my gear, not some dumb drink that lets me upgrade poison damage at the start of the run when i don't even use poison. I don't think the player should feel regret when using a core function of the game is all.\n\nOnce you get to late game (fully upgraded town), the game really stales. you play the exact same way as you did before, only they're hp inflated and you're damage inflated(not to the same degree i might add) so the runs take longer but you're doing the same thing. Same enemies as well. There are some rng (also very rare) ways to min max your endgame load-out with the newest missions update but they really don't seem worth it. \n\nOverall, the game has given me enjoyment. It feels like it should still be early access with the complete lack of content, gameplay diversity, and cheat time-gating. If you want to time-gate the progression, at least make the gameplay spicy, because there are no new areas, no new mobs, nothing new just same run hoping for stuff to drop.",

I dislike the RNG element of the trinket system, basically you have the standard equipment you loot, but in the runs you will drop or find some passives which are reset afterwards. (vampire survivors/megabonk system, choose 1 from 3). Maybe its me but I believe its not a good fit for a game like this. I dislike the inventory/equipment UI.

We are able to play almost anything co-op together well past the point we would have stopped otherwise. \n\nFor this type of game it is pretty solid for quite a while, so if you're looking for something to pour hours of grind into, this one might be worth your time.\n\nBut that's where this game also falters. At first it feels like there is a ton of progression to keep you going forever, but all of it caps out while the enemies keep on improving. The first issue will come when most subclasses become too weak to continue due to lacking specific gimmicks that make the others viable despite the massive increase in the enemies stats. Then beyond that the enemy health scaling becomes ridiculous to where it becomes a slog to kill things. Lastly you will get to the point where you can be one shot fairly easily. And there is nothing you can do to keep up with all of it.\n\nTrinkets have flat scaling that also caps very early. Equipment stops keeping up with the enemies to the point where you feel silly fighting for upgrades that will just boost your damage less than the amount of HP gains each higher new game run (and will do NOTHING for your defenses, don't even try). You also run out of the other upgrades very very early (like before you even get far into new game runs at all). \n\nThere are still people playing this, so if you like everything I just said about it, feeling like you like this type of challenge where you have to play around massive sponge enemies while dying quickly yourself then more power to you. Enjoy it. But to those who are like me and want to feel like you have some agency in growing with the increasing difficulty, this game fails at that. It does take a long time before that point arrives however, so you can still get a ton of enjoyment out of it before then.\n\nNote: I only made this post because I saw they just now released the next tier of gear. Maybe there's something about that gear that helps you keep up with the scaling, but I doubt it. Especially since they seem to think the enemies need MORE health and buffed them further this patch. As long as the trinkets don't scale, this game has no long term enjoyability in my eyes - it could have easily been a game I came back to forever otherwise.",

If you don't join a game at the right time you simply will not be given any of these items. You can't pick your food/ drinks/ blessing/ starting skill in town if you aren't in a game before the run starts, that alone makes joining online games almost completely worthless, but it gets worse. If you join a map in progress any items that have been touched by another player cannot be used by you, so even if you join a run won't get the buffs from the current map, the previous maps, or from town, which will put you at a serious disadvantage, which doesn't just leave you feeling weak and unable to contribute ( or even survive most of the time ), but your joining increases the difficulty for the other players and now they will have to decide whether or not to carry you at the expense of their run, because if they have to revive you, and every time they revive you, they will sacrifice more and more of their maximum HP to do so.\n\nThe game doesn't remember your progress in a run either, if you leave a game or glitch out, or someone quits, items disappear from the map itself, and you lose everything you did up to that point. While you can rejoin, kind of, it's not the user friendly drop in drop out experience that it should be.\n\nEnemies can push you out of bounds locking you in a wall or a tree with no way to continue the run, the other players can continue without you, so you have no choice but to quit.\n\nText glitches out for no reason becoming an unreadable mess, so do the character images in menus; did anyone even playtest this atrocity?\n\nEven when the game does work, the developers made some mind boggling choices in terms of game mechanics. The game basically requires you to constantly spam attacks, or you're just going to die, but half the moves require you to stop attacking or move very slowly in order to charge up or aim the \"big\" attack, that doesn't end up dealing enough damage to be considered a big attack at all. Not being able to properly handle multiple button presses and unleash queued skill executions is substandard. You can't spam your attacks, and attacks that require a long press don't properly execute in sequence, and they all conflict with each other in inefficient ways that lock you out of doing any actions at all.\n\nCharacters are  constantly getting stuck on tiny pixels of nothing for no reason.\n\nEverything is so tedious and slow, the grind is not enjoyable, everything costs \"resources\", even just changing your mind. Even after the new update, none of the problems are fixed and the \"content\" seems to do nothing but add more tedious grinding. The new maps are implemented in the most obnoxious possible way, every single character has to collect their own set of \"maps\" and each map has a level, the new areas and items don't scale to you NG+ level or character level, you just have to hope that you randomly get a \"map\" with the right level and equipment type that you need. Grind the new resource on boring zero challenge maps, or grind the main game in the hope of getting better maps, maybe, some day.\n\nIt's like they never played a videogame before in their lives.",

I might be a little masochistic, but the annoyance helped me get to late game out of spite. I'm not sure when it clicked but mid game was very enjoyable. Getting the hang of the flow, knowing what to keep and what not to, finding new trinkets. I can't tell if i love the gear system or not; You can find enchant blueprints in the dungeon to learn to put on any of your current and future weapons forever. sounds great right? The catch is that there are up to 7 equip slots and they all have separate enchants. Finding those blueprints is up to rng (and pretty rare, MAYBE 1 that wont be useful a run). On top of all that, there are other blueprints to be found, like drinks(run starting buffs) and trinket upgrade blueprints. This creates a sense of regret once you upgrade those buildings that allow you to find the blueprints because I want to get enchants for my gear, not some dumb drink that lets me upgrade poison damage at the start of the run when i don't even use poison. I don't think the player should feel regret when using a core function of the game is all.\n\nOnce you get to late game (fully upgraded town), the game really stales. you play the exact same way as you did before, only they're hp inflated and you're damage inflated(not to the same degree i might add) so the runs take longer but you're doing the same thing. Same enemies as well. There are some rng (also very rare) ways to min max your endgame load-out with the newest missions update but they really don't seem worth it. \n\nOverall, the game has given me enjoyment. It feels like it should still be early access with the complete lack of content, gameplay diversity, and cheat time-gating. If you want to time-gate the progression, at least make the gameplay spicy, because there are no new areas, no new mobs, nothing new just same run hoping for stuff to drop.",

Bosses are ok.\n\nThere are a lot of better games out there, especially HnS.\n\nMAIN REVIEW:\n\nThe main problem is that runs are random with no strategy. You just pick up dozens of mostly useless trinkets, wishing you get the good set or something useful. There is no strategy, no different styles with each run. EVERY RUN IS THE SAME.\n\nFrom level 10+, it is hard to get any good item. My friends were constantly annoyed that while playing as a warrior he was getting wands, AND THERE IS NO TRADE BETWEEN PLAYERS (in a co-op game, wtf).\n\nFor base and character upgrades you just need to grind gold and materials. Nothing special here. The problem is flexibility. Reset is expensive, and the build change you can do is  go with skill A, B or C. That is it. Stats is basically your DPS stat vs health. Also, that's it. Too simple, not interesting.\n\nWith friends it was fun to play at start, because this is typical mediocre pixel-art game sometimes the map is very hard to read(or see what is going on at all). One of my friends always got blocked in gates (hard to spot when vertical) or stairs (that are almost invisible) or on some pixel and die to traps very often. If was fun, but it was sometimes also happening to me, which was really annoying.\n\nJust meh.",

I dislike the RNG element of the trinket system, basically you have the standard equipment you loot, but in the runs you will drop or find some passives which are reset afterwards.

We are able to play almost anything co-op together well past the point we would have stopped otherwise. \n\nFor this type of game it is pretty solid for quite a while, so if you're looking for something to pour hours of grind into, this one might be worth your time.\n\nBut that's where this game also falters. At first it feels like there is a ton of progression to keep you going forever, but all of it caps out while the enemies keep on improving. The first issue will come when most subclasses become too weak to continue due to lacking specific gimmicks that make the others viable despite the massive increase in the enemies stats. Then beyond that the enemy health scaling becomes ridiculous to where it becomes a slog to kill things. Lastly you will get to the point where you can be one shot fairly easily. And there is nothing you can do to keep up with all of it.\n\nTrinkets have flat scaling that also caps very early. Equipment stops keeping up with the enemies to the point where you feel silly fighting for upgrades that will just boost your damage less than the amount of HP gains each higher new game run (and will do NOTHING for your defenses, don't even try). You also run out of the other upgrades very very early (like before you even get far into new game runs at all). \n\nThere are still people playing this, so if you like everything I just said about it, feeling like you like this type of challenge where you have to play around massive sponge enemies while dying quickly yourself then more power to you. Enjoy it. But to those who are like me and want to feel like you have some agency in growing with the increasing difficulty, this game fails at that. It does take a long time before that point arrives however, so you can still get a ton of enjoyment out of it before then.\n\nNote: I only made this post because I saw they just now released the next tier of gear. Maybe there's something about that gear that helps you keep up with the scaling, but I doubt it. Especially since they seem to think the enemies need MORE health and buffed them further this patch. As long as the trinkets don't scale, this game has no long term enjoyability in my eyes - it could have easily been a game I came back to forever otherwise.",

If you don't join a game at the right time you simply will not be given any of these items. You can't pick your food/ drinks/ blessing/ starting skill in town if you aren't in a game before the run starts, that alone makes joining online games almost completely worthless, but it gets worse. If you join a map in progress any items that have been touched by another player cannot be used by you, so even if you join a run won't get the buffs from the current map, the previous maps, or from town, which will put you at a serious disadvantage, which doesn't just leave you feeling weak and unable to contribute ( or even survive most of the time ), but your joining increases the difficulty for the other players and now they will have to decide whether or not to carry you at the expense of their run, because if they have to revive you, and every time they revive you, they will sacrifice more and more of their maximum HP to do so.\n\nThe game doesn't remember your progress in a run either, if you leave a game or glitch out, or someone quits, items disappear from the map itself, and you lose everything you did up to that point. While you can rejoin, kind of, it's not the user friendly drop in drop out experience that it should be.\n\nEnemies can push you out of bounds locking you in a wall or a tree with no way to continue the run, the other players can continue without you, so you have no choice but to quit.\n\nText glitches out for no reason becoming an unreadable mess, so do the character images in menus; did anyone even playtest this atrocity?\n\nEven when the game does work, the developers made some mind boggling choices in terms of game mechanics. The game basically requires you to constantly spam attacks, or you're just going to die, but half the moves require you to stop attacking or move very slowly in order to charge up or aim the \"big\" attack, that doesn't end up dealing enough damage to be considered a big attack at all. Not being able to properly handle multiple button presses and unleash queued skill executions is substandard. You can't spam your attacks, and attacks that require a long press don't properly execute in sequence, and they all conflict with each other in inefficient ways that lock you out of doing any actions at all.\n\nCharacters are  constantly getting stuck on tiny pixels of nothing for no reason.\n\nEverything is so tedious and slow, the grind is not enjoyable, everything costs \"resources\", even just changing your mind. Even after the new update, none of the problems are fixed and the \"content\" seems to do nothing but add more tedious grinding. The new maps are implemented in the most obnoxious possible way, every single character has to collect their own set of \"maps\" and each map has a level, the new areas and items don't scale to you NG+ level or character level, you just have to hope that you randomly get a \"map\" with the right level and equipment type that you need.

I might be a little masochistic, but the annoyance helped me get to late game out of spite. I'm not sure when it clicked but mid game was very enjoyable. Getting the hang of the flow, knowing what to keep and what not to, finding new trinkets. I can't tell if i love the gear system or not; You can find enchant blueprints in the dungeon to learn to put on any of your current and future weapons forever. sounds great right? The catch is that there are up to 7 equip slots and they all have separate enchants. Finding those blueprints is up to rng (and pretty rare, MAYBE 1 that wont be useful a run). On top of all that, there are other blueprints to be found, like drinks(run starting buffs) and trinket upgrade blueprints. This creates a sense of regret once you upgrade those buildings that allow you to find the blueprints because I want to get enchants for my gear, not some dumb drink that lets me upgrade poison damage at the start of the run when i don't even use poison. I don't think the player should feel regret when using a core function of the game is all.\n\nOnce you get to late game (fully upgraded town), the game really stales. you play the exact same way as you did before, only they're hp inflated and you're damage inflated(not to the same degree i might add) so the runs take longer but you're doing the same thing. Same enemies as well. There are some rng (also very rare) ways to min max your endgame load-out with the newest missions update but they really don't seem worth it. \n\nOverall, the game has given me enjoyment. It feels like it should still be early access with the complete lack of content, gameplay diversity, and cheat time-gating. If you want to time-gate the progression, at least make the gameplay spicy, because there are no new areas, no new mobs, nothing new just same run hoping for stuff to drop.",

You can work around this by either unlocking the frame rate or if you're on something like a steam deck, setting the frame limit ~10% lower than the game's own limit.\r\nThe textures tear and have some very odd noise. The art style itself is too noisy, it's difficult to interpret.\r\nThe complexity of the game is a fair bit higher. It's harder to \"just play\" without being aware of things like your equipment. The increased complexity is worse for how easy it is for casual gamers to pick up.\r\n\r\nVery disappointed that they haven't been doing couch co-op. These games have been fantastic for a game night with friends. Needing two copies and two machines isn't too bad but it doesn't scale well to 3 or 4 players. It's also just sad to have one player up on a TV and the next stuck on their laptop. \r\n\r\nThe online requires servers to be online. Why is there no true LAN option?

      "review": "Mediocre game, 5/10.\n\nTLDR:\n\nBoring and grindy. No story, boring 2-skill combat, pixel art is average at best, and I don't even remember the music. Bosses are ok.\n\nThere are a lot of better games out there, especially HnS.\n\nMAIN REVIEW:\n\nThe main problem is that runs are random with no strategy. You just pick up dozens of mostly useless trinkets, wishing you get the good set or something useful. There is no strategy, no different styles with each run. EVERY RUN IS THE SAME.\n\nFrom level 10+, it is hard to get any good item. My friends were constantly annoyed that while playing as a warrior he was getting wands, AND THERE IS NO TRADE BETWEEN PLAYERS (in a co-op game, wtf).\n\nFor base and character upgrades you just need to grind gold and materials. Nothing special here. The problem is flexibility. Reset is expensive, and the build change you can do is  go with skill A, B or C. That is it. Stats is basically your DPS stat vs health. Also, that's it. Too simple, not interesting.\n\nWith friends it was fun to play at start, because this is typical mediocre pixel-art game sometimes the map is very hard to read(or see what is going on at all). One of my friends always got blocked in gates (hard to spot when vertical) or stairs (that are almost invisible) or on some pixel and die to traps very often. If was fun, but it was sometimes also happening to me, which was really annoying.\n\nJust meh.",

You need to farm the exact same map with same enemies over and over and over until you defeat the boss(at least i believe so, I didnt get to defeat it cause the game got tedious). Monsters do not drop loot, instead you need to open chests scattered across the map which are tiny and very difficult to see. Honestly who thought that idea? Loot is more scarce than path of exile 2. I have dropped only 3 items in a few hours gameplay but that may be a skill issue from my side because Im missing the chests. I dislike the RNG element of the trinket system, basically you have the standard equipment you loot, but in the runs you will drop or find some passives which are reset afterwards. (vampire survivors/megabonk system, choose 1 from 3). Maybe its me but I believe its not a good fit for a game like this. I dislike the inventory/equipment UI. Im not a hater of UI in general, I have some pretty low standards. But if something feels like a mobile game its a turn off for me. Chronicon imo is a better game in every aspect.",

We are able to play almost anything co-op together well past the point we would have stopped otherwise. \n\nFor this type of game it is pretty solid for quite a while, so if you're looking for something to pour hours of grind into, this one might be worth your time.\n\nBut that's where this game also falters. At first it feels like there is a ton of progression to keep you going forever, but all of it caps out while the enemies keep on improving. The first issue will come when most subclasses become too weak to continue due to lacking specific gimmicks that make the others viable despite the massive increase in the enemies stats. Then beyond that the enemy health scaling becomes ridiculous to where it becomes a slog to kill things. Lastly you will get to the point where you can be one shot fairly easily. And there is nothing you can do to keep up with all of it.\n\nTrinkets have flat scaling that also caps very early. Equipment stops keeping up with the enemies to the point where you feel silly fighting for upgrades that will just boost your damage less than the amount of HP gains each higher new game run (and will do NOTHING for your defenses, don't even try). You also run out of the other upgrades very very early (like before you even get far into new game runs at all). \n\nThere are still people playing this, so if you like everything I just said about it, feeling like you like this type of challenge where you have to play around massive sponge enemies while dying quickly yourself then more power to you. Enjoy it. But to those who are like me and want to feel like you have some agency in growing with the increasing difficulty, this game fails at that. It does take a long time before that point arrives however, so you can still get a ton of enjoyment out of it before then.\n\nNote: I only made this post because I saw they just now released the next tier of gear. Maybe there's something about that gear that helps you keep up with the scaling, but I doubt it. Especially since they seem to think the enemies need MORE health and buffed them further this patch. As long as the trinkets don't scale, this game has no long term enjoyability in my eyes - it could have easily been a game I came back to forever otherwise.",
