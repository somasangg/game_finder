      "review": "This game can give you some of the most fun and dynamic fights I've ever seen in my life. Once you start getting the hang of it, you can burn hours and hours just fighting nonstop. Every weapon handles a little bit differently, there's a ton of small tricks to pull off, and fights can be decided in a split second mouse twitch, intense stuff. \n\nAs an example, I had a fight against an enemy using a voulge while I had a longsword. He managed to catch my leg while I was advancing, but I managed to stick my sword into his leg(by half swording after I closed the distance). We both fell, but I got up first. Without a weapon, the only option I had was to grab the bastard and punch him repeatedly as we both tumbled once again. I got up, took his voulge as he unsheathed his backup sword. The motion to unsheathe was too much for his leg(that still had the longsword stuck to it) so he stumbled backwards a final time before I sliced him open with his own weapon. It happens dynamically and swiftly, there's no awkward delay as you switch weapons or stances.\n\nOf course, there's also matches that end instantly, with me parrying an initial swing and slicing my enemy's neck open between his armor plates. Beautiful stuff, the possibility of becoming extremely precise and deadly keeps you going.\n\nIf you're easily frustrated though, I recommend not playing the challenge mode. Stick to free play(for technical play) or the Abyss(for laughs), because the physics engine is not perfect and will lead to a lot of very unfair deaths. Sometimes, weapons will clip into you after you parry them, meaning your organs explode. One light shoulder tap will sometimes just instakill you for no reason. Bosses are designed to be as unfair(extra health, extra size, better armor) as possible. Stepping on an axe will launch it into your crotch and bisect you, somehow. \n\nStuff like that just gets you a \"ah, snap\" or a laugh when it happens in a free mode duel, but when you're deep in the challenge mode and die to a physics glitch, it just sucks.\n\nThere's also a bit of awkwardness regarding your character taking too long to get up after falling, some swings being oddly weak, just a result of the physics engine doing most of the heavy lifting in combat. It's hard to judge whether those aspects are working or not because it's still in development, but it's a hell of a lot of fun.",

Then I have to repeatedly kick them in the head until they finally give up. Let us heal after every wave and stop sending in two spikey spears when I only have a short sword.

The physics-based combat is super fun and gives the fights a really raw, gritty feel. It definitely doesn’t hold your hand, but once you start getting the hang of the controls, it’s incredibly satisfying to land a clean hit or disarm your opponent.\n\nThe medieval setting and focus on realistic swordplay make it stand out from other combat games. There’s something about the way the characters move and stumble that makes every fight feel unpredictable, in a good way.\n\nIt’s still a demo, so there are some rough edges, animations can be a bit janky at times and the learning curve is real, but that kind of adds to the charm.

But the best part of the game is definitely the gore, i feel an immense psychopathic satisfaction  from watching as the poor fellow fighting me has his entire leg chopped off from my axe and immediately starts squirming in agony while screaming for mercy.

The recent addition of a tournament mode livens the game up a bit for sure, but it is at times a little too punishing when you happen to lose a round, especially when it's due to the lovingly clunky controls.\n\nI think the game could also be a little better optimized for lower-end PCs, ideally without making the game as unplayably difficult to look at as it is on its lowest graphics settings. The addition of the Abyss, while a welcome addition from the Playtest, also causes issues on lower-end PCs, just like its Playtest counterpart. Whenever I load into Abyss mode, my game crashes immediately, which is rather problematic in tournament mode specifically, since Abyss is now used as a sort of \"sink-or-swim\" minigame in order not to lose rank progress. I find myself wishing I could just toggle it off.\n\nIn the end though, I've had a lot of fun playing this game, and I only hope that in the future, I will still be able to play the final release on my average old laptop!

The mechanics are a little goofy but I think that is what makes it so enjoyable. Half Sword Games isn't a huge company so updates just take little time. Overall the gore is insane and combat is really fun. I do think sometimes weapons cut into you a little too easy, which seems to come from a lot of the negative comments. I also think it does need some optimizations. Other than those two things i'm hyped for the game officially to come out. ALSO THERE IS A FREE MODE!!!",

      "review": "This game can give you some of the most fun and dynamic fights I've ever seen in my life. Once you start getting the hang of it, you can burn hours and hours just fighting nonstop. Every weapon handles a little bit differently, there's a ton of small tricks to pull off, and fights can be decided in a split second mouse twitch, intense stuff. \n\nAs an example, I had a fight against an enemy using a voulge while I had a longsword. He managed to catch my leg while I was advancing, but I managed to stick my sword into his leg(by half swording after I closed the distance). We both fell, but I got up first. Without a weapon, the only option I had was to grab the bastard and punch him repeatedly as we both tumbled once again. I got up, took his voulge as he unsheathed his backup sword. The motion to unsheathe was too much for his leg(that still had the longsword stuck to it) so he stumbled backwards a final time before I sliced him open with his own weapon. It happens dynamically and swiftly, there's no awkward delay as you switch weapons or stances.\n\nOf course, there's also matches that end instantly, with me parrying an initial swing and slicing my enemy's neck open between his armor plates. Beautiful stuff, the possibility of becoming extremely precise and deadly keeps you going.\n\nIf you're easily frustrated though, I recommend not playing the challenge mode. Stick to free play(for technical play) or the Abyss(for laughs), because the physics engine is not perfect and will lead to a lot of very unfair deaths. Sometimes, weapons will clip into you after you parry them, meaning your organs explode. One light shoulder tap will sometimes just instakill you for no reason. Bosses are designed to be as unfair(extra health, extra size, better armor) as possible. Stepping on an axe will launch it into your crotch and bisect you, somehow. \n\nStuff like that just gets you a \"ah, snap\" or a laugh when it happens in a free mode duel, but when you're deep in the challenge mode and die to a physics glitch, it just sucks.\n\nThere's also a bit of awkwardness regarding your character taking too long to get up after falling, some swings being oddly weak, just a result of the physics engine doing most of the heavy lifting in combat. It's hard to judge whether those aspects are working or not because it's still in development, but it's a hell of a lot of fun.",

Then I have to repeatedly kick them in the head until they finally give up. Let us heal after every wave and stop sending in two spikey spears when I only have a short sword.

There’s something about the way the characters move and stumble that makes every fight feel unpredictable, in a good way.\n\nIt’s still a demo, so there are some rough edges, animations can be a bit janky at times and the learning curve is real, but that kind of adds to the charm.

But the best part of the game is definitely the gore, i feel an immense psychopathic satisfaction  from watching as the poor fellow fighting me has his entire leg chopped off from my axe and immediately starts squirming in agony while screaming for mercy.

The recent addition of a tournament mode livens the game up a bit for sure, but it is at times a little too punishing when you happen to lose a round, especially when it's due to the lovingly clunky controls.\n\nI think the game could also be a little better optimized for lower-end PCs, ideally without making the game as unplayably difficult to look at as it is on its lowest graphics settings. The addition of the Abyss, while a welcome addition from the Playtest, also causes issues on lower-end PCs, just like its Playtest counterpart. Whenever I load into Abyss mode, my game crashes immediately, which is rather problematic in tournament mode specifically, since Abyss is now used as a sort of \"sink-or-swim\" minigame in order not to lose rank progress. I find myself wishing I could just toggle it off.\n\nIn the end though, I've had a lot of fun playing this game, and I only hope that in the future, I will still be able to play the final release on my average old laptop!

Every weapon handles a little bit differently, there's a ton of small tricks to pull off, and fights can be decided in a split second mouse twitch, intense stuff. \n\nAs an example, I had a fight against an enemy using a voulge while I had a longsword. He managed to catch my leg while I was advancing, but I managed to stick my sword into his leg(by half swording after I closed the distance). We both fell, but I got up first. Without a weapon, the only option I had was to grab the bastard and punch him repeatedly as we both tumbled once again. I got up, took his voulge as he unsheathed his backup sword. The motion to unsheathe was too much for his leg(that still had the longsword stuck to it) so he stumbled backwards a final time before I sliced him open with his own weapon. It happens dynamically and swiftly, there's no awkward delay as you switch weapons or stances.\n\nOf course, there's also matches that end instantly, with me parrying an initial swing and slicing my enemy's neck open between his armor plates. Beautiful stuff, the possibility of becoming extremely precise and deadly keeps you going.\n\nIf you're easily frustrated though, I recommend not playing the challenge mode. Stick to free play(for technical play) or the Abyss(for laughs), because the physics engine is not perfect and will lead to a lot of very unfair deaths. Sometimes, weapons will clip into you after you parry them, meaning your organs explode. One light shoulder tap will sometimes just instakill you for no reason. Bosses are designed to be as unfair(extra health, extra size, better armor) as possible. Stepping on an axe will launch it into your crotch and bisect you, somehow. \n\nStuff like that just gets you a \"ah, snap\" or a laugh when it happens in a free mode duel, but when you're deep in the challenge mode and die to a physics glitch, it just sucks.\n\nThere's also a bit of awkwardness regarding your character taking too long to get up after falling, some swings being oddly weak, just a result of the physics engine doing most of the heavy lifting in combat. It's hard to judge whether those aspects are working or not because it's still in development, but it's a hell of a lot of fun.",

It also handles far more intensive games, and didn't have a problem before the recent update. Drivers are up to date as well. I have gotten to the Ultimate Gauntlet 10ish times, and it crashes several times mid gauntlet. I am eventually able to beat it after maybe 5-7 attempts. Never had a problem in the previous version of the demo, nor the playtest, which was on max settings for gore and graphics.

      "review": "Although I have put a significant amount of time into this game, and I truly enjoy a lot of the fighting elements of the game, I cannot in good faith recommend this game due to the god-awful character models and buggy input response.\n\nThe biggest glaring issue of this game is that falling down is basically guaranteed death due to the disgustingly long time it takes to stand up, and your character can also fall over for literally no reason, and often does. Especially in Gauntlet Mode, you can do everything right and still randomly fall over and lose all of your progress. The amount of times I ragequit this game, not due to lack of skill but due to gameplay failure beyond my control is hard to quantify.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is that the keyboard input response is abysmal. I prefer not to play with the shield, so I tend to drop it before battle. There have been times where I have mashed the Q key over 20 times and my character will still be holding their shield when I go to take a swing with my sword. There have been times where I have stood directly over a weapon in Spoilance, pressed the E key to pick it up, and my character will crouch down, reach out for the weapon and grab nothing. There have been times where I have been running and my character suddenly stops moving because the WASD key input randomly stops responding.\n\nThe give-up/respawn timer is also extremely slow. The only way to save your progress in Gauntlet Mode when you fall over due to some inexplicable physics error is to give up immediately, but the timer to give up takes approximately 3-5 business days to finish, and in that time you're being attacked and killed nonstop with no recourse whatsoever. You might as well just delete the game because that's 90% of the gameplay experience.\n\nThe fighting mechanic and the weapons selection in this game are very good. The physics and the gore aspect of the game are excellent and I commend the developers for the true dedication and detail that they seem to have put into this game. But until the fundamental gameplay issues are corrected, I will not post a positive review for this game.",

With the new update, not only have they improved the intelligence of the AIs, but theyve also added a gauntlet mode. I actually found the gauntlet mode to be quite fun until I reached the \"Ultimate Challenge\". i have now attempted it over 100 times and still have not even gotten close to completing it. The \"Ultimate Challenge\" Means that you have less range, worse weapons, and worse armor than your opponents. they also continue respawning in waves that get bigger and bigger, their weapons and armor continue to get better, and its not even gauranteed that they will drop you anything you need, leaving you even MORE undergeared for the next wave. on top of all of that, there are no checkpoints and there is nowhere to heal, so you must maintain the same health while fighting 15-20 opponents who continously get stronger and are able to outperform you in every way. considering the levels of the gauntlet before this only took 2-3 tries max, i feel this jump is very sudden and unwarranted and leads to a feeling of unsatisfaction and distrust with the structure of half sword as a whole. this paired with the unreasonable deaths and bugs such as tripping over nothing, flying objects in the abyss that can knock you out/kill you, and the faulty partial controller support, which allows no customization leads me to be very unsatisfied with the current state of half sword, with hope they will improve.",

If these get fixed I will obviously re-review it. Here are the issues, its mostly a bug report to be honest:\n\n-Performance got a little better since the physics upgrade, but when it was released the game was straight up unplayable. Now its playable, but despite having a well above average PC, I play on Medium and it still mostly doesnt hit 60FPS. I would need this fixed.\n\n-The performance issues are so bad that the game crashes frequently. This wouldnt be that bad if not for the fact that the Final Stage of the game is a long series of fights against increasingly large amounts of enemies and its also painfully difficullt. So its just a tad bit infuriating when I crash for the 3rd time in the middle of it. Currently its uncompletable, unless maybe I turn down the graphics to zero, but I cant guarantee it.\n\n-The new physics have the advantage that cuts are dynamic, as in there is no set position for cuts. Issue is it results in limbs being cloned, cuts looking weird and unnatural, and lagging the shit out of my PC. In its current state, it is less fun than the previous version.\n\n-Cuts are wildly inconsistent in how much damage they do. Sometimes a cut barely stratches someone, while a light tap by a knife cuts someone in two. It looks as if the physics engine doesnt calculate momentum for a weapon properly.\n\n-Getting pushed on the ground is straight up instant death, unless you abuse the surrender mechanic. It feels like you lose all motor functions and get lobotomized. Just recently in a new update it was added that enemies surrender if they lie on the ground for more than 10sec, which basically means that they surrender no matter what, because characters get up at the speed of a snail, so even if you put a light sratch on them it mostly takes more than 10sec for them to get up. I would like standing up, especially when there is no leg or head injury to be much quicker and hopefully for us to be able to move while on the ground at least somewhat better. Currently this feels like Gang Beasts and not a medieval fighting game.\n\n-Sheating a weapon sometimes drags you in the direction of the sheet, which as described previously is instand death because it drags you to the ground.\n\n-Trying to put on a stabbing position with a lance or pichfork often makes you let go with one hand and the weapon akwardly flops away cömpletely useless. This is new, probably happened due to the changes to the default stances with lances.\n\nThese are the current issues I have for the most part. I am sure I could write some more, but for now I feel this is enough.\n\nLove the game, but I needed to write this after the 3rd crash I had in the afformentioned Final Stage. Hope I was helpful.",

I've been around since a few months after the abyss demo dropped. It was fun in that state but it just needed more. Then the playtest came out, fully sandbox with tons of weapons and armor. It was amazing. I put well over 100 hours into it. With the latest update, yes it has become more of a game... but they kinda forgot who was actually playing the game. There is no sandbox features to speak of, and the only way to unlock a free mode is to play through a 1 life gauntlet. Not only that, free mode progression is completely bugged right now and if you die in gauntlet mode you will lose free mode progress. On top of that, the game by nature is extremely buggy and glitchy deaths can be frequent. Not to mention the absurd amount of crashes i've had already.

I still haven't, the amount of luck you need in order to beat it is actually atrocious, this is no longer a \"skill-based\" game, its very clearly all about luck because the moment you fall down, you are dead, because the AI is programmed to just beat you to death. If the devs are looking to make the game more enjoyable, you know that system that you used to detect when you fall down and display that little \"press G to give up\" thing on the top of your screen? Use that same system in order to make the AI detect that you have fallen over, and LET YOU GET UP, just make it give you like 5 seconds to get ready, you can play it off as like \"the AI has honor for you\" or something, but I'm telling you that that's what the players want, also, long ranged weapons especially spears are just broken, one hit and you die, if you're using a short ranged weapon you pretty much have no chance against a spear. The most important thing is the Ultimate Challenge, as I said, I get that it's trying to be a very hard challenge, but at this point it's literally impossible if you're not lucky, and some people just want to unlock the last level for freemode in order to play as the baron, but no, you can't, just make it so that if you beat the knight boss you also unlock the option to play as the baron in freemode, cus that last challenge is absolutely ridiculous. (honourable mention: fix those stupid crashes pls)",

Absolutely hate the permadeath nature of the gameplay as a result of various issues I have with combat. Attacks with blades feel extremely inconsistent, most of the time either bouncing off (unarmored, mind you) enemy npcs harmlessly even when it doesn't hit with the flat. Stamina is practically nothing, and enemies will just walk into you and knock you over, of which you will never get back up 70% of the time, even in lower tiers with less weight on them. As a result, I was essentially forced to cheese the game in order to progress past the third champion.\n\nI can ignore the crashing and overall performance issues given that the game is still in development, but the underlying gameplay in and of itself is just not fun outside of going into free mode and beating knights silly with a poleaxe or mace.\n\nI want this game to succeed beyond all metrics, but right now, I do not like what I have experienced.

It ruined its casual-friendliness trying to be something it has no right being.\n\nWe dont care about a story mode, We dont care about the roleplay aspect of it.

Losing character progress for loging out is also terrible, I cant grind to a point and get back at it the next day, if I leave I have to ruin the playthrough. It reallly sucks and I dont enjoy the game anymore, Bring back sandbox mode, if the devs want to waste time developing a story/roguelite mode good for them but I think it would be a terrible waste of time and resources when they could sell a sandbox version for quite a bit of money.

Blood was good gore was decent too. \n\n\nNext Update, they added the little arena which still felt pretty good but the swings felt less impactful, not terrible but just weaker... Did at blood and gore back, which looks really good but kills performance.\n\n\nFinal update which seems to have combined the Abyss mode and the arena modes together... At this rate, someone breathes on me wrong, I fall over. My swings feel like I'm just randomly flailing my arms even if I prepare my swing ahead of time and go for a proper hit with good technique. Genuinely just feels more clunky too to top it all off. \n\nOverall we started running and ended up at a snails pace, just hope they realize they had the physics right before, hits felt solid and now even with a heavier weapon like the two handed mace or just a normal mace, hitting a target doesn't feel right, like they can brush it off. Swords feel less viable in their swings and stabs, now you may as well just swing it randomly  and pray you hit because there isn't a point to trying to aim your strikes anymore unless you go for only the legs. \n\nThe pushing \"META\" is so strong even the AI understand it now, you get into a close quarters fight 9 times out of 10 the AI will two hand their weapon in an attempt to shove you to the ground which in theory is amazing but completely unsatisfying in reality, as you can do the same but the odds of you winning are simply reduced because the AI knows best and will almost always have more stamina than you in these clinches.\n\nI typically wouldn't have had a problem with all of it since afterall it is just a sandbox medieval fighting game and it's wacky gimmick is ragdoll physics, but it's getting to a point where that's all it really is, with no multiplayer / PVP dueling the game just feels completely and utterly stale to me as I've spent a 90% of my time in it just dueling with the AI with some occasional Small Buhurts or Carnages.\n\n\nStarted at a 8/10\n\nDropped to a 4/10\n\nPlease review the older physics/combat mechanics, it'll make you more money in the long run.",

      "review": "Although I have put a significant amount of time into this game, and I truly enjoy a lot of the fighting elements of the game, I cannot in good faith recommend this game due to the god-awful character models and buggy input response.\n\nThe biggest glaring issue of this game is that falling down is basically guaranteed death due to the disgustingly long time it takes to stand up, and your character can also fall over for literally no reason, and often does. Especially in Gauntlet Mode, you can do everything right and still randomly fall over and lose all of your progress. The amount of times I ragequit this game, not due to lack of skill but due to gameplay failure beyond my control is hard to quantify.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is that the keyboard input response is abysmal. I prefer not to play with the shield, so I tend to drop it before battle. There have been times where I have mashed the Q key over 20 times and my character will still be holding their shield when I go to take a swing with my sword. There have been times where I have stood directly over a weapon in Spoilance, pressed the E key to pick it up, and my character will crouch down, reach out for the weapon and grab nothing. There have been times where I have been running and my character suddenly stops moving because the WASD key input randomly stops responding.\n\nThe give-up/respawn timer is also extremely slow. The only way to save your progress in Gauntlet Mode when you fall over due to some inexplicable physics error is to give up immediately, but the timer to give up takes approximately 3-5 business days to finish, and in that time you're being attacked and killed nonstop with no recourse whatsoever. You might as well just delete the game because that's 90% of the gameplay experience.\n\nThe fighting mechanic and the weapons selection in this game are very good. The physics and the gore aspect of the game are excellent and I commend the developers for the true dedication and detail that they seem to have put into this game.

I actually found the gauntlet mode to be quite fun until I reached the \"Ultimate Challenge\". i have now attempted it over 100 times and still have not even gotten close to completing it. The \"Ultimate Challenge\" Means that you have less range, worse weapons, and worse armor than your opponents. they also continue respawning in waves that get bigger and bigger, their weapons and armor continue to get better, and its not even gauranteed that they will drop you anything you need, leaving you even MORE undergeared for the next wave. on top of all of that, there are no checkpoints and there is nowhere to heal, so you must maintain the same health while fighting 15-20 opponents who continously get stronger and are able to outperform you in every way. considering the levels of the gauntlet before this only took 2-3 tries max, i feel this jump is very sudden and unwarranted and leads to a feeling of unsatisfaction and distrust with the structure of half sword as a whole. this paired with the unreasonable deaths and bugs such as tripping over nothing, flying objects in the abyss that can knock you out/kill you, and the faulty partial controller support, which allows no customization leads me to be very unsatisfied with the current state of half sword, with hope they will improve.",

If these get fixed I will obviously re-review it. Here are the issues, its mostly a bug report to be honest:\n\n-Performance got a little better since the physics upgrade, but when it was released the game was straight up unplayable. Now its playable, but despite having a well above average PC, I play on Medium and it still mostly doesnt hit 60FPS. I would need this fixed.\n\n-The performance issues are so bad that the game crashes frequently. This wouldnt be that bad if not for the fact that the Final Stage of the game is a long series of fights against increasingly large amounts of enemies and its also painfully difficullt. So its just a tad bit infuriating when I crash for the 3rd time in the middle of it. Currently its uncompletable, unless maybe I turn down the graphics to zero, but I cant guarantee it.\n\n-The new physics have the advantage that cuts are dynamic, as in there is no set position for cuts. Issue is it results in limbs being cloned, cuts looking weird and unnatural, and lagging the shit out of my PC. In its current state, it is less fun than the previous version.\n\n-Cuts are wildly inconsistent in how much damage they do. Sometimes a cut barely stratches someone, while a light tap by a knife cuts someone in two. It looks as if the physics engine doesnt calculate momentum for a weapon properly.\n\n-Getting pushed on the ground is straight up instant death, unless you abuse the surrender mechanic. It feels like you lose all motor functions and get lobotomized. Just recently in a new update it was added that enemies surrender if they lie on the ground for more than 10sec, which basically means that they surrender no matter what, because characters get up at the speed of a snail, so even if you put a light sratch on them it mostly takes more than 10sec for them to get up. I would like standing up, especially when there is no leg or head injury to be much quicker and hopefully for us to be able to move while on the ground at least somewhat better. Currently this feels like Gang Beasts and not a medieval fighting game.\n\n-Sheating a weapon sometimes drags you in the direction of the sheet, which as described previously is instand death because it drags you to the ground.\n\n-Trying to put on a stabbing position with a lance or pichfork often makes you let go with one hand and the weapon akwardly flops away cömpletely useless. This is new, probably happened due to the changes to the default stances with lances.\n\nThese are the current issues I have for the most part. I am sure I could write some more, but for now I feel this is enough.\n\nLove the game, but I needed to write this after the 3rd crash I had in the afformentioned Final Stage. Hope I was helpful.",

There is no sandbox features to speak of, and the only way to unlock a free mode is to play through a 1 life gauntlet. Not only that, free mode progression is completely bugged right now and if you die in gauntlet mode you will lose free mode progress.

      "review": "initially i wrote this review out of rage and spite for the game, however i've now managed to accumulate several points that resulted in my distinct lack of enjoyment with the game in its current state\n\nfirstly, the main issue i ran into is with how the settings to determine damage to player and damage to enemy simply just do not function. in previous versions, i was able to notice a tangible impact and in some cases save some runs due to turning down damage to player in some situations, however now i simply don't think changing the sliders actually impacts the game anymore\n\nin terms of functional gameplay, the enemies since previous versions have become absurdly resilient to any form of pushback by the player, or conversely the player character now basically will just fall over on the lightest touch of an enemy. this makes playing the gauntlet mode especially very annoying on account of the fact that you will oftentimes lose a fight simply because you are pushed over by a brief touch by an enemy, either just causing you to fall over or causing some additional physics glitch that causes you to fall over, and then you become unable to get up forcing you to either give up or wait until the lose timer finishes you off. this is doubly worse for great foes, especially the higher tier ones, as trying to get close is asking to lose because they will immediately push you to the ground and force you to forfeit.\n\nmy most egregious issue with the game though primarily lies in the ultimate challenge. firstly, while i may be incorrect on this, the fact you cannot access this natively in free mode - despite it being /free/ mode where you would imagine everything would be accessible alongside the fact it was added due to pushback from the playerbase due to dissatisfaction with the most recent version - almost feels like it's forcing players into playing gauntlet mode just so they can unlock this wherein many players already simply do not want to. even besides this, having completed the main gauntlet, i have experienced (in every run where i have not had to back out of it due to poor RNG in terms of what weapons are dropped to me) a fatal unity error that simply prevents me from progressing to the end as it will just force-close the game. this kind of issue, ESPECIALLY in a mode where it's intended to be one life, having a decent attempt at the ultimate challenge being nullified because of the game rather than any fault on your part is nothing short of infuriating. i would have expected an error such as this to be caught in playtesting, considering how drastic it is and how frequently it seems to be occuring, but i digress. \n\ni just really cannot recommend this game in its current state. i am aware it is a demo, but i generally see this most recent update as a downgrade to the previous version of the demo. abyss mode ceases to be enjoyable, i still don't understand why there is no equipment selector (especially in free mode), and the ultimate challenge consistently causing crashes fails to make it a worthy successor to what abyss mode could have been",

But the game runs horrible now and looks worse than before... how do you lose graphics and run worse? The fighting is god awful, I will get almost to the top and then boom arms glitch behind my back and i get hit and knocked down... and guess what, you cant get up because the AI dont have stamina like you so they can just keep swinging. Oh and you are moving you mouse in a straight line towards the enemy? Not moving it up or down? You are also locked onto them? Sucks for you, you swung above their head or at their ankle. Not to mention if you hit them in the fleshy bits, its a 50/50 shot that your weapon dont bounce off of them because apparently an axe being swung into someones bare ribs is nothing to them. But dont think for a second that the same will happen to you. Hell no! The AI have their weapon enchanted with sharpness 500 and the have pin point accuracy. The second you are touched you are pretty well screwed. But if they are on the ground and you want to swing straight down, oh well looks like you swung down and to the side no matter if you did or not. This game is awful. 4/10 literally would never in my life recommend. Also 50/50 shot you see this, the devs like removing mean and honest reviews. If you say its a bad game it gets removed.

I know hes supposed to be stronger than you, but he will hit me once and insta kill me while I am able to hit him full on several times and he doesn't give af. There is a line between something being a fun challenge and something being too unfair to enjoy. Also side note idk if its me but it feels like the spin kick move you could do has been nerfed.

After this big update I now experience random black screens and crashes, which is something that just happened on the 2nd fight after beating the 1st mini-boss.   From what I hear this is a common issue now whereas before it almost never happened to me.\n\nI'm also not a big fan of how the hits register now as compared to the previous Demo.   It feels more floppy, less controlled, and stabs don't really seem to work anymore, even when using the alt key.   It seems the stabs now go through the bodies without registering a lot of the time.  I had gotten pretty decent at controlling weapons with the first iteration of the demo and definitely notice the difference.\n\nI dislike the new NPC clean up system post-death.   Having the NPC turn into a skeleton immediately and sink through the ground is not satisfying, especially in 1v2 or more fights.   I liked the system before where the bodies would only despawn if you left the area.\n\nLeaving this review because this game has been awesome in the past, and I'm hoping some of these things get fixed/reverted.",

When the playtest came out, it was amazing, I was playing it like crazy because it offered so many new options and also improved a lot. But it started getting boring, and that's when this new update popped up, obviously, at first I was very interested in it, and especially in the gauntlet mode (seemed pretty cool). I did realize that you needed to play gauntlet in order to play freemode properly, but honestly it wasn't that big of a deal for me, although the physics were very clearly worse and the performance was tough, I pushed through and managed to beat almost all the bosses. What I mean by \"almost\"? Well, the \"Ultimate Challenge\" is a very bad idea, and the way they did it was even worse. I have spent around 8-9 hours so far trying to beat that stupid gamemode, but guess what? I still haven't, the amount of luck you need in order to beat it is actually atrocious, this is no longer a \"skill-based\" game, its very clearly all about luck because the moment you fall down, you are dead, because the AI is programmed to just beat you to death. If the devs are looking to make the game more enjoyable, you know that system that you used to detect when you fall down and display that little \"press G to give up\" thing on the top of your screen? Use that same system in order to make the AI detect that you have fallen over, and LET YOU GET UP, just make it give you like 5 seconds to get ready, you can play it off as like \"the AI has honor for you\" or something, but I'm telling you that that's what the players want, also, long ranged weapons especially spears are just broken, one hit and you die, if you're using a short ranged weapon you pretty much have no chance against a spear. The most important thing is the Ultimate Challenge, as I said, I get that it's trying to be a very hard challenge, but at this point it's literally impossible if you're not lucky, and some people just want to unlock the last level for freemode in order to play as the baron, but no, you can't, just make it so that if you beat the knight boss you also unlock the option to play as the baron in freemode, cus that last challenge is absolutely ridiculous.

Absolutely hate the permadeath nature of the gameplay as a result of various issues I have with combat. Attacks with blades feel extremely inconsistent, most of the time either bouncing off (unarmored, mind you) enemy npcs harmlessly even when it doesn't hit with the flat. Stamina is practically nothing, and enemies will just walk into you and knock you over, of which you will never get back up 70% of the time, even in lower tiers with less weight on them. As a result, I was essentially forced to cheese the game in order to progress past the third champion.\n\nI can ignore the crashing and overall performance issues given that the game is still in development, but the underlying gameplay in and of itself is just not fun outside of going into free mode and beating knights silly with a poleaxe or mace.\n\nI want this game to succeed beyond all metrics, but right now, I do not like what I have experienced.

It ruined its casual-friendliness trying to be something it has no right being.\n\nWe dont care about a story mode, We dont care about the roleplay aspect of it. The combat is way too janky to warrant putting effort into \"leveling\". Losing character progress for loging out is also terrible, I cant grind to a point and get back at it the next day, if I leave I have to ruin the playthrough. It reallly sucks and I dont enjoy the game anymore, Bring back sandbox mode, if the devs want to waste time developing a story/roguelite mode good for them but I think it would be a terrible waste of time and resources when they could sell a sandbox version for quite a bit of money. I'd pay to have sandbox back, I wouldnt pay for the current system/modes.\n\n\"[b]Half Sword is an immersive, physics-based medieval combat simulator[/b] that offers players a unique experience of becoming a commoner-turned-knight\"\n\nThe part in bold is the fun part of the game, \"a unique experience of becoming a commoner-turned-knight\" My brothers there are a million games that provide this very unoriginal experience.
