It might be a bit boring at the very start or later in-game when you unlock most of stuff, since you are slowly earning your way for better and faster automated upgrades. There are also Skins and Hats so you can customize your ninja the way you like it. If you are thinking about 100% achievements, well it takes a lot of time and patience, so no need to hurry, might as well put it in back running sometimes. \nIf you like Idle Games it wont hurt to give it a try, maybe you like it, maybe not, you never know. Not everyone has the same taste.",

Le jeu parvient à maintenir un rythme satisfaisant sans tomber dans les pièges habituels du genre : pas de murs de progression\n   insurmontables, pas de système agressif vous poussant vers les microtransactions. Chaque session apporte un sentiment tangible d'avancement, ce qui est essentiel pour maintenir l'engagement sur le long\n   terme.\n\n   Contenu saisonnier et Conquest : une diversité bienvenue\n\n   Le contenu saisonnier renouvelle régulièrement l'expérience et offre des objectifs à court terme motivants. Le mode Conquest mérite une mention particulière : il apporte une vraie diversité gameplay et\n   brise la monotonie des idle games. Cette variété dans les mécaniques de jeu contribue grandement à la longévité du titre.\n\n   Verdict\n\n   Si vous êtes amateur d'idle games, Tap Ninja est un must-have. Le jeu respecte votre temps, offre une progression gratifiante et propose suffisamment de contenu varié pour justifier des centaines\n   d'heures de jeu. Un titre que je recommande sans réserve à tous les fans du genre.",

If you want to have the upgrades screen open, there goes 15% of your screen (and messes with targeting orbs, see below). \n2) There are a lot of systems, several of which are monetized, though that's not even really the issue since you can bypass most of that. The issue is imo that a lot of those systems get dumped on you fast and furious, don't have great tooltips, and again, the UI is not awesome. That's a bad mix.\n3) The first few hours are ok, but you pretty quickly move into mid-game and mid-game is like 95% idle, which would be fine except that the 'orb events' are not idle.  This would also be fine except each orb event is some number of min apart (3-8) and worth anywhere from several minutes of idle farming to seemingly several hours.\n\nSo the game is largely idle, but has events that are easy to miss and if you miss them it feels bad.  And that's before we get into the issues with the ninja minigame progression and the Fortress progression. Just the main loop feels...bad.\n\nTo a point I get what they're going for - largely idle but with some incentive for intermittent active play, and for some people maybe it's great but for me it feels unbalanced - everything but the orbs feels like a waste of time to me.",

If you want to have the upgrades screen open, there goes 15% of your screen (and messes with targeting orbs, see below). \n2) There are a lot of systems, several of which are monetized, though that's not even really the issue since you can bypass most of that. The issue is imo that a lot of those systems get dumped on you fast and furious, don't have great tooltips, and again, the UI is not awesome. That's a bad mix.\n3) The first few hours are ok, but you pretty quickly move into mid-game and mid-game is like 95% idle, which would be fine except that the 'orb events' are not idle.  This would also be fine except each orb event is some number of min apart (3-8) and worth anywhere from several minutes of idle farming to seemingly several hours.\n\nSo the game is largely idle, but has events that are easy to miss and if you miss them it feels bad.  And that's before we get into the issues with the ninja minigame progression and the Fortress progression. Just the main loop feels...bad.\n\nTo a point I get what they're going for - largely idle but with some incentive for intermittent active play, and for some people maybe it's great but for me it feels unbalanced - everything but the orbs feels like a waste of time to me.",
