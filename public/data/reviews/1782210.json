Mute button is not optional.\n* You will die to someone gently touching you at Mach 3 from behind.\n* “Teamwork” lasts exactly until there are fewer than 4 players left, then it becomes a nature documentary.\n* Host leaves → entire server Thanos-snaps out of existence. Your victory? Gone. Your dignity? Also gone.\n\n---\n\n### Peak Crab Game Moments\n\n* Making an alliance with three people, then all four of you immediately pushing each other off a cliff anyway.\n* Surviving an entire round just by standing very still and radiating prey energy.\n* Getting eliminated in the first 5 seconds, then shouting “EZ” from spectator mode like a true gamer.\n* Winning a lobby and realizing your prize was… absolutely nothing except the knowledge you’re worse than your enemies morally.\n\n---\n\n9/10\nParty game, social test, psychological horror—depends on the lobby.\n\nWould get shoved into the void by a 12-year-old with a $5 headset and queue up “one more” again.",
