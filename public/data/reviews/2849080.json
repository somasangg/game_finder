Personally I have been very hyped and excited for this installment and I did unfortunately not find that it lived up to my expectations.\nThe theme of an alliance of good and evil, and of having two heroes is unfortunately not explored very thoroughly.\n\nIf you are looking for a Kingdom Rush game this is it. If you are looking for THE Kingdom Rush game, this is not it.\n\nMain campaign 6/10\nThe main campaign felt very short with only 3 areas, I would love for it to have had a 4th area or more.\nThe levels have been somewhat polarizing, some levels were awesome, requiring me to think about what I had to change about my strategy to complete it. On the other hand, some levels were just boring, and at times unpleasant to play.\n\nThe first area was very beautiful and well crafted, I liked the thematic and the difficulty.\n\nAesthetically the second area was only decent, however the difficulty was very fun! I had to spend time to adjust my strategy, and think about what towers and upgrades I wanted to bring to the battlefield.\n\nPersonally the last area was thematically uninteresting. The maps were annoying to play because of the ”eye” mechanic of the maps, healing and buffing the enemy units. It felt very uninteractive to play against since there was not much I could do to prevent it. On some maps there is an opportunity to fight the enemies before and after but it does not matter that much. Also the last 3 levels i just spammed the eldritch channeler and found it to be the most effective :(\n\nHeroes 4/10\nThe heroes are for me mostly quite uninteresting. The whole idea behind having two heroes is for them to be strong and interact a lot with the levels. Yes, that did happen, but I only ever seemed to find myself using Raelyn + Someone else.",

      "review": "So this franchise is great, its always been great. I've been playing it since it was a browser game. The game play formula has been surprisingly consistent over the years. Evolving slightly between titles, without the developers trying to change genres, or steer the franchise in a contrived way.  \n\nI've noticed some disappointment from long term fans with the last two releases. I think the issue is that a base game comes out. Then for a year or two dlc trickles out for it. When its all said and done, you have solid memories of that game and its DLC combined. When the next game comes out without the DLC that will eventually define half of its buik and character, it feels lightweight and half assed.\n\nIts an illusory sadness that the developer cant really fix, and it goes away if the player sticks it out and sees it through.\n\nFor my money, all five games are great. They all basically came out to three hours of entertainment per dollar spent, and story wise, I'm kind of interested to see what they do next.",

      "review": "Probably my least favorite in the franchise and actually made me appreciate both Origins and Vengeance more.  Originally I was disappointed in Origins because it felt like it deviated from the first two games too much, but now with this release, I realize it was closer to them than I had thought. Vengeance felt like a true deviation from the original formula and yet it completely stuck the landing. The theme of the game, the customization, its overall charm - the Kingdom Rush magic was there. And I feel like it's not with this new installment.\r\n\r\nI can't tell what the theme of this game is at all. It's like a mishmash of everything which makes it so that there's nothing to define it by. Like someone was cooking a soup and just threw in everything because they thought it would make it better but it just really made it come out bad. \r\n\r\nThe heroes, the towers...I wouldn't necessarily say they are bad as they are quite a few that I like (especially with the new Wu Kong DLC), but the options this time around feel like bloat. Vengeance, despite having the same formula as this game, didn't feel that way. Everything felt fun, distinct, and charming. Some of the towers and heroes in this game are just flat out not appealing, and not in a meta/damage output way, but just overall design/fun to play way. I don't want to play with them. There's too many toys here that just aren't fun.\r\n\r\nMap and wave design is just bad. This is probably my biggest gripe with the game. Maps just look bad, are designed poorly, and waves feel like they are very easy until maybe the last 3 waves of the last 3 levels of the main campaign, where the difficulty just shoots up tremendously out of nowhere. I always thought Kingdom Rush was a cut above the rest of every other Tower Defense game because each wave brought a nice, smooth progression in difficulty/enemy units, unlike other games where it felt like the waves are easy until the final 20 seconds of the last wave where it feels like you are suddenly bombed with enemy units that rush in out of nowhere. This game unfortunately has that now, especially with some of the damn flying units .\r\n\r\nEnemy units just blow. Again with the other games, there is a distinct theme about them that makes it both charming and intuitive. Intuitive in the sense that I know if I see say an armored looking unit, then I know, \"okay, he has physical damage mitigation and I should place a magic tower to counter him\". This runs true as well when I see a mage looking guy. But this game, with it complete lack of distinct theme and mishmash of everything, I find myself just confused on what the enemy unit is and what it exactly does. I even will have just read the fact card about it that pops up, and then forget a few waves later after I read 3 more fact cards about 3 new enemies.\r\n\r\nCharm is no longer here in this game. There's no more humor. No more iconic one liners, \"TOOOOOOO BATTLE!\". With its extremely vibrant, animated design and colors, lack of theme, and lack of that classic Ironhide humor, this game feels soulless. \r\n\r\nNow, having said all that, there's still plenty I like about this game:\r\n\r\n-It's a Kingdom Rush game\r\n\r\n-Having two heroes is pretty fun (though I do miss meteor barrage/lightning/magic as those were super satisfying to nuke a wave with)\r\n\r\nShit... not much else. This is an off-the-cuff, stream of consciousness review so as I was writing out the pros of this game nothing comes out besides those two. The other games in this franchise are just better, in virtually all ways. \r\n\r\nHaving said all this, I still recommend getting this game if you are fan of the series and my opinion on this game will likely change in the future like it did for Origins. I will probably appreciate the game more in the future as I sink more hours into it, more DLC comes out for it (Sun Wukong has been pretty hype so far), and I revisit it with fresh eyes.",

This isn't the first version of this game I've played, and I have played quite a few TD games. \r\n\r\n There's a lot of variety on towers and champions to play and that's cool. But some are just wildly stronger than others. It means you can just spam one tower on basically every level and win. \r\n\r\nSame with heroes. Ranged are just massively stronger than melee, and flying is even stronger than that since they don't die. Also Melee is handicapped since it's much harder for them to gain XP. \r\n\r\nSo now you have a very clear meta on how to win and it's boring. Now let's add to that: there's no speed controls in the game so it's stuck going very slow. Also you can't window the screen, so if you want to alt+tab to something else while you wait, you can't. \r\n\r\nLastly, and maybe this is only a thing for me: You can't just escape> quit.

The base towers all served a role and they could specialise on the go allowing you to assess the situation and make the right choice.\r\n\r\n2. Towers lack much personality, unlike older games where every tower had multiple specialisations making it fun to mess around and find out which build for that tower is the best, the towers in this game are static with the same upgrades every time and I understand this game is trying to have many new towers instead of a few with many specialisations but it just makes all the towers boring. there is no variety, you can only do one thing with those towers,",

      "review": "Kinda disappointed on a number of levels. This isn't the first version of this game I've played, and I have played quite a few TD games. \r\n\r\n There's a lot of variety on towers and champions to play and that's cool. But some are just wildly stronger than others. It means you can just spam one tower on basically every level and win. \r\n\r\nSame with heroes. Ranged are just massively stronger than melee, and flying is even stronger than that since they don't die. Also Melee is handicapped since it's much harder for them to gain XP. \r\n\r\nSo now you have a very clear meta on how to win and it's boring. Now let's add to that: there's no speed controls in the game so it's stuck going very slow. Also you can't window the screen, so if you want to alt+tab to something else while you wait, you can't. \r\n\r\nLastly, and maybe this is only a thing for me: You can't just escape> quit. You are forced to go to the main menu and then quit. It's 2025, it's not hard to code this. Esc> exit game on every game forever, this is a cardinal rule of gaming. \r\n\r\nThis is one of those mobile time wasters, whatever. Not worth the price on PC, that's for sure. Maybe if it goes on sale for $5.",

      "review": "Other reviews said it better so I'll keep it short. Its a 6/10 not worth the money. It lacks content and innovation and is no better then the previous games, arguably worse in multiple aspects. Its DLC's do not fix the core problems with its design, gold based difficulty, bosses instantly destroying or disabling towers, etc. They do add more content which this game is notably lacking but also increase the price which is already too high. If you want to play Kingdom Rush the previous four games are better, only play this one if you liked the previous games and want more of the series and even then only get this game with its DLC's and on sale. If Steam had a neutral review id select it over negative.",

It started in the wrong screen size with the 'options' button somewhere off screen.  30 minutes of browsing forums, the internet, and seeing Dev's suggestions for this common problem mostly involved going to %appdata% and scrolling through the Explorer tree then opening settings files and editing them in notepad, which didn't work by the way, leads me to believe they may be experts at graphics and gameplay and god knows what else but they can't figure out a way to fix a common problem without asking us to code for them.  Angrily refunded.",
