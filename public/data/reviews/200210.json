So, what make this game special?\n\nGameplay: A roguelite (roguelike with permanent progression mechanics) molten with mmorpg and bullet hell.  Addictive.\n\nStorytelling: It may seem small, but it's incredibly rich! Each dungeon has its own secrets, reason for existing, and a story behind it.\n\nGraphics: Captivating, a celebration of pixel art.\n\nSound: Very few dungeons have bad theme music, I always play with the game's sound on. The music at Ice Citadel is, in fact, breathtaking.\n\nLegacy: It was released in 2010, so, we can say that probably inspired the indie scenario of mmos and roguelikes.\n\nProblems: Always the connection ;(.\n\nOverall: 8/10, the connection is a big problem, but the time that you spend in game is fun and very addictive, you want win all the dungeons, maximize all the classes and challenge yourself, even though it often seems impossible. It's a must to play game!",

      "review": "Under it is a bit of a guide/explanaition for possible new players and because most of the negative reviews are about servers I will say this: These people are probably playing on a Full server that they have a poor connection to. I haven't had ANY problems with servers.\n\n->The Review:\nAbsolutely love the game! I’ve been playing since the Kongregate days (over a decade ago), and it’s still a game I come back to. Getting into it as a new player isn’t easy, I’ll admit, but once you understand the basics of the gameplay loop, it becomes the kind of game you can hop in and out of whenever there’s an update or a new season. You create a character, take on challenges, and return whenever you feel like it.\n\nThe game isn’t hard unless you play recklessly, as nothing forces you into specific content. You can take it slow and enjoy casual farming, or push yourself into tough quests/encounters and challenges that might take multiple tries to even complete. Both play styles are valid, and that freedom is part of what makes the game so fun.\n\n->The Guide:\nFor new players, the tutorial doesn’t explain much, so here’s a quick idea of what you should know (without spoiling the fun of figuring out the game):\n\nThe game is open-world. When you enter a “Realm,” you’ll see quests that guide you toward areas suitable for your level. They don’t give rewards directly, they’re just \"Average players in your level go here\".\n\nIf enemies feel too strong, head to an easier biome, farm enemies, level up, quests aren't important per se. Everything drops loot also sometimes you’ll find new weapons, armor, or pots (potions that increase your power) just by grinding.\n\nDungeons appear when certain enemies are defeated. These are fantastic for early gear and sometimes drop unique items (UTs).\n\nGear has a tier system: weapons/armor go from T0 up to T14, rings/abilities up to T7. Beyond that, there are also Untiered (UT) items with special effects. These can range from powerful mid-game gear to really strong end-game items.\n\nThe \"nexus key\" (by default \"R\") is your best friend if you are in a pickle you press it, and you INSTANTLY go to safety, !!!USE IT!!! you are better off losing a bit of possible loot than losing your character (this is a perma death game, do not be cocky).\n\nThe \"Vault\" that is in the nexus is where you can store items permanently and share them between characters if you have multiple or for when you die to have back up items, a lot of times lets say that you get a good character and are able to farm some gear maybe it is not as good as your current gear but still grabbing it and putting it in the vault will still help if you die.\n\nSometimes you’ll find eggs, which give pets when used in the Pet Yard. Pets have abilities (always three). They’re resource sinks but very worth it. Due to them being so hard to level up and needing items with high \"feedpower\", I will just straight up say it the MUST-HAVE ability combo is Heal and Magic Heal in the first two slots (Electric as a third, and it is perfect, but the 3rd ability doesn't really matter). Leveling pets requires feeding and fusing them with another pet of the same \"family\" when both are almost max level/when the fusing strength says \"Max\", which gets expensive, but they’re a huge long-term investment.\n\nThere are seasons as I said before, these have a \"battle pass\" where even in the free version you can get gear and special stuff easily these come with LOADS of missions like \"clear X dungeon\" \"kill X enemies\" so on these are wonderful for starting players you can access the missions by pressing the flag that is on top of your XP/fame b, and you can access the battle pass with rewards while on the nexus. (Tip: while in the Nexus, press every menu button to familiarize yourself with everything.)\n\nTL:DR->Whether you want a quick session or grind for the best gear, Realm of the Mad God delivers. It’s a mix of MMO, bullet-hell and roguelike; Learning it is a bumpy road, but it is a wonderful game and with what I wrote above you are ready to explore it.",

And the nail in the coffin from this game for me was the game deleting items in my VAULT that I spent money on, because I took a month break from the game and the season rolled over and deleted my items. When I contacted support I was told this was an \"intended game mechanic\" and I will never touch this game ever again. Do not play this game, fuck predatory monetization practices.",

      "review": "Hi! I've been playing on and off and have been playing ROTMG for 13+ years. I want to give some of my thoughts regarding what I think about the game at its present in sections.\n\n=POSITIVES=\nTHE REALM OVERHAUL\nThey really did a good job upgrading how the realm operated. Before this, it used to be that you need to run to middle of the map to the godlands, doing event bosses and/or do dungeons to get potions and it took longer to get to 8/8. But now? You have beacons in different biomes that you can teleport to, reducing the long walking distance. Potions drop more commonly in the realm too, a big plus. The map is more detailed and vast as well, marking where the beacons, events and quest boss locations are.\n\nFREE TO PLAY EXPERIENCE\nDECA is generous adding an account levelling system for rewards for new accounts, I would even say more plentiful than what Wildshadow & Kabam offered in the past. There is also a login calendar which encourages players to log in daily for rewards. Just be aware that if you skip any days, you will be behind rewards-wise. You do NOT need to spend money just to enjoy the game!\n\nADDICTIVE GAMEPLAY\nIf you are prone to getting addicted & you have a mindset to grind, it will get you hooked. Getting your first white bag is such a dopamine rush & it makes you do it over and over again just to get that same feeling. Same thing goes with getting shinies which are off-coloured versions of the original gear! They recently even implemented enchantments where you can get extra slot buffs depending on the rarity. [Uncommon, Rare, Legendary, Divine]\n\nSEASONAL CHARACTERS\nThis was a great addition to the grindfest that is ROTMG. They are characters that have a separate vault/potion storage space compared to your regular character and are only usable per season. At the end of the season, every single character that's seasonal will be converted to regular and the cycle starts again. It encourages people to build from the ground up while giving incentives to complete missions for rewards. ONLY Seasonal vaults get converted to more space in your main vault, NOT for Seasonal potion storage. So there is some motivation there to grind for some free storage space & goodies.\n\n=NEGATIVES=\nTHE SERVERS\nWhile I was on the fortunate end when it comes to entering & going through servers, it can get annoying when you randomly disconnect/crash from the game. DECA really needs to have some sort of hardware survey to figure out why the servers aren't up to par or at least fix them for a more smoother player experience. It's a permadeath game too, so there is bound to be people that have lost their characters to crashing/lag. The error I often get is \"Account in Use\" and it takes at least 15-30 minutes cooldown to wait it out.\n\nTHE OUTDATED TUTORIAL\nThe tutorial needs an overhaul of an update because there are so many things that go unexplained! What they don't really explain to you is what seasonal tokens are, the quest tree and just expect you to read everything in the 'Journal' section. Personally speaking though, the Journal itself is too wordy and would be better translated as an extended part of the tutorial. They don't even explain what seasonal characters are, what the purpose of forge/enchanter is, shiny items... etc. They don't even explain what missions are.\n\nSUGGESTION: Have tutorial quests in the Daily Room or in Missions so that the player can learn about ROTMG. New players can familiarize themselves on where to go such as the Daily Quest Room & Vault, mechanics with Forge & the Enchanter, learn about missions, teleport to others, seasonal events, tokens... etc. Any major topic the original tutorial doesn't cover! Lots of visual aid is needed, & just reading in the Journal section isn't always going to help.\n\nNOT BEGINNER FRIENDLY\nWhile I can navigate around the game just fine, I feel that newer players are going to have a much harder time doing so. When they enter Nexus, they will be greeted by bots in chat and a lot of shop items on the side which will be overwhelming. Most people expect you to know how the game, since majority of the playerbase are experienced with ROTMG. It's a 50/50 toss up that you either get helped or get bullied.\n\nTHE UI\n- The missions board? An EYESORE to look at, the detailed splash art in the BG & the web of quests together in one place make it hard to focus in one area at a time. Yes, there is a list option which makes the UI much simpler to look at but it's not even the default option. I wish they dulled the background splash art so that the missions are more readable and the background less distracting to look at. It's especially notorious during the Halloween season when there are too many different nodes branching out!\n- Sometimes the buttons don't work as intended and you need to click on it multiple times just for it to work or to claim awards from milestones. I personally had this issue when I tried obtaining a char slot from the account level rewards and I was just not given it at all.\n\nNO NEW PLAYER RETENTION\nROTMG is made and created for the current playerbase, which is fine. The problem with that is when new players get involved. A healthy game involves a solid playerbase and new players entering. And no, alts made by experienced players don't count. I personally find it difficult recommending this game to other people because the UI is overwhelming for them and not as insane enough to endlessly grind. Old games often have problems with getting new people on board, and ROTMG is no exception.\n\nROTMG DISCORD RAID SERVER SUPREMACY\nFor endgame content, it is an absolute must to join these servers. If you want to gain exalts for extra stat points, joining a raid server is necessary for progression. It is much difficult to grind exalts by yourself without coordination from other people & their huge financial backing of keys. For new players, it's daunting considering that each and every server has a step-by-step verification process & minimum reqs for characters needed to join. Not only that, some ROTMG discord servers are unfriendly to new players. They are condescending, rude, toxic, racist and are not always understanding.\n\nPREDATORY MONETIZATION\n- The reason why there are a bunch of cosmetics, weapons, gear and keys out in the open the moment you enter Nexus is to tempt you to buying things. There were a lot of complaints about this, but DECA didn't remove them because it was \"making them too much money\" allegedly. Lots of microtransactions, and especially when it comes to pet feeding which is one hell of a moneysink if you choose to pay for it. There are also 'Mystery Boxes' where you pay a base amount multiple times for chances to get certain items in the loot pool and eventually the grand prize. There is NO transparency for what the chance rates are of getting said items per mystery box.\n\n- Some cosmetics like dyes, cloths, player/pet effects (Arcane Style) are permanently lost once a character dies. So if you're that one unfortunate person that spent your money on temporary cosmetics just to die, that's not a good investment. You CAN buy dyes/cloths with fame in the left/right bazaars and in 'Customize character' (the colourwheel icon, top middle area), but you do need to die repeatedly to afford it. Things like character/pet skins and player entrances are permanent cosmetics. you don't lose those after death.\n\nTHE TWO-YEAR LIMIT ACCOUNT PURGE\nDECA established if an account hasn't been active in 2 years or more they delete your account to clean up the database and for security/privacy reasons. Just make sure you log in so your account is considered 'active'. I wouldn't call this a negative in itself, but it's here because you are required to keep your account alive by physically joining the game.\n\nBROKEN STEAM ACHIVEMENTS\nIt hasn't been fixed for years.\n\nCONCLUSION\nNo, I don't recommend this game unless you have plenty of time on your hands & need something to pass the time &/or if you are a masochist.",

      "review": "Good permadeath game mostly. Had my first run for a couple of weeks, was alot of fun but as usual I died due to group mechanics. Some dungeons scale based on how many players are inside, I generally play solo but the servers were not opening realms so I joined a low tier dungeon that scaled well past what I should have been doing due to the amount of people inside. Got insta popped so my biggest advice is stay away from groups especially as you learn. I typically dont like to look up guides and play one life for everything and if you are the same style you need to be very careful testing even when things seem simple. The game will nuke you very easily once more people get involved and you likely wont see how. You cant expect to hit R before you die because even if you do the game might not register it quick enough in those moments. 900+ HP wont save you in those moments. I will still say its a great permadeath game but I also wont be playing again after such a miserable ending. The fame system can reward you for playing multiple lives but in the entire time I played I have not found gear better than the starter gear you get from basic rewards so making a new seasonal account will likely be faster until you get to a 10 star account and essentially tenure one of your characters with massive stat boosts. Unless you get to that point you really shouldnt spend much more than 25 or 50 dollars on the game as it can quickly became a trench you will throw money at for no real reason than skill issues. \n\nI would actually recommend this to many hardcore perma deathers and even casual groupers but since a hard yes or no is needed I will opt for no as a large audience wont enjoy a real experience in this game aside from handouts and the try hards will likely get deleted for something completely irrelevant and both parties will waste their money until they reach certain thresholds making it a scam for those that struggle with gambling and sunk cost fallacy",

      "review": "Hi! I've been playing on and off and have been playing ROTMG for 13+ years. I want to give some of my thoughts regarding what I think about the game at its present in sections.\n\n=POSITIVES=\nTHE REALM OVERHAUL\nThey really did a good job upgrading how the realm operated. Before this, it used to be that you need to run to middle of the map to the godlands, doing event bosses and/or do dungeons to get potions and it took longer to get to 8/8. But now? You have beacons in different biomes that you can teleport to, reducing the long walking distance. Potions drop more commonly in the realm too, a big plus. The map is more detailed and vast as well, marking where the beacons, events and quest boss locations are.\n\nFREE TO PLAY EXPERIENCE\nDECA is generous adding an account levelling system for rewards for new accounts, I would even say more plentiful than what Wildshadow & Kabam offered in the past. There is also a login calendar which encourages players to log in daily for rewards. Just be aware that if you skip any days, you will be behind rewards-wise. You do NOT need to spend money just to enjoy the game!\n\nADDICTIVE GAMEPLAY\nIf you are prone to getting addicted & you have a mindset to grind, it will get you hooked. Getting your first white bag is such a dopamine rush & it makes you do it over and over again just to get that same feeling. Same thing goes with getting shinies which are off-coloured versions of the original gear! They recently even implemented enchantments where you can get extra slot buffs depending on the rarity. [Uncommon, Rare, Legendary, Divine]\n\nSEASONAL CHARACTERS\nThis was a great addition to the grindfest that is ROTMG. They are characters that have a separate vault/potion storage space compared to your regular character and are only usable per season. At the end of the season, every single character that's seasonal will be converted to regular and the cycle starts again. It encourages people to build from the ground up while giving incentives to complete missions for rewards. ONLY Seasonal vaults get converted to more space in your main vault, NOT for Seasonal potion storage. So there is some motivation there to grind for some free storage space & goodies.\n\n=NEGATIVES=\nTHE SERVERS\nWhile I was on the fortunate end when it comes to entering & going through servers, it can get annoying when you randomly disconnect/crash from the game. DECA really needs to have some sort of hardware survey to figure out why the servers aren't up to par or at least fix them for a more smoother player experience. It's a permadeath game too, so there is bound to be people that have lost their characters to crashing/lag. The error I often get is \"Account in Use\" and it takes at least 15-30 minutes cooldown to wait it out.\n\nTHE OUTDATED TUTORIAL\nThe tutorial needs an overhaul of an update because there are so many things that go unexplained! What they don't really explain to you is what seasonal tokens are, the quest tree and just expect you to read everything in the 'Journal' section. Personally speaking though, the Journal itself is too wordy and would be better translated as an extended part of the tutorial. They don't even explain what seasonal characters are, what the purpose of forge/enchanter is, shiny items... etc. They don't even explain what missions are.\n\nSUGGESTION: Have tutorial quests in the Daily Room or in Missions so that the player can learn about ROTMG. New players can familiarize themselves on where to go such as the Daily Quest Room & Vault, mechanics with Forge & the Enchanter, learn about missions, teleport to others, seasonal events, tokens... etc. Any major topic the original tutorial doesn't cover! Lots of visual aid is needed, & just reading in the Journal section isn't always going to help.\n\nNOT BEGINNER FRIENDLY\nWhile I can navigate around the game just fine, I feel that newer players are going to have a much harder time doing so. When they enter Nexus, they will be greeted by bots in chat and a lot of shop items on the side which will be overwhelming. Most people expect you to know how the game, since majority of the playerbase are experienced with ROTMG. It's a 50/50 toss up that you either get helped or get bullied.\n\nTHE UI\n- The missions board? An EYESORE to look at, the detailed splash art in the BG & the web of quests together in one place make it hard to focus in one area at a time. Yes, there is a list option which makes the UI much simpler to look at but it's not even the default option. I wish they dulled the background splash art so that the missions are more readable and the background less distracting to look at. It's especially notorious during the Halloween season when there are too many different nodes branching out!\n- Sometimes the buttons don't work as intended and you need to click on it multiple times just for it to work or to claim awards from milestones. I personally had this issue when I tried obtaining a char slot from the account level rewards and I was just not given it at all.\n\nNO NEW PLAYER RETENTION\nROTMG is made and created for the current playerbase, which is fine. The problem with that is when new players get involved. A healthy game involves a solid playerbase and new players entering. And no, alts made by experienced players don't count. I personally find it difficult recommending this game to other people because the UI is overwhelming for them and not as insane enough to endlessly grind. Old games often have problems with getting new people on board, and ROTMG is no exception.\n\nROTMG DISCORD RAID SERVER SUPREMACY\nFor endgame content, it is an absolute must to join these servers. If you want to gain exalts for extra stat points, joining a raid server is necessary for progression. It is much difficult to grind exalts by yourself without coordination from other people & their huge financial backing of keys. For new players, it's daunting considering that each and every server has a step-by-step verification process & minimum reqs for characters needed to join. Not only that, some ROTMG discord servers are unfriendly to new players. They are condescending, rude, toxic, racist and are not always understanding.\n\nPREDATORY MONETIZATION\n- The reason why there are a bunch of cosmetics, weapons, gear and keys out in the open the moment you enter Nexus is to tempt you to buying things. There were a lot of complaints about this, but DECA didn't remove them because it was \"making them too much money\" allegedly. Lots of microtransactions, and especially when it comes to pet feeding which is one hell of a moneysink if you choose to pay for it. There are also 'Mystery Boxes' where you pay a base amount multiple times for chances to get certain items in the loot pool and eventually the grand prize. There is NO transparency for what the chance rates are of getting said items per mystery box.\n\n- Some cosmetics like dyes, cloths, player/pet effects (Arcane Style) are permanently lost once a character dies. So if you're that one unfortunate person that spent your money on temporary cosmetics just to die, that's not a good investment. You CAN buy dyes/cloths with fame in the left/right bazaars and in 'Customize character' (the colourwheel icon, top middle area), but you do need to die repeatedly to afford it. Things like character/pet skins and player entrances are permanent cosmetics. you don't lose those after death.\n\nTHE TWO-YEAR LIMIT ACCOUNT PURGE\nDECA established if an account hasn't been active in 2 years or more they delete your account to clean up the database and for security/privacy reasons. Just make sure you log in so your account is considered 'active'. I wouldn't call this a negative in itself, but it's here because you are required to keep your account alive by physically joining the game.\n\nBROKEN STEAM ACHIVEMENTS\nIt hasn't been fixed for years.\n\nCONCLUSION\nNo, I don't recommend this game unless you have plenty of time on your hands & need something to pass the time &/or if you are a masochist.",

Oryxs castle lags for 20 seconds everytime it starts, doesn't matter if there's 3 players or 80 players. Tutorial not updated for the other classes, the game wants you to play wizard but that's no longer the only class available in the beginning.",

Tutorial is non existent and new players should not be expected to look up how to play the game and which discords to join. It's a great game, but only for people who put in hundreds of hours. Plz make a better intro into the game rather then sending new players to fend for themselves and rely on other players to tell them how to play the game....",
