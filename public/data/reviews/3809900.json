I thought it was an indie project but seems like it’s Sulake themselves publishing on Steam. \n\nWell, to me, this was a very good jump back… :) It was around 2006 I started discovering the internet and I met Habbo. \nLot of fun times and good friends, we were just kids. \nEven tho the original sites are still up, this seems like a good version designed for the older users. Logging into Habbo’s site you might find lot of 13 yrs old, which is okay that’s the age we had when we played.\nHere it seems more projected to older people who used to play many years ago! \n\nThere aren’t a lot of users, but this might be better to getting to know people and maybe making some connections. I wouldn’t suggest buying credits and furni… seems kinda stupid 😅 I wouldn’t suggest that for any ppw game.

      "review": "Habbo Hotel: Origins is basically a time machine to that era of the internet where your entire social life fit inside one isometric lobby and saying “ASL?” was a valid opener.\n\nYou log in as a tiny pixel person, enter a hotel, and immediately remember:\n\n* You are underdressed\n* Everyone else has rarer furniture\n* And the chat filter still turns mild words into **bobba**\n\nThere is no combat, no quests, no guns. The gameplay is:\n\n* Walk into room\n* Sit on chair\n* Type\n* Get ignored\n\nPerfectly accurate 2000s simulation.\n\n---\n\n### Pros\n\n* **Weaponized nostalgia**: the UI, the avatars, the furniture, the public rooms—your brain will physically time-travel back to the dial-up era.\n* Endless room possibilities: cafés, nightclubs, mazes, adoption centers, casinos “but not gambling,” police stations run by 13-year-olds—it’s all here.\n* Economy so intense you will learn more about supply & demand here than you ever did in school. “Why is this pixel chair worth three weeks of my life?” is a normal question.\n* Perfect game for alt-tabbing: you just stand there, maybe move three tiles to prove you’re alive, then go back to whatever you were doing.\n* Roleplay is *thriving*: hotel staff, mafia, hospital RP, school RP—everyone is unpaid, overdramatic, and 100% committed.\n\n---\n\n### Cons\n\n* Social anxiety: walking into a full room and seeing 20 people all mid-conversation feels like crashing a party in slow motion.\n* You will spend an hour decorating a room, set the perfect mood, open it to the public… and get *one* visitor who leaves after 4 seconds.\n* Scams never die:\n\n  * “Drop to win!”\n  * “Give rights for prize!”\n  * “Trust trade?”\n    If you fall for them in 2025, that’s on you, champ.\n* Fashion inequality: default clothes make you look like you spawned 30 seconds ago, which, to be fair, you did.\n* You think you’re here “just to look around,” and suddenly it’s 3 a.m. and you’re arguing about virtual couch prices with someone named xXDarkAngelXx.\n\n---\n\n### Peak Habbo Origins Moments\n\n* Getting kicked from a room by a fake “security” user with absolutely no authority but *incredible* power-tripping energy.\n* Typing something mildly spicy and watching it transform into pure **bobba** in real time.\n* Getting stuck in a maze because you stepped on the wrong chair, then pretending you meant to do that.\n* Standing in a nightclub room for 40 minutes doing the same dance loop while talking about nothing—peak MMO experience, no XP required.\n* Logging in “for nostalgia” and accidentally rebuilding your entire teenage personality in 2D pixels.\n\n---\n\n**9/10**\nNot really a game—more like a perfectly preserved fossil of early internet culture you can still walk around in.\n\nWould once again log in, sit on a virtual sofa, type “hey,” get ignored, and somehow have the time of my life again.",

      "review": "So Anyone who grew up in the 1990s or 2000s may recall a bustling virtual world called Habbo Hotel. The MMO featured various \"rooms\" in which players could hang out with one another and socialize, along with customizable guest rooms and user-hosted mini-games. It was truly the peak of computer-simulated social environments, rivaled only by similar chatroom-esque games like Gaia Online and the far less mature Club Penguin.\n\nThe original Habbo Hotel experience was lost as time went on, sadly, tarnished by changes and controversies galore - with developers notably opting to take the game down the NFT route a few years back. That hasn't stopped players of years past from missing the classic Habbo Hotel they engaged with as teens, though - and it looks like developers are well aware of the collective nostalgia.\n\nReviews for Habbo Hotel: Origins are largely positive, especially among returning players who praise its strong focus on nostalgia, the return of classic gameplay mechanics, and a friendly, adult community that fosters genuine social interaction.\nKey Positive Aspects\nNostalgia and Retro Charm: The game is widely celebrated for being a faithful revival of the early 2000s version of Habbo Hotel, providing a powerful \"time machine\" experience for long-time fans. The classic pixel art style and familiar public rooms (like the Habbo Lido and Welcome Lounge) are key draws.\nCommunity-Led & Adult Audience: A significant positive for many users is the adult-oriented player base (the game requires players to be 18+) and community-led governance through in-game polls. This has reportedly resulted in less moderation friction over language and a more mature, welcoming environment where people are genuinely kind to strangers.\nSocial Focus: Players highlight the strong social elements, enjoying the unscripted banter, spontaneous events (like DJ sets, quests, and build-offs), and the ease of making new friends. Many appreciate the departure from modern game mechanics that focus solely on grinding or min-maxing, preferring the simple, fuss-free social experience.\nCreative Freedom: The expanded building tools and a revamped fashion studio are well-received, allowing players to design unique rooms and avatars, from \"cozy lounges\" to \"over-the-top dance floors\".\nAccessibility: The game's availability on platforms like Steam makes it easily accessible for both new and returning players, helping to rebuild a healthy player base.\nPlayer & Critic Quotes\n\"Playing Habbo Hotel: Origins was like taking a time machine back to simpler days... This geriatric millennial was very pleased to revisit the era before 'WASD' navigation, with fuss-free but nevertheless fun gameplay.\"\n\"The community is lovely and keeps me around... It has been great. I love the community feeling. I've even made friends with people in the game\"\n\"Habbo Hotel: Origins, truthfully, feels like stepping into a portal to a time where the internet was wild, anachronistic, and had an entirely different set of ways in which it'd scar unsupervised children for life.\"\n\"It's more than nostalgia. It's a living, breathing community that evolves every season.\"\nOverall, players who were fond of the original Habbo experience find the Origins version to be an authentic and enjoyable revival, successfully blending retro vibes with a few modern tweaks and a refreshingly mature community. Got my Vote. :D",

I just got on for the first time in about 12 years and I was able to win a 21 or bust and got my first piece of furni.",

Logging into Habbo’s site you might find lot of 13 yrs old, which is okay that’s the age we had when we played.\nHere it seems more projected to older people who used to play many years ago! \n\nThere aren’t a lot of users, but this might be better to getting to know people and maybe making some connections.

The gameplay is:\n\n* Walk into room\n* Sit on chair\n* Type\n* Get ignored\n\nPerfectly accurate 2000s simulation.\n\n---\n\n### Pros\n\n* **Weaponized nostalgia**: the UI, the avatars, the furniture, the public rooms—your brain will physically time-travel back to the dial-up era.\n* Endless room possibilities: cafés, nightclubs, mazes, adoption centers, casinos “but not gambling,” police stations run by 13-year-olds—it’s all here.\n* Economy so intense you will learn more about supply & demand here than you ever did in school. “Why is this pixel chair worth three weeks of my life?” is a normal question.\n* Perfect game for alt-tabbing: you just stand there, maybe move three tiles to prove you’re alive, then go back to whatever you were doing.\n* Roleplay is *thriving*: hotel staff, mafia, hospital RP, school RP—everyone is unpaid, overdramatic, and 100% committed.\n\n---\n\n### Cons\n\n* Social anxiety: walking into a full room and seeing 20 people all mid-conversation feels like crashing a party in slow motion.\n* You will spend an hour decorating a room, set the perfect mood, open it to the public… and get *one* visitor who leaves after 4 seconds.\n* Scams never die:\n\n  * “Drop to win!”\n  * “Give rights for prize!”\n  * “Trust trade?”\n    If you fall for them in 2025, that’s on you, champ.\n* Fashion inequality: default clothes make you look like you spawned 30 seconds ago, which, to be fair, you did.\n* You think you’re here “just to look around,” and suddenly it’s 3 a.m. and you’re arguing about virtual couch prices with someone named xXDarkAngelXx.\n\n---\n\n### Peak Habbo Origins Moments\n\n* Getting kicked from a room by a fake “security” user with absolutely no authority but *incredible* power-tripping energy.\n* Typing something mildly spicy and watching it transform into pure **bobba** in real time.\n* Getting stuck in a maze because you stepped on the wrong chair, then pretending you meant to do that.\n* Standing in a nightclub room for 40 minutes doing the same dance loop while talking about nothing—peak MMO experience, no XP required.\n* Logging in “for nostalgia” and accidentally rebuilding your entire teenage personality in 2D pixels.\n\n---\n\n**9/10**\nNot really a game—more like a perfectly preserved fossil of early internet culture you can still walk around in.\n\nWould once again log in, sit on a virtual sofa, type “hey,” get ignored, and somehow have the time of my life again.",

      "review": "So Anyone who grew up in the 1990s or 2000s may recall a bustling virtual world called Habbo Hotel. The MMO featured various \"rooms\" in which players could hang out with one another and socialize, along with customizable guest rooms and user-hosted mini-games. It was truly the peak of computer-simulated social environments, rivaled only by similar chatroom-esque games like Gaia Online and the far less mature Club Penguin.\n\nThe original Habbo Hotel experience was lost as time went on, sadly, tarnished by changes and controversies galore - with developers notably opting to take the game down the NFT route a few years back. That hasn't stopped players of years past from missing the classic Habbo Hotel they engaged with as teens, though - and it looks like developers are well aware of the collective nostalgia.\n\nReviews for Habbo Hotel: Origins are largely positive, especially among returning players who praise its strong focus on nostalgia, the return of classic gameplay mechanics, and a friendly, adult community that fosters genuine social interaction.\nKey Positive Aspects\nNostalgia and Retro Charm: The game is widely celebrated for being a faithful revival of the early 2000s version of Habbo Hotel, providing a powerful \"time machine\" experience for long-time fans. The classic pixel art style and familiar public rooms (like the Habbo Lido and Welcome Lounge) are key draws.\nCommunity-Led & Adult Audience: A significant positive for many users is the adult-oriented player base (the game requires players to be 18+) and community-led governance through in-game polls. This has reportedly resulted in less moderation friction over language and a more mature, welcoming environment where people are genuinely kind to strangers.\nSocial Focus: Players highlight the strong social elements, enjoying the unscripted banter, spontaneous events (like DJ sets, quests, and build-offs), and the ease of making new friends. Many appreciate the departure from modern game mechanics that focus solely on grinding or min-maxing, preferring the simple, fuss-free social experience.\nCreative Freedom: The expanded building tools and a revamped fashion studio are well-received, allowing players to design unique rooms and avatars, from \"cozy lounges\" to \"over-the-top dance floors\".\nAccessibility: The game's availability on platforms like Steam makes it easily accessible for both new and returning players, helping to rebuild a healthy player base.\nPlayer & Critic Quotes\n\"Playing Habbo Hotel: Origins was like taking a time machine back to simpler days... This geriatric millennial was very pleased to revisit the era before 'WASD' navigation, with fuss-free but nevertheless fun gameplay.\"\n\"The community is lovely and keeps me around... It has been great. I love the community feeling. I've even made friends with people in the game\"\n\"Habbo Hotel: Origins, truthfully, feels like stepping into a portal to a time where the internet was wild, anachronistic, and had an entirely different set of ways in which it'd scar unsupervised children for life.\"\n\"It's more than nostalgia. It's a living, breathing community that evolves every season.\"\nOverall, players who were fond of the original Habbo experience find the Origins version to be an authentic and enjoyable revival, successfully blending retro vibes with a few modern tweaks and a refreshingly mature community.

Most have dropped off after the hype died down, but I still remain in hopes one day the word spreads around, and more people join. I see potential in Origins and they can count on my continued support given they course-correct.\"[/i]\n\nThose were the opening words to one of my very long and thought-out feedback posts on the Origins Discord which got no response, and evidently wasn't taken to heart. I take no pleasure in saying this but I sit here now 1 year later looking back on Origins downfall with a smile on my face. The only people who are actively playing nowadays are the deluded Community Staff who desperately cling on to their rank, and their NPC friends who drove the game into the ground with their dogsh*t ideas and suggestions, which deviated so much from what Habbo is, that Origins now has Runescape-esque skills you can level up -- and that's not even an exaggeration.\n\nI was there on day 1, and the signs were already showing back then. The Devs and their paypiggies were in such a rush to push the game in a new direction, completely ignoring the \"Origins\" title and the promises that came with that.. It's clear to me now that Origins [u]never[/u] had any interest in giving you an authentic nostalgic tour around a 2000's era Habbo. Originally released as a passion project from a Sulake Employee who wanted to bring back the [i]Origins[/i] of Habbo -- it is already looking like an amalgamation of Legacy and a bootleg retro hotel only 1 year later, what a total joke dude. Sulake must suck the soul out of everything with their greed, we were all fools to think this would be any different.\n\nAfter this Steam release, I am now aware of the fact that reasonable people actually did exist, and that their Discord was just one giant echo-chamber, where any opposing opinion was silenced and hidden away from the hivemind. I hope the public stain that is your dear game's review score serves as a wakeup call, though somehow I doubt it.\n\nLet the coping ensue.",

However, that faded quickly as the developers’ incompetence became glaringly obvious. Each update introduces a slew of bugs and glitches, making the game frustrating to play. Their handling of competitions is equally problematic—mid-event rule changes and a complete lack of transparency in judging build, art, and creative contests leave players feeling cheated.\r\n\r\nThe developers also fail to handle community feedback effectively. They cater to the loudest complainers on the official Discord, appeasing those who demand everything for free. Not every item needs to be accessible to everyone, but their failure to establish varied rarity values for items from the start has wrecked the in-game economy, with every item holding roughly the same value. It took them a full year to even attempt addressing the broken trading system.\r\n\r\nWorst of all is their handling of gambling mechanics. Bringing back the game with gambling elements, they ignored the fact that many returning players—now 25-30+ years old with disposable income—would pour money into it. For five months, the devs turned a blind eye, profiting off this cash grab while players funded their lavish vacations. Only then did they crack down, rug-pulling the majority of the player base. While gambling licenses are complex, their negligence feels like a deliberate money-making scheme. \r\n\r\nI could go on about their incompetence, but I’ll stop here.

There are zero free goodies or incentives given to new players to invest in the game or community. The rares release weekly and so players there from the start have all of the interesting rares, and tonnes of them, so the economy is already an in-group out-group situation. \nThe game is just, sad. If Sulake had monetized this better and made it more simple and fun for new people to onboard, it could have been fun. They really don't seem to understand as a company that: having a large player base > having a small community of whales.",

Make sure your game is set to use the Habbo Hotel Origins XL client.
