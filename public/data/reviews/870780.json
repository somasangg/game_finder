On Point.[/h3]\n[hr][/hr]\nDon’t mind my hours on Steam - I already finished this on console but haven’t started breaking physics on PC yet.\n\nThis game is an absolute wild ride. The atmosphere? Creepy, stylish, and borderline hypnotic. The sound design? So good it could wake [i]THE HISS[/i] itself. The visuals? I spent a solid chunk of time just staring at reflections and floating debris like a mesmerized intern.\n\nGameplay’s buttery smooth - nothing beats the joy of weaponized telekinesis by turning every piece of office supplies and furniture into guided missiles. The story, though? I think I was fixing reality… or possibly destroying it? Honestly, I had no freaking clue what the heck was going on, but I was too busy feeling powerful to even care anymore after a certain point.\n\nThe DLCs crank up the weirdness and dive deeper into the [i] Remedy's Connected Universe[/i], tossing in some cool [b]Alan Wake[/b] nods - or at least that’s the one reference I actually caught before the cosmic confusion kicked in again. \n\nIt’s stylish, chaotic, and delightfully weird in all the right ways. If you enjoy hurling things at supernatural horrors while questioning your sanity, [b]Control: Ultimate Edition[/b] is absolutely worth your time - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n[hr][/hr]",

      "review": "Control: Ultimate Edition honestly surprised me with how quickly it grabbed my attention. You play as Jesse Faden, who arrives at the Federal Bureau of Control looking for answers about her brother. Within minutes you are thrown into a strange situation inside a building that seems to have a mind of its own. Half the time you’re not even sure what is real, but it works in a way that keeps you curious. The story is genuinely interesting and it constantly pushes you to find out more.\nWhat I really enjoyed was how the game connects to Alan Wake. It’s not just a small reference or two. It really feels like Remedy is building one big shared universe. If you’ve played Alan Wake before, you’ll recognize a lot of things that make the connection feel meaningful. The DLC builds on this even more.\nAnother thing Control does really well is world-building through all the reports, notes, tapes and weird case files you discover while exploring. There are a lot of them, and they explain paranormal events, secret experiments and the history of the Bureau. They add a lot of depth to the world. If you like digging through lore, you’ll love this part of the game.\nThe gameplay feels great too. It is a mix of gunplay and supernatural abilities like telekinesis and levitation. Fights look chaotic in a good way because almost everything can break apart or be used as a weapon. It really makes you feel strong. The upgrade system is kinda mediocre and it could definitely be better.\nTLDR: This game is very easy to recommend to anyone who likes story-driven games with a mysterious atmosphere and lots of secrets to uncover. Since this version includes all the DLC, you get the full experience from the start. It’s the kind of game that stays in your head even after you finish it. I am really looking forward to playing Control 2 in the future.\n\n[h2] Pros: [/h2]\n- Phenomenal story\n- Creative combat\n- Impressive visuals\n- Rich lore and storytelling\n- Well-written characters\n\n[h2] Cons: [/h2]\n- Mediocre upgrade system\n- Spatial orientation may be difficult for some players.\n\n[h1] Overall rating: 9/10 [/h1]",

The brutalist architecture and the surreal patterns reminiscent of The Shining or Twin Peaks are a visual splendor. I adore the eeriness of some areas; the Oceanview Motel is my personal favorite. The gameplay itself is good; it's satisfying enough to be engaged, though it might feel repetitive after a while. I like the Metroidvania-ish setup of the world; it flows nicely enough, though it can be confusing sometimes. The story is good, though the world-building is much more interesting for me. Of course, I love the performance of the late James McCaffrey. He brings such reverence to the director, and complemented with the dialogue, it is so reminiscent of the OG Max Payne. Also, to note, there is a certain mission near the end that is just absolutely amazing. You'll know what it is.\r\n\r\nAWE DLC - 7/10\r\nThe Foundation DLC - 8/10\r\nOverall Game - 8/10!! \r\n\r\nI recommend it!!",

      "review": "I spent a long weekend playing Control... a total of 27 hours for the Story plus a LOT of Side Quests and collectables... and my honest opinion is that it is an incredible game.\r\n\r\nThe story is very clever, and has just the right amount of twistedness and creepiness... and for me the delivery and pacing is brilliant. I was so captivated, I just wanted to keep playing. But besides the main story, there are a good amount of side quests.. and later on you unlock \"Bureau Alert\" radiant quests too.\r\n\r\nThe game does focus heavily on the combat aspect... but I felt it really kept things interesting, with the introduction of new enemies and in particular the way it handles weapons.. in so many games (particularly looter shooters) you have to dredge through so many different weapons to find the perfect combination of type and bonuses... but Control gives you (heh) control over your weapons.. you gradually unlock different types, but they are all forms of the same basic weapon and you can easily switch between them in your inventory... and you can load them out with up to 3 mods each. I love the weapon names too.. Grip (pistol type), Shatter (shotgun type) and Spin (SMG type) to name just 3. I also love the fact that ammo is unlimited, you just have to wait a little for it to recharge.. but you can be doing other stuff in combat instead... \r\n\r\nWhich brings me on to the other thing that constantly keeps combat fresh which are the powers you unlock as the game progresses.. for example the telekinetic power that allows you to grab and launch objects.. so you seemlessly switch between shooting enemies to flinging objects at them, Darth Vader style.. There are other powers too, which I don't want to spoil. You can also put ability points into the various powers, or into health and energy, to compliment your playing style. I had a lot in the telekinetic ability.. but also some in other areas.\r\n\r\nControl uses a save point system.. which is something I'm not normally a fan of (I prefer games that just let me save anywhere, so I can avoid things like: re-watching cut-scenes; long walks back to where I had died; or frustrating parkour areas)... but I actually felt Control's system worked really well... save points were frequent enough, sensibly located, and also acted as a fast travel system.. The game also saved my progress through areas.. so even if I didn't find another save point, when I inevitably died and had to respawn, I had not lost all of the progress I had made.\r\n\r\nOverall... two thumbs up from me. I really enjoyed it and will now go and play the DLC.",

      "review": "I finally got around to finishing Control after playing through the first Alan Wake for the 4th or 5th time, and then finishing Alan Wake 2 very recently, as my new PC was able to properly run the game. After that, I started in Control, and as mentioned, finally finished the game. I started this game twice in the past, once on my Xbox and again on my PS5, but never finished either playthrough. That's not to say Control is a bad game. It is very far from it. But getting through the game to the end, including finishing both DLCs, I very much enjoyed Control. This is pretty much Remedy Entertainment's rendition of the SCP universe. From the vibes, altered items, objects of power, and also the Backrooms' inspiration of the Oldest House. The combat is fun and very fluid. Jesse's throw ability is a ton of fun to use, especially when you fully upgrade it to pick up bigger objects and hold three objects at the same time. It makes some fights, including boss fights, trivial because of the damage it can do. The Service weapon and its different forms are fun to use as well, but I did find myself sticking to using just the Grip, and switching to another form to, well, switch things up a bit. Graphically, Control is a very good-looking game. However, I have run into an issue a few times at certain parts of the game where the fps just plummets for really no good reason, as my PC can run this game perfectly on ultra settings till I get to those aforementioned parts of the game. I also want to point out that putting the texture resolution to max causes the game to have blurry textures. It does load in the textures eventually, and they look amazing, but it is best to keep this setting at ultra or whatever settings your pc can handle. I found out it has something to do with texture streaming, and that a mod can fix it, but I honestly didn't bother. The ultra setting still looks great. As for characters, some are more memorable than others, like Jesse, Emily, Ahti, Trench (because of Max Payne), and, of course, Doctor Darling. Regardless, everyone is well-acted, and I enjoy the conversations from the dialogue. It definitely pulls you in as learning about the Oldest House and its quirks; it is very interesting along with finding the various documents that provide more lore. And truth be told, I like that I played Alan Wake 2 before Control, as it was really cool to see the parallel events between both games, and those \"OHHHHH\" moments. Really, the biggest issues I have with this game, besides the fps drops at certain moments of the game, are with the way levitation works. To keep ascending, you have to hold down the button/key that initiates levitation. Letting go and holding the button/key after simply makes you descend, and it has messed up a few of my jumps. Oh, and those flying enemies that dodge the stuff you throw at them. Those are annoying enemies. I would also say the map can be confusing, but honestly, you quickly get used to it, and it's not too bad. The music for Control is great, too. Remedy has a thing for making awesome music in their games. Do I recommend getting Control at $40 price? Honestly, yeah! It comes with two DLCs, which provide more content on top of the base game. I am really excited to play Control 2 and see how much more they expand on the Control universe. It is also very likely that we are going to get a third Alan Wake game, but we shall see! 8.5/10!!! I think Jesse is pretty hot redhead!",

      "review": "I think Control is worth playing but only at a steep discount (I paid $3.59 USD) as it does have some pretty annoying flaws. I finished the main story for the game (no side missions or anything after the final chapter) in just over 6 hours. The gunplay is decent and the powers are pretty fun to use. The story is interesting but the ending is kind of mediocre and not that satisfying.\n\nWhile Control is worth your time it has some baffling flaws that make absolutely no sense to me in the landscape of modern games. Gameplay wise you almost always feel quite weak unless you're fighting the lamest enemies. You don't have enough energy (even after leveling it up) or ability to throw large objects unless you do enough side missions. If you just play through the story the ending is a bit of a slog due to being quite weak and enemies take a long time to kill.\n\nEnemy variety is low. I think there are less than 15 total enemies and many of the bosses are enemies that become common later which is something I despise. I don't understand why so many AA and AAA games over the past 8 or so years have had so few enemies. It's boring to fight the same enemies over and over and making them more powerful via various mechanics instead of giving us more interesting things to fight is quite a letdown.\n\nThere is a lot of lore in this game and weirdly Remedy made a significant amount of video content but decided that watching that and exploring the lore and documents/logs should be as tedious as possible. You started a video? It is only on that TV/projector and doesn't follow you meaning you have to wait around while it runs. You started an audio log? It only plays within a small vicinity of the tape player. You picked up a document? It doesn't read you the document as you play the game, you have to hold a button to go in to a menu then read it. Why? For the sake of continuity in the universe? This is a lame reason. Play the video in the corner of my screen, make the audio log follow me (I mean let me pick it up with my psy powers if that's what it takes, I don't care!), READ the documents to me via internal monologue so I can keep playing the game while I explore the lore or even let them take up half the screen while I keep playing, anything! This was such an easy thing to make really enjoyable yet they chose not to do so and I don't understand why. Instead it makes exploring the lore tedious and annoying for no reason.\n\nThe \"mod\" system is also awful. I can't remember if it was a trend back in 2020 that every game needed a crafting system but man does the crafting here suck. Not only is it not fun and not very rewarding (wow +X% of a stat, how fun!) it's also tedious. Getting crafting materials is done through killing enemies or finding them in crates. I only unlocked 3 weapons during my story playthrough and only got to upgrade one of them! You can also craft more mods (which enemies drop for some reason so you have to interact with the system even less) from the various currencies but the mods aren't static, nor do you get a sense of accomplishment because you're leveling up a specific mod that suits your playstyle. Instead you have a system that crafts different levels of mods, and to get those higher level mods you have to upgrade the crafting system itself. It's a baffling and pointless system. Why can't I just upgrade what I want? On top of this you only get 3 mods per weapon (if you even level them up that far, I only got 2 mods on one weapon), and up to 3 mods on yourself (again you need to unlock this, I only had 2) so they don't even impact gameplay significantly. I basically never engaged with this past crafting more guns and eagerly checking to see if I could upgrade them only to be met with disappointment every time because I didn't have some random crafting material I had no idea how to get.\n\nThe map is terrible, there's nothing more to say in this regard.\n\nI'm going to mark this review as recommended because I did have some fun, it's a relatively short game, and they tried something a bit different here with the style and story but only at an extremely steep discount as the game has many flaws and dumb systems that actively detract. Remedy is so close to making a really fun game that is also smooth to interact with and play but they keep messing it up. Control is the closest they have gotten so far and I hope they keep trying and don't get stuck in the weeds like they have here and in the past.",

      "review": "Another one of those \"greats\" that I was several years late in playing.  This is a phenomenal game so far, and I'm only a few hours in.  I did kind of misunderstand this game though, which is part of why it took so long to play it... let's see if I can help clear that up for anybody that may be on the fence.\n\nThis is primarily a 3rd person shooter, but not a horde shooter.  Enemies can swarm a little bit, but by and large you are fighting small groups or bosses.  It's also got some fun telekinetics thrown in that work really well.  There isn't much of a cover system here, so it's primarily about move/shoot.  The action is good.  It's not earth shattering by any means... but it's solid.\n\nWhere this game really shines is the story and the protagonist.  The voice acting and cutscene graphics here are really astounding.  Jesse Faden (main character) looks and sounds incredible.  The facial expressions, intonations, everything just pulls together so, so well.  You learn more about Jesse as you go through the game, uncovering layers of her persona and history.  The other characters as well are all so well done... the VA's and animators really knocked this out of the park.\n\nThe story of the game is sci-fi, but in much more of an \"inter-dimensional\" sense than technological sense.  This game revolves around some very bizarre interdimensional interactions and concepts that are so fun to learn about as you go, though they can come off as a bit... confusing at first.   Just stick with it, it's meant to play out that way.  If you like odd, reality bending, physics defying horror then this is really going to be up your alley.\n\nAt the end of the day, this game relies upon immersion and the player getting into the story.  If you are just coming for action, you'd be better off with Space Marine 2 or something.  This game brings an incredible story, tension, and narrative that will keep you up at night if you let it.\n\nWholeheartedly recommend for people who like some action, some challenge, and lots of immersion into the narrative.",

The storyline is great, it’s veigue-ish, but after collecting everything, I feel confident in my understanding of it. The game and its combat can be frustrating at times, many times, if you are as unskilled as I am, but even so much as the promise of that satisfying boom on the screen when you enter a new area is more than enough to keep me moving. \r\n\r\nOne thing I want to express is that I’m a completionist at heart, and one of the things I appreciate most about this game is, as someone who appreciates a challenge but is more engaged by lore and story (collectables, achievements, etc.), that the developers don’t punish you for being less interested in the combat portion. When I’m just trying to get a last achievement or collectible, I really love how the devs urge me to play the challenge, but allow me the ability to turn on things like 1 hit kill or immortality if I am becoming frustrated or bored, without penalizing me by disabling achievements on my save, for example. It means that, even though I don’t use it often, I am allowed to enjoy the many aspects of this game without being weighed down by an onslaught of monsters when I’m just not feeling it. At the end of the day, if not for allowances like those, I would not have found nearly the immense level of enjoyment that I have in this game, and I think that that’s what's really important.\r\n\r\nAnd NONE of this is to even touch on the jaw-dropping visuals which have my artist brain spiraling into a pit of awe and inspiration every time in step foot into this somehow beautiful yet imposing brutalist monument to color and architecture.\r\n\r\nTLDR: If you enjoy shooters, Lovecraftian horrors, SCP, lore-heavy games, or any of this studio's other games, this is an excellent pick that I would highly recommend.",

I saw the fridge thingy YEARS ago and I had it in the back of my mind SINCE. I cannot find the video and I never knew what happened because the video didnt tell me and I was too lazy to go look for the answer. A little spoiler, theres just a dimension with a big ass monster inside the fridge that sucked up the guy inside when you both stopped looking at it. And no, the fridge doesn't insta kill you if you look away, it just damages you slowly. Sorry for yapping LOL, genuinely a fun and interesting game, I cannot stress this enough how interesting it is.\n\nNot to mention, THERE IS 1 ending and it's genuinely exactly what I want and I love!!!! I love the game Prey, the multiple endings and games that dont have a set/canon ending just dont feel right to me, but this game!!!!!! This game! has a genuine canon ending and you just continue playing in the place you played through the entire game after you complete the game, the npcs are still alive and very much interactible, it's so lively and cool how after you finish the ending, it's all about restoring back the berau to its former condition, without the Hiss.\n\nThe dlc and expansion are just, \"additional\" content. for example, the dlc is just a new area of the berau where you can freely go and do it anytime you want, and I have to say, YES, THE DLC IS WORTH IT. IT WAS GENUINELY SOOOOO COOL AND SO FUN, and scary, for me atleast. I cannot handle any kind of horror LOL, I'm even scared of going mining in minecraft at my big age. But I sucked it up and played the game from start to finish and I don't regret a single second of it. The dlc is genuinely good and you can play it I think around the 60 % mark of the game because you unlock like one of the many areas of the Berau that has an elevator that brings you DEEPER down to this place where the dlc story entales and ohhh man, scary and cool asf. You have to try it out.\n\nAbout the expansion, damn, genuinely no words other that DAMN. Not only is it harder than the original content but it just continues the story, it just CONTINUES THE STORY WHICH I LOVE. LIKE- After removing the Hiss you go to its SOURCE, the ROOT of it. Like I genuinely cannot express how cool of a game this is, maybe it's just to me but continuing this story after having a SINGLE canon ending is all I ever asked for and I LOVE IT. Multiple endings games are okay!! They're cool but this game is exactly what I was searching and YEARNING for! Also I love the way its harder, it requires more skill and everything upgraded and unlocked. \n\nOne thing I forgotttttt to mention is side stories, oh my goddd. Not only do you have the main story but side missions and projects are genuinely GOLDDD. You just learn more and more about this... this place! And what stuff is going on, like, the plant and fungus area, I loved AND HATED it, the monsters were such a pain to deal LOL, especially the random ass boss??? LOL but I genuinely loved it and I cannot reccomend enough of this game. I'm on a mission to get all achievements, most likely will soon. :]\n\nI love and reccomend the game wholeheartedly!",

      "review": "I went into this game far more blind than most. I have vague recollections of every tech channel a few years ago using this as their benchmark for things like DLSS and graphics cards. but I had no clue what it was beyond being a third person shooter with a hot redhead main character. well now I know, and I have to say it's a LOT more than just that. \n\nthe gameplay is certainly a third person shooter. but what's not obvious at first is that it's also a metroidvania. and kind of a superhero game. and it has light RPG elements. and the funny thing is that it combines all of these elements in a way that's so seamless you have to stop and think before you realize that's what it is. I myself didn't realize it was a metroidvania until a few hours in. \n\nthe setting is also incredibly unique and interesting- although it does have one very, very obvious comparison in that of the SCP foundation. both are centered around organizations that research paranormal items imbued with strange effects. one thing SCP doesn't have though is that \"binding\" yourself to these items gives you supernatural powers. that's where the superhero game comes in. as to not spoil anything, I'll simply say that the very first power you get is being able to throw things fast and hard like you're the guy from prototype or the hulk in ultimate destruction. the later powers give even more obvious comparisons to superhero games. there's also a ton of environmental storytelling that you might not notice at first glance. the previous-previous director northmoor's fate is classified and never brought up directly, but you can figure it out entirely through in-game environmental clues if you look hard enough. \n\nsome things I don't like about this game is 1: the early game when you have very little choice in the way of weapons or powers is kind of boring, and I was thinking at first that I might not enjoy it much. boy am I glad I kept playing. and 2: the optional content like the expeditions or arcade machine challenges are overtuned so as to be a nightmare to play on standard difficulty, and the rewards you get for playing through them don't amount to much in the face of the effort and time needed. you get ONE optional costume per doing *everything* in a challenge mode. that's it. and for 100%ing the game you get... a 1 second cutscene that adds nothing. I won't even count that as a spoiler because there's nothing to spoil! \n\nspeaking of standard difficulty settings though, that's another thing this game does well. you get all sorts of difficulty options that let you tweak your experience, up to and including turning on invincibility or a one hit KO mode. the thing that impresses me the most is the slider in the options menu that lets you control how much damage enemies do. that's the kind of thing that should be standard in most games. \n\nthe amount of freedom offered to the player in this game is downright applause-worthy. although that can be a double edged sword. some boss fights I struggled with that others downed easy, and some I downed in seconds that others took days to beat. it's entirely possible to create a build that's good enough for everything except one particular challenge and then never realize that's the problem because it's never a problem before or after that. I suppose that's a natural byproduct of a system where you have six weapons (though only two weapon slots), five superpowers, and \"mods\" you can pick up that do so, so many different things, letting you alter your playstyle in a practically infinite amount of ways. \n\nif you are a fan of third person shooter metroidvania games with supernatural elements recommending this is a no-brainer. I might even play through it again in the future- but if I do, I'm still not playing through all the expeditions. that's such a slog.",

Remedy’s world-building and signature storytelling are front and center, and the game’s visuals, atmospheric presentation, and responsive mechanics set a new bar for third-person action adventures. The variety of supernatural abilities and the transforming Service Weapon offer a thrilling toolkit for combat, making many encounters both intense and satisfying.\n\nHowever, after the initial hours, the game reveals its main weakness: repetition. Despite its narrative intrigue and unique setting, the missions and combat scenarios become formulaic, with similar enemy waves and objectives repeating throughout—especially in the latter half. The intriguing mystery that pulls you in eventually starts to drag, with backtracking and filler overshadowing what could have been a tighter, more engaging conclusion.\n\nIn summary: Control is an audiovisual and technical showcase with some of the finest atmosphere in the genre, but its tendency towards repetitive and dragged-out scenarios holds it back from true greatness. Worth playing for its strengths, but expect some fatigue as you push towards the end.",

      "review": "Finished Control. It was an okay game. In the beginning, I was really into the mystery of what the game was teasing. Giving me little snippets of information through the collectables was fun and I loved reading and watching all of them. Toward the middle of the game, they started to answer some of my questions about the Bureau and the world that the game inhabited. This intrigued me further because I had come up with some of the answers on my own based on the documents that I picked up and read. At the end, it was kinda of a neat twist that they set up. Honestly would love a game set in this world but you just go around and contain objects of power throughout America. Characters were really interesting at the start. Loved the main character, even when she was corny af, at the start. Many of the supporting cast were interesting enough for me to want to know more. But toward the end of the game, I just gave up on caring about them. No real character development from most of the characters you meet. I can count on one hand the amount of characters that had some sort of arc in the game and that includes the main character. Now I'm not expecting them to write BG3 levels of character establishment in a ~20 hour experience but I would like to see at least some motivation from them. All it boils down to is, \"We need to get these Hiss out of here\" and thats it. One thing I really liked about the game was the gameplay. Man it was FUN to use abilities. Mostly the launch ability where I can pickup objects and throw them around. This could also be in conjunction with just how awesome the physics system is. I could grab a piece of stone off the wall and the rubble could fall and do damage to someone standing under it. I could pull objects through wood and rather than just destroying it, it made like a little Looney Toons hole in it. I mean I haven't seen a physics engine that good since Bad Company 2. It was that good. Surprisingly while this game was one of the shortest I've played, it felt like it took me forever to finish it. I don't know if its bad pacing or if it was bloat but it felt like a long time. And even though it was short, this is one of my longest reviews I've written this year. Unfortunately while I did like the game, I really don't feel like playing the DLC. I think I was just ready to move on to something else toward the end. All in all, I think I'd give Control an 8/10.

      "review": "Recently, I’ve found myself drawn to strange tales and supernatural elements—things like the Backrooms or SCPs. Oddly enough, most fan-made games in this genre don’t really hold my interest for long. That’s why I ended up returning to this game, which I first encountered briefly back in 2020, and decided to give it a proper playthrough.\n\nWhen I started the game this time, the gentle tutorial and relaxed early pacing unexpectedly pulled my thoughts elsewhere—to time itself. In 2020, I was just a college freshman, facing a future full of excitement and possibility. Now, as I’m about to finish my master’s degree,I can’t help but feel how quickly the years have slipped away. What hits me even harder is realizing that the college kid who could spend entire evenings getting lost in a game now has to think twice before starting one—because time and energy aren’t things I can throw around so freely anymore.\n\nI didn’t keep playing back then because the beginning felt too monotonous. But now, revisiting it, I find it surprisingly aligned with the SCP-like experiences I enjoy—while still carrying that unmistakable Remedy atmosphere. Overall, I’d rank it somewhere between a masterpiece and an epic.\n\nAs for the gameplay, I’ll keep it brief. The progression, narrative, and visuals occasionally remind me of something Zelda-like, and the world is incredibly imaginative. I’d call it a hidden gem. At the same time, the game does follow a very “formulaic” structure—by which I mean it sticks to well-established patterns. That isn’t praise, but it does make the game solid and reliable, even if not groundbreaking.\n\nOne thing I personally love is the interior architecture. I’ve never been abroad, so the only place I’ve seen similarly vast and uniquely geometric spaces is Beijing. That style appeals to me a lot, and because of that, I didn’t experience aesthetic fatigue early on. But if players aren’t fond of prolonged indoor environments, visual fatigue might set in sooner.\n\nOf course, the game has its flaws. The model of the female protagonist looks very different from the real-life actress. She’s genuinely beautiful in person, but the in-game version makes her look noticeably older.\n\nStill, I strongly recommend this game. It’s a solid AAA title with supernatural themes, polished design, and a distinctive atmosphere. Definitely worth playing.",

The environment of the game lacks colour and that's what makes it so immersive, you're in this corporate industrial building for the entire game with reflections in every corner. The story was confusing, trust me I tried my best to understand it but I guess I'm just too dumb for it. The cutscenes and dialogues could've been better ngl, most dialogues were cheesy and felt out of place. My biggest complaint with the game is the navigation system, you'll spend HOURS just to get to the places you need to go. There are signs directing you to rooms but even then you'll get lost half the time. The puzzles were fun and interesting too. The AWE DLC was fun too, brought a sort of horror element to the game. Foundation? Not so much. I freaking hated those overpowered Hiss sharpened who could run as fast as light and even teleport but eh, it was challenging to face a lot of enemies at once. Last but not least, The Ashtray Maze. Just for that alone you should buy this game, God how much I loved that sequence. Definitely the most memorable part of the game. Good job Remedy!",

Mixed feelings on the actual gameplay and story. However, the pen-ultimate fight (where you need to [spoiler]cleanse the tethers[/spoiler]) was touching, and the DLCs fix quite a few problems of the main game. So thumbs up it is.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n\n- The overall scenario of Control is reminiscent of one of the better X-Files epsiodes (i.e. eerie and enigmatic), but the actual in-game missions, events and items remind me of a particularly bad X-Factor offering (i.e. awkward and forced). The core storyline even is almost... mundane, which is a feat on its own. \n\n- For me, the main cast (both Fadens, Pope, Marshall, Underhill) came across as unendearing---as if they'd been introduced to secure government funding. The uncanny, wooden facial animations and the emotionless voice acting didn't help, neither did the stiff dialogue lines. The only character I could relate with was the one without any dialogue at all. As things are, I'd rather have played a game about Trench and Darling, they at least had some sort of dynamic going on.\n\n- Combat in Control isn't bad, but tedious and repetitive: At large, you encounter but a handful of same-looking, mostly human enemy types that arrive in neverending waves you need to dispatch to progress. There's minor differences in how you handle different enemies, but that grows old soon. In theory, you have multiple weapons at your disposal. All of these, however, deal similarly low amounts of damage (a full magazine for one trash mob) and are vastly outclassed by telekinetically thrown rocks. Enemies can't even properly hurt you unless you stand still---while then, one unfortunate hit may well take you out.\n\n- Control does not know how to reward you. Rewards (e.g. for missions, backtracking or secrets) mostly consist of boring, numerical upgrades (e.g. plus 5 percent damage) or ability points---which you can use to buy even more numerical upgrades. Control indubitably has the most uninspired skill tree and equipment catalogue I have ever seen.\n\n- The background soundtrack consists mostly of stereotypical and monotonous synth drones and drums. I couldn't even tell what region which \"song\" belongs to. The tracks by real-life bands are great, though.",

Aqui vai o que achei sobre o jogo:\n\nA história é muito original e interessante, porém exige do jogador um certo grau de atenção para conseguir entender a história de forma clara. O lance de misturar sobrenatural com método científico realmente me prendeu e me deixou interessado durante todo o jogo. A opção de usar atores reais nas gravações explicando os fenômenos que o departamento investiga também é um ponto positivo e deixa a história ainda mais imersiva.\n\nA protagonista e outros personagens são carismáticos (a maioria, pelo menos). Gostei muito de como a história foi concluída.\n\nAs missões principais são boas e têm uma boa duração. As secundárias (mesmo as do faxineiro) também acrescentam à lore do jogo e dão recompensas bacanas, incentivando o jogador a cumpri-las.\n\nAs DLCs também são ótimas e complementam bem o universo do jogo. A DLC do setor de investigação também traz muito conteúdo interessante sobre outros casos que o departamento esteve envolvido. A DLC da Fundação traz muita informação sobre os primeiros dias do departamento dentro da Antiga Casa e mais detalhes sobre o Conselho.\n\nOs gráficos são bons, mas não são revolucionários. O jogo se passa todo dentro do prédio do departamento, então a maioria dos cenários é acinzentada (o que é esperado de um prédio). Embora isso não tenha me incomodado, pode se tornar cansativo para algumas pessoas.\n\nA gameplay é bem fluida e divertida. Os poderes da protagonista são de longe os mais divertidos e ajudam muito durante o combate. O nível de dificuldade também é coerente.\n\nA parte sonora também é muito boa, com destaque para a cena do Cinzeiro. As demais músicas também são boas e ajudam a manter a imersão.\n\nUm dos poucos pontos negativos que encontrei é o mapa, já que muitas vezes é confuso distinguir andares diferentes e saber como ir de um andar para o outro.\n\nNota: 9/10",

      "review": "This was a good game but it felt very short. The story was okay but I admit it likely would have been harder to piece together without reading some of the files laying around. There is quite a bit of reading you'd have to do. This game kind of makes me think of SCP because of the objects with strange abilities. There was a lot of weirdness and I enjoyed that aspect. When the pieces fall together and the answers are given it takes a lot of the mystic out.\n\nThe game play was fun and often very challenging. I really liked Jesse Faden, the main character. I really hope I get to see Jesse Faden in the future again. This game comes with two DLCs and I didn't immediately notice I was playing the DLC. The only DLC that definetly feels like DLC is the Alan Wake one. I can't say that I really cared too much about the Alan Wake DLC but I've never played Alan Wake. The Alan Wake boss is hands down THE worst boss in the game. Which is funny cos its a DLC boss.\n\nI was kind of disappointed in the way the game ended. It felt sort of abrupt. I didn't even know I was at the ending until it was over. I was expecting more of a challenge out of the ending since the Alan Wake boss was such a pain in the ass. However there wasn't really an end game boss? There were a lot of enemies but nothing I hadn't mowed over in the past. \n\nGenerally It's a good game but it did feel like there was a lot left to be desired. I felt like it was reading a short story that doesn't come to a final conclusion. I didn't hate the ending, I was happy for Jesse Faden's arch as a whole. For someone who's thrown into the deep end of a swimming pool really abruptly she takes so much in stride. She thrives and I'm happy for her story and character. She isn't a compelling character by any means but generally a decent vehicle for the story to be told. \n\nWould I recommend this game? If you have some spare time and are looking for something to do. If you skip the DLC this is a fairly quick game to be honest.",

As a usual Remedy fare you get a bunch of overproduced short films, a ton of well-written notes, a banger song and a complicated story you have to unravel. This game also has a reputaion for being \"SCP coded\", and it is true, speaking as SCP fan. If you like reading documents this story is absolutely must play. If you dont, which I really have to assume you are, then it is a much tougher sell. One advice I can give to anyone interested - skip the filler. There would be misions/side activities that feel like filler - skip them. You may think they lead to somethiong cool - they dont.

I like some of the actors, especially the head researcher. But a lot of the \"audio logs\" are cutscenes, many over a minute long, showing an actor going through the same few motions. And even real audiologs can only be heard if you stand near the player, and replaying them means you stand there with the game frozen. The story is weak and doesn't make much sense. And like Alan Wake's \"Dark Presence,\" the opposing force has a dumb name: The Hiss. \n\nThere were a few highlights. Some of the puzzles to reclaim the \"altered items\" were pretty fun.

And then somewhere between the 10- and 15-hour mark, something went horribly wrong. Suddenly -as if the developers switched out the team for all new members- the gameplay shifted from story-driven with a gradual incline of difficulty, to a shoot-em-up action game where you were forced to spend time perfecting mechanics so that the 30th time you went through the same boss fight, you might hit just the right combo to get through the 150 minions and defeat the absurdly difficult boss. \r\nIt's a drastic change that occurs over a fairly short period of time. The elements of the early game entice lore-lovers and the type of gamer who uses his screen time to blow off steam after work. Then the turning point completely alienates those same people. If you aren't a hardcore button-mashing, combo-breaking, competitive perfectionist, you will quickly become frustrated in the game after about 10 hours of gameplay.\r\nBecause of this, this has been an incredibly disappointing game. I don't foresee myself finishing it. And that's a shame, because I've become quite invested in the storyline. I want to know what happens to Jesse. I have an emotional attachment to these characters, but because I have far less interest in wading through waves and waves of minions and projecting unreasonably difficult boss battles than I do searching for clue and fighting well-designed battles at an appropriate pace, I will never get the resolution I crave. \r\nThe developers lost track of what this game started as, and as a result, it finished as something completely different.",

The movement and controls are clunky, but not so much that its in the way all the time, only enough to be annoying occasionally. The weapons feel anemic to fire and use, with enemies being bullet sponges and your gun being just inaccurate enough to make you want to pull all of your hair out. Not to mention how fragile the MC is, where it feels like harsh words and an angry glare would cause her to keel over. You can actually see them try to compensate for this by giving the MC resistance to being 1-shot if you are above a certain threshold of HP, leaving you with 1 HP. It is very reminiscent of Alan Wake 1, where that game also had far too much combat when the combat never felt good in the first place. The combat “just exists” as a gameplay obstacle to pad out the time, since it is never actually fun.\r\n\r\nThat’s the thing about Remedy games. They have a certain feel to them, where they have creative and interesting writing and worlds, but the actual game part feels… off. Even Alan Wake 2, though the gameplay and feel of the combat is improved, it still has that weird feeling that there is something just… off… about it. Given that the combat never feels good, it really mutes and ruins the rest of the game I feel, since they shoved SO MUCH COMBAT in the game. The FBC seems to have as many security personnel as a small nation’s army, all within the walls of a single complex. This was also a problem with Alan Wake 1, where the game would have been far better if they ripped out at least half of the combat and stopped making everything bullet sponges.\r\n\r\nThis is not going into the technical problems the game has. I am running a R7 5800X3D with an RTX 4090 with W11, and no matter what I do, I get the occasional full system lockup or BSOD, forcing me to reboot my entire system. Yes, I have the most recent drivers. Yes, I am playing the game bone stock with no modifications whatsoever. Yes, I have tried having DLSS on and off, ray tracing on and off. Even with no ML enhancements whatsoever, so only native resolution with no DLAA, using baked lighting, it still crashes my system.\r\n\r\nOverall, I would give it a neutral recommendation, but the technical problems make it a not recommended from me.",

      "review": "I definitely late for the party for this one. I found this game on sale and remembering the good reviews i heard about it i decided on a whim to give it a shot.\n\nThe first impression of the game was really positive. The uncanny and creepiness of the setting hooked me in right away with the premises of its mistery. \nSadly that first impression faded away pretty quickly and it left a sour taste in my mouth for the rest of my playthrough.\nThe main feeling i got from the game was of disappointment for the wasted potential. \n\nThe worst sin of the game is: monotonous repetition.\nThe game present you with some fun set pieces at the start but instead of adding on to them it just recycles the same ones over and over again, and by the end what felt intriguing and excting ends up feeling dull and numb.\nAn example of this is the locations: gray office cublicles and gray blocky deconstructed offices. That's it. For me it got so bad that i had multiple point in my playthrough where were to go because everything looked the same.\n\nAnother example: the enemies. You get presented with the concept of a secret SCP facility where hell has broken loose but somehow almost all  the potential dangerous entities are still subdued or harmless and all you get is an endless horde of super \"hiss\" zombie soldiers. The game throws at you some kind of new variation here and there but they still always remains pretty much glowing red soldiers that some time can fly and throw shit at you. After you spent the first ten hours killing hundreds of them you pretty much saw everthing the game can offer.\n\nAnother thing that ticked me off is the game commiting the simple sin of \"telling but not showing\". Through all the game you can collet HUNDREDS of documents telling you about all the weird stuff the Bureau had to deal with... and that's it. Aside for the main plot related stuff 99% of what you read in the documents is never gonna show up in the game.\nIt felt like going in a restourant, being given a menu with plenty of options and exotic stuff... and then the waiter tells you the only thing you can order is a grilled chicken breast with peas. \n\nIt's not that the grilled chicken is bad but i wold've appreaciated to taste other stuff too. \nAnd if i want to read a bunch of creepypastas i can just go on Reddit.\n\nFor me the game simply doesn't get weird enough, it doesn't really lean enough in to the whole uncanny SCP theme and just plays for the most part as a generic action shooter with a superficial flavor of uncanny. \nAdd a really undewhelming ending and by the end of it i was just glad i bought it dirty cheap. \n\nSo no, i can't really recommend it, even on sale. The money spent may be fair but the time wasted probably not.",

Too much pseudo Intellectuality for my taste, as if the game is just a mean for the devs to show off their highly advanced intellect. At some point the game just feels dull, boring, uninteresting, too detached from any down to earth anchor or graspable reference point. \r\n\r\nThe story is built on a mix of esoteric concepts, pseudo theology, 4th grade understanding of quantum physics and bad drama. The game fails on building tension and momentum, during the first 2 or 3 hours nothing makes sense and its hard to follow up and to stay hooked, it requires a great amount of commitment and will to keep going... almost feels masochist.\r\nSome cutscenes are good and enlightening, but most part of the story/lore and world building is built based on documents you find on completely random locations and audio players, which if you pay attention to all of them will take like 50% of your whole gameplay time. \r\nIn short, while I like sci fi and creative concepts, for me this story is crap and told in a non captivating way.\r\n\r\nGameplay wise some abilities are fun to play but gets hold pretty fast, guns and upgrades are just mew, close to meaningless.... also not having to get ammo doesn't help to make combat more meaningful and it ends discouraging the player to evolve, learn and be more skilled. Enemies diversity and AI behaviour is decent though. \r\nLevel design is horrible. So basic, so linear, for this type of game exploration should be more challenging, rich, surprising. \r\n\r\nThe world is ok in some areas, but a major part of it feels generic and uninteresting, lots of meaningless rooms and props. \r\n\r\nWhere the game shines, is when you use the launch ability and it pulls a piece of concrete from a nearby pillar exposing and twisting the iron bars within, that's cool. Or when you shoot a destructible prop (most of them, which is cool) and it starts disintegrating into pieces of materials that fly everywhere. \r\n\r\nThe game has some flashy details and visuals that are good but overall the whole experience is just boring.",

The whole time I kept thinking: WHY?! Game of the Year it was not, sorry, IGN, but I genuinely don’t see what others supposedly saw in it.\n\nThe game play certainly didn’t help its case. Basic enemies can fire rockets that nearly kill you in a single hit, which is more irritating than fun. And while re-spawning itself was fine, the game constantly threw enemies back into areas you had already fought through. Passing back through a corridor or room you’d previously cleared shouldn’t feel like déjà vu in all the worst ways. It came across as lazy encounter design rather than genuine tension.\n\nSwitching weapons felt like I was fighting the controls just as much as the enemies. Yes, the combat mechanics and powers had their moments, but nothing felt new or groundbreaking. More than once I caught myself thinking of BioShock, mostly because it reminded me how much better similar ideas have been done elsewhere.\n\nOddly enough, the best part of the entire experience was the in-game FMV sequences. They were polished, engaging, and felt like the only moments where the game had a clear identity.\n\nBy the time I reached the end, it didn’t feel like an achievement, just a chore that I was relieved to finally have behind me.

      "review": "When it comes to the story, I feel like Control is highly diluted. There’s a good concept buried in there, but it could have been delivered in a much more concise and impactful way. Jessie Faden as a protagonist just doesn’t resonate with me. I couldn’t connect with her struggles in the same way I did with Max Payne’s grief or Alan Wake’s descent into obsession. Both of those stories pulled me in and made me feel something.\r\n\r\nWith Control, I don’t feel much of anything. Jessie’s journey feels bland and detached, almost clinical in tone, and the way the narrative is presented makes it harder to stay invested. The world-building and lore are interesting in pieces, but instead of drawing me in, it often feels like a drag to piece it all together.\r\n\r\nMost of the good parts of the story are buried in readable documents and long audio logs. I don’t mind collectibles when they’re tied strongly to the main story or characters — like the narrations in Max Payne that enhanced every moment. But here, they feel obscure and detached. I don’t really care what the janitorial staff thought about the building, or side-stories about people I’ll never meet. It doesn’t respect my time. A tighter, more focused story — even four hours long — would have had me begging for more, just like I’ve replayed Max Payne 2 eight times. Instead, Control left me waiting for it to be over so I could put it down without guilt.\r\n\r\nEven the DLCs felt redundant — more like chores to push through rather than compelling expansions of the main game. And that’s a shame, because Remedy clearly has a great cast of characters. People like Trench, Darling, Emily Pope, Marshall, Dylan, and Tomasi could have carried the story with real depth. But instead, most of them stay hidden behind layers of files, recordings, and walls of dialogue. The only character who consistently stands out on screen is Ahti, and while he’s great, one character isn’t enough to carry the entire narrative weight.\r\n\r\nThe environment deserves a mention too. It’s beautiful, sleek, and technically impressive, but it never quite achieves the sense of fear or tension it sometimes tries to build. It looks good, but it doesn’t feel as unsettling as it should.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that stood out to me was how the game handles gender dynamics. I’m not against strong female leads — far from it — but here it feels a bit forced. Almost all of the characters currently in charge are women, while the major male figures like Trench and Darling are portrayed as having failed or brought the Bureau down. It ends up giving off the sense of a subtle “women to the rescue” narrative. I get the intention, and the cause is noble, but the execution feels more like propaganda than a natural story choice. For me, it would have worked better if leadership and competence felt balanced and organic, rather than tilted one way.\r\n\r\nOn the technical side though, I can’t complain: the game runs beautifully on my RTX 4050, I’ve had zero bugs so far, and the gameplay feels very fluid. Remedy nailed the engine and mechanics here, and I honestly hope they reuse this system for the upcoming Max Payne remake.\r\n\r\nBut gameplay balance is where things break down. I don’t like the mod system at all — it feels like it hinders progression rather than enhances it. Unless a mod radically changes how the game works, I don’t want it, and here they just ended up ruining the flow for me. And then there are the weapons. Why is the rocket launcher weaker than the pistol? Guns don’t feel powerful, enemies turn into bullet sponges, and then, just when you’ve unloaded clip after clip, they gain the ability to one-shot you. That’s not satisfying design — it’s frustrating.\r\n\r\nAnd then there’s the map. The Oldest House is massive, and while it looks cool, it’s very easy to get lost in. I found myself constantly pausing to open the map just to figure out where to go next. Whether in the main game or the DLCs, navigation feels like a chore. An easier, clearer system would have made exploration much smoother.\r\n\r\nI’m not saying you shouldn’t play this game or won’t enjoy it. You should — because it’s part of the Alan Wake universe, and that connection does matter. It felt good to see the FBC in Alan Wake, but that’s about all I took away from it. I repurchased this game for the DLCs, mainly for the Alan Wake connection, and in the end I was let down.\r\n\r\nIn short: Control has a technically strong foundation, but its story feels diluted, its pacing bloated, its cast underused, its narrative tone a little forced, its map confusing, and its combat undermined by poor balance. It’s a game with flashes of brilliance, but for me, it never clicked the way Remedy’s past titles did.",

Sure, there might be some kind of plot going on, but it's usually just \"Go here to do thing and a weird thing will happen along the way.\" There's definitely plenty of lore, but I just can't be bothered to read 100s of pages of \"[REDACTED].\" I'm not making a joke, that's basically all the lore pages say. I guess if you like SCP then the lore will be engaging for you.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is also a miss for me. Every enemy just feels like a total bullet sponge and clearing rooms is a slog. Maybe I hadn't leveled up my guns enough or something, but I was always lacking materials for that.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, I know this is a popular game, and I think it will be a lot of fun for a lot of people, but it was just one of those games that's never been able to catch me at the right time, I guess.",

Duh.\nPower progression is based upon skill trees and crafting. Skill trees are exactly what you'd expect with nothing of note whatsoever. Crafting is the laziest form of crafting imaginable. Arbitrary resources dropped in arbitrary locations to craft numerical-increase \"mods\". It honestly feels like padding, and still, you're forced to engage with this system or late game enemies will demolish you (they're the same enemies as earlier in the game, but they have more health and deal more damage. Because otherwise the crafting would be pointless, you see.) \nYou almost never have to use your powers or your understanding of the setting creatively in order to progress. Despite the lore describing creepy entities such as \"an item that attacks you if you're not looking\" and despite the main character having somewhat interesting and original powers, the game will never ask that you use this knowledge or attempt to engage with the world in any way other than \"shoot the same bad guys again\". The absolute most you can expect is that, in order to solve a puzzle, you have to read one or two documents scattered about, that tell you exactly how to solve it.\nMind boggingly boring.

      "review": "[b]Score: 3.5/10[/b]\r\n\r\nI'm really just baffled. This is a baffling game. The point is the story, undeniably, but the story has neither a meaningful/discernable resolution (I unironically accidentally played through half of the DLC before realizing that it wasn't some epilogue mission to the main storyline), or a satisfying buildup. The entirety of the questions leading up to the ending are built around promising something being finally revealed at the end, something finally there, as the game puts it - a \"hole behind the poster\", a la Shawshank Redemption, but the problem is that Shawshank DID end by revealing the hole. Control refuses to take down the poster, or if it did, it's just a dent in the wall. Like some aborted attempt at the actual tantalizing tunnel into climax. Because of this story blunder, the rest of the gameplay by the end loses the benefit of the doubt that it gets during the experience. The gunplay and abilities are completely average, bordering on sluggish and boring. This is a looter shooter, for some reason, despite the enemy weapon variety being oh-so-wishfully diverse (I would've loved to have used the drum-fed machine gun the Rangers use, or the RPG with a bayonet the enemies use, hello??). It's a crappy system too, with progression just being numerical upgrades and mods never doing anything interesting enough to merit taking off the one that gives you more damage and the other one that gives you more health. The difficulty is only increased with sponginess so there's no real incentive to explore since you won't need more than what the game hands you along the main story, and the \"hee hee, laymen workers are getting up to no good!\" paper notes are the rule, not the exception, which makes them all kind of a pain to read. All in all, it's a story that gives itself way, way too much credit for complexity (consider Half Life if you want some dimensional sci fi instead), and the credence the rest of the game gives to that Atlassian pillar is misplaced. I can't state how hilarious it is that I played through most of the DLC before being like \"wait a minute. something's up here\" because I didn't believe the ending was the ending. Main character is very frustrating as well, holding back information from the ingame NPCs but also the player? For some reason? Funny Finnish janitor, though.",

I enjoyed playing the game for the first couple hours, but the mediocre gunplay couldn't sustain my interest as I kept getting lost trying to find the main objective (the in-game map also doesn't allow you to change floors, which adds to the confusion). The best thing about this game is the physics, which can be better enjoyed in F.E.A.R. or Half Life 2 (gravity gun). Lastly, if it is helpful, my favorite Remedy games are Alan Wake and Max Payne 1/2. I hated Alan Wake 2, which felt to me like a game with all style and no substance.

Making things worse, the game itself only displays very few paranormalities directly. Unfortunately, even less paranomalities require some player interaction or contain some mystery, which the player can unravel by performing the right actions.  Also the player only has three paranormal skills at his disposal: levitation, telekinesis, a shield, dash and mind control. Because of that, in control, the gameplay actually feels pretty detached from its world building. \n\n- The design of the enemies is boring: A world of paranormalities would have allowed the devs to create very many interesting enemy designs. Unfortunately, in control all except two enemy types are actually humans - and those humans are either controlled by a hostile resonance or a fungus. Since the game only throws the same enemy designs at you over and over again, the game becomes very predictable and also loses its uncannyness.\n\n- The combat is boring and horribly balanced: This boringness not only stems from the player fighting the same enemies over and over again. It is also caused by levitating all the time and spamming telekinesis is seemingly the strongest combat tactic. Of course, the player might use his gun with several different modes (regular gun, shotgun, sniper rifle, machine gun, rocket launcher).  But the DPS of this gun is severely lacking compared to the DPS of telekinesis. For example, even the shotgun mode does less close combat DPS than the telekinesis ability does but with a very long range. Then, the enemies also struggle to actually hit the player. But if they actually manage to hit the player, the player (if he fails to press the evade button) actually dies pretty quickly. Making things worse, the player often is not able to see his (randomly spawned) enemies, and thus he has no chance to evade their attacks. Thus, while the combat actually is not difficult (there are no encounters or bosses, which the player will have to try hundreds of times in order to succeed), the player happens to die many times in a very frustrating and seemingly random way.\n\n- The talent tree is boring: That is because almost all talents only give the player a flat bonus on an attribute or a skill, which does not even feel any interesting. \n\n- The itemization is boring: There is only a quite limited amount of different items, and very most of those items are useless. Making things worse, the game spams the player with those item finds, i.e. the player will find the very same useless items over and over again.",

      "review": "Tedious, repetitive combat.  The atmosphere and environmental storytelling were great and the main story showed some early promise, but the cutscenes and dialogue were awkward and the finale didn't feel worth the grind to reach the end.  It's got that clumsy sort of writing where characters try to tell you what to think about various people or events, rather than the writers trusting you to come to your own conclusions.",

      "review": "For the first 10 hours of gameplay, I absolutely loved Control. It was all about the story, and it did a great job of keeping you eager to learn more. And then somewhere between the 10- and 15-hour mark, something went horribly wrong. Suddenly -as if the developers switched out the team for all new members- the gameplay shifted from story-driven with a gradual incline of difficulty, to a shoot-em-up action game where you were forced to spend time perfecting mechanics so that the 30th time you went through the same boss fight, you might hit just the right combo to get through the 150 minions and defeat the absurdly difficult boss. \r\nIt's a drastic change that occurs over a fairly short period of time. The elements of the early game entice lore-lovers and the type of gamer who uses his screen time to blow off steam after work. Then the turning point completely alienates those same people. If you aren't a hardcore button-mashing, combo-breaking, competitive perfectionist, you will quickly become frustrated in the game after about 10 hours of gameplay.\r\nBecause of this, this has been an incredibly disappointing game. I don't foresee myself finishing it. And that's a shame, because I've become quite invested in the storyline. I want to know what happens to Jesse. I have an emotional attachment to these characters, but because I have far less interest in wading through waves and waves of minions and projecting unreasonably difficult boss battles than I do searching for clue and fighting well-designed battles at an appropriate pace, I will never get the resolution I crave. \r\nThe developers lost track of what this game started as, and as a result, it finished as something completely different.",
