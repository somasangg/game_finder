It perfectly captures the feeling of doing pickup games with your friends in a way that any other soccer game out there just hasn't done right. Even if you have a few inexperienced people, the game is a lot of fun and can be very silly. \n\nThat said, I have plenty of issues with this game. Some are more specific to my tastes (like cosmetics being kinda weak, derivative, or just ugly), but the gripes that are less excusable include connection problems, questionable gameplay / control changes, or performance issues. I'm being broad, but these are all things that have gotten progressively worse as the game has gone on. It crashes constantly, there are strange graphical bugs, sync issues with the ball.\n\nMany of these things I'm sure are in the queue to be ironed out, but it feels really bad to shell out $30 (WITH ADDITIONAL MICRO-TRANSACTIONS) in this economy for a game that, at many times, has barely worked. That combined with random (in my opinion worse) changes to how your character controls and moves, I just can't recommend this game to my friends given it's current price tag.\n\nReally fun. Surprisingly competitive. I'm sure most of these people suck at soccer in real life. Not worth 30 bones. Shaka. I wish there were more nuanced options for the recommending this game, but I'm just gonna say yes. 🤷🏽♀️",

      "review": "This game allows you to control your own player in a fast paced 6 minute games, either on 3v3 or 5v5 games.\n\nThere are tons of things you can do from passing, to dribbling, to taking advantage of the walls surrounding the pitch to create plays. It resembles games like FIFA Street except that passing is the only way to get far while dribbling is there to gain an extra second so you can choose the best available passing option.\n\nThe game probably released a bit too early and launched with bugs, network issues and exploits that affected the way the game was supposed to be played. Since then it has gone a long way and it is now in its most balanced state and network issues are a thing of the past. \n\nThe gameplay is fluid and very fun, especially if you find like-minded teammates to take full advantage of the link up plays. Even if you find yourself in a game full of random teammates that you can't seem to work with don't worry about it, the game ends after 6 minutes or after being down by a 4 goal difference. \n\nUnfortunately it has lost a lot of players in the months since the release either because the game might not be for everyone or because it had these early issues. However it is VERY far from dead and you can find a game within 20 seconds most of the time. I am predicting that at some point in the game's life cycle it will go F2P. In any case, the game is not dead at all and if you buy it now you will zero trouble playing within seconds from queueing. \n\nIf you are someone who enjoys football games where you only control your own player you should definitely give it a try. It is fairly priced, has a loyal playerbase and most people are cooperative. You will meet likeminded people to play with very fast and you will have a lot of fun. The fast pace of the game, the fluidity and the short duration of each games ensures that you will have fun in short bursts or you will suffer for only a few minutes before a bad game ends. The comparison to Rocket League is fair from this perspective so if you are a Rocket League player who enjoys and understands football chances are you will enjoy the game. You can easily play it on your controller  but also on mouse and keyboard which is what I personally prefer. \n\nPeople tend to be doomers about the state of the game or its future but give it a try, I have played since day 1 and the game has never been more fun than it is currently.",

      "review": "REMATCH is the love of your life in high school. You wait for it, dream about it, crave it, and when it finally arrives, you’re overwhelmed with excitement.\n\nWhen I saw the first playtest, I was the happiest man alive. At last, a sports game built entirely on skill: no Pay-to-Win, no packs, no corporate greed from EA lurking behind it. \nJust a small studio, the same publisher as Expedition 33, and a project that inspired trust. \n\nThen the game launched.\n\nSince release, REMATCH has felt like that first love: it could have been perfect, if only it lasted. You’ll always think back and wonder, “What if…?” What if the developers had taken a different path? \nDay one was fun, but unpolished: bugs, disconnections, crashes everywhere. They tried to patch things slowly, too slowly, and with every fix new problems appeared. \nLike with your first love, you keep fighting, telling yourself it will be fine, because “Hey, this is the love of your life, don’t waste it.”\n\nBut then came the decision to bundle new features with fixes. Patches dragged on, cross-play was forced in, and players began to leave. I poured 600 hours into Season 0, plus 150 more during the betas. I still believe REMATCH could become the next great eSport, but the road is steep.\n\nCommunity-wise, it’s tough for newcomers. Most of the remaining players are either competitive teams or ego-driven veterans, which makes learning the game harder. To play well, you need vision and tactical awareness, qualities rare in a world conditioned by FIFA and arcade-style sports titles. Here, movement is deeply simulative: you must sync perfectly with teammates, press together, fill the right spaces at the right time. \nThe \"meta\" itself demands technical mastery: knowing where to place the ball to trigger the right animation, where to pass to unlock your teammate’s movement. \n\nThis complexity could be the foundation of a true eSport, but it also risks keeping the player base small.\n\nAs a fan, the biggest issue is how static matches feel. Competitive players reset to the keeper, call the scheme, execute it. Rarely do you see someone shine with a clever dribble or an unexpected move. Watching tournaments, you often find yourself bored, skipping ahead to the next game.\n\nStill, I believe the Game Awards nomination might shine a spotlight on REMATCH, helping rebuild its community. And I hope it wins “Best Sports Game.” Why? Because it deserves it. It’s fresh, original, and skill-based, everything a sport should be. FC is a money machine, Mario Kart isn’t even a sport. REMATCH is the only title on the list that truly fits.\n\nMy hope is that winning will attract a bigger company, maybe Epic Games, to buy the IP and elevate it; just as they did with Rocket League. Because despite all its flaws, REMATCH is still great. And maybe, like the love of your life, you grow apart, live your own story, and then one day stumble back into her arms. You try again from where you left off, and maybe this time you live your best life with what you always knew was the love of your life. You’ll never know unless you try.",

I've been screamed at, insulted, sometimes in languages I don't even understand, and even received a death threat. And still, it has proven to be one of the most fun multiplayer experiences I've enjoyed in close to a decade. \n\nHaving played this game since day 1, it is clear to me that it was not quite ready for launch when it did launch. The growing pains it went through trying to balance the most egregious \"meta\" that was popular the following weeks left a lot of people disappointed and frustrated, both the users of said \"meta\" and its victims. By now, in my opinion, the game has arrived at a point where I'd call it to be a good position in terms of balance. Sure, it still feels unfair at times, but I've noticed that a lot of times it is not because teams were inherently unfairly balanced (though sometimes they are), but that my team just didn't [i]vibe[/i] as well as the opponent's did.\nWhen this game works, [b]it works[/b]. It takes everything, that, for me, makes football boring to watch and incredibly boring to play and just [b]yeets[/b] that out the window. The last time I got this much enjoyment out of a football game was Fifa Street for the PS2 in 2006. Accuracy, reliability, positioning and teamwork don't rely on some random stats your team is made out of (or worse how much money you spent), but on the skill and attention of every single player. While this might lead to frustration sometimes, especially in 5v5, it is even more rewarding everytime your team succeeds. \nBeing a live-service title I'm not surprised that there are micro transactions and a pass. Development is an ongoing cost and it needs an ongoing revenue stream. I am pleasantly surprised however that every item in the shop or the pass is cosmetic in nature and there being no space for pay 2 win. Its cosmetics (so far) are also not extremely ridiculous or completely unfitting to its visual style (though the halloween pack was cutting it very close in my opinion). \n\nTaking the well-established formula of football and being the first to try and turn it into an even more engaging and fun video game experience than any one has ever tried before is not an easy task and for the most part, the team at Sloclap has exceeded all my expectations. For its price of just 25€ I fully recommend Rematch. If you're unsure, the next Steam Sale is bound to happen or you might check out third-party sellers offering an even better deal. \n\n[b]We got this![/b]",

Thing is Sloclap is a small company that has created this game, they're trying their best to solve the problems 1 by 1. \n\nPriorities in this game is a huge meta - Devs are balancing\n\nWhat to include in this post \n\n1. The community\nPeople tend to see the \"Individual Plays\" You guys ever heard of Bluelock? Yes, kids wants to be the fucking best but they don't want to pass the ball. Instead they're going to get tackled when they have less stamina left.\n - (Kids, High Ego and Pride) Players tend to become that God like player when it comes to dribbling and becoming the Striker. This pisses me off.\n\n2. Slow Progress of the game\nUnfortunately, the game is slowly losing players because of bugs. This one is self-explanatory. The developers are trying to make the game as fun as possible while dealing with bugs and glitches. Hence, the slow progress. \n\n\nPersonally, I love the game because of it's team based core. The game is more into casual rather than competitive. There are Esports scenes here and there but it just needs the right people (Basically, the people who can fucking pass the ball). I understand sometimes you've got to dribble and get out of pressure, being creative in order to make space for your teammates is good but people should communicate instead of fucking toxic every now and then. I'd say, hate the people not the game. \n\nTo be honest, I would love to see this game get bigger than Valorant, CS, Overwatch, FIFA etc. It has the potential to become one of the GOATed eSports. Give it a try and you'll experience the fun side of it.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, REMATCH is the game where you can get along with your friends and have the freaking time of your life then this game is for you!",

There’s no penalty for leaving a ranked match, so players can quit mid-game without consequences.

      "review": "Rematch is what some would like to call \"Rocket League but with People\". But incase that doesn't clue you in to what that entails, let me explain. Rematch is a teambased football Game, focused on a speed and precison. Where just like in the game that it gets jokeingly refered to, you can shoot, and pass the ball of giant barriers that cover out of bounds areas of the playing area, allowing you to essentially include the walls in your plays. \r\n\r\nThe potential with this game is by all means very limitless. It's competitive, it's fun with friends, it has all the right ingredients to be great. But there is just one giant flaw, one catch, that makes it hard for me to even recommend the game, no matter how much i love it.\r\n\r\nThat flaw is the execution of its ongoing development is simply not good enough. While the devs clearly care and are trying their best, the updates are consistently breaking more than they fix. We are currently stuck in a painful loop of delays and regression that is slowly eroding player trust of a dwindling player base. The caution they are takeing before adding any new features is understandable but the game is lacking in places it never should have.\r\n\r\nIn its current state, Rematch is a brilliant tech demo wrapped in a fragile package. Keep an eye on its patch notes, but maybe keep your wallet closed until the dust settles, or this flower finally blooms.",

It's not even running in the Process tasks.\n\nSeptember - November: Same issues, they added 3v3 Ranked, In-game reporting now.\nThey made controlls so wanky and hard to use.\nUsing controller or keyboard+mouse is just not the same anymore. \nThe goalkeeping animations are very slow and at most times broken.\n\nIf a player has more ping than you & lower refresh rate, then the player will win the ball 100%.\n\nThe Game had huge potential, but the lack of development of new features & bug fixes caused a major playerbase drop. \n\n- You can't \"rematch the team you played\"\n- You can't create a team.\n- You can only play 3v3 4v4 or 5v5.\n- Dribbling is basically sliding your character across XY, very broken\n- You can play against BRONZE 3 players while being ELITE 1, no skill cap.\n- You get the same points (ELO) if you do nothing in the match or if you get MVP with 20k points.\n\n5/10.",

      "review": "I played this game when it was a free beta for over 20 hours and loved it. It was unique, fun, relaxing, and overall a very positive experience. When I hopped on for the free weekend a couple months ago, I still had some fun, but even during a free weekend it was obvious that the game was dying. I convinced 4 other friends to download the game and queue up for 5v5, but we just ended up sitting in queue for 10 mins multiple times unable to find a match. I realised that this is due to the reality that Sloclap have no idea how to properly manage or monetise their game. \r\n\r\nThey've opted for the strategy of adopting a pretty egregious full price ($30USD, $45AUD), to never going on sale, and to rely on whales wasting their money on their overpriced micro-transactions, because somehow they decided that this would be a great long-term strategy to keep bringing in players.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the game is dying. A game that is genuinely great (despite it's issues with exploits and updates that are slow to roll out) has been killed because some idiot(s) thought bigger number for price = more revenue. At the time of writing there's 2687 players online on Steam. To put that in perspective, there was on average 100k people playing the free Betas in April and May/June, with an all time peak of 160k. And then when it came out not even 5 MONTHS AGO, they somehow managed to convince at least 92k people to buy a game that should be half the price that it is. The reported sales numbers I found were over 2.5 million in June, but in hindsight, I think that's complete bullshit.\r\n\r\nI'm actually baffled by the management behind this game. There are negative reviews on Steam by people who have sunk hundreds of hours into the game, with valid criticisms about the disrespect shown to the hardcore playerbase. So my question is, if they're not caring about the hardcore players, who are they catering to? Because it sure as shit isn't the casuals, because they've been priced out of getting the game in the first place, and the ones that did splurge are playing other games. They must be scratching their heads wondering what tf has happened to all the players? Well as one of them, I'll tell you: I bought Peak for $7. I bought Hollow Knight for $10. I hop on Rocket League every now and then because it's free. Same for Fortnite and Marvel Rivals, and guess what? Even though those last three games are free, I still spent more money on those than I have on Rematch. Yep. I haven't even bought this game that I'm passionately reviewing because I can't justify the stupid pricetag for a game that has one game mode and is basically dead. I'm not stingy either. I forked out $60 AUD for ARC Raiders, because that's a game that actually justifies it's price. I'm not smart either. I bought FC 26 despite saying I wouldn't (don't buy that game either btw).\r\n\r\nIt's a shame because myself and those four friends I mentioned that I tried to play with during the free weekend were easy customers. I could've talked them into buying this game if it was half the price. Imagine how many more there were that you fumbled. Sloclap management, if you for some reason start listening to your community and are reading this, here's a few sentences that could save your game (which would give you a lot of $$$, the one thing you actually care about):\r\n\r\nDrop the price to a maximum of $7.50 USD permanently, or go all out and make it free. Fuck half the price at $15, fuck $10, $7.50. Your chance to price it at $15 and sell at least five times more copies than you have has sailed. I mentioned Peak earlier. That game is $7.50, and frequently goes on sale for $5. It's a different genre, sure, but like Rematch, its a small but fun game to play solo or with friends. It has made a cool $55 million despite coming out 3 months later, just on PC, with no micro-transactions. More importantly, Peak is alive and thriving with content updates and players who love the game, with 47k playing right now. Peak isn't even the type of game that is expected to have the kind longevity that you wanted to have, but at this rate it's going to be far more relevant and successful Rematch.\r\n\r\nYou have millions of players who want to play this game out there (allegedly over 1.5 million copies sold on all platforms, and plenty more like me who would buy it for a reasonable price). You just have to do the math and bring them in.",

It pains me to say I've witnessed it's players attempt all sorts of exploits since it's launch, be it wall header, lifting the ball into the wall then volleying it into the box, among others. However, I finally gave up on it when the players discovered yet another one, the meta; just kick the ball into the opposition box and await your striker, whom was planted there all along, to volley it and score. Imagine whole matches of this. No skill, no dribble, no movement, no passing, nothing. Just kick it forward and finish. Both teams doing this. Back when I was still active, I was top 0.20% goal scorer in this game, and I've never relied on such antics. Yet, even for me the game began to suck hard, when everybody stopped playing and just kicked it forward, and even when we managed to win, I felt... Distraught. Makes you lose faith in humanity. So don't waste your time, unless you think that shit is some kinda big deal and you feel no shame in being an exploit whore. The only way this game can be salvaged is if they add the offside rule.",

      "review": "First off, I started playing since 1 week after release. The game is awesome, great potential and the satisfaction it brings when you make a good play with randoms or with friends is just otherworldly. The mechanics are great, easy to understand but extremely hard to master.\n\n Which brings me to the problem, the mechanics, which are great, are not consistent at all. What do I mean by that ? Let's say I'm the goalkeeper and I want to jump right after the ball, easy just hold the direction you want to jump to and then press the button the jump. But the problem is sometimes it just jumps up or in front, why? No one knows, it just does that. Now let's say that it does jump in the direction you want to, sometimes it just jumps 2cm in the direction you wanted, again, why? No one knows.\n There are more bugs with the mechanics, let's say I'm holding forward to run with the ball, I'm hitting it forward then for some reason my character just stops, turns back runs a bit and then goes back to where I originally wanted to run. \n I also want to point out the ball priority as it is the most inconsistent mechanic I have ever seen in a video game.\n\n Now there are more bugs but if I list them all this review would be too long, to be completely honest I would be more understanding or sympathetic considering they are not a very large Game Studio. But considering the current circumstances of having to buy the game (25 euros), having premium battle passes (10 euros) and then them having collaborations with Puma, Balenciaga and popular footballers. This means they have the funds and also prioritize this stuff instead of fixing these annoying bugs.\n\nI also want to point out Ranked 3v3. It's a blast to play to say the least, but sometimes there are teams that score and then just pass the ball for 5 minutes just to win. I don't know what else to say except it ruins the fun for others and for this one I'm not blaming the developers. But one thing about Ranked 3v3 that I am blaming the developers for is not adding a report button. I sometimes get teammates that just go for the ball and just it in our on goal and all I can do is watch them do it, I can't even report them so all that I can do is sit there helplessly in a 4v2 situation.",

The game at its core is extremely fun, and I've had a blast playing solo and with a full team of friends. The beta had some game-breaking latency bugs - that's to be expected since it's a beta. Season 1 releases, and many, many of those same bugs are present. I encounter these bugs basically every single match that I play, and so do my friends. Ball de-sync, ownership priority, server instability, hit registration. It has gotten better, but to call this a finished game is a straight up lie. I wouldn't be complaining if I hadn't paid the full $30 that this game is asking for.\r\n\r\nAs of right now this game is really, really hard to enjoy. I just end up just getting frustrated that a ball that I thought I had clearly locked onto ends up in the other team's possession, or a ball flies over the goalies head only to snap to their hands. This game has unfortunately just become a clip farm for my friends and I to show each other what stupid bug(s) happened this time after each match. If I lose a match because of a skill issue where the other team was just clearly better than me at the mechanics, I'll still be frustrated but at least I know it was fair. But right now, I just feel like I'm cheated every match. Sometimes the game will even be in my favor where the ball will go straight through the goalie or snap to my feet in an unintended way that gets me a free goal, and it just doesn't feel good to get those goals knowing I didn't earn them.\r\n\r\nFor now, I'm uninstalling.

      "review": "I think this game was something special and a refreshing competitive idea come to life. I really enjoyed playing it from the beta, but after seeing the meta progression though a couple of patches, I can't recommend it because of the problems with the game engine\n\nThe most similar game this is compared to is probably Rocket League, but I think that's a mistake as RL is a physics based engine, whereas this engine is the SIFU engine repurposed. After playing, you can really feel that it's more of a fighting game, and the server stability has always been awful with players' connections really make playing the game difficult. Each match is plagued by inconsistent hit detection, lag, desync, and random disconnects. Imagine playing a 1v1 fighting game without rollback frames, and this game is basically a 5v5 fighting game..\n\nA huge point of my distaste with the game was the evolution of the Meta, and how the developers' attempts to try to shape the game to their original vision resulted in worse experiences for the general playerbase. The skill in this game is abusing the game engine mechanics before it gets patched out, and then trying to figure out the next exploit that's in the game. Compare that to Rocket League where Flip Resets were always in the game, but it wasn't until players discovered that interaction and then made it a part of the game\n\nHere's how the Meta evolved in the short months I was playing before I decided to quit the game\n\n1. Meta was defined by abusing a \"gather ball\" and \"push ball\" animation, making something called \"the ippy slide\". It was incredibly easy to pull off, and used the server desync and engine mechanics to teleport the ball while dribbling. It was very difficult to defend against, and because the tech was so easy to master, games became centered around players exploiting this desync \n[b]>devs make changes slowing player movement, reducing the distances in which a player can gather the ball, and nerfs the push ball distance[/b] \n\n2. Meta became a slog of defense focused turnovers. Passing became harder, and there was a lack of offensive options to skillfully beat your defender. This meta was probably the my favorite one to play because it mimics real soccer- you need accurate passing to capitalize on defense mistakes. However, this meta resulted in extremely long Over Times, with some images online showing players in the same game for 30+ minutes\n[b]>devs make changes[/b] \n\n3. Meta returns to a fast pace, but now there's misleading animations without reliable defensive counterplay. Attacking players now spam a single button juggle that is chainable, and the defensive option is a jump to block. Missing a jump block has insane recovery time and only works about 50%, so your best option on defense is to sit, not move, and wait to see if you can get your turn to interact with the ball\n\nUnfortunately I don't know how the devs can 'fix' this game so it becomes a game of skillful dribbling, passing, shooting, and defending. I think your $30 is spent better elsewhere",

The game was released at least 6 months too early, and as a result the entirety of season 0 (and some of S1) essentially felt like the game was still in the playtesting stage. \n\nCountless netcode problems, movement exploits, and mechanical bugs that made it a struggle just to play the game. Movement got reworked multiple times, changing the feel of the game completely after launch, and despite these drastic changes we are STILL seeing bugs that have been in the game since the closed playtest stages. \n\nThe game was missing core features and menu functionality for months post launch, and only now is the studio giving attention to the ranked mode, which has been a complete mess with ranks, ranking up, and matchmaking since day 1. This is of course, not even touching on the fact that solo queue is almost entirely pointless, as you'll get nowhere without competent teammates.\n\nDevelopment is far too slow and convoluted for a competitive multiplayer game like this, which needs to find its niche and do it well right off the bat. Further, I simply don't believe the game will last much longer. Playing on EU servers I'm regularly seeing queue times up to 3 minutes on 5v5 quickplay. The game is losing players every month, and who knows how bad it'll be a year from now.\n\nAdding this on at the end because I somehow forgot to mention monetisation, but it is not good. The game costs £20.99 in the UK, and still comes with a full suite of paid battlepass, paid cosmetics, and premium currency. This on its own would be fine, since they need to make money to keep the lights on, but the rate of progression is some of the worst I've seen. \n\nEach battlepass has 3 time-gated \"phases\", each one filled with nodes that take 3 or 5 battlepass points to unlock, giving you one cosmetic per point. Depending on performance, you need to play 4-5 matches for one point, which means that you'll spend roughly 50-60 HOURS to complete ONE battlepass, which expires at the end of the season whether you paid for it or not. \n\nIt's also important to mention that the battlepass has multiple paths you can take with your points, which can be nice if you only want one or two items from a path, but it also means that if those items are at the end, you need to spend your points on that entire path before reaching that singular reward. This level of grind is ridiculous, and effectively means that unless this is your main game that you play every day without fail, you won't be able to complete the battlepass and will have wasted the money you spent on it.\n\nThere is a fun, unique, and enjoyable game buried somewhere in Rematch, but as it is now I just can't recommend it.",

I still get tilted by teammates who appear to have room temp iq. I swear everyone on my team, who's turn it is to be goalkeeper instantly becomes braindamaged. every shot is a goal. I've had games where I was literally carrying with 3 goals and 1 assist, but we lost 4v5. it doesn't matter how good you are individually, you can't carry sometimes. if you wanna experience teammates that are unable to pass, refuse to or pass to the space behind you - this is the game for you. \r\n\r\nit was the most fun during beta back when nobody knew how to play.

But let's be honest - the same could be said with any competitive game out there. Still though, I've experienced a very little amount of matches where the players aren't selfish, disgusting and just mentally horrible, especially due to this being related to football - which has a team based culture around it. \n\nThese points apply for any rank in the game. Even elite players are still a bunch of arrogant, egoist dribblers instead of focusing on what should be the main focus - teamwork and making quick and effective counter plays. Due to these slow dribbler types, the complete point of a build up play goes out the window as your opponents rush and make their way back to their own box in no time, completely eliminating any passing options, besides back, which players never utilise for some odd reason.\n\nSomething goes wrong in a match though? They'd rather start throwing or AFKing, or throwing a tantrum like little fetuses, or when things go south, they expect you to wipe their ass clean of all the mistakes they made. The game is done for me. It's not attracting a fresh player base anymore and only decreasing, while keeping the same braindead players who think they are goated soloing at let me remind you - A TEAM BASED GAME, where the ball will always move faster than any players dribble.\n\nNow to move on to the development side of things - very slow, and updates are usually bug ridden, making the overall gameplay experience worse, with patches taking a long time as well. What's worse is that one of my friends (this could or could not be true), said they recently as of the time of writing said they updated their TOS (Terms of Service) to mention that they can't guarantee servers are going to be consistently smooth anymore, which implies a lower budget and cheapening out on the, what in my opinion are, bad enough servers as they were before, with plenty of problems.\n\nFinally, and this was completely optional as well, but they completely missed the opportunities with the cosmetics possible in this game. They limit themselves to real clothing brands and partnerships and sponsors instead of actually being really creative with what your character could wear, look like, and offer a crazy amount of customization options, possibly even incentivising players to hop into the store more often to support the game. I'm a big fan of cosmetic items in games usually, but in this game it's just really shallow.\n\nAs of time of writing, I simply cannot recommend this game to anyone sadly, as excited as I was for this game during the BETA and earlier on. They started off really on the strong foot in the first season, and have plateaued since. I will continue to play the game on occasion whenever I feel like playing it, but each time I do it's just not a pleasant experience, but I really do want this game to shine and change this review eventually.",

But the most annoying thing about this game for me, is the fact there's no option to have tackle and slide tackle on 2 separate buttons. Can I just run and do a normal tackle with the option to slide when I need to? Is that too much to ask? Based on how much they like to focus on cosmetics and nothing else, I'd say their answer is a big \"F U!\"",
