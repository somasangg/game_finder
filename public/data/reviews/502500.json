      "review": "[h1] Close to Perfection [/h1] \nACE COMBAT 7: SKIES UNKNOWN is a glorious and visually stunning love letter to arcade flight combat. It successfully recaptures the magic of the series' peak, delivering a pure, unfiltered power fantasy of being an elite fighter pilot. From the moment you tear through the clouds, you're treated to some of the most exhilarating dogfights in gaming.\nhttps://youtu.be/MZeNlMpx24w\nThe core gameplay is simply masterful. The controls are accessible yet deep, and the thrilling aerial ballet of locking onto enemies, dodging missiles, and pulling off high-G turns is endlessly satisfying. The dynamic weather is a fantastic addition, making the skies a beautiful and deadly battlefield. However, seasoned aces might find the overall challenge a bit lacking. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3385656206\nThe story, while epic in scale, is a double-edged sword. It presents a deep, convoluted tale of political intrigue and war in the signature Ace Combat style. There's a genuinely interesting narrative there about drones, the nature of combat, and the cost of war. But for many, the endless stream of names, factions, and historical references between missions can feel like a homework assignment. You often find yourself wanting to skip the briefings just to get back into the cockpit where the game truly shines. Crucial plot details and character dialogues are  dumped on you in the middle of the most intense, saturated battles. While this aims for immersion, it often has the opposite effect. When you're simultaneously dodging a dozen missiles,  and lining up a shot on a priority target, you simply have no time to listen\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3379096197\n[h1] PS. ACE COMBAT 7 is a must-play for any fan of action games or aviation. It delivers a near-perfect arcade flight experience that is both accessible and deeply rewarding. Its main shortcomings are a story that sometimes feels like a burden to follow and a difficulty curve that could have been sharper. But when you're soaring through a storm, missiles blazing, and the orchestral score swells, none of that seems to matter. This is a spectacular ride, even if you're just along for the flight and not the political drama. [/h1]",

      "review": "Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown is an air-combat action game that combines accessible controls with cinematic presentation. Its campaign follows a fictional conflict in the Strangereal universe, using a mix of political tension, personal stories, and high-stakes missions to create a focused narrative backdrop without relying on real-world events.\n\nFlight handling is intentionally stylized. Aircraft respond quickly, maneuvers are exaggerated, and combat emphasizes speed and spectacle rather than simulation accuracy. This design keeps missions intense and readable, allowing players to focus on dogfights, missile evasion, and maintaining momentum. Weather effects—such as turbulence, icing, and storms—add situational pressure without overly complicating controls.\n\nThe mission variety is strong. Players engage in air superiority battles, ground strikes, defense operations, and large-scale set pieces featuring shifting objectives. The game frequently introduces new threats or environmental conditions to maintain pacing. Enemy ace units and scripted encounters provide standout moments that give the campaign its identity.\n\nPresentation is a major strength. Aircraft models are detailed, the skyboxes are expansive, and particle effects enhance the sense of speed. The soundtrack blends orchestral and electronic elements to match mission tone, and radio chatter contributes constant context during combat.\n\nProgression revolves around unlocking aircraft and weapons through a tech-tree system. This structure encourages replaying missions to earn research points and experiment with different loadouts. Though the system is straightforward, it provides enough depth to support varied playstyles.\n\nMultiplayer includes team deathmatch and battle royale–style dogfights, offering quick matches focused purely on combat skill. It lacks long-term depth but provides a functional extension of the core mechanics.\n\nOverall, Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown delivers a polished, high-energy air-combat experience built on spectacle, accessible controls, and strong audiovisual design. It is suited for players seeking fast, cinematic aerial action rather than fully realistic flight simulation.",

It strikes the perfect balance between arcade accessibility and mechanics and satisfying complexity. Every plane feels unique(save for a few which don't seem to have much differences though their stats say otherwise), and the high speed, close-quarters dogfights are the most intense and rewarding I have ever experienced. Mastering PSMs (Post-Stall Maneuvers) feels incredible, turning a routine encounter into a cinematic spectacle.\n\n🌩️ Visuals/Graphics, Atmosphere, and Sound Design\nThe game clouds and nature is breathtakingly beautiful. The clouds and weather effects are gameplay features that force you to adapt. Flying through a turbulent storm or watching the sun set over the clouds adds immense atmosphere and the flying through clouds adds a feeling of suspense and danger as you are unable to see allies or enemies for that matter. This is all backed up by an absolutely phenomenal soundtrack that perfectly swells the drama during key mission moments and is just so damn cool.\n\n🎯 Multiplayer & Replayability-\nThe multiplayer is frantic fun, offering excellent competitive dogfighting that tests your aerial skills against other pilots. With tons of aircraft to unlock, special weapons to research, and the pursuit of better mission rankings, the replay value is through the roof.\n\nAnnoying Rant and TLDR: Ace Combat 7 delivers for the most part everything a fan of the series or people who are interested in flight combat could possibly want. It is a visually stunning, mechanically flawless experience. If you like planes, action, or just great video games, buy this now. You won't regret it.",

The story is surprisingly well made, gripping and even touching at times, combat and interactions with your wingmen feel very good, there's a great arsenal of weapons, large selection of aircraft to choose from, great graphics, controls, soundtrack, you name it. Overall presentation of the game is just plain awesome. There's also a ton of optional DLCs available.

      "review": "[h1]One of the best Mechanics in a game that I have seen [/h1]\n\nAce Combat 7 is genuinely one of the best gameplay experiences I’ve ever had. I wouldn’t say I’m here for the story, mostly because I skip the cutscenes, but the game still delivers its narrative incredibly well through radio chatter, AWACS updates, and the voices of the other pilots. Even without watching the cinematics, you still feel like you’re part of something bigger with every mission.\n\nWhere the game absolutely shines is in its mechanics and controls. Everything is polished, responsive, and designed to feel satisfying. It’s clear the developers thought through every detail, because the handling, the physics, and the way the aircraft behave just feel perfect.\n\nIf you decide to play this game, do yourself a favour and switch the controls from “Standard” to “Expert” the moment you start. The difference is huge. Expert mode gives you far more freedom, precision, and fluidity, and you adapt to it surprisingly quickly.\n\nAlso, this game should absolutely be played in first-person cockpit view. Every aircraft has a uniquely designed interior, and the level of detail is incredible. Being able to see your altitude, position, heading, and the world around you through the cockpit adds a whole new level of immersion that third-person view just can’t match.\n\nA Note on Difficulty\nAs incredible as the game is, it can be brutally challenging at times, even on easy mode. Some enemies feel unusually strong, and a few checkpoints are placed in a way that makes failure genuinely frustrating. It’s possible to complete almost an entire mission only to fail in the last seconds and have to redo fifteen minutes of progress. Adjusting your loadout or aircraft mid-mission often isn’t possible either, meaning you sometimes need to quit out completely just to make changes. Even certain settings, like video options, can only be edited from the main menu.\n\nThere are minor gameplay quirks as well. Occasionally, missiles don’t track the way you expect, and while you eventually learn how to reliably guide and dodge them, a few moments still feel off. Some boss encounters also push the limits of fairness, with enemy missiles turning sharply multiple times before hitting you, making them feel nearly unavoidable. A handful of missions might seem impossible on first attempt, but they can be beaten with a bit of perseverance (and maybe a short break).\n\nEven with these rough edges, the game remains incredibly satisfying. The highs far outweigh the frustrations, and the overall experience is absolutely worth it.\n\n[b] Overall rating: 8/10 [/b]",

The controls are simple enough that you can pick them up quickly and start pulling off sharp turns, missile dodges, and chase maneuvers without much effort. At the same time, there’s enough nuance in how planes handle, how weapons work, and how missions are structured that skilled players can still push themselves. It strikes a good balance between being easy to learn and satisfying to master.\n\nPerformance is another strong point. The game runs surprisingly well even on older PCs and last-gen hardware, maintaining smooth framerates and crisp visuals without needing a high-end setup. The scaling is well-optimized, and even at lower settings the clouds, lighting, and explosions still look impressive. It’s one of those rare modern games that feels polished and stable across all platforms.\n\nVisually, Ace Combat 7 is beautiful. The attention to detail in the aircraft models, the lighting that shifts as you climb through the atmosphere, and the cinematic camera angles during combat all combine to make each mission feel alive. The soundtrack is just as good, with powerful orchestral themes that elevate every dogfight and emotional moment.\n\nThe campaign is classic Ace Combat storytelling—melodramatic, idealistic, and surprisingly emotional. Even if you’re not familiar with the series’ long-running lore, it’s easy to get swept up in its tone and atmosphere. Each mission feels unique, offering a mix of large-scale battles, tense escort runs, and high-speed chases through storms or mountain ranges.\n\nThere are some flaws. The story can be confusing for newcomers, and a few missions rely on repetitive objectives. Multiplayer is a fun distraction but lacks the depth and progression to keep you hooked long-term. Still, these issues don’t take much away from the core experience.\n\nAce Combat 7: Skies Unknown is one of those games that reminds you how good pure gameplay can feel when everything clicks. It’s thrilling, accessible, and full of memorable moments that make every sortie feel meaningful. Even years after release, it remains one of the best air combat experiences you can find.\n\n9/10 – A fast, cinematic, and beautifully polished arcade flight experience that balances accessibility and depth, running smoothly even on older hardware while delivering unforgettable aerial battles.",

My next gripe is with the Aces in the game, where they're minor and are easily missable, where as in other games they were featured and a big part of the series.  Next the mission tree isn't a tree, its a line, no variability at all. This greatly limits replayability despite unlocking a harder difficulty after beating the game and you can't get all the planes in one run.  But there's another problem.. the planes are separated into 3 trees, western, eastern, and european, except western and european merge near the end and modules are locked behind each tree. It's just really damn annoying. Only 2 attack airplanes in the base game meanwhile there's a billion multirole and fighter planes.  Every single mission is de facto a multi-role mission.

It might be worth buying for a playthrough or two if you are new to the genre and can get the base game with story DLCs for $20-$30 (with the DLCs doing the heavy lifting in providing value), but there are better options still in Project Wingman ($25+$5 DLC).\n\nStory is massively subpar. Uninteresting characters, scenarios, dialogue, and overall narrative. Gameplay is passable but largely one-note which, while not the end of the world on its own, means that there's nothing to keep coming back for when combined with lackluster writing and mission design. Music is also incredibly shallow, entirely lacking the depth or emotional tones of 4, 5, and Zero's soundtracks that made those so compelling, replay after replay. The DLC missions do improve on the base game noticeably, with vastly more interesting characters, better scenario writing and mission design, slightly more varied gameplay, and music that finally differs from the same two themes repeated ad nauseum, but that level of polish is unfortunately only afforded to those three missions. If you do buy this game, do not skip on these DLC missions. They are Ace Combat 7 at its peak in every department.\nMultiplayer is dead, and only ever consisted of deathmatch to begin with.",

      "review": "[h1][b]Turbulent[/b][/h1]\n\nDespite years of dormancy, the core experience remains as it always was- lock-on to the green squares and hexagons, turn them red, blow them up. While that doesn't sound electrifying on its own, the gestalt it forms with a bombastic soundtrack and a melodrama-stuffed narrative likewise remains unchanged. That feeling like your flying through an episode of an anime, that certain spark that has left Ace Combat as essentially the last \"flight-action\" franchise still burns brightly. \n\nWhile the core loop is as sound as ever, I can't help but find AC7 unambitious when viewed through a wider lens. Beyond some new cloud and weather tech, courtesy of Unreal Engine 4, AC7 lacks a defining secondary mechanic. There's nothing like commanding a whole squadron in AC5, the branching campaign of ACX, or the choose-your-reputation Ace Style system from AC0. Even the increased scope of battles introduced in AC6 has been pared back to near PS2 levels despite having even more processing power to play with. It seems AC7's rocky development has resulted in it being the most minimalist mainline entry in nearly twenty years and I think it suffers for it. A prevailing sense of creative bankruptcy certainly doesn't help matters. Not only are we starting with bomber attacks and ending with tunnel runs while enemy aces who frustratingly break the laws of physics harder than you and giant superweapons are sandwiched in-between [i]again[/i], levels of self-referentialism have reached the point that we're fighting the [i]same[/i] enemies over the [i]same[/i] locations we did in AC4. After waiting all these years for a new entry in the franchise, I can't help but find what I got safe and underwhelming.  \n\nThe narrative also bares some scars. All the parts veterans would expect are there, but they don't seem to mesh quite right- you have an ensemble cast of allies who you're supposed to care about but they feel so thin and anonymous that when they die, no sense of drama or pathos is generated. Even the subordinates (that you can't actually command in any fashion) your eventually granted feel like strangers rather people who hold your life in their hands and vice-versa. You spend a chunk of the game in a Soviet-style penal squadron but this too feels surface level and incidental, nothing meaningful comes of this or your eventual exoneration in terms of the story or gameplay. It all feels coherent and yet [i]off[/i] in a way I don't have the vocabulary for.     \n\nAs an aside, I'm not a fan of how aircraft DLC is handled. Buying skins with boosted stats back in AC6 was one thing but paywalling classic, iconic aircraft like the Falken and F-15 S/MTD entirely feels scummy. I'm also not pleased that they're not integrated into the aircraft tree but unceremoniously dumped in your lap immediately, adding pay-to-win to injury.   \n\nAs a franchise veteran, I wouldn't recommend Ace Combat 7, at least not before nearly every mainline entire that came before it. The game is [i]fine[/i], but I expect more than that given its pedigree. I'm sure newcomers will find something of merit, though. Especially when the game is on sale.  \n \n[b]Pro-Tips[/b]\n[list]\n    [*] Pulse Lasers make things so much easier. Prioritize aircraft that can equip them and parts that enhance them. \n    [*]  Install the Skies Restored mod. Restores cut dialogue while also fixing typos and making other vanilla-friendly improvements. \n[/list]",

It's quite obvious that someone is hacking when they have missiles that instantly hit you the moment they fire at you.\nThis would still be fine if the game had a way to report or at least block these players. But it doesn't.\nSo if you leave a lobby that's infested with a hacker, don't be surprised if they follow you to a different one (if one is even available). The moment everyone rage quits the lobby they are in.\nThis was also not an issue on AC Infinity because the game was a PS3 exclusive. But if you're going to have a multiplayer game on PC, you need to account for hackers at least to some capacity.\nInstead, the devs decided to stick their heads in the sand and pretend they don't exist while the basement dwellers that use these hacks run rampant and ruin what little is left of the multiplayer community. \n\nSpeaking of AC Infinity, I won't be surprised if all the planes came straight from it because, visually, it looks the same.\n\nYet, they still managed to create a paid game that's worse in nearly every respect than its free-to-play counterpart when it comes to multiplayer!\n\nIf you're buying this for anything other than a simple, fun campaign experience. Don't ... save your money. \nIn its current state, this game isn't worth more than $10 at best, and that would be if all the digital content came included.",

Even the increased scope of battles introduced in AC6 has been pared back to near PS2 levels despite having even more processing power to play with. It seems AC7's rocky development has resulted in it being the most minimalist mainline entry in nearly twenty years and I think it suffers for it.

Gameplay is passable but largely one-note which, while not the end of the world on its own, means that there's nothing to keep coming back for when combined with lackluster writing and mission design. Music is also incredibly shallow, entirely lacking the depth or emotional tones of 4, 5, and Zero's soundtracks that made those so compelling, replay after replay. The DLC missions do improve on the base game noticeably, with vastly more interesting characters, better scenario writing and mission design, slightly more varied gameplay, and music that finally differs from the same two themes repeated ad nauseum, but that level of polish is unfortunately only afforded to those three missions. If you do buy this game, do not skip on these DLC missions. They are Ace Combat 7 at its peak in every department.\nMultiplayer is dead, and only ever consisted of deathmatch to begin with.",

Of course, that really won't matter much when half your missiles lose their target lock in clouds and you can't see anything due to icing.

It's quite obvious that someone is hacking when they have missiles that instantly hit you the moment they fire at you.\nThis would still be fine if the game had a way to report or at least block these players. But it doesn't.\nSo if you leave a lobby that's infested with a hacker, don't be surprised if they follow you to a different one (if one is even available). The moment everyone rage quits the lobby they are in.\nThis was also not an issue on AC Infinity because the game was a PS3 exclusive. But if you're going to have a multiplayer game on PC, you need to account for hackers at least to some capacity.\nInstead, the devs decided to stick their heads in the sand and pretend they don't exist while the basement dwellers that use these hacks run rampant and ruin what little is left of the multiplayer community. \n\nSpeaking of AC Infinity, I won't be surprised if all the planes came straight from it because, visually, it looks the same.\n\nYet, they still managed to create a paid game that's worse in nearly every respect than its free-to-play counterpart when it comes to multiplayer!\n\nIf you're buying this for anything other than a simple, fun campaign experience. Don't ... save your money. \nIn its current state, this game isn't worth more than $10 at best, and that would be if all the digital content came included.",

It has what I'm sure they thought were call backs to previous games, but to me it just comes across as an unoriginal and deeply uninspired story.  My next gripe is with the Aces in the game, where they're minor and are easily missable, where as in other games they were featured and a big part of the series.  Next the mission tree isn't a tree, its a line, no variability at all. This greatly limits replayability despite unlocking a harder difficulty after beating the game and you can't get all the planes in one run.  But there's another problem.. the planes are separated into 3 trees, western, eastern, and european, except western and european merge near the end and modules are locked behind each tree. It's just really damn annoying. Only 2 attack airplanes in the base game meanwhile there's a billion multirole and fighter planes.  Every single mission is de facto a multi-role mission. It's just uninspired game development by a team who clearly knew the title would sell so the effort could be minimized.",
