Everyone's character is so cute !\n\nThe game DO need more care on certain aspects, especially in the customization, lots of clipping with the clothes, accessories like tails are sometimes placed too high on the character. Also not a fan of the blue outline on absolutely every 3D objects, looks a little weird a lot of the time, a black or dark brown outline would have suit better i think. I feel like the HUD could be better and add more identity to the game. Just need to be a little more polished overall but it's really off a great start. \n\nAlso more customization please !! c:",

It also doesn't take up that much computer power so I'm basically using it as my wallpaper for my second monitor when I'm not using the timer to focus. I bought this on a complete whim so I'm very happy with how randomly attached I got to this app.\n\nIt's also great for ambient noise- You can turn on and off 24 different ambient noises/variants and adjust how loud each thing is. I also like that I can add gifs and images to certain items, as well as draw on things with what I understand is the newest patch :D\n\nOf course the game does have issues, like how the item placement isn't great- sometimes you can't move items even if you have grid placement off, mostly when things are near the ceiling or the corners of the room. Items also snap to the center your mouse on the item, so placing rugs underneath pre-existing furniture is a nightmare sometimes because there's no option to send an item to the lowest layer, so sometimes you have to move everything away from the area you want to put a rug, then put everything back after you place the rug, etc.",

It's so hard to find pieces of clothing that fit together without noticeably clipping into each other, and the color customization is also extremely limited to the point where it often makes it actively [i]harder[/i] to match different pieces together, thus defeating the point. Moreover, the undo function is... kind of broken, which is especially a problem when considering that for some reason you often can't edit a piece of clothing you have already equipped without unequipping it and re-equipping it first, which resets any preexisting customization.

It was a delight getting to experience mutliplayer right off the bat— all players being able to customize and host rooms of all sorts of moods. Outside the customization and ability to create your perfect space, I enjoy the music player and timer within the game, something that's a huge step up from any other pomo-timer site/app/etc I've found out there. \n\nThere are occasional glitches within the game though Gogh is constantly coming out with new updates that fixes these. The main thing I'd love to see is additional character customization options as I've noted many players including myself enjoy creating their own characters— it's something that's especially joyful for many of the creatives that end up playing this game!",

      "review": "I got interested in this game because I already owned My Dream Setup, but that one didn’t let you have an avatar, track tasks, or do anything beyond customizing rooms. Gogh, on the other hand, immediately caught my attention because it includes all those extra features. I can create my avatar, add my tasks, and even customize my music. The music system is especially interesting because you can link a local folder from your PC and use your own songs as an in-game playlist, and you can even assign a custom cover image from your computer.\n\nOne thing I really loved about My Dream Setup was the ability to add custom images to frames, posters, monitors, and screens, and Gogh also has that, which is great. Still, there are several downsides. You can’t change the size of rooms, freely scale furniture, or recolor certain parts of objects. Some furniture comes in colors like white and pink, and the game only allows recoloring the white part, not the pink, which is frustrating. You also can’t add or remove doors and windows wherever you want, which severely limits room customization. In My Dream Setup, you could even draw the entire floorplan from scratch, so I was able to recreate my room perfectly there. In Gogh, even the largest room preset is still too small for my real bedroom.\n\nThere is also a noticeable lack of furniture variety. My Dream Setup includes detolfs, which are extremely popular among figure collectors, and Gogh would really benefit from items like that. The game could also use more frame and poster proportions, especially 1:1 square formats and round frames. On top of that, Gogh really needs more types of basic furniture, such as larger mirrors, proper wardrobes, and different PC cases, including mini-tower cases like the one I use in real life.\n\nAnother issue that many players, including me, have experienced is that the to-do lists sometimes reset, causing all tasks to disappear. That’s a pretty big problem considering that productivity is one of the main focuses of the game.\n\nAll of these limitations affect the customization experience, especially when trying to recreate a real room. It would also be great if we could scale the length of avatar hairstyles, since many cute styles are way too short for what I wanted.\n\nOverall, that’s everything. If the game eventually improves these features, it would be absolutely perfect.",

I haven't had issues making darker skin as a COLOUR, but the lines for the mouth and all that stay as the regular grey-ish and it looks awful. I wish there was a lot more options for furniture; more options for natural-looking pillows, blankets, etc. Some items that should go together(like the bed + pillows) do not at all, it's not cohesive. The grid is also INFURIATING. why isn't it lined up with the wall??\n\nWhen it comes to the actual studying part of the game, I think it does exactly as it's supposed to, I mean, it's not a very complex feature. I don't think this would make me any more likely to study(and it hasn't so far), but with multiplayer the whole body-doubling aspect of it might change that up. All-in-all it's very cute and relaxing to watch, but mostly as a second-screen kind of thing.\n\nI encounter a of bugs, I've had rooms not save(A LOT, might be a cloud issue im not sure), etc. common issues that make me never wanna play again(for a week) but I can get over it.\n\nThat being said, it is a very relaxing game with a lot of potential.

I'm sure most people who have a life outside of this game would agree that it's very annoying to have the pets grow based on how productive you are.

Mostly the lack of different skin  colors. I'm sure after a few more updates, the devs will deal with that. I'd suggest focusing on the skin colors and also maybe add a color wheel with hex codes you can enter.\r\n\r\n My third issue with the game is the bugs that come with it.

Not only that, but the letters you receive from theses pets are annoying too. \r\n\r\n My other issue with the game is the lack of avatar customization so far. Mostly the lack of different skin  colors. I'm sure after a few more updates, the devs will deal with that. I'd suggest focusing on the skin colors and also maybe add a color wheel with hex codes you can enter.\r\n\r\n My third issue with the game is the bugs that come with it.
