      "review": "I bought Hearts of Iron IV because I saw tens of thousands of people playing it on Steam and thought, “Hey, if that many people are into it, it’s gotta be good, right? Probably just Risk with better graphics.” Wrong. So very wrong. This game isn’t Risk. This is a full-blown world domination simulator built entirely out of spreadsheets, buttons, and pain. It’s like someone weaponized Excel and gave it historical trauma.\n\nI started a game as Japan, thinking “Cool, I’ll conquer the Pacific like in the movies.” I didn’t even make it past 1938 before I’d completely derailed history. I invaded China with full confidence... and zero supply. My tanks ran out of fuel, my troops starved in the mountains, and I accidentally built more horses than actual weapons. My navy? Still stuck in port because I forgot to give them orders. Classic rookie admiral move.\n\nThings only got worse when I tried to join multiplayer. The chat hit me with:\n“J A P rush 40w marines, meta is CAS-heavy micro, USA does AA spam, GER go 7-2s.”\n\nI felt like I was reading secret military code. People were throwing out terms like \"air meta\" and \"naval micro\" like we were planning a real war. Someone told me to “rush AA with 40w support recon CAS” and I honestly considered uninstalling. I asked what “7-2” meant and someone called me “Malta-tier.” I don’t know what that means, but I took it personally. And look, I tried to get better. I even launched a naval invasion on the UK forgot convoys. My entire army just stood at the edge of France, staring across the channel like sad kids waiting for a school bus that doesn’t exist. Meanwhile, the British invaded me with paratroopers. I didn’t even know paratroopers were in the game. My capital fell before my invasion plan even got off the ground.\n\nBut then I discovered a mod. Old World Blues. And suddenly, it all clicked. Now I’m not just failing at World War II I’m thriving in the Fallout universe. I’m leading an army of radioactive ghouls through post-apocalyptic Utah. I’ve got super mutants with rocket launchers. I invaded a toaster cult and took over a robot factory. I still don’t really know how combat width works, but at least now I can wear power armor while not knowing. It’s way more intuitive, way more fun, and somehow I understand it. Probably because the game isn’t pretending to be historically accurate it’s just chaos, lasers, and lore. I’m still losing wars, but now it’s to talking bears instead of Belgium. Huge improvement.",

The shift to the battle planner, clearer production lines, and simplified unit hierarchy removes the micromanagement hell of HOI3 while still keeping the depth where it matters. National Focus Trees give each country a sense of direction instead of forcing you to dig through menus for every political tweak, and the streamlined logistics and research systems mean you spend more time actually planning wars instead of wrestling with the interface. It’s still complex and maintains that certain level of strategic planning but is more forgiving to new comers(Which was needed in my opinion, I still struggle with HOI3 to this day).",

But now they want us to buy a new DLC for the pacific front. From what I have seen \"No Compromise, No Surrender\" looks cool and I would think about buying it if it wasnt $30 for what should be a rework of an already existing DLC. Paradox please do one of these 3 things: \n1 Refund Waking the tiger for those who bought it and incorparate it into the base game\n2 Give people who bought waking the tiger the new DLC\n3 Lower the price to $10-$15 like DLC's used to be",

      "review": "Hearts of Iron IV is quite simply the best and most comprehensive strategy game based on World War II. Now that nine years have passed since the game's launch, Paradox has added numerous features that help create the feeling of managing your country, and there is really nothing like it in terms of recreating the scale and scope of the war.\r\n\r\nThere are essentially 2 games within HOI; the first is a relatively accurate and historical portrayal of the first part of World War 2. The enemy AI is initially locked into choosing the same path their nation took in WW2 through the focus tree, though it should be noted that the various \"story beats\" can be a little out of time with the real events. The second game is a completely open strategy game set during the Second World War. Do you want to recreate the Mughal empire, or allow Gandhi to forget his pacifism and become the destroyer of worlds he was meant to be? Would you like to endure a 2nd Russian Civil War and bring the Tsar back to power? Within the 4 ideologies in the game (Fascism, Communism, Democracy and Non-aligned), there are a plethora of obscure historical or completely wacky goals for you to achieve, and I like that the achievements encourage you to try out these paths. \r\n\r\nThe game can be as complex as you like, allowing you to meticulously plan operations such as Barbarossa, subdividing your army groups into separate thrusts with strategic towns or supply hubs to capture. The Eastern Front is just as much of a void into which you throw men and material as reality, and if you want to learn the names of obscure Russian towns, there is no better game. You can fully relive D-Day and the liberation of Western Europe, pushing back the veil of totalitarianism. \r\n\r\nTerrain such as mountains, deserts and jungles all have direct impacts on combat, and the game has a dynamic weather system that calculates rainfall, mud accumulation and snowfall. You can give divisions and their commanders medals if they participate in an action worthy of merit. \r\n\r\nThe supply and logistics system is deep and complex, with the game even taking into account the flow of supply up and down rivers, should you own both banks. \r\n\r\nTank, plane, and ship designers allow you to recreate historical vehicles or create monstrosities that should never have seen the light of day. \r\n\r\nThere is a resistance mechanic, linked to occupation laws, compliance and harshness of occupation. \r\n\r\nThere really is so much to learn and adapt to in terms of the limitations of the period, geography and strategic situation. \r\n\r\nNations have a focus tree, which is where the main \"flavour\" and historical (or ahistorical) grounding is laid out. Starting in 1936 or 1939, you must guide your nation by managing the economy, building an armed force and guiding your political and strategic aspirations through World War 2. This is where the main historical (or ahistorical) flavour is delivered, and Paradox have really leaned on this mechanic imported from EUIV. \r\n\r\nAs a fan of history, I love discovering the obscure history of nations that had marginal roles in the war, and events that I'd never heard about, that had a large impact on their respective nations but were somewhat drowned out by the more momentous battles. There are very few nations left now without focus trees, and old major nations like Germany and Japan have had their focus trees ballooned to keep pace with the new additions. \r\n\r\nAll of this barely scratches the surface, and we haven't even gotten to the mod scene yet. HOI4 has some of the most obsessive and creative mods in any game, allowing you to play a strategic game of whatever alternate fiction you desire. Cold War, WW1, Modern Day conflicts like Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, Fallout, Lord of the Rings, My Little Pony, Kaiserreich, all have their respective mods and communities that add many more hours of content. \r\n\r\nProbably my favourite strategy game ever. Get it.",

Seriously, how do you get rid of it if you aren't planning to selfishly steal resources from another country? It says you can reap more by improving infrastructure, but then because of your lack of resources, construction is slower, trapping you in this vicious cycle where your civilian factions are working their socks off to produce only a fraction of what they and the rest of your nation needs, and you therefore can't trade them off to other countries for the resources that  they require to operate in the first place.\n In other words, playing this game as a noob is like that meme where the dog sits on the house on fire saying \"this is fine\".

Hearts of Iron IV understands this truth better than most governments I’ve had the misfortune of rescuing.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment the map unfurls, you feel the weight of nations balanced delicately at your fingertips. The game provides the player with the sort of strategic command usually reserved for prime ministers, generals, and on the rare occasion—certain double-O agents. It’s a grand dance of diplomacy, industry, and military might, and I must say, it does wonders for one’s sense of authority.\r\n\r\nPlaying as the United Kingdom, naturally, was an experience close to my heart. The factories hum like well-trained agents, the Royal Navy stands proud and immovable, and the air force—my personal favourite—soars with the confidence only an island nation can muster. There’s a peculiar satisfaction in watching Britain rise to its rightful place as the calm centre of a storm-tossed world. God save the King, indeed.\r\n\r\nThe political intrigue is so vivid I half expected to receive a classified dossier with every decision. One moment I'm outmaneuvering a would-be dictator, the next I’m organizing the sort of global coalition that would make M raise an approving eyebrow. And should conflict arise—well, Hearts of Iron IV captures the tactical thrill of warfare without any of the mess that usually ends up on my tuxedo.\r\n\r\nIn short, the game is clever, stylish, and dangerously addictive. Much like its greatest British admirer.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy shaping history with precision and charm—and have a particular fondness for keeping the world safe from tyranny—I can assure you, Hearts of Iron IV is a mission well worth accepting.",

Or try making Germany a peaceful democracy (spoiler: not easy). Or go full expansion mode as the USSR and reshape the world map however you like.\nThe best part? Every playthrough feels different.\nOne run you’re struggling with supply lines in Africa, the next you’re dragged into a Balkan conflict, and another time you’re desperately trying to stop the Allies from landing in Normandy.\nThe game is complex—but in a satisfying way.",

      "review": "Unfortunately, I find it necessary to post a review of this and the DLC at this point as the changes and discussion have signaled that this is an intended feature and as such I will be reviewing the game assuming it is intended. While I understand few players actively micro, the battle planner, a feature that allows you to build up a bonus to your units stats while on attack over time if you let them sit on the border with an enemy and put them under Ai control, is a frustrating nightmare of a feature that punishes you for microing through tedium and what are effectively stat penalties. While delegating units to be under AI control is a helpful feature Paradox has decided that it is necessary to balance the game around this feature. \n\nThe first issue is that in order to build up planning bonus you have to assign units to a frontline which gives the AI control of where those units will be placed before the offensive starts. The AI will place units in attrition, place them in bad locations, and simply control everything. The approved way around this would be to manually create many separate small frontlines to gain planning bonus, this takes time and creates a dizzying nightmare of attack orders and frontlines overlapping that are hard to control. As a battle plan is executed and provinces are taken the frontlines will dynamically change and I will have to readjust the lines every couple of seconds. This creates a situation where I am effectively fighting against the battle planner. I will be honest, If this is an intended balance feature as others have mentioned it is an awful design choice. It is mind boggling, no other strategy game has ever introduced tedium as a balance mechanic, the only places you will see such things are in risk vs reward scenarios in games and grindy mmos. No other developer that I can think of has ever done this and for good reason.\n\nThe second issue lies with the idea to penalize directly taking control of your units in the first place, generally the reason for doing so is argued to be that microing is so much more effective that the stat penalties are justified. The scale of the stat buffs for using your planning bonus makes this argument dubious but also this argument only makes sense when the situation is player vs player where some players are microing and some are letting the AI control areas of the attack. In the single player aspect what this argument actually boils down to is they want to lesson the opportunity cost of not microing your units (It also could be an indirect buff to the AI but this doesn't make much sense to me). Thus, I am not supposed to engage at a more in depth level with what is the core feature of the game in a strategy game. This also boggles the mind as I don't know what game exists bellow this. This isn't meant to knock at players who only use the battle planner its just that I can no longer really engage with the mechanics I enjoyed.\n\nIf this is to be assumed to be the intended game design then the game is a frustrating nightmare where you are nearly forced to play at a few layers abstracted away from the actual game, the intended design wants you to have to fight with the AI controlling your units in order to get what you intended done.",

This will make all previous saves useless so that campaign you spent days on is now just over AND if you start a new game you have to learn some new God forsaken mechanic that more often than not adds nothing but makes the game less enjoyable to play. By slowly doing this every couple of months for years It has morphed into something I honestly cannot suggest to anyone. Just do yourself a favor and don't waste your time.

However, there is one major issue that completely ruins the experience: the DLC model.\n\nThe base game feels incomplete, and many features that should have been part of the core experience are instead split across dozens of DLCs. Each expansion adds only a tiny fragment of content, yet many of them are priced almost like brand-new games. At some point the whole experience stops feeling like a grand strategy game and turns into a DLC purchasing simulator, where you're constantly expected to pay more just to access content that should have been included from the beginning.\n\nHOI4 itself is good even great but the monetization strategy is extremely consumer-unfriendly and hard to justify. I originally planned to buy Crusader Kings, Europa Universalis and another game from Paradox as well, but after seeing how aggressively Paradox slices their games into endless paid add-ons, I no longer trust their business model.\n\nBecause of this, despite the game’s quality, I cannot recommend purchasing it or supporting this approach.",

It used to be fun to play this game now it is a pain, from broken AI to, factions that dont work or completely ruin a playthrough, the list goes on\n\nFor example I play as a germany main and with each update the developers have taken a protagonised nation and made it bend to the will of every other nation no matter how small. I can't even get through a playthrough with out the Italians, British, or Americans completely ruin it. Italy cant hold Africa, the British repell all my raids (Air and Naval), Americans seem to have infinite supply even when 30+ units stacked in the middle of the desert with no supply hub.\n\nI know Naval units are not the most useful, but for my playthroughs I like to build a Navy. Never has Naval gameplay been satisfying or understandable, even with the new updates I can't even make a dent in any Navy. I  recently had 5K+ planes flying and they cant even shoot 1 ship. WTF is going on!!!\n\nFactions have always been extremely frustraiting. Random countries declairing war or taking all the terriory I fought for. Allies not fighting or having the worst unit build just for an enemy AI to take even worse units and roll my 40 width tanks.\n\nThere is too much that has been wrong with this game for years and the developers still refuse to fix, and yet still release a DLC that seems like they didn't play test.\n\nFix your game before releasing DLC",

In those years I have never written a review, but now is the time to write a negative review.\n\nYear after year, they announce DLCs about countries from different parts of the world, and they always release them incomplete and with bugs. Instead of dedicating more time to testing them and releasing a proper product, they rush them out for the sake of making money, without polishing the details and without releasing a quality DLC.\n\nBut the last straw was the latest DLC (No Compromise, No Surrender). It's not just the problem they've had with coal, broken events, or some paths impossible to complete. The biggest problem for me, and the most useless and senseless decision, has been not adding the Chinese warlord countries to the base game, but reserving them only for DLC owners. In a game that is supposed to be historical, fixing the map of China with countries that historically should be there, and not making them available to everyone, is a decision that makes no sense at all. Especially considering that in Graveyard of Empires they added the French and Brittish puppets in the Middle East for everyone, not just the DLC owners. It makes no sense that these new countries aren't now part of the base game, despite they are already designed with their flags, leaders, names... They are not even added as a releasable countries, or a initial rule of a fragmented China that includes them. I don't care if they don't have any event related or if they have the generic national focus tree, but they must be in the base game.\n\nFinally, the most disrespectful and unforgivable thing was that, when I complained on the forum and asked them to add them (in a completely respectful manner), their response was a flat refusal, and after asking for a valid reason for their refusal, they banned me from the forum. For me, that crossed the line.\n\nGoodbye to Paradox. After this review, I will uninstall this game that gave me so many hours of fun.

Hearts of Iron IV suffers from all the modern Paradox design issues: an arcade-like base game that becomes bloated and watered down by DLCs, which mostly add more micromanagement just so the numbers on your screen go up faster.\n\nThe base game feels too arcade-like, especially the national focus trees. They are inferior to the old chained events that actually required gameplay to unlock. Now you simply click a focus to “research” things like the invasions of the USSR or Poland or to pop up factories. All this bloat and conflicting gameplay in the national focus trees encroaches on the gameplay of diplomacy and research. The worst part is that it is very difficult to match the historical timing.\n\nStarting a new game with most of the DLC installed requires you to spend over 25 minutes just clicking around and preparing your campaign, like assigning leaders, leveling manufacturers, and so on.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, it doesn’t feel like you’re fighting a real world war with real stakes. There’s very little attention to immersion. Ironically, the best DLC is the WWII speeches, as it is the only addition that truly transports you to that era.\n\nSo I dont recommend playing you will feel empty at the end, like the time you played was wasted, no memories and no soul.",
