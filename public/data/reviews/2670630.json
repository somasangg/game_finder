I just wanted to report this bug before anyone ends up going through the same and getting surprised by this bug/glitch.",

Buggs are occasional, not offten and one server restart fixes them. Game is still getting updates and fixes, which is good. Plays good on Deck. Last update tho, broke the coloring option for furniture, but hopefully they will fix it soon. Recommend this game if you want something addictive.",

I play with my girlfriend and she would love to play as female character not a man. But overall a fun coop game, still having fun and still willing to continue our shop.

I haven't tried the multiplayer version but very much enjoying the single player mode. Online orders, beating people with a bat when they try to steal from your store. Setting prices to make more money. Expanding the store so its bigger and can have more items and have a proper supermarket.

You run every part of the store — ordering stock, setting prices, stacking items, dealing with deliveries, and even scanning products at the register. It’s oddly satisfying watching your tiny store slowly turn into a smooth, profitable business. The gameplay loop feels rewarding, the visuals match the cozy style, and even the occasional bug or chaotic physics moment just makes the experience funnier rather than frustrating. If you enjoy chill but engaging management sims where every small improvement feels meaningful, this game is absolutely worth your time.",

It was annoying to start with but now having multiple staff stacking shelves this system of clicking the staff needs to change. I'm wasting so much time chasing them down individually and then picking up random boxes when I'm trying to click the staff member. Would prefer a level system on the computer for upgrading the staff members speeds ect.\n2) Rubbish under shelving. Not sure if its just me but it can be hard to see rubbish hidden under shelves or in the middle of the round shelf. I've found on multiple occasions if I have to move the shelf, either it wont let me put the shelf back or customers wont see the product on the shelf and I need to save and exit to reset the shelf.

I play it in co-op with my partner and there has been several instances now when we have started playing and the boxes are glitched all over the place. Because the main control comes from the primary game player when the controls go (which is happening everyday now) there is no way of resolving this unless you exit the game which boots everyone and then you lose all progress you have made :(. Since the most recent update we have now found that the re-stockers just stand around looking at the wall or a box and there is nothing that will resolve this unless we exit the game. Also the amount of customers coming in has dropped considerably which means we have gone from earning 7k a day to 2k a day. This means it would takes weeks (in game weeks) to earn enough to expand the shop or storage :(. we have tried 3 times now to play again but its the same each time\nGlitching boxes \nre stockers stuck and staring at walls\nPrimary player controls stop working\nlack of customers\nboxes despawn from shelves and re spawn well anywhere\n\nIts making the game unplayable in co op :(",

It's especially fun to play with friends and have a person who handles each aspect of the daily operations. \n\nSome current bugs that exist in both single player and multiplayer that can get a little annoying, but don't necessarily make me not want to play: \n1. Sometimes the shelf count in the storage rooms aren't right or show a quantity when there is no box there. \n2. Shelves glitch through walls sometimes when they are moved.\n3. On multiplayer specifically, if you've been playing for several hours, the player characters might start glitching into the furniture or crashing.\nThe only solve I've found for the above bugs is to simply save and exit out of the game and then reload.\n\nA few criticisms or things I'd like to see in the future:\n1. Character customization/choice \n2. Fixes on multiplayer as it gets pretty buggy\n3. Better growth/progression - even with loans, it can be difficult to save for bigger expenses as you expand storage and the store even more. Everything only gets more expensive and upkeep of stock in the store can make it feel like a never ending cycle of never getting somewhere at times. \n4. Ability to hire a worker to handle delivering the online orders\n\nA note:\n1. The shelving/fridges have the ability to come in a variety of colors, but the drop down selection has never worked for me so I am unable to take advantage of that customization.

Give me a goddamned toggle option or allow me to remap these ridiculous bindings. \n\nThen I saw that the game allegedly had \"full controller support\" which is wild that they'd somehow get that implemented before a TOGGLE FOR SPRINTING, but it is also a total lie. It's lagging when I'm trying to use the controller and the button labeled \"A\" to drop the box when it's a green highlight just puts it back in my hand rather than set it down, so I'm only able to either throw it or hold onto the box for all eternity. \n\nI just want to be able to play my mindless little game without being irritated that my little dude skipped leg day for all eternity or being in agony because my hypermobile fingers + arthritis despise holding shift. Seriously, how hard is it to have a toggle button? Or, you know, speed slider options in the menu. \n\nAt least they finally gave us save slots. There's still a lot that should have been added before this game left early access.

Which is complete opposite of what capitalist simulator should be. About 90% of the game I had abundance of money and just waiting for days to pass by to accumulate enough customers to get experience for expansion. I was running every product with 50-70% discount to get as much customers as possible. Yet it still took forever because how badly are gaming mechanics optimized (experience per customer is capped at 4-5xp, nothing player can do to improve it)\n\n- Game punishes player for variety of goods and roleplay. From 20 available product licenses it makes sense to buy about 5 of them. Rest is going to decrease profit and not increase number of customers. Name Cleaning supplies and bookshop simulator would be more fitting.\n\n- Limits on number of employees. I can have 6 restockers with stupid conditions to unlock hiring them like owning number of storage racks I don´t even use, because goods just sell so fast it goes right into shelves.

Modders fixed this until devs broke the mods. No workshop support.\n\n- Lacks basic statistics like detailed expenses and information about number of sold product. No option for regular deliveries. Really no depth and quality of life from developers.\n\n- Customers never leave. You can run supermarket with 150 customers per day with single self checkout and they would just wait in line. Yet you can hire 12 people as cashiers, twice the limit of restockers that are actually useful and essential.

Only shoplifters bring a bit of fun. If the real job is more fun then the game it tells alot\n- Town is bare bones. You have few shops around but most of the town is just missed pontential\n- Delivery is tedious and you can't hire anyone to do the job for you. So avoiding deliveres is the best option\n- Most of the time what you do in this game 90% of the time is ordering and restocking because staff can be slow, becomes boring after a while\n- There is no staff satisfaction they are just robots standing and slaving away\n- There is nothing interesting to unlock or see other then expanding what you already have, very bare bones in content\n\nTake a game called \"Supermarket Together\" for a example. A game that is free and offers by far a lot more content, a lot more interesting things to do, taking care of your staff happines, taking care of your customers comfort, hiring a large team, having mutliple tasks to do, hiring your own delivery, unlocking a large skill tree with abilities, running a bigger store, ect.

It's lagging when I'm trying to use the controller and the button labeled \"A\" to drop the box when it's a green highlight just puts it back in my hand rather than set it down, so I'm only able to either throw it or hold onto the box for all eternity. \n\nI just want to be able to play my mindless little game without being irritated that my little dude skipped leg day for all eternity or being in agony because my hypermobile fingers + arthritis despise holding shift. Seriously, how hard is it to have a toggle button? Or, you know, speed slider options in the menu. \n\nAt least they finally gave us save slots.

There's no new fun gimmicks or tools to be had as you level up because the gameplay loop is:\r\n\r\n*Load day\r\n*Order or buy product\r\n*Wait 30+ minutes as your workers stock the store\r\n*Open store\r\n*Make $20 in profit\r\n\r\nAnd the profit margins are razor thin, and the upgrades are exceedingly expensive. There's ways to trick the game into generating an appropriate amount of profit but honestly, Its just boring. The finish line is there but this game is more idler than simulator. I'd almost rather work in an actual grocery store.",

      "review": "So far my opinion on the game as a whole for $25 Canadian is it's okay, I'm having fun with everything supermarket, the problems come when anything not in the initial scope of the game is brought up.\r\n\r\nProblems I have with the game\r\n\r\n- Online Deliveries: At some point you just start getting online deliveries, you don't get to enable/disable them or even set a price or appoint an employee to do it for you. You're simply stuck doing them or letting the order fail.\r\nOh you also only have 1 inventory slot so you have to deliver 1 thing at a time and return to the shop every single time unless you buy a vehicle which gives +1 inventory per tier of vehicle.\r\n\r\n- Mobility: You run fairly fast for someone in a small supermarket, but when you have to go across town to deliver a paper bag with a few things in it you're incredibly slow. You do get access to \"Vehicles\" but it's really just the worst driving possible.\r\nTo elaborate, you're stuck in first person with a messed up FOV that you either get to see price tags or have wider vision, you can turn your head while driving but there's no return so you can't get back to center to know where you're going unless you exit the vehicle and re-enter it.\r\nThe vehicles all make you feel like a geriatric, your acceleration is that of a 8 year old on their first bicycle and your top speed is an RC-Car.\r\n\r\nThe skateboard's kinda fun, but it's really lacking since you aren't much faster than on foot and you're stuck with tank controls, you also don't get extra \"storage\" with the skateboard so if you want storage you have to upgrade to one of the real vehicles but they're just not worth it. (They drive terribly, the city is a hellscape for navigating, you have to pay for gas and there's only 1 gas station)",

      "review": "There are definitely good things to say about the game but that's not helpful.  The concept is great, visuals are good enough but the execution needs a lot of work. \nThe money balancing is really bad once you get a ways in.  You only profit around 1k per day whether you're level 20 or level 40 but any expansions at this point are 10k+.  It's just not fun when you just have to grind the same routine every day and rarely can afford upgrades.\nIt drives me absolutely bonkers that the sizes of the shelves, coolers, freezers, etc are not standardized or related to the room sizes.  It really should be more like every other game with tile snapping with free placement as a toggle option.  There no reason this shelf and that freezer should be a few \"inches\" different in width and oh now you have this gap in the corner where nothing fits.\nThe vehicles are terrible and pointless.  It's faster to run.\nGet the game on sale and you can have a few hours of fun but it really sucks that I'm missing out over half the content of the game because I'm not willing to grind out a few hundred hours to unlock it.",

Luckily, I'm so late to buy this game, but unfortunately, it seems I'm too early to buy this too",
