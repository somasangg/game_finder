FFXIV faz isso comigo. Ele tem esse poder bizarro de acender memórias, emoções e momentos que eu nem sabia que estavam guardados.\r\n\r\nA Realm Reborn foi legal. Sincero. Gentil até. Um começo que não tenta impressionar — só te convida a caminhar. E eu fui. E conforme fui andando, o jogo começou a se revelar: devagar, mas com propósito.\r\nE quando percebi… já era tarde demais. Eu estava investido. Nos personagens. Nos diálogos. Nos pequenos detalhes que o jogo espalha como quem não quer nada, mas que ficam com você dias depois. Nas músicas que parecem falar com partes da gente que a gente não mostra pra ninguém.\r\n\r\nFinal Fantasy XIV tem algo que poucos jogos têm: coração.\r\nNão o tipo óbvio, exagerado — mas aquele coração silencioso que pulsa por trás de cada cena, cada batalha, cada momento de paz entre uma missão e outra.\r\n\r\nE a verdade é que eu poderia escrever um texto gigante — enorme mesmo — mas nenhum faria jus ao quão especial esse jogo é pra mim. Se eu fosse contar cada momento em que me senti cativado por ele, levaria um livro. E talvez ainda não fosse o suficiente.\r\n\r\nNo fim das contas, FFXIV é especial não porque entrega momentos épicos (embora entregue muitos), mas porque te faz lembrar deles. Ele fica com você.\r\nEle te acompanha.\r\n\r\nE enquanto as músicas tocam —  fica impossível não lembrar do porquê esse jogo significa tanto pra mim.\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/dEsSlg39CQ0",

Firstly: You can play hundreds of hours for free with their test-account system and after you played through hundreds of hours of content, you can just start your subscription and continue straight away. The visual style is GORGEOUS. The soundtracks are BEAUTIFUL and the characters are PERFECTLY IN DEPTH. Less important ones a little less, more important ones more. You get the picture. The gameplay loop is very nice aswell as the many quests. Like in every mmo there are boring fetch quests, but FF14 hides them the best imho.\nYou probably will not be disappointed, if it's your first or 10th mmo! The devs really cooked with this one!",

      "review": "Overall Grade: A — Strongly Recommended\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV has stood the test of time, evolving through expansions and updates to remain a cornerstone of the MMO genre. Even with mixed reactions to newer content, its storytelling, community, and worldbuilding continue to set the standard for MMORPGs.\n\nGraphics — B+ \nStylized visuals hold up well, with each expansion adding polish. Character designs and environments are charming, though the engine shows its age compared to newer MMOs.\n\nSound & Music — A+ \nMasayoshi Soken’s soundtrack is consistently breathtaking, with memorable themes and orchestral scores that elevate every expansion. Ambient soundscapes add depth to exploration and combat.\n\nCombat & Gameplay — A- \nCombat is fluid and accessible, with a wide variety of jobs offering unique playstyles. Rotations can feel complex at higher levels, but the system rewards mastery. Some pacing issues exist in newer expansions, yet the core loop remains satisfying.\n\nStory & Quests — A+ \nNarrative is FFXIV’s crown jewel. From A Realm Reborn through Endwalker, the storytelling has been praised as some of the best in the genre. Even with Dawntrail’s divisive reception, the game continues to deliver heartfelt character arcs and epic worldbuilding.\n\nOpen World & Exploration — B+ \nHydaelyn and its expansions are vast and beautiful, with diverse regions to explore. Zone transitions and instancing can break immersion, and exploration would feel even stronger if load screens were minimized or eliminated entirely.\n\nPerformance & Quality of Life — B \nThe game runs smoothly on modern systems, with regular patches improving stability. UI customization and accessibility options are solid, though some legacy systems feel clunky.\n\nBusiness Model — C \nOne major drawback is the subscription system. Once you’ve subbed for a month, you can no longer access the free trial, leaving you locked into monthly pay-to-play. For casual players, this feels restrictive and undermines accessibility.\n\nCommunity & Longevity — A \nFFXIV’s community is famously welcoming, with strong social features like Free Companies, housing, and events. The game continues to evolve, with Square Enix promising further updates to keep it fresh.\n\nFinal Verdict Final Fantasy XIV is more than just a game—it’s a living world with stories, friendships, and adventures that endure. While the subscription model makes this game hard to play casually, the sheer quality of its narrative and community make it one of the most compelling MMORPGs available today.\n\nP.S.

FFXIV is one of the most immersive and emotionally engaging MMORPGs out there, combining beautiful storytelling with a vibrant world full of personality and charm.\n\nThe main story is incredibly well written, with characters that actually grow on you and moments that stay with you long after you log out. The expansion stories are even better, raising the stakes and delivering some of the best narrative arcs in the franchise.\n\nGameplay-wise, the combat system is smooth and rewarding, and every class feels unique and fun to play. The amount of content is honestly impressive: dungeons, trials, raids, crafting, gathering, housing, glamour, side quests, seasonal events… there’s always something to do, whether you’re a casual player or someone who loves optimization.\n\nOne of the strongest points of FFXIV is the community. Most players are welcoming and helpful, and it's easy to make friends or find groups for any type of content. The developers also communicate well and clearly care about improving the game with every patch.\n\nVisually, the game is stunning, from the music to the environments and character designs. The soundtrack alone is worth the experience.\n\nOverall: Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys MMORPGs or the Final Fantasy universe. It’s a game you can enjoy at your own pace, with great storytelling, beautiful world-building, and endless content to explore.",

      "review": "Game has a lot of content for when you start out, so you're never bored. You can easily get distracted from the main story by all the side quests and side lore. The game is in a fairly easy state to pick up at the moment from a difficulty perspective, however there is a long journey if you plan to pick this up for mostly end game content. Once at endgame, your experience will differ based on your interests. If you enjoy the whole game then you will have so much content and collectables to grind for. If you're a raider then there is content spanning back through all the expansions, with you choosing how you tackle them. If you're a story player then there are lots of quests and side quests which explore the lore of the world. Some people will say there is a lack of content however that really comes down to what you enjoy and how you interact with the game. If you only log on to do the main story and dungeons then you will be lacking content between patches, however if you interact with a lot of the game systems, be it crafting, gathering, raiding, glamourer, socialising and collecting to name a few, then you'll have ample to do. \r\n\r\nI mostly play this game for the endgame content, and I can say that it scratches my itch perfectly. Having transitioned over from Destiny 2, this game fills the content itch I was looking for. Some raids (Ultimate and some savage raids) can take a few hours to days to weeks to months, to complete for the first time, while also having other raids (extremes, unreal and earlier savage fights) that can be done in an afternoon to a few days. I often find myself just wanting to jump into a raid, even if the reward is no longer relevant, just because of how satisfying and fun some of the fights are. \r\n\r\nMy main criticism comes from the lack of overworld content outside of hunt trains and fates. It does feel empty when doing fates and exploring outside of the first few launch weeks. \r\n\r\nDefinitely recommend this game for anyone looking for a game to either fill some time, or to be their next main game.",

Due to life, I no longer have the time to significantly dedicate myself to playing and keeping up with this game. That makes me a little sad, as I want to go back, but I'll feel frustrated if I can't dedicate at least a few consistent hours to the experience every other day.\n\nIn the nearly 600 hours I've spent in this game, I never found it boring even once. That's rare, as I almost never sink that much time into a single game. The combat is exciting, the dungeons are exhilarating, bosses are wonderful, and the music is always on point. My favorite part of the game has to be the ambiance and vibe of the cities you can visit.\n\nMore than that, this game got me through a difficult time when I was chronically ill. I'll never get back the lost time in the real world, but this game provided me with an alternative that was, in some ways, maybe as good thanks to the people I met and played with. The community in this game can be worth it just on its own.\n\nThere were days I'd just talk to people in a virtual city, on a beach, or just out and about adventuring.

I'm still in the \"A Realm Reborn\" content, picking flowers and delivering packages like a medieval FedEx driver, and apparently the REAL game doesn't even start until hour 100? Crikey.\n\nFFXIV is like a beautiful, elaborate wedding cake that takes forever to get to the good layers. The early game is a bit of a slog, I won't lie - there's more fetch quests than a golden retriever convention. But the music? Absolutely stunning. Soken went absolutely mental with the soundtrack and I'm here for it.\n\nThe job system is brilliant - one character can be every class, so you don't need to create alts. This is both a blessing and a curse because now I want to level EVERYTHING.\n\nThe community is shockingly friendly for an MMO. People actually say \"hello\" in dungeons and wait for you to watch cutscenes. It's like stepping into a parallel universe where gamers are nice, eh?\n\nWith 73 hours, I can't speak to endgame raids or the later expansions that everyone raves about, but the foundation is solid. The story is picking up, my character looks fabulous, and I'm thoroughly addicted.\n\nJust... clear your calendar. This game is a commitment. Worth it though.",

Finding out I can swap between job even though I played expecting to be stuck with the same job until I chose to make an alt, exploring the areas and their uniqueness, the compelling story that makes you laugh and cry, and how in depth each supporting characters feels.\nThis is my comfort game, the one I will always go back to after taking a break. Whether it's to do content or to mingle with players around the world, from people spending hours clearing savage/ultimates, to those simply gathering and crafting, there is always something for a player to do.\n\nI have met so many people in this game that have become my closest friends, to the point where I've been able to stand next to them irl instead of ingame. And the fact a game such as FFXIV can do this, I will forever be grateful for.\n\nOf course there are my gripes in terms of the grind. I do understand it's to keep people playing the game, but when something takes you weeks, if not months to complete while spending a substantial amount of time doing said content daily can be frustrating.\nBeing on the Materia Data Centre, I have also noticed the struggle of roulettes popping declining over the past few weeks, which had made doing daily roulettes quite time consuming.\n\nAll in all, from the bottom of my heart, please give the game a try! Even if it's not a long term thing, try the experience of the \"Critically Acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV.\"\nThis game has changed my life for the better",

Everyone is very patient and kind with new and veteran players.\n\nIf you ask almost any FFXIV player their favorite part of the game, its not going to be finally unlocking that new mount or minion they have been on the hunt for years for, or even doing treasure hunts with friends. Most of the time you will hear them say something that has to do with the story and I am on the same boat as them!\n\nThe story is Great! its the main reason I got the game and ended up still playing long after i finished the current story is because of all the content and friends I made, the game is this good.\n\n What you do hear from almost everyone is that the story to A Realm Reborn is slow... and that is true, i wasn't really enjoying the story or gameplay throughout the Base game, but i pulled through and got to Heavensward, and OMG the story gets good and the game even BETTER! so if you are struggling to get through the story just pull through it and I think you will find yourself enjoying the game and having a good time. (especially when you get to Stormblood one of my personal favorite expansions when it comes to the story). Also before i forget, there is also an expanded free trial for anyone who wants to try out the game, it allows you to get up to level 70 and play through the base game and the first two expansions (Heavensward and Stormblood) with NO RESTRICTIONS up to that point!\n\nSo please come and join the over 30 million of us FFXIV lovers and experience greatness!\n\nWould absolutely recommend this game to anyone who is a Final Fantasy veteran or for anyone who wants to try out a MMO. \n\n10/10 Game!",

      "review": "Final Fantasy XIV is one of the few MMORPGs with a storyline I genuinely found myself invested in. Without spoiling anything, it’s a tale centered on unity, friendship, and perseverance in the face of hardship. In a gaming landscape overflowing with gacha systems, I found myself searching for something that truly captured the MMORPG experience of my youth—and FFXIV delivered. Its systems and tools felt familiar in the best way, offering that classic sense of adventure I’d been missing.\n\nOne of the game’s strongest aspects is its incredibly welcoming community. New players are marked with a small “sprout” icon, and this simple system goes a long way—veterans immediately recognize newcomers and often guide them through dungeons, mechanics, and early-game confusion. It creates a genuinely supportive environment that makes starting out feel exciting rather than overwhelming.\n\nThat’s not to say the game is without flaws. FFXIV certainly has its share of weaknesses, most notably the recent DDoS attacks that have been affecting the servers. It’s frustrating when downtime hits right as I get off work, but to the game’s credit, the outages have rarely lasted long enough to stop me from playing altogether.\n\nSome players may also feel that the subscription required to play FFXIV is outdated in modern gaming. I can understand that perspective. But when you consider what FFXIV truly is, the model starts to make more sense. The original version of the game released in 2010, back when subscription-based online services—like Xbox Live Gold—were commonplace. While the subscription system it still uses is clearly a remnant of that era, I find it almost endearing. It feels like a fitting trait for what I consider one of the last bastions of old-school MMORPGs.",

This isn't only because that Final Fantasy XIV has a welcoming community, but also the way you can express yourself through fashion, emotes, dances and music can really makes you feel like you are in a living breathing world!\r\n\r\nMy first month in the game I met some lovely people while participating in the Summer Event (one of the many events that are held throughout the year). Little did I know that they would become hugely impactful on my journey playing Final Fantasy XIV and now just recently I am a part of their Free Company, a small tight-knit family community that makes you feel like you always have a home to return to.\r\n\r\nAs a game by itself Final Fantasy XIV has a lot to offer. A wonderful story that has many emotional moments, including interesting and funny side quests, a beautiful world to explore, lots of fun (and at times quite challenging) Dungeons, Trials and Raids from 4 to 24 players at a time. As you explore you'll discover places such as the Gold Saucer, that has Mini games to play including jumping puzzles and Chocobo Racing! There are many extra things I haven't mentioned and no doubt a lot that I am yet to discover myself, because I am still a Sprout (New Player)!\r\n\r\nI do honesty believe that Final Fantasy XIV has something to offer for everyone and if you allow yourself to open up and get involved with the community, then you will have a wonderful experience!",

      "review": "This is probably one of the best MMOs to have ever been made, I can really only speak up to the Stormblood expansion but I think it is the quintessential MMO.\n\n\nIt's very easy to compare to World of Warcraft since WoW has dominated the MMO sphere since it's release in 2004... yet it does a lot of things differently.\n\nFirst and foremost this IS a mainline Final Fantasy game through and through, that is a major strength as the story is well written, albeit in the case of XIV... it uses very verbose poetic archaic language and that takes some getting used to, but works well in the context of the world. It's a Final Fantasy game first, and an MMORPG second. Here is where I feel the comparison between it and World of Warcraft come into play the heaviest. Not to bash World of Warcraft or Blizzard, but... World of Warcraft, especially in modern times only cares about getting the player into end-game content, previous story elements and any sense of linearity of the storyline are cast aside, the player without a guide is often left clueless and wandering and that's to say nothing for the lack of in-game community.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIV offers the exact opposite of that. Playing though the mainline story is an experience and part of the leveling process. The leveling content actually matters to the overall story and it engages with the player. However people often refer to A Realm Reborn's story as a bit of a slog... that's not without reason, but once you've gone through later expansions it might not hurt to start a second character and go through ARR a second time to re-experience it and you might find that you missed a lot of elements you might have otherwise enjoyed with the newer context.\n\nMechanically the game is very solid, the community is engaged... though not as much as they used to be.\nThe only REAL caveat I'll say about this game is that you shouldn't buy it until you've gone through the totality of the Free Trial or there is something in the paid experience that you really really need to experience.\n\nEveryone glazes Heavensward, and with good reason. It was one of the best stories I've ever experienced in a video game, period.\n\nHonestly in a world where the MMO sphere seems to be dwindling by the day, especially mmos of this calibre and quality, Final Fantasy XIV stands as a beacon to future game developers as to what an MMO can and should be.",

      "review": "I've played since Stormblood and tried everything this game has to offer. From Raiding (albeit, not a lot) to Roleplaying, I put my all into this game to see if it this game was worth it putting over 4.6K hours into the game and in all honesty? I'm extremely conflicted as I am writing this because I realize I can't really say that I can or cannot recommend FFXIV to the average player who wishes to have an MMO experience because of one thing that is completely holding it back in general: The community.\n\nSquare Enix tries their absolute hardest to make sure that this game is for everyone. The changes they made to jobs, the fight design, the content, literally everything is influenced by player feedback. This is like a Monkey Paw because, thanks to the community, a lot of the jobs have been changed to such a degree that some of them are not enjoyable to play or too simple to play. I am looking directly at Summoner, one of my favorite jobs in all of Final Fantasy, being one of the least enticing and boring jobs to play at max level. The rotation is mindbogglingly boring and we gotta thank the community for making such a large hissy fit that jobs are too difficult or have a too complicated kit to use. But noone wants to point fingers at them to realize that we have been the problem all along, it's Square Enix who made these changes by giving into our demands.\n\nSince I am talking about community, this game is an MMO. You are supposed to interact with people online, establish friendships and find groups or free companies, etc. Funnily enough, the only time I ever had that type of interaction was when I stumbled upon an FC in the middle of roleplaying in Uldah. That was also my first interaction with people as well, I still have contact with one of them after their FC disbanded YEARS ago. Since then, I have not had an interaction like this with strangers since. As the expansions went on and on, I genuinely believe that the social aspect of the game is almost nonexistent outside of a very few handful of cases and it bothers me a lot as I usually categorize MMOs to have this social interaction with the playerbase. This makes the only social interactions in this game revolve around usually around either roleplaying or visiting venues. Very rarely will it be in other instances like the Bozja raids but other than that, you will almost never interact with any other player aside from saying \"hello\" or \"ty for the run\" when finishing a dungeon.\n\nRaiding to me has been at first quite the pleasant time, believe it or not. I started my first Savage Raid experience in 7.1 after the game decided to not give mid-core players an ounce of attention (thanks Dawntrail) and I wanted to do something new to see if Raiding was for me. I am not good at the game, according to my logs and I accepted that I will need to improve or change to another job in order to get a better parse. However, parses don't mean anything to me, the achievement and mount you get from the raids is all I need to show that I can do some harder content as well. After a month of being unable to beat Wicked Thunder, I quit the static and thought I could ask my FC to help me get the clear later once I have better gear through the next few patches. The static I used to be part of decided to send me screenshots of them beating that fight without me, taunting me with the clear. I was pretty demotivated afterwards and I didn't want to be part of a static again since. This was my only interaction with a raiding group, there have been multiple things happening as well within the group that I won't get into but my experience should not be a reflection of what every raiding group will be like. In general, I really like raiding but because of that one interaction, I am struggling to find motivation of finding another group and getting the clear as well as continue raiding in general as I don't want to be the one dragging the team down due to my lackluster performance when a group can find better players than me. If you want to raid, go for it.\n\nIf you wish to hear me talk about the story, I won't. I personally like it up until Dawntrail, Endwalker was already a bit rocky but Dawntrail made me want go back to installing Classic WoW just so I won't have to babysit a privileged Mary Sue. Instead, you get to hear me praise the encounter design which is absolutely astonishing in DT along with the music that plays during raids, dungeons and trials. While World of Warcraft strives in making music for the areas you visit while levelling (like Westfall or the Barrens), SE goes dummy in making memorable boss fight or dungeon music combined with the encounter design that plays and feels good with the mechanics they throw at the player.\n\nI will end it off by saying that I want to recommend this game. I really really do. I will probably play the game again one day to finish the Dawntrail story and level up my Disciples of Land & Hand to the next maximum level they will introduce in another expansion. This is all a personal review, don't take it with a grain of salt, it's my experience afterall. Yours might very well either differ from mine or be an almost identical experience as a whole too. If you experience any kind of negativity, it's usually best to step away from some time and play something else or find different people. Just make sure you have fun.",

But by the end of the first expansion its an incredibly fun game with a deeply interesting plot. I would say give the free trial a chance since it takes you up into the later expansions for free.

      "review": "Final Fantasy XIV is \"sunk cost fallacy - the game\" and it really feels like the many longtime players telling you \"it get's better later\" are part of some pyramid scheme they're trying to push on you.\nI got through the entirety of \"A Realm Reborn\" and a good chunk of the boring slog beyond that which you have to trudge through to get to Heavensward.\n\nI'm sure the story get's better, I'm sure the cutscenes get more flashy and the voice acting improves, I've seen the videos talking about the expansion storylines. But the greatest story in the world is worth jack shit if it is delivered in this padded, uninspired way where 90% of the time all you do is run across the map doing dull delivery quests for NPCs. The story also relies heavily on you being invested in the Scions who I did not find to be particularly likable or interesting, but you're forced to join them anyway.\n\nThe pacing in this game is awful. It feels like it's intentionally padded to nickle and dime you for the monthly subscription. The writing has it moments but overall NPCs are way too wordy and verbose and it feels like the writers are just padding themselves on the back for how huge their vocabulary is and for all the clever puns they can come up with; it makes most NPCs feel very artificial.\n\nExploration is basically non-existent because there's nothing interesting to discover just venturing out on your own, the FATEs are a neat idea but most of the time you can't engage with them because they're outside of your level range.\n\nCombat consists of pressing the same 3-4 buttons over and over again while dodging telegraphed attacks. The game is also trivially easy throughout the entire main story. There is absolutely no build variety within your chosen job whatsoever but atleast you can level all jobs on one character, that's pretty cool. New player experience sucks too, you can't take your time in dungeons and take in the vibes because you're gonna get rushed by other players who are just in here to level, the only solution to this is playing a tank since then you're the one dictating the pace.\n\nFinally, the game feels very derivative. The different player races are mostly cripped from Final Fantasy XI with the interesting bits sanded off. The game is also filled to the brim with fanservice and references to the other FF games which was honestly the most entertaining part for me as a longtime FF-fangirl but it also leads to FFXIV feeling like it doesn't have much of an identity of it's own.\n\nEven if the game does a complete 180° later and turns into a completly different, much better experience it is not worth the 100+ hour time investment to get there. I know MMOs are slower paced and deserve more of a grace period than other games but the time FFXIV spends drip feeding you boring slop is still unacceptable. In the time it takes to get through ARR you could play through multiple of the older FF games and have a much better time. I'm sure some people will say \"well it's an MMO, what did you expect\" but I don't think that's an excuse. I'm playing through Guild Wars 2 right now and it has none of these issues.\n\nDon't fall for the weird, cultish hype FFXIV players have built around this game, it is not worth your time.",

      "review": "the best way to describe this game is as a movie. the gameplay itself can best be described as sterile: from the beginning, the developers have eroded any sense of character or fun that you may have been able to get out of the actual core gameplay-- which is running dungeons, and endlessly pressing the same sequence of buttons, over and over. the combat, as with most mmos, has no depth outside of memorization. some might say the depth comes from fight mechanics, wherein you must complete certain movements to avoid raid-ending of heavy-damage attocks from bosses.. however, these are just jumping hoops. fundamentally, it's the same thing: buttons on repeat, with just some special running around having been added. the combat does not feel good. if yo uwanted a game where it feels impactful to press a button, where mechanics matter, this isn't it. if you want a game that's been dumbed down enough, become sterile enough, that it doesn't really have any character outside of how absolutely benign it is, then you may enjoy it.",

      "review": "The purpose of this review is not to be part of the bandwagon of bad criticism around the game, the real purpose of it is to talk about the current state and my personal thoughts on it. Keep in mind since this is a long, unedited and raw review I will put the other half in the comments section.\n\nLet me start by saying I loved this game. I loved the community who took part since I first started the game (late Shadowbringers). This whole game has been a blast and I've never been happy with the service, but I want to say that it's time to part from it (Hopefully for now)\n\nIn short I want to say that I met an amazing group of friends, and confidently enough I want to say that from one situation to another, I don't regret it. In another sense, this game will continue to get worse.. and the bigger the game gets, the worse the development and the community will be all together.\n\nI've put about 2.5k hours into the game, I officially took a break at the release of Dawntrail and every now and then would go for PvP, but I saw a lot of the game's bad criticism from the start to the current content of this game. So I want to start slow and give my final thoughts about the game and how it feels going in and out.\n\nThe multiplayer feels non-existant at first, and getting people into the game feels like a chore if they all decide to start quitting back to back - Now the entire game is a glorified single player game, there's a lot of multiplayer content but I'd say it sounds more like endgame content once you're done with the entirity of the story. Lets say that you got a group of buddies, you're done with the game and you'd love to help them. You kind of almost can't because they're going to be in the free roam doing quests, then instances, then trial or dungeon and rinse and repeat for the next 500+ ish hours. There's a lot of multiplayer content mind you, but you first have to play a ton to actually get there... if not you can always buy skips. Skips prevent people from learning the game mind you.\n\nThe entire game is cosmetic - In endgame, after you finish through all of the game, the real content is fashion, and sure the game has stats but you pretty much farm for items just to look cool or to be caught up for the bigger and harder content. Your character's stats feel like it doesn't matter, same with the gear, materia and job. At the end of the day your character is cosmetic and the only thing that requires brain power is the telegraphed mechanics, the math in terms of crafting and specially the muscle memory on which player does their rotations the best. Also, forgot to mention drops on a lot of things are horrible, so expect to be farming like crazy. After completing the story, aside from just story it all feels empty, and the open world feels like playing section based areas like Borderlands. Don't get me wrong, a lot of the multiplayer content is super fun... deep dungeons and stuff like bozja and zadnor are both my jam, and stuff like the firmament is also addictive, there is a lot of really fun stuff to do in the game, but at the end of the day it's all about getting that sweet cosmetic.\n\nThe modding scene and the game's image - I'll be honest, I am fine with mods in any game.. the problem is the people and how out of hand the scene has become to the point on how the game now looks for people who don't play the game or there's actually no appeal on why to play the game aside from the story and the friends you make. You're going to find a lot of things with the modding scene, from quality of life plugins, to UI, to making the game somewhat easier or if not you're going to also find how thirsty and how pornographic the game has become outside of the console atmosphere. \n\nThis has led to multiple public issues:\n- Venue dramas like the famous Night Club Summer Bash incident, where somebody bought a billboard in specific states in america using Square's official assets, trademark, custom poses and on top of it modded assets and datamined content like the moonfire faire outfits which were only accessible through one other plugin. This was a promotion to an erp / rp beach party.\n- The lovense sponsorship where someone used the game's modded gpose to promote a toy.\n- A plugin where you could go even further on how to stalk a player in game, showing histories on where they were in the game, other characters in that player's account and etc. It could have been much worse, people were even scared if it would catch personal information even.\n- The now recent plugin where you can sync mods with other players, where it lead a whole to community start an outrage, file petitions and review bomb over the fact that square shut down their favorite mod that encourage them to do things that FROM THE BEGINNING IT WAS STATED THAT IT WAS AGAINST TOS.\n- There's a bunch of other issues, that includes a botting problem, scripting problem, malware issues coming from the mod syncing, to even a reshade fork having some pesky DRM or malware integrated.  Also I forgot to mention, this also includes the people who parse too.\n\nIn short, there's quite a lot more, and unfortunately if they decide to put a strong anticheat into the game, the remaining amount of players depending on all of this will drop like flies and even worse the mods (pornographic or not) and the role playing scene is what's keeping them alive to begin with, and thats what it feels like. \n\nIn the case of a game like VRChat, they implemented EasyAntiCheat but the playerbase didn't seem to decline, because a lot of the mods are being shoved into the game slowly but surely, specially the ones that are accessibility related, in the case of this game if it gets implemented the game's over.\n\nI'm not forgetting though, there is a strong scene of players that actually just play the game, and that included the console playerbase. I respect those people, and majority of the people who continue to mostly clear content. At the end of the day, do whatever and have fun.\n\nThe community and the social aspect of it - I'm admitting that there is some very lovely people in the game, very very amazing kinds of people but just like any other community it's as bad as the others. The community specially the roleplaying communities are incredibly toxic. Most of the drama can be even taken out of the game, everything regarding mods as mentioned before, american politics, religion, sexualities, gender, literally the list goes on including relationship drama (Part of these issues also comes from developers and VA's too, not saying that they do a lot of this stuff but some of the stuff said on BlueSky specifically have been out of hand). This game is cluttered with drama queens, stalkers, accusers, harassers and its even infested with sex pests, so not only its filled with so much gooning, you're pretty much not safe if you interact a bit too much. One of the biggest problems going on right now even includes players making really heavy real life threats in a live event with other real players only because they're being disagreed on politically.\n\nNow ignoring the outside of the game portion there has been a lot of drama regarding the gameplay itself, the game has become much easier, and there was a point that people cleared parts of the game without a healer, where it lead to a great healer strike making healers play horribly on purpose which literally lead to absolutely nothing. Hell, samurai nerfs, black mage being shafted patch to patch, dragoon being more braindead and this list also goes on. This game has become too damn easy, of course you just need to learn only two things.. mechanics and rotations and thats it. \n\n\nThe social aspect of it revolves around venues, free roaming, main cities and just normal player interactions.. except you kind of begin to notice that even the most basic part of the game which is that is also incredibly flawed, part of those flaws will be mentioned up next with yoshi p's stuff.",

So if you're Canadian like I am, be prepared to pay 1.40x more for everything. \n\nThis game is dated and needs some TLC. Back in 2017, this was a top of the line as far as how nice the game looked and ran. I know most don't play for the graphics, but it's a subscription based MMO - character models shouldn't be as minecraft-looking as they are in 2025. \n\nI admittedly am not a big quester when it comes to games and MMO's, and I hopped into this game knowing that it would be quest heavy. \n\nI made a black mage and got up in my 50's on it when I experienced Post-ARR MSQ hell. None of my friends that recommended this game to me told me anything about this, knowing that I advised them I'm not huge on questing. \nAfter completing what I thought was a lot of quests with little reward, I started wondering how much more quests were left to go before the MSQ was done and I could get my skills. After feeling like end wasn't in near sight at all, I google'd my progress and realized that I was TWENTY out of EIGHTY quests in. And from what I've been told, this is a massive improvement from what it used to be (around 300 quests or so?). \nThese quests are not short enough to merit doing 80 of them when your class has skill locks that only unlock by completing the MSQ. Each quest gives about 0.002%-0.003% experience at level 56. Needless to say, it was going to take HOURS to complete all of these MSQ's and hit 60 before doing more quests to unlock my skills for my class. Outrageous to say the least.\nThe ragequit point for me was the fact that Square Enix sells an item on their website that bypasses all of these quests and puts you right into heavensward. \nSo Square Enix knows this part of the game is hated and completely unacceptable to their already paying customers. But instead of making it better for their paying players, they decided to monitize it to take even more money out of something because it was intentionally tedious to complete without this bypass (for $9 USD.).\n\nAfter finding this out, this game was uninstalled, subscription was canceled and I won't return. I'll spend my money some other place where the game developers actually care about their players instead of making their experience miserable to people that bought the base game, downloadable content AND their monthly subscription.\n\nDo better, Squeenix.",

      "review": "A very rigid and instanced quasi-open world RPGMMO with a storyline that goes from generic to quite above the JRPG average, only to end up in the 10th circle of hell - atrocious lolrandom self-inserting. [strike]classes[/strike] Jobs keep getting homogenized to the point where most play almost exactly the same with different visuals, dungeons are meticulously engineered to take exactly the same amount of time, with the exact same structure of 3 bosses with 4 packs of trash mobs inbetween (separated in 2 with an arbitrary wall, just in case the player feels like actually making decisions!), and the critically acclaimed storyline tends to tediously insist on certain tropes later on, making me wish for Heavensward again. Creative[strike]ly bankrupt[/strike] Studio III seems to really love the idea of taking away the player's agency every step of the way, as demonstrated not only by XIV's MSQ being comprised in 90% of cutscenes with full on fade-in, fade-out, camera-pan-across-the-area displays of cinematic grandeur for 3 lines of dialogue you'll forget after 5 minutes, but can also be seen in FFXVI - the game all the talented staff members left for, as it clearly shows in anything XIV released after Shadowbringers. Behind the wall of insufferable quest design though, lies an audiovisually stunning (yet gameplay wise repetetive) PvE endgame. Still, given the very enthralling first time experience, excellent player onboarding process and half of the game falling under the free trial, I'd say it's definitely worth giving a try, since by the time you get to the parts I complain about here, you'd have already sunk a couple hundred hours in. \n\n(to not come off as a doomposter: the game's side content and pve encounter design in the otherwise horrible dawntrail are all VERY good!!! especially aac m1-m4 cuz i didn't like the second section that much)\n\noh yeah and the housing system is predatory artificial scarcity dogshit, so if that's what you're looking for in an mmo you might enjoy gw2 more (or the upcoming wow xpac if you love being let down)",

      "review": "After half a decade of hearing about the great story that FFXIV offers, I finally decided to give it a chance.\n\nIt starts really slow, ARR being a slop, but with a 10/10 momemnt right before the first expansion starts. Then the overall quality of the game takes a sharp rise, and even though I was not really smitten by the HW story, it wasn't bad. StB was meh with a great ending, and I pushed through it with the promises of two amazing expansions following.\n\nAnd I really enjoyed SB. It had some weaker moments (I hate trolleys now), but I would say it is a solid 9/10 story, so I was really hyped about Endwalker. And it started strong. I especially loved how grim and mature the game was in the Garlemald zone (even though I really dont think the skimpy Vera were really necessary). But after that?\n\nWTF?!\n\nRight now, after a large story moment in the first trial, the game took such a drop that I have zero interest in continuing. I am stuck with some frickin' space rabbits, quests are about tasting their frickin' carrots and wearing silly clothes. The story cutscenes went from fighting for a future of the world to watching one of the creatures running around in panic with \"funny\" music playing in the background. Peak comedy...\n\nI will probably finish this expac, just to see the story to its conclussion, but I lost every ounce of respect for the game. It doesn't know what it wants to be - dark, mature fantasy or stupid, over-the-top carefree JRPG.\n\nIt certainly has its moments, some of them were incredibly good. But these pearls are hidden in a great pile of manure which is the rest of the game. I have played for over 200 hours and enjoyed about 30 of them.\n\n3/10 overall.",

      "review": "I can recommend but I have quite a few issues here. For the MSQ, it is great. I can't fault it, at least until Dawntrail. Class quests can be equally as enjoyable. But the whole point of an MMORPG is to have those fun role playing aspects, which tie into mounts, glamour, coop content, and collections in general.\r\nHowever, after having played 2.8k hours of this non-stop, I can say it has some glaring issues and very unrealistic expectations for the player.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the job (Classes) grind is way too high. There is no 'right way' to get each one to max level. Which results in a mish mash of either fates or duty roulette's to finish it. You also need to unlock other side content to have a more entertaining duty roulette. And for some stupid reason class quests lock abilities, so you have to waste time doing these. \r\n\r\nSecond major issue is the collection aspect. Glamours are limited to 800 storage (With too many to store), and 20 plates. Minions can't comment on, but mounts have so many issues in terms of acquisition and method. Some are too RNG dependent, others aren't but have a really steep learning curve (such as Savage raiding) which is also RNG because you have to be lucky enough to be the one to roll it. So F me I guess for beating a hard raid and getting nothing? Not to mention, why aren't these farmable on the normal versions? Oh, and there is a mount in the game that requires completing 366 fates + 100 more hours of time to get. AND there are mounts that are timegated to 48-72 hours, from S ranks which are required for an achievement (You need 1000 of these, they spawn on any data centre and count but still a nuisance) \r\n\r\nAnd a side thing, relic weapons can be extremely unfair and grindy. \r\n\r\nThird, the endgame, has so many systems it is hard to keep track, it feels way too excessive. Topping off currency and getting latest gear (Latest currency is timegated). At the same time, I do not like how many times I need to do things. Faux Hollows requires 2x completions (and competing with RNG for some reason at times too), weeklies are difficult to track at times too.\r\n\r\nFourth, crafters make no sense. Once you do your first one, you've done them all. There's no identity. They're all the same. So why can't we just automatically get the others to max level after the first? Or do them all at the same time as one, like shared XP. \r\n\r\nFinally, it is really held back by an outdated combat system. I'm not really talking about class design which has issues in itself (like no AOE until level 30, 40 or 50 depending on which it is). It's more to do with the Global Cooldowns, and abilities. Which typically bypass it, BUT, you cannot spam more than 2 buttons at once. Which is so contrary to some class design here. It doesn't make any sense. Not to mention servers can be really laggy, I've had it in PVP where my character is killed behind cover or my buttons do not work, and PVP is awful by the way, too many stuns, too many unbalanced systems like Battle High, and can be very one sided, at least talking Frontlines, but I have had it in 5v5s too. Also stupid design choice to make classes have LATE GAME ABILITIES when playing at a lower level, so these don't make sense to a new player. \r\n\r\nMy review for Final Fantasy XIV would have been positive. I have a list of good aspects in this game. Personally though, I find myself bordering burnout every single time I come across a stupid game design choice, I just feel like slapping someone. I look in the mirror and see someone very slappable, but that's besides the point. I think FFXIV is a very enjoyable experience, in the right areas, the Manderville quests are comedy gold so far. and the community in game for the most part is very friendly, outside of a few not so PC comments. Think of this review as a 'player beware'. If you like collection, AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS, IT WILL BREAK YOU. IT WILL. PLEASE FIX THESE SYSTEMS SQUARE ENIX!",

      "review": "In short, the single player aspects aren't fun and the multiplayer aspects can be quite inaccessible.\n\nThe story has its nice points but it is delivered poorly. Just hundreds of hours of watching cutscenes with extremely minimal gameplay in between. It's also designed to be a single-player experience, so you can't even meaningfully do the story with friends other than to walk to the next quest objective together. I booted up this game to play a MMO, not a single player visual novel.\n\nAnd yet, the designers didn't seem to account for the fact that this single player-focused story is the core of a MMO. You need to have a good internet connection to get through cutscenes (and Square Enix's servers use some awful network hops if you don't want to also shell out for a VPN). And instead of making each expansion self-contained and letting new players catch up to endgame more quickly, you have to slog through every single expansion before you can really play with other people.\n\nEndgame content is never designed with longevity in mind and while there may be organised groups for old content, it's not an option for people who can't play during peak hours (and while they have the technology for letting you play on another region's servers, it is only enabled for the Oceanian server, which is such a ghost town that you can't even easily queue into dungeons). And yet, endgame content is always locked behind finishing the story.\n\nEffectively, the only MMO part of this game exists at the end of an extremely long single player story. And while there may be smaller pockets of multiplayer gameplay that are more accessible, like the dungeons, they have been polished down so much over time that they are just very dull.",

      "review": "Final Fantasy XIV is \"sunk cost fallacy - the game\" and it really feels like the many longtime players telling you \"it get's better later\" are part of some pyramid scheme they're trying to push on you.\nI got through the entirety of \"A Realm Reborn\" and a good chunk of the boring slog beyond that which you have to trudge through to get to Heavensward.\n\nI'm sure the story get's better, I'm sure the cutscenes get more flashy and the voice acting improves, I've seen the videos talking about the expansion storylines. But the greatest story in the world is worth jack shit if it is delivered in this padded, uninspired way where 90% of the time all you do is run across the map doing dull delivery quests for NPCs. The story also relies heavily on you being invested in the Scions who I did not find to be particularly likable or interesting, but you're forced to join them anyway.\n\nThe pacing in this game is awful. It feels like it's intentionally padded to nickle and dime you for the monthly subscription. The writing has it moments but overall NPCs are way too wordy and verbose and it feels like the writers are just padding themselves on the back for how huge their vocabulary is and for all the clever puns they can come up with; it makes most NPCs feel very artificial.\n\nExploration is basically non-existent because there's nothing interesting to discover just venturing out on your own, the FATEs are a neat idea but most of the time you can't engage with them because they're outside of your level range.\n\nCombat consists of pressing the same 3-4 buttons over and over again while dodging telegraphed attacks. The game is also trivially easy throughout the entire main story. There is absolutely no build variety within your chosen job whatsoever but atleast you can level all jobs on one character, that's pretty cool. New player experience sucks too, you can't take your time in dungeons and take in the vibes because you're gonna get rushed by other players who are just in here to level, the only solution to this is playing a tank since then you're the one dictating the pace.\n\nFinally, the game feels very derivative. The different player races are mostly cripped from Final Fantasy XI with the interesting bits sanded off. The game is also filled to the brim with fanservice and references to the other FF games which was honestly the most entertaining part for me as a longtime FF-fangirl but it also leads to FFXIV feeling like it doesn't have much of an identity of it's own.\n\nEven if the game does a complete 180° later and turns into a completly different, much better experience it is not worth the 100+ hour time investment to get there. I know MMOs are slower paced and deserve more of a grace period than other games but the time FFXIV spends drip feeding you boring slop is still unacceptable. In the time it takes to get through ARR you could play through multiple of the older FF games and have a much better time. I'm sure some people will say \"well it's an MMO, what did you expect\" but I don't think that's an excuse. I'm playing through Guild Wars 2 right now and it has none of these issues.\n\nDon't fall for the weird, cultish hype FFXIV players have built around this game, it is not worth your time.",

      "review": "f you're considering buying this game and you're coming from another MMO, there's one fatal flaw you should be aware of beforehand.\nUnlike most other MMOs, Final Fantasy XIV locks its content not behind levels, but behind its story. So even if you level your character to max using dungeons, open-world content, PvP, or raids, you'll still be locked out of 90% of the content and game systems unless you've progressed through the story.\nThis story spans 978 quests, requiring you to play through all five expansions plus their patches. Even if you play daily, it would take around 200–300 hours to complete. The story itself isn’t bad—in fact, it’s great—but the gameplay loop is so mind-numbing that it can make you resent the narrative.\nHere’s how it goes:\nYou watch a cutscene, do a fetch or “kill X amount” quest, then watch another cutscene. Repeat that cycle 10–15 times, and you finally get to do a dungeon (which you can run with NPCs). During all of this, you can just mash your head on the 1–2–3 keys and win 99% of the time.\nThe fun, challenging fights that force you to learn and adapt as a player are so rare and spaced out that you’ll forget they exist. If you're lucky, you’ll get two or three of those per expansion.\nThe phrase “It gets better later” should be the official motto of this game and its community:\n- “When will my class (job) get more complex and fun?” — It gets better later.\n- “When will the story speed up?” — It gets better later.\n- “Do the fights ever get more engaging than this?” — It gets better later.\nAnd they’re not wrong—it does get better. But only after 200–300 hours.\nThe best thing your friends can do while you invest those hours is walk you to quests or join you in low-level content that you’ll only touch once as you slog along to the next main quest.\nThis demand for such a massive time investment before “it gets better later” has created a divide between players. There are fewer and fewer of us at endgame. Unless Square Enix finds a way to fix this—besides selling story skips in the cash shop—I can’t recommend this game.",

Probably due to the fact the types of people who enjoy that kind of thing, are majority of the players for the game for quite some time. And it makes sense when you look at it in a business standpoint, where you don't need to keep creating new and exciting things, when you have a large amount of people who's enjoyment comes from primarily sitting/standing doing nothing or talking like a chatroom. \nas i've said with a lot of things i've enjoyed that's been ruined, it's always 'Profit over Passion'.\n\nThe way it reflects in the game itself, is that has turned the ''content'' it has now, into almost an auto battler with zero repercussions. You will find you will never fail in this game, unless people are really not giving the bare minimum of having their eyes open slightly. It is so bad, it has completely nullified a role in the trinity system and has never been addressed or dealt with since endwalker release, when a tank named WAR had it's kit so disgustingly broken that it couldn't die in any forms of ''normal'' content over level 60. Something i preached that they would fix hopefully by dawntrail, because fundamentally breaking core game mechanics is not good game design. But they doubled down and made ALL tanks the same and made healer nothing more than a 1 button press for 40 minutes Role.\nAnd while i understand people can love these things about a game, this game didn't start this way. So you almost feel a bit cut off from a game you love and were passionate about.\nYou really FELT this with midcore content, something that just evaporated in EW and continues to be gone. So your only choice was Roulettes and doing a weekly raid \nwhich had no difficulty and classes that all played/felt the same. A large portion of time in EW i had almost fallen asleep multiple times and outright refused to do my weekly Alliance raid because EW raids were a walking sim, since the mechanics gave you 3-5 working days before ending cast. \nComing from Nier Raids to that, is such a steep drop. I mean i used to do content for 'fun', i know it's a crazy notion, but i would run leviathan eden over and over again just for the music. But EW onward, everything went downhill from music to gameplay. Apart from Zeromus EX, actually the most enjoyable fight i ever did even tho the difficulty of it felt like 'normal' difficulty shadowbringers and before.\nThere is a ton of issues with the gameplay, that i won't get into any further since this is really just a 'get off my chest' type of review. \n\nThe community, is incredibly hit or miss. From cult like behaviour ever since the award the game was given for best community back around shadowbringers. The games playerbase gives an almost facist and entitled mindset, which ironically made it such a toxic environment to be in since then.\nBefore i played ffxiv, i came from very games with notable toxicity issues, but ffxiv is genuinely the worst i've ever experienced. \nNot to mention GMs seemingly handing out bans based on their mood. So good luck if you said ''Sh*t'' ''f*ck'' in the context of yourself making a mistake or talking to a friend. Because in a game with implied SA, Death and all sorts of adult themes, 16 year olds can see that in (profanity filter btw) chat!\n\nAnd not to mention a grotesque modding scene, that the devs know about but won't put anti cheat in because they know it will kill what is keeping the game currently alive. Even when said mods were getting personal information or people were making the worst type of pornographic content you can think of.\n\nThis used to be a wonderful game, that i sunk so many hours in. Met a lot of ''interesting'' people and made a lot of memories. \nI miss that game i played greatly. \nBut this game is a victim of Profit over passion. \na cow for SE to milk for it's other projects. \nAnd the loss of my account was probably a good thing in some ways, because i was holding onto something that was already gone.\n\nIf you enjoy what i consider the negatives, then please go enjoy yourself. If what i said puts you off this game, then please find something else.",

It means nothing to beat an ultimate when half the ultimates use an outside resource(Auto Trigger) to assign people numbers on what they need to do during mechs.

I have uninstalled and won't be looking back. Not only that but the recent surge of negative reviews are from people leaving BECAUSE OF MODS. This game is just too much.

The quality of the story dropped to an unrecognizable low, during Dawntrail, the new expansion. \nTo the point that I would have preferred for the game to find it's permanent end in Endwalker, than to ever had had the displeasure of trudging through Dawntrails poor attempt at a story.\n\nTHE CONTENT:\nSomehow the devs seem to have forgotten (or thrown away) formulas that were reliably working for them.\nStuff like the new exploration zone+ its special dungeon have literally regressed  design-wise, abandoning the things that made the previous iteration so successful.\n\nThe combat content in general is still ok, but I can't help feeling that the devs are unsure what to do with class identity. And after the changes some of the classes have suffered thru the last few years, I wouldn't have high hopes either.\n\nTHE SCHEDULE:\nWhile I understand devs cannot push out content faster than they do, they should ensure the content that they do push is long lived and that players have a reason to do it. \nRight now we're facing a severe content draught. Players don't have anything to look forward to, and this is doubly so when you consider the next expansion will likely not happen until 2027.\n\nI doubt we will see any fixed to these issues and therefore I can't get invested in the future of this game.\n\nI invite you to try the free trial, but as for buying? I'll pass. Let's hope that they're able to fix  issues fast,",

      "review": "I started playing at the beginning of Heavensward and got back into it during Shadowbringers, when FFXIV felt like it was at its peak: a compelling story, an engaged community, and content that struck a balance between casual and hardcore play. Since then, I’ve cleared Ultimates, raided extensively, and dedicated myself to PvP. From Season 1 through Season 10 I’ve played thousands of matches, climbing from Unranked to Crystal every season.\n\nAfter all that time, one thing is clear: FFXIV’s PvP is toxic, repetitive, unrewarding, and abandoned by its own developers.\n\nCrystalline Conflict was supposed to be the big PvP revival. In reality, it’s fast-food content: flashy at first, shallow once the novelty fades. One wipe snowballs into defeat, burst cooldowns matter more than teamwork, and every match feels the same. Worse, it’s not even part of daily roulettes, so most players never touch it. Spectator mode exists, but with no tournaments or competitive scene it’s wasted. And perhaps the biggest flaw of all: there are no duo queues. It is impossible to play with friends, even in casual matches, making the entire mode feel like a solitary grind instead of a team-based experience. What should have been the flagship mode is already irrelevant.\n\nRanked should have been the crown jewel of competition. Instead, it highlights everything broken with the system and the player base: matches are decided by button mashing rather than strategy, players chase scoreboard numbers instead of objectives, and fundamental mistakes—throwing overtime, chasing kills off point, wiping on the crystal—happen even in Diamond and Crystal. Toxicity is constant: AFKs, griefing, harassment, Quick Chat spam. Bots and scripters climb unchecked, and Square Enix does nothing. Balance swings wildly every patch, making class choice more important than skill. There is still no option for duo queues, which makes every match a gamble with strangers and strips away a huge layer of strategy. And the rewards? Titles, recolored mounts, recycled glamours. Ten seasons later, ranked PvP feels less like competition and more like a treadmill.\n\nRival Wings is dead: queues take hours or never pop at all. The mode is abandoned with no updates or incentives. Frontlines only survives because it’s tied to roulettes, but the gameplay itself is just chaotic zerging where RNG spawn timers decide the winner. Most matches feel like 20 minutes wasted. Both modes prove the same thing: if content isn’t tied to roulettes, it dies. If it is, people treat it as a chore.\n\nNew players get no onboarding, no tutorials, no guidance. Veterans end up carrying teammates who don’t even understand the basics. The fact that PvP still doesn’t have a proper tutorial system after ten seasons shows how little it matters to Square Enix.\n\nAnd it’s not just PvP. Endgame as a whole has the same decline. Ultimates are brilliant but too rare to be true endgame pillars. Normal raids are formulaic dances recycled every tier. Expansions are padded with filler storylines, abandoned systems, and empty zones. Daily roulettes are the same grind with outdated dungeons. MSQ is bloated with filler dialogue and downtime. Progression is thinly stretched with time gates, recycled rewards, and little more than glamours, mounts, and housing items passed off as “content.” FFXIV looks spectacular, but it lacks lasting depth.\n\nThe community is marketed as the most welcoming MMO. At a casual level, maybe. But in competitive content, the mask slips. Players chase stats instead of wins, constructive criticism is rejected, and griefers, botters, and toxic players roam free with little to no punishment. These problems plague even high-ranked matches, where players should know better.\n\nI’ve put in the hours: ten PvP seasons, Crystal every time, Ultimate clears, and thousands of matches. That commitment should feel rewarding. Instead, it feels wasted.\n\nWhat FFXIV actually delivers today is simple: button mashing over strategy, stat padding over teamwork, bots and griefers over integrity, recycled raids and expansions over innovation, and rewards that disrespect the player’s time. Square Enix has had ten seasons and multiple expansions to prove they care about competitive content. They’ve failed every single time.\n\nFFXIV is still a good story-driven MMO if all you want is cutscenes and cosmetics. But as a competitive game—PvP or PvE—it has no backbone, no prestige, and no future. In its current state, I cannot recommend it.",

This recurring fee model feels like extortion rather than a fair transaction, especially for players who expected to purchase the game and own it outright.\n\nForcing players to pay continuously to maintain access limits the enjoyment and accessibility, turning what could be a fun experience into a constant financial burden. Instead of feeling valued as customers, players are trapped into paying repeatedly, which is unfair and leaves a bad taste for anyone who hoped to casually enjoy the game without ongoing costs.\n\nIf buying is not owning, then piracy is not stealing",

      "review": "The purpose of this review is not to be part of the bandwagon of bad criticism around the game, the real purpose of it is to talk about the current state and my personal thoughts on it. Keep in mind since this is a long, unedited and raw review I will put the other half in the comments section.\n\nLet me start by saying I loved this game. I loved the community who took part since I first started the game (late Shadowbringers). This whole game has been a blast and I've never been happy with the service, but I want to say that it's time to part from it (Hopefully for now)\n\nIn short I want to say that I met an amazing group of friends, and confidently enough I want to say that from one situation to another, I don't regret it. In another sense, this game will continue to get worse.. and the bigger the game gets, the worse the development and the community will be all together.\n\nI've put about 2.5k hours into the game, I officially took a break at the release of Dawntrail and every now and then would go for PvP, but I saw a lot of the game's bad criticism from the start to the current content of this game. So I want to start slow and give my final thoughts about the game and how it feels going in and out.\n\nThe multiplayer feels non-existant at first, and getting people into the game feels like a chore if they all decide to start quitting back to back - Now the entire game is a glorified single player game, there's a lot of multiplayer content but I'd say it sounds more like endgame content once you're done with the entirity of the story. Lets say that you got a group of buddies, you're done with the game and you'd love to help them. You kind of almost can't because they're going to be in the free roam doing quests, then instances, then trial or dungeon and rinse and repeat for the next 500+ ish hours. There's a lot of multiplayer content mind you, but you first have to play a ton to actually get there... if not you can always buy skips. Skips prevent people from learning the game mind you.\n\nThe entire game is cosmetic - In endgame, after you finish through all of the game, the real content is fashion, and sure the game has stats but you pretty much farm for items just to look cool or to be caught up for the bigger and harder content. Your character's stats feel like it doesn't matter, same with the gear, materia and job. At the end of the day your character is cosmetic and the only thing that requires brain power is the telegraphed mechanics, the math in terms of crafting and specially the muscle memory on which player does their rotations the best. Also, forgot to mention drops on a lot of things are horrible, so expect to be farming like crazy. After completing the story, aside from just story it all feels empty, and the open world feels like playing section based areas like Borderlands. Don't get me wrong, a lot of the multiplayer content is super fun... deep dungeons and stuff like bozja and zadnor are both my jam, and stuff like the firmament is also addictive, there is a lot of really fun stuff to do in the game, but at the end of the day it's all about getting that sweet cosmetic.\n\nThe modding scene and the game's image - I'll be honest, I am fine with mods in any game.. the problem is the people and how out of hand the scene has become to the point on how the game now looks for people who don't play the game or there's actually no appeal on why to play the game aside from the story and the friends you make. You're going to find a lot of things with the modding scene, from quality of life plugins, to UI, to making the game somewhat easier or if not you're going to also find how thirsty and how pornographic the game has become outside of the console atmosphere. \n\nThis has led to multiple public issues:\n- Venue dramas like the famous Night Club Summer Bash incident, where somebody bought a billboard in specific states in america using Square's official assets, trademark, custom poses and on top of it modded assets and datamined content like the moonfire faire outfits which were only accessible through one other plugin. This was a promotion to an erp / rp beach party.\n- The lovense sponsorship where someone used the game's modded gpose to promote a toy.\n- A plugin where you could go even further on how to stalk a player in game, showing histories on where they were in the game, other characters in that player's account and etc. It could have been much worse, people were even scared if it would catch personal information even.\n- The now recent plugin where you can sync mods with other players, where it lead a whole to community start an outrage, file petitions and review bomb over the fact that square shut down their favorite mod that encourage them to do things that FROM THE BEGINNING IT WAS STATED THAT IT WAS AGAINST TOS.\n- There's a bunch of other issues, that includes a botting problem, scripting problem, malware issues coming from the mod syncing, to even a reshade fork having some pesky DRM or malware integrated.  Also I forgot to mention, this also includes the people who parse too.\n\nIn short, there's quite a lot more, and unfortunately if they decide to put a strong anticheat into the game, the remaining amount of players depending on all of this will drop like flies and even worse the mods (pornographic or not) and the role playing scene is what's keeping them alive to begin with, and thats what it feels like. \n\nIn the case of a game like VRChat, they implemented EasyAntiCheat but the playerbase didn't seem to decline, because a lot of the mods are being shoved into the game slowly but surely, specially the ones that are accessibility related, in the case of this game if it gets implemented the game's over.\n\nI'm not forgetting though, there is a strong scene of players that actually just play the game, and that included the console playerbase. I respect those people, and majority of the people who continue to mostly clear content. At the end of the day, do whatever and have fun.\n\nThe community and the social aspect of it - I'm admitting that there is some very lovely people in the game, very very amazing kinds of people but just like any other community it's as bad as the others. The community specially the roleplaying communities are incredibly toxic. Most of the drama can be even taken out of the game, everything regarding mods as mentioned before, american politics, religion, sexualities, gender, literally the list goes on including relationship drama (Part of these issues also comes from developers and VA's too, not saying that they do a lot of this stuff but some of the stuff said on BlueSky specifically have been out of hand). This game is cluttered with drama queens, stalkers, accusers, harassers and its even infested with sex pests, so not only its filled with so much gooning, you're pretty much not safe if you interact a bit too much. One of the biggest problems going on right now even includes players making really heavy real life threats in a live event with other real players only because they're being disagreed on politically.\n\nNow ignoring the outside of the game portion there has been a lot of drama regarding the gameplay itself, the game has become much easier, and there was a point that people cleared parts of the game without a healer, where it lead to a great healer strike making healers play horribly on purpose which literally lead to absolutely nothing. Hell, samurai nerfs, black mage being shafted patch to patch, dragoon being more braindead and this list also goes on. This game has become too damn easy, of course you just need to learn only two things.. mechanics and rotations and thats it. \n\n\nThe social aspect of it revolves around venues, free roaming, main cities and just normal player interactions.. except you kind of begin to notice that even the most basic part of the game which is that is also incredibly flawed, part of those flaws will be mentioned up next with yoshi p's stuff.",

The reason I am not recommending this right now is when I came back to the game again, it seemed fine until getting into certain content that is not even really considered endgame. Best way to describe it, is toxic asf for lack of better term. A decent amount of the community that is left (ALOT more from when first joined) has sunk to the point harassment of other players new or regular over the most ridiculous things. I personally don't expect moderation to be able to keep up with all of it. But if you are going to hop on now I suggest one of two things, either don't mix with people too much or just have chat off. The newest low was players randomly accusing other teams of being full of hackers, from what I am assuming just to have people target them. As a person who loves fun balanced pvp this game gives, that was last straw. Love the game and its lore, but until they chill, I just can't even enjoy it. If people hate me for this opinion.

How can SQUARE ENIX stand by and have someone on your team that is in favor of violence towards those who she disagrees, in fact let me quote Katheryn Cwynar's repost \"Anyway the choice america faces going forward is live in the confederacy or do reconstruction for real and purge those motherf*ckers from all of public life. And there isn't really an in-between.\" This is quite the problematic world view where you take a position of \"either you are on my side or we will destroy you\", this is quite a disgusting and shows they don't even understand the game they are working on, she previously mentioned liking Wuk Lamat and I can't figure out why since she is so pro violence against people she disagrees, which is very unlike Wuk Lamat whose whole journey and growth came from interacting with different perspectives and finding common ground in order for everyone to be able to live among each other. If the Warrior of light had the same points of view as Katheryn he would be called the Warrior of rivers of Blood since the story would be 10% interacting with an echo chamber and 90% destroying anyone in our way, there would be no profound story whatsoever, Garlemald would have been wiped out completely, heavens, Ishgard would have been destroyed completely for what happened to the dragons, and that is assuming we even would have bothered to learn about them in the first place, nobody would have been reformed in Stormblood, (Yotsuyu would have been ended even if she lost her memories by our hands, gaius and later his adopted children would have been attacked on site for example), there would be no amazing plot about Emet Selch and everyone in the Eulmore would have suffered a horrible fate at our hands, and Endwalker would have been a complete entire mess devoid of any meaning where we would definitely fail to save the world because 9/10 people would pray for our downfall and even if we somehow did win in the end, Wuk Lamat would cut ties with us mid journey because we would refuse to have a talks with the people of that continent. In conclusion I will not support a game who mantains someone with such harmful world views in their team and I encorage everyone else to do the same until Square Enix fires Katheryn Cwynar for her harmful rhetoric.",

So if you're Canadian like I am, be prepared to pay 1.40x more for everything. \n\nThis game is dated and needs some TLC. Back in 2017, this was a top of the line as far as how nice the game looked and ran. I know most don't play for the graphics, but it's a subscription based MMO - character models shouldn't be as minecraft-looking as they are in 2025. \n\nI admittedly am not a big quester when it comes to games and MMO's, and I hopped into this game knowing that it would be quest heavy. \n\nI made a black mage and got up in my 50's on it when I experienced Post-ARR MSQ hell. None of my friends that recommended this game to me told me anything about this, knowing that I advised them I'm not huge on questing. \nAfter completing what I thought was a lot of quests with little reward, I started wondering how much more quests were left to go before the MSQ was done and I could get my skills. After feeling like end wasn't in near sight at all, I google'd my progress and realized that I was TWENTY out of EIGHTY quests in. And from what I've been told, this is a massive improvement from what it used to be (around 300 quests or so?). \nThese quests are not short enough to merit doing 80 of them when your class has skill locks that only unlock by completing the MSQ. Each quest gives about 0.002%-0.003% experience at level 56. Needless to say, it was going to take HOURS to complete all of these MSQ's and hit 60 before doing more quests to unlock my skills for my class. Outrageous to say the least.\nThe ragequit point for me was the fact that Square Enix sells an item on their website that bypasses all of these quests and puts you right into heavensward. \nSo Square Enix knows this part of the game is hated and completely unacceptable to their already paying customers. But instead of making it better for their paying players, they decided to monitize it to take even more money out of something because it was intentionally tedious to complete without this bypass (for $9 USD.).\n\nAfter finding this out, this game was uninstalled, subscription was canceled and I won't return. I'll spend my money some other place where the game developers actually care about their players instead of making their experience miserable to people that bought the base game, downloadable content AND their monthly subscription.\n\nDo better, Squeenix.",

[strike]classes[/strike] Jobs keep getting homogenized to the point where most play almost exactly the same with different visuals, dungeons are meticulously engineered to take exactly the same amount of time, with the exact same structure of 3 bosses with 4 packs of trash mobs inbetween (separated in 2 with an arbitrary wall, just in case the player feels like actually making decisions!), and the critically acclaimed storyline tends to tediously insist on certain tropes later on, making me wish for Heavensward again. Creative[strike]ly bankrupt[/strike] Studio III seems to really love the idea of taking away the player's agency every step of the way, as demonstrated not only by XIV's MSQ being comprised in 90% of cutscenes with full on fade-in, fade-out, camera-pan-across-the-area displays of cinematic grandeur for 3 lines of dialogue you'll forget after 5 minutes, but can also be seen in FFXVI - the game all the talented staff members left for, as it clearly shows in anything XIV released after Shadowbringers.

I recently repurchased it through steam as my last purchase was all the way back in 2013. After only a few days of being able to play i am no longer able to log in and the support center has never responded to my inquiry.",

      "review": "After half a decade of hearing about the great story that FFXIV offers, I finally decided to give it a chance.\n\nIt starts really slow, ARR being a slop, but with a 10/10 momemnt right before the first expansion starts. Then the overall quality of the game takes a sharp rise, and even though I was not really smitten by the HW story, it wasn't bad. StB was meh with a great ending, and I pushed through it with the promises of two amazing expansions following.\n\nAnd I really enjoyed SB. It had some weaker moments (I hate trolleys now), but I would say it is a solid 9/10 story, so I was really hyped about Endwalker. And it started strong. I especially loved how grim and mature the game was in the Garlemald zone (even though I really dont think the skimpy Vera were really necessary). But after that?\n\nWTF?!\n\nRight now, after a large story moment in the first trial, the game took such a drop that I have zero interest in continuing. I am stuck with some frickin' space rabbits, quests are about tasting their frickin' carrots and wearing silly clothes. The story cutscenes went from fighting for a future of the world to watching one of the creatures running around in panic with \"funny\" music playing in the background. Peak comedy...\n\nI will probably finish this expac, just to see the story to its conclussion, but I lost every ounce of respect for the game. It doesn't know what it wants to be - dark, mature fantasy or stupid, over-the-top carefree JRPG.\n\nIt certainly has its moments, some of them were incredibly good. But these pearls are hidden in a great pile of manure which is the rest of the game. I have played for over 200 hours and enjoyed about 30 of them.\n\n3/10 overall.",

      "review": "Having played only Realm reborn so far I can say it's not great. The combat is fine although a bit stiff compared to Guild wars 2 but overall fun. The Real Reborn story is really tough to get through. I read it everywhere - it gets better after the main story once you get into the expansions. That's good and all but I wasn't having fun for about 40 of my 57 hours. The story is cringe, the protagonist can't speak (no text or voiced) the voice acting isn't always great and nothing interesting was happening untill the last 10ish hours.\r\n\r\nI will continue playing it as i finally reached the first expansion and heard amazing things - excited for that. One BIG miss in FFXIV is the UI. oh boy if you think that Guild wars 2 is messy and cluttered you have no idea what's waiting for you in this game.. there is way too much info on the screen and not enough room. Have too many active quests? it just goes behind your inventory off screen. The settings are a mess too and it's not great.\r\n\r\nIf the expansion really blows me away i will update this review to positive but that doesn't change the first 50ish hours aren't fun and that for a MMO WITH monthly subscription and cash store.",

      "review": "I can recommend but I have quite a few issues here. For the MSQ, it is great. I can't fault it, at least until Dawntrail. Class quests can be equally as enjoyable. But the whole point of an MMORPG is to have those fun role playing aspects, which tie into mounts, glamour, coop content, and collections in general.\r\nHowever, after having played 2.8k hours of this non-stop, I can say it has some glaring issues and very unrealistic expectations for the player.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the job (Classes) grind is way too high. There is no 'right way' to get each one to max level. Which results in a mish mash of either fates or duty roulette's to finish it. You also need to unlock other side content to have a more entertaining duty roulette. And for some stupid reason class quests lock abilities, so you have to waste time doing these. \r\n\r\nSecond major issue is the collection aspect. Glamours are limited to 800 storage (With too many to store), and 20 plates. Minions can't comment on, but mounts have so many issues in terms of acquisition and method. Some are too RNG dependent, others aren't but have a really steep learning curve (such as Savage raiding) which is also RNG because you have to be lucky enough to be the one to roll it. So F me I guess for beating a hard raid and getting nothing? Not to mention, why aren't these farmable on the normal versions? Oh, and there is a mount in the game that requires completing 366 fates + 100 more hours of time to get. AND there are mounts that are timegated to 48-72 hours, from S ranks which are required for an achievement (You need 1000 of these, they spawn on any data centre and count but still a nuisance) \r\n\r\nAnd a side thing, relic weapons can be extremely unfair and grindy. \r\n\r\nThird, the endgame, has so many systems it is hard to keep track, it feels way too excessive. Topping off currency and getting latest gear (Latest currency is timegated). At the same time, I do not like how many times I need to do things. Faux Hollows requires 2x completions (and competing with RNG for some reason at times too), weeklies are difficult to track at times too.\r\n\r\nFourth, crafters make no sense. Once you do your first one, you've done them all. There's no identity. They're all the same. So why can't we just automatically get the others to max level after the first? Or do them all at the same time as one, like shared XP. \r\n\r\nFinally, it is really held back by an outdated combat system. I'm not really talking about class design which has issues in itself (like no AOE until level 30, 40 or 50 depending on which it is). It's more to do with the Global Cooldowns, and abilities. Which typically bypass it, BUT, you cannot spam more than 2 buttons at once. Which is so contrary to some class design here. It doesn't make any sense. Not to mention servers can be really laggy, I've had it in PVP where my character is killed behind cover or my buttons do not work, and PVP is awful by the way, too many stuns, too many unbalanced systems like Battle High, and can be very one sided, at least talking Frontlines, but I have had it in 5v5s too. Also stupid design choice to make classes have LATE GAME ABILITIES when playing at a lower level, so these don't make sense to a new player. \r\n\r\nMy review for Final Fantasy XIV would have been positive. I have a list of good aspects in this game. Personally though, I find myself bordering burnout every single time I come across a stupid game design choice, I just feel like slapping someone. I look in the mirror and see someone very slappable, but that's besides the point. I think FFXIV is a very enjoyable experience, in the right areas, the Manderville quests are comedy gold so far. and the community in game for the most part is very friendly, outside of a few not so PC comments. Think of this review as a 'player beware'. If you like collection, AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS, IT WILL BREAK YOU. IT WILL. PLEASE FIX THESE SYSTEMS SQUARE ENIX!",
