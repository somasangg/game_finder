      "review": "Garry’s Mod is one of those games that becomes whatever you want it to be. I play it with my son and it has turned into a modern day sandbox where you can create almost anything you can imagine. There is no real storyline or goal. You just jump in, pick tools, grab props, and build whatever comes to mind. That is the whole magic of it.\r\n\r\nThe physics system is where the fun really starts. You can stack objects, throw things around, make machines, build cars, create scenes, or just mess around with ragdolls and see what happens. Half the fun is experimenting and watching your ideas fall apart in hilarious ways. It is simple, but that freedom is what makes the game feel endless.\r\n\r\nThe game also has a huge amount of community content. There are maps, models, game modes, and tools that other players have made, and you can download whatever you want to try out. Some are silly, some are creative, and some are full game modes on their own. It gives you more variety than most games ever offer.\r\n\r\nPlaying with my son makes it even better. We end up laughing at the weird things we build or the strange moments that happen because of the physics. It is creative in a fun way, and it encourages imagination instead of pushing you into a set path. You can build, explore, roleplay, try challenges, or just mess around for the sake of it.\r\n\r\nThe graphics are older, but the game does not need fancy visuals to be entertaining. The focus is on creativity and freedom, and it works. You just jump in and do whatever your brain decides.\r\n\r\nOverall, Garry’s Mod is a huge open toolbox that lets you and your friends or family make your own fun. If you enjoy creative games or just want something you can experiment with together, this one is perfect.",

I'm not a zoophile, I don't touch animals with sexual intent, and I'm not a pedophile; you can ask one of my dear friends who opted to live with me than deal with her hostile home situation if you really feel such a burning desire to write me as a creep.\n\nBut the AMOUNT of people- no, [b]children PRETENDING to be adults, as this game is FULL of children-[/b] in this community have made posting anything furry-related a nightmare.\n[h2]HOWEVER, I'm not complaining about that.[/h2]\nInstead,  I'd like to mention the amount of human trash that accumulates here; you'd think this was a landfill the way trash is piled here.\nMany might me call me trash too, don't care- point is, [b][i]and you know who you are,[/i][/b] there's FAR too much racism (even ironic racism), homophobia, transphobia, and general INTOLERANCE of others that I don't see [i]why[/i] you'd waste your time trying to tell that to another GMod player unless they say it to you.\n\n[b]This game somehow has a community [i]worse[/i] than Soyjak Party [i]//AND//[/i] 4chan combined, and if you don't believe me, find out yourself. Dip your toes in, go for a swim. [i]You'll find plenty of deranged NUTCASES who only wanna drag you down, grin as you drown.[/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Rant aside...[/h1]\nThis game is bland with no addons/UGC; there's only so much fun you can get from building with the standard GMod/HL2 props, and I mean that as nicely as possible.\nThat's where the Workshop comes in... it offers near-endless replayability! The possibilities are damned near infinite with the Workshop. If it [i]doesn't[/i] exist? It's... easy enough to make it, as long as you like the masochism that's learning Lua and/or modelling, depending on what you want. Oh, and, watch out if you make a goofy gun that looks realistic but doesn't have 69 gajillion rails, black paint, no handguard, no barrel, no stock, and chambered in all calibers of the world- [i]the tacticrap CoD nerds might harass you![/i]\n[strike][b][i]the fact I'm explaining this and the fact YOU made it this far means you're either REALLY bored, have an amazing attention span, or you're just looking for the comment section to mock me.[/i][/b][/strike]\n\nMoving on, the game is built on a 2004 engine that was [b]already[/b] pushing limits for tech of the time; despite such, people have found ways to push it past that.\n[b]As long as your PC has a graphics card and a CPU from anything past Windows XP-era, you can run this damn game like butter*.[/b]\n\n[h1]notice that asterisk? Good, glad you did.[/h1]\n[b][i]If[/i] you aren't running too many addons.[/b]\nI don't wanna measure cockerspaniels or anything, but even MY PC struggles to run this game and it's arguably much more powerful than a standard Walmart-ass desktop, [b]but[/b] only if I'm running my usual modlist of over 800 mods!\n\nBy the way, learn some terminology if you're gonna play this game; I still learn new things and I've been playing it since May 28th of 2017.\n...that said, I've also legitimately reached a point I've gotten burnt-out on GMod and can't stand playing it; I only run it for more hours.\n[strike]...that's my strategy with most games, run it for a long time to rack hours up and then laugh when people ask for advice.[/strike]\n\n\n\nBy the way, screw your stupid comments, I don't wanna hear all the whiny people complaining about me being a furry.

This game is an anomaly in gaming, It's a simple mod for HL2 that mods back in the Physics Gun from the betas of HL2. This seems like a very lacking game and would appear to be one of the most \" I got bored within 15 minutes of gameplay \" sandbox games ever. But due to the time it released, which was very soon after hl2 released, It luckily gained a lot of players and was updated until really taking off with the release of GMOD9, And eventually it was put on steam. Now lets get to the real review section. I think this game works great as a simple template sandbox to be modded to hell and back. For once It's normal to have Hundreds of mods, And to completely overhaul the game. For example communities such as Gmod Realism and also that time I made the game look like sh**, I'm sure There's more examples but I can't be bothered. Now that's not even talking about multiplayer, The multiplayer works very well and I've spent many a hour just f****** about in gm construct and southside, I think there's also a lot of opportunity for making videos and memes, I think if I made Gmod videos I'd have over 6,000 Hours on this game. I have spent many years playing a silly sandbox game and it took my way too long to make a review.",

Staff of these servers are the exact same population as those you encounter within the game. There is nothing to be had of value within the game. Any fun moment is ruined once you come across one of the denizens inhabiting the map you are on. \r\n\r\nThe \"people\" within these areas are off-putting to put it lightly, you won't find common interests with someone named the baydolf bitler, diddyblud, or george droyd fentlord. Once it becomes apparent to them you are not like them they will quickly annoy, attack, or harass you in any way possible. All of this is an attempt to justify killing you (remember the mods love the power of punishing someone) or to bait you into getting reported through one of the myriad of different rules you could be breaking. \r\n\r\nThey have nothing in life to look forward to, and nothing to look back on fondly. They are a ruined people writhing within a hell that they made for themselves. It is unfortunate. Thankfully we can take solace in the fact they have created a containment game for themselves which prevents them from poisoning other areas of gaming you may be partaking in.\r\n\r\nI do not recommend spending any amount of time in gmod darkrp and this morning was the last example I needed to understand there is no \"good server\" it's all that way.

      "review": "Conclusion, gmod darkrp is beyond saving. The only people left are complete weirdos, social outcasts lashing out at anything around them. Staff of these servers are the exact same population as those you encounter within the game. There is nothing to be had of value within the game. Any fun moment is ruined once you come across one of the denizens inhabiting the map you are on. \r\n\r\nThe \"people\" within these areas are off-putting to put it lightly, you won't find common interests with someone named the baydolf bitler, diddyblud, or george droyd fentlord. Once it becomes apparent to them you are not like them they will quickly annoy, attack, or harass you in any way possible. All of this is an attempt to justify killing you (remember the mods love the power of punishing someone) or to bait you into getting reported through one of the myriad of different rules you could be breaking. \r\n\r\nThey have nothing in life to look forward to, and nothing to look back on fondly. They are a ruined people writhing within a hell that they made for themselves. It is unfortunate. Thankfully we can take solace in the fact they have created a containment game for themselves which prevents them from poisoning other areas of gaming you may be partaking in.\r\n\r\nI do not recommend spending any amount of time in gmod darkrp and this morning was the last example I needed to understand there is no \"good server\" it's all that way. Hopefully this can prevent stress or issues in your lives and you can avoid wasting any amount of time coming to the same conclusion as I have.",
