      "review": "Two Point Hospital – A Brilliantly Absurd Take on Medical Management\n\nTwo Point Hospital is a charming and hilarious hospital management sim that balances strategic depth with a playful sense of humor. Serving as both a spiritual successor to Theme Hospital and a modern refinement of the genre, it turns healthcare into a delightful blend of chaos, creativity, and calculated problem-solving.\n\nAt its core, the game is about designing efficient hospitals while treating increasingly ridiculous illnesses — from Lightheadedness to Cubism and Mock Star. The absurdity never feels forced; instead, it gives the game personality, keeping the experience light even as the complexity ramps up. You’re constantly juggling staff needs, patient flow, research, finances, and reputation, making every decision meaningful.\n\nWhat makes Two Point Hospital so engaging is its accessibility. It’s easy to pick up but surprisingly deep to master. The progression through different regions introduces new challenges and objectives that keep things fresh, while the star-based rating system pushes you to continually optimize your layouts and management strategies.\n\nVisually, the game’s colorful, cartoonish art style perfectly complements its comedic tone. The radio announcements and PA system chatter add to the charm, delivering some of the funniest background humor in any sim game.\n\nWhile late-game micromanagement can become slightly overwhelming, the game does a great job of teaching systems gradually and rewarding experimentation.\n\nVerdict:\nTwo Point Hospital is a joyful, clever, and highly addictive management sim that blends strategy with slapstick satire. Whether you’re a seasoned tycoon veteran or a newcomer to the genre, it offers hours of satisfying, laugh-out-loud gameplay.\nScore: 8.5/10",

      "review": "Two Point Hospital is a fun management game that keeps the classic feel of the old Theme Hospital while updating everything with smoother controls and a cleaner, brighter look. The whole idea is simple. You build a hospital, hire staff, treat patients, and keep everything running without going broke. It sounds serious, but the game keeps everything light with humor and over the top illnesses.\n\nThe presentation is what pulls you in first. The visual style is bright and colorful, and the animations make the hospital feel busy without becoming overwhelming. The fictional conditions, like Lightheadedness where patients literally have light bulbs for heads, Monobrow, and Cubism, keep the tone playful. It takes place in the Two Point County universe, which gives every hospital a different personality and layout.\n\nThe gameplay is steady and easy to learn. You place rooms, manage staff, train doctors and nurses, buy equipment, and adjust how the hospital runs. The controls respond well, and the menus are cleanly organized. It never feels confusing even when your hospital gets bigger and busier. Most tasks are point and click, and you can pause the game whenever you want to think things through.\n\nManaging staff is a big part of the game. Each person has traits that help or hurt your hospital. You can train them to specialize, give promotions, handle their moods, and decide who is worth keeping. It adds a layer of strategy without feeling stressful.\n\nMoney management matters too. You need to balance upgrades and salaries with the steady flow of patients coming in the door. Some hospitals start with easy goals, but later ones have harder challenges like natural disasters, high training requirements, or more demanding conditions. It keeps the progression interesting.\n\nTwo Point Hospital also includes research, marketing, reputation goals, and star ratings. Once you get one star at a hospital, you can keep building it up to two and three stars for better rewards and harder challenges. You can also move on to the next hospital whenever you want, which gives the whole game a nice sense of ongoing progress.\n\nOverall, Two Point Hospital is an easygoing and entertaining management game. It has a great balance of humor, strategy, and simple controls. It plays smoothly, looks good, and gives you plenty to do without ever feeling overwhelming. It is a great pick if you like building games or anything in the same style as the classic Theme Hospital.",

Has several new hospitals with their own challenges. \nSandbox mode is great with the ability to create a large or small hospital. Create challenges in each; patient recovery, training, as examples. \nThe only negative I have is the lack of auto-research, which while bit annoying, this is a very minimal complaint.\n\nWould recommend to anyone who likes sim games.",

      "review": "Two Point Hospital is an under-sung triumph of gaming, made by a small unnoticed team from Airstrip One that captures the feel of Wallace and Gromit, while celebrating Theme Hospital.\n\nIn this game, you are the administrator and your purpose is to run an efficient hospital and meet the requirements to earn a star and move on to the next challenge. Having played both Theme Hospital and this game, I appreciate that the world map provides a sense of place as well as context to where you are going to be sent to next. The DLCs stretch where you go. From the frozen mountains, to the tropics and even through time and space, there is plenty to do. More on those later.\n\nThe game’s graphics, gameplay and quality of life features are steps above Theme Hospital in many significant ways, especially thanks to some update patches. With only a few minor niggles when it comes to pathfinding or assigning jobs to your staff, running a hospital is a smooth process and you are not punished for changing your mind about room layouts or even changing its location. That is not to say that it is easy, and in fact the best feature to manage patient flow is to make treatment prices the max cost while telling diagnosis rooms to fast-track treatment, so that doctors are freed up to work on incoming patients, while earning as much money as possible.\n\nAs a small aside, the hospital that is run like a nationalised service in the base game, is considered one of the most difficult. This is simply because it is the only one where you don’t get paid for treating patients...nothing like real life at all!\n\nIt is quite easy to get into a comfortably flow with this game while listening to podcasts, and with the ability to save room layouts to be loaded later, the game is designed to be highly entertaining with a mix of deadpan humour and ridiculous diseases and cultural references.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that it is perfect. Epidemics, just like in Theme Hospital, are a pain to deal with and hordes of patients can only be resolved by “pulling the fire alarm” (i.e. kicking every patient out of your hospital). Also the AI does make some strange choices when it comes to who gets into line first, especially if they’re in the cafe’, bathroom or the other side of the hospital. It usually isn’t a problem until it becomes unbearable, but patients are stupid, which is in character.\n\nAlso, while it is possible to finish the entire game by flying through hospitals with only 1 star complete, it is designed for 3 star finishes in my opinion, which is a major investment and may not be for everyone. \nOn that note, the DLCs are very different and entertaining, but not must-buy if you don’t like more of the same. They do add some overpowered equipment to the base game (robo- janitors for example) as well as unique challenges, diseases and game types, but aren’t majorly impactful.\nI would not bother with cosmetic DLC unless on sale.\n\nHowever, the last DLC, Speedy Recovery is “mostly” fixed, compared to a messy release, however the final level is intensely micromanagement heavy since you have to manually send out ambulances to collect all your patients. \nI only mention this because unlike every level in the game, they can sometimes bug out and end up waiting a long time at the destination as if taking a break at the disaster site. However this aspect was quite fun and a nice set up for a sequel if there ever is one.\n\nSo in my opinion, if you like Theme Hospital, comedy management games and are very much a tinkerer, I’d try the base game and then the DLC if the investment required to “get gud” resonates with you.",

      "review": "Here is my hot take on this game, after learning the game mechanics:\n\nTwo Point Hospital just turns into the perfect background game, and any other way of trying to play it is completely wrong.\n\nHear me out — this is an incremental/time-based game. You will become absolutely infuriated just staring at the screen, and may even make bad decisions trying to force something to happen.\n\nThe secret is to use room templates and choose between fast-track healing or not, depending on whether you need a high cure rate or simply more patients treated. (Discharging incurable or dissatisfied patients manually is also something you can do to increase cure rate.)\n\nThere are other neat tricks you learn along the way, but I think I’ve spoiled enough.\n\nYou can watch a movie, talk to friends, video conference someone, and play this game at the same time — and that doesn’t make it bad. It’s very enjoyable and scratches my OCD need for uniform structure.\n\nPositives:\n\nIt has solid game design, and the progression method was very well thought out.\n\nFantastic shiny visuals you won’t get bored of.\n\nRadio 2 Point is hilarious — you can tell they put a lot of work into it.\n\nCons:\n\nThere are no save slots.\n\nThere is a lack of a true sense of completion. After getting 1 star on the base game’s final hospital, you can see the end credits by clicking on the congratulatory letter — but it feels very unceremonious.\n\nThe DLCs cost a king’s ransom. At full price, you’ll pay more than €100 for everything. Even on sale, the “complete” version will set you back over €50. That’s a lot, considering each DLC only adds 3 hospitals, a few cosmetic additions, and a couple of machines and diseases.",

Only part i hate is the lack of room haha. you need so much general practitioners of diagnostic rooms, you don't have space for treatment. Or you have so many different diseases you need basically every treatment room you have and then you have no room for diagnostic rooms. \n\nAnd then there is the fact there are some bugs in the game (nothing big). They appear later in the game when your hospitals are getting bigger. Some are: people you fire, but they're not leaving, and getting the notification people can't go where they want even though they should. \n\nAll in all, if you like planet zoo, sims, rollercoaster tycoon etc, you'd most likely like this game too!

I do wish that they would update TPH to have a similar feature as TPM where staff could be allocated to specific tasks (e.g., a doctor trained in general practice only works in the GP office). Otherwise still one of my favourite games.",

I've got Two Point Campus and Two Point Museum too, and while they are great the nostalgia of the hospital setting always brings me back to this one.\nIt seems to spend most of its time on sale for <£10 so if you're at all interested I'd recommend giving it a go as there's a massive amount of content in the base game that I'm nowhere near through yet.\nI've recently bought all of the DLC in the Steam Autumn Sale (in the region of £25 for the bundle) as I just don't want it to end. I've not tried any of them out yet as many are locked until the last one or two hospitals to make sure you've got a full grounding in the main features before branching out.\nThe only issue I have is trying to see/find the minibeasts, but I had that issue in Theme Hospital too!",

      "review": "Two Point Hospital – A Brilliantly Absurd Take on Medical Management\n\nTwo Point Hospital is a charming and hilarious hospital management sim that balances strategic depth with a playful sense of humor. Serving as both a spiritual successor to Theme Hospital and a modern refinement of the genre, it turns healthcare into a delightful blend of chaos, creativity, and calculated problem-solving.\n\nAt its core, the game is about designing efficient hospitals while treating increasingly ridiculous illnesses — from Lightheadedness to Cubism and Mock Star. The absurdity never feels forced; instead, it gives the game personality, keeping the experience light even as the complexity ramps up. You’re constantly juggling staff needs, patient flow, research, finances, and reputation, making every decision meaningful.\n\nWhat makes Two Point Hospital so engaging is its accessibility. It’s easy to pick up but surprisingly deep to master. The progression through different regions introduces new challenges and objectives that keep things fresh, while the star-based rating system pushes you to continually optimize your layouts and management strategies.\n\nVisually, the game’s colorful, cartoonish art style perfectly complements its comedic tone. The radio announcements and PA system chatter add to the charm, delivering some of the funniest background humor in any sim game.\n\nWhile late-game micromanagement can become slightly overwhelming, the game does a great job of teaching systems gradually and rewarding experimentation.\n\nVerdict:\nTwo Point Hospital is a joyful, clever, and highly addictive management sim that blends strategy with slapstick satire. Whether you’re a seasoned tycoon veteran or a newcomer to the genre, it offers hours of satisfying, laugh-out-loud gameplay.\nScore: 8.5/10",

      "review": "Two Point Hospital is a fun management game that keeps the classic feel of the old Theme Hospital while updating everything with smoother controls and a cleaner, brighter look. The whole idea is simple. You build a hospital, hire staff, treat patients, and keep everything running without going broke. It sounds serious, but the game keeps everything light with humor and over the top illnesses.\n\nThe presentation is what pulls you in first. The visual style is bright and colorful, and the animations make the hospital feel busy without becoming overwhelming. The fictional conditions, like Lightheadedness where patients literally have light bulbs for heads, Monobrow, and Cubism, keep the tone playful. It takes place in the Two Point County universe, which gives every hospital a different personality and layout.\n\nThe gameplay is steady and easy to learn. You place rooms, manage staff, train doctors and nurses, buy equipment, and adjust how the hospital runs. The controls respond well, and the menus are cleanly organized. It never feels confusing even when your hospital gets bigger and busier. Most tasks are point and click, and you can pause the game whenever you want to think things through.\n\nManaging staff is a big part of the game. Each person has traits that help or hurt your hospital. You can train them to specialize, give promotions, handle their moods, and decide who is worth keeping. It adds a layer of strategy without feeling stressful.\n\nMoney management matters too. You need to balance upgrades and salaries with the steady flow of patients coming in the door. Some hospitals start with easy goals, but later ones have harder challenges like natural disasters, high training requirements, or more demanding conditions. It keeps the progression interesting.\n\nTwo Point Hospital also includes research, marketing, reputation goals, and star ratings. Once you get one star at a hospital, you can keep building it up to two and three stars for better rewards and harder challenges. You can also move on to the next hospital whenever you want, which gives the whole game a nice sense of ongoing progress.\n\nOverall, Two Point Hospital is an easygoing and entertaining management game. It has a great balance of humor, strategy, and simple controls. It plays smoothly, looks good, and gives you plenty to do without ever feeling overwhelming. It is a great pick if you like building games or anything in the same style as the classic Theme Hospital.",
