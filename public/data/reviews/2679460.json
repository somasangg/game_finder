      "review": "This game is the very embodiment of what one might call an “eight-out-of-ten” title. Nowadays, we are inundated with blogs, websites, magazines, and YouTube videos that dispense extravagant scores, yet everyone seems to have forgotten what truly defines a masterpiece and what, conversely, constitutes a mediocre work. This game stands precisely in the middle ground.\n\nIt teeters on the edge of brilliance, a single step away from greatness, yet it lacks perhaps the most vital quality of any true work of art: its uniqueness. Though this game boasts the most exquisite art style I have ever witnessed in my life—a breathtaking vision of a fantastical city steeped in politics, racial diversity, and towering walls reminiscent of Attack on Titan—its identity feels derivative. Its fairy-tale aesthetic evokes the finest of Disney’s magic, the prince’s enchanted thorns recall Sleeping Beauty, and its dreamlike cinematic interludes conjure the sketches of Leonardo da Vinci himself. There’s even a subtle nod to one of my all-time favorite video games: when characters unleash their abilities, their bodies transform into red-lined figures that unmistakably echo the protagonist of Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter. Even the menu animations are crafted with an almost sublime elegance.\n\nThe issue lies in its narrative. For all its visual splendor, the story lacks distinction. You continue playing not out of narrative investment, but simply because the game is beautiful and its gameplay loop deeply satisfying. It borrows the most appealing aspects of Persona 5 and reimagines them through a fantasy lens. The cherry on top is a stroke of genius: the ability to slay low-level enemies instantly and still gain experience points—a true blessing from the heavens.\n\nSPOILER: Having completed the game, my opinion remains unchanged from the first few hours. The plot is archetypal—a king, a prince, a curse, the inevitable power struggle, and a relentless antagonist whose obsession leads to monstrous transformation. Louis is arguably the highlight of the story, bearing a striking resemblance to N from Pokémon Black and White. In borrowing Persona 5’s finest mechanics, the developers also appropriated its most memorable boss fights, culminating in a finale that mirrors that of its inspiration—sans the true ending.\n\nAs I said from the outset, this is a phenomenal, immensely enjoyable video game—yet, as a work of art, it is ultimately mediocre.\n\n8/10. It could have been so much more with just a few refinements in its writing. But if we are to judge purely by its art design, then it belongs to an entirely different realm.",

      "review": "Overall, I recommend Metaphor: ReFantazio if you enjoy JRPGs.\n\nIf you’ve played Persona 3, 4, or 5, the gameplay loop will feel instantly familiar. It features turn-based combat, a day-by-day calendar system, and a bond (social link/confidant) mechanic, along with its own take on the concept through Archetypes, which function as spiritual cousins to Personas. As in the Persona series, much of Metaphor’s core draws from Jungian psychology and social themes. That makes sense since many of the same developers who worked on the modern Persona games were involved in creating this one.\n\nAs you’d expect from ATLUS, the presentation, voice acting, cutscenes, and music are all top-notch, and the game feels polished throughout.\n\nThat said, Metaphor also carries over a few of the notable things from Persona that some people will like and others may not. The game is long, and the story pacing can feel uneven in places. It also throws a lot of systems and mechanics at you early on, which can be a bit overwhelming at times. Fortunately, it’s forgiving when it comes to time management and figuring things out. As long as you stay on top of doing things, you can experience most of what the game offers. By the end of the game, I had every quest complete, every bond maxed, and still had extra days in-game to spare for grinding levels and Archetypes or whatever I wanted before the finale.\n\nWhile Metaphor’s characters and story didn’t hit me quite as hard emotionally as the Persona games did, I do think they're pretty good, and I think comparing to Persona is a high bar to clear. Its world is imaginative, the mechanics are satisfying, and it’s definitely worth playing or at least trying the demo if you enjoy story-driven RPGs with depth and style.",

      "review": "Metaphor ReFantazio is the latest Atlus game. In short it is similar to the Persona games, but then in a fantasy world.\n\nAs you would expect the graphics are very striking, with creatively designed and intuitive menus and UI.  The soundtrack is very memorable with the monk chants, backed by the classical orchestra. Also the performance is great, it runs without any issues on my pc on the highest graphical settings. \n\nThe combat is as usual very addictive. The monster design is pretty cool as well, there are a lot of monsters that are definitely inspired from the Jheronimus Bosch paintings. You start out in dungeons in real time action combat, where you can eventually enter turn based combat. The press turn system from the Shin Megami Tensei games is back, where you gain extra turns when hitting weaknesses or crits. It makes the combat feel tactical. \n\nThe thing that didn't return are the demons. Those are now replaced by Archetypes, classes that each have their own playstyle with strengths and weaknesses. The fun part is, that you can level those and evolve on every character in your party. And by time and experience, you can inherit skills from those Archetypes, which you can mix & match in the current Archetype you are using.\n\nThe story is compelling and it uses a lot of fantasy tropes. Sometimes it reminded me a bit of Studio Ghibli movies or the Final Fantasy games in a way. I loved traveling the world and learning all the different tribes and their cultures on the journey. There are plenty of interesting characters where you can build bonds with, each with their own story.  The characters each have a memorable design and they look so stylish. Some stories were very touching or surprising.\n\nThe main story starts of strong and intriguing. and it really feels like a journey you make together with your party, while you uncover several mysteries and defeat mighty foes in their dungeons. Somewhere around the end of the game, the pacing slows down, and feels a bit like a slog. For me, it felt like there were too many twists and fakeout endings thrown at you. That mixed with a lot of repetition in long dialogues and cutscenes, made me feel a bit fatigued. It makes me wish they extended the middle part of the story a bit more.\n\nOf course you can grind for passive skills and do sidequests as well, which is very similar to the Persona gameplay loop. It's all calendar based, but you have plenty of time to do what you want to do.\n\nOverall, I think it is another great Atlus game, but I wish the ending wasn't such a slog. They were able to improve the fun combat from Persona even more, and their way of writing a fantasy story feels refreshing.\n\nMy rating for this game is: 8/10.",

The time between story beats, dungeon lengths, and dialogue in general, flow a lot better and keeps you hooked. \r\n- The Calendar being used to give the game actual travel time between destinations is wonderful to see and makes the adventure truly feel grand.\r\n- I found all the NPCs in your party, and that you gain relationship levels with, to be fantastic. \r\n- The benefits gained from raising your \"Confidant\" levels are more useful then in Persona, even if not as varied.\r\n- The Turn Icon combat is brought over from SMTV, which I think is one of the best turn based combat systems, rewarding buffs, debuffs, and weakness exploits much more then the average JRPG\r\n- The main dungeon crawls are a truly fun, multi-calendar day experience, with the length really adding to the pre-dungeon planning and in dungeon strategy. I actually enjoyed the fact I ran out of MP and had to find a checkpoint room to retreat from and return the next day. \r\n- The music is fantastic\r\n- The game does an amazing job of making the most out of its budget, using really creative ricks to emulate the feeling a truly grand, continent-spanning journey. \r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- The side dungeons are your standard repetitious Persona fare. Though, I will give them credit for being finite, none-randomized places you can fully explore.\r\n- The late game grind for the MAG and XP you need to unlock all the Archetypes and inheritable skills you want can be a bit of a drag.\r\n- A mid game unlock takes away some of the magic and majesty of travel\r\n- The auto-play dialogue option often cuts off the last couple words of the voice acting\r\n\r\nNeutral:\r\n- Not being able to romance a companion is a bummer, but it makes sense in the context of the story \r\n- While the music is fantastic, the tracks are pretty limited\r\n- Overall graphics and animation are good enough for the budget, with the art direction, character, and enemy designs doing a lot of heavy lifting. \r\n\r\nOverall Rating: Best in Class (JRPG)",

While I'm sure some improvements could be made here or there, I can confidently say that this game has the best JRPG turn-based combat to date. \n\nWhile the story takes a break during the last fifth of the game to allow the player to complete all side content, I found it to be tightly written and engaging the whole way through - something that's rather uncommon for most JRPGs. Many of the characters are amazingly written as well, and while some of them can be rather simple, the main cast of this game is top tier to me.\n(The only caveat I'll give for the story is that the long break towards the end made me lose interest for a while - I originally started playing the game on release, but was put off by this gap and moved onto other games, and didn't come back to finish Metaphor until a year later.)\n\nI'm not really a fan of the $70 price being standard for AAA games nowadays, but I think that Metaphor really deserves it. Its consistent quality and quantity stand above nearly every other game with the same price tag. The developers and studio deserve it for the amazing work they've created.\n\n10/10",

      "review": "In my view, this is largely superior to the Persona games, with vast gameplay improvements and a story that has parallels to other media in the fantasy genre, but still succeeds. Persona games are great, but are quite similar to one another. Student in Japan that has special powers and discovers other students with the same powers. Metaphor is more like Game of Thrones, where it's a race/competition for the throne after the King's assassination. \n\nGameplay is almost 1 to 1 with Persona, but where it differs are the archetypes and the way turns go. Each side has 4 actions that can be extended by getting a crit or hitting a weakness, similar to one more from Persona. The difference is that instead of the same character repeating the action, it goes to the next character while returning you half an action (being unable to pass your turn with that action point). Archetypes are classes with a base skillset and affinities. While most higher tier archetypes are better, \"weaker\" ones might have skills that the stronger ones don't have. These skills can be inherited by other archetypes, provided that the character has leveled up the other archetype. This is one of the best parts of the game; mixing and matching skills to strengthen your equipped archetypes. Leveling them up can either be done by equipping them before battles, or using certain items that you can find or get via leveling up an archetype that has gotten to level 20. Each time they level up beyond that point, you get one of those items. Maxing archetypes also gives the character that got it to level 20 a stat boost in a certain area. \n\nThe story is akin to Game of Thrones, with you and others vying for the throne. It's effectively an election, with you and other candidates traveling around the continent. The story tackles issues like the poor vs the wealthy, and different races butting heads. When games typically tackle race, it ends up being cringy or a one sided agenda fest. This game manages to make it a big point, while not putting it above everything else by a mile. The main focus is on stopping the main antagonist, while dealing with others that are after the throne. Can't say much else cuz spoilers.\n\nThe music is great. Not much else to say, other than there could be more individual tracks.\n\nThe graphics are a mixed bag. Some things in the game look great, while other things look like a cartoony PS3 game. The main highlight are the models of enemies and archetypes. The lowlights are many of the NPC models, mainly up close. They look like they just stepped out of a Warriors engine game, with low detail faces and clothing. Environmental textures go back and forth between good looking and dated.\n\nThe art style is beautifully simple. Much of the game has the same color, and environments don't change too much. However, what's there looks really good. A subtle, satisfying art style that doesn't overstep nor underwhelm. When it gets wilder, it's when there's a boss fight or a corrupted area. \n\nThis is for you if you enjoy Persona. The story and setting are a lot different, but the gameplay beats are the same, with the calendar and battle systems making a great return. The current sale is another excuse to get it. Try out the demo. I've played the full game twice and I think I'll play it again.",

Therefore you've got to be efficient or enemies will punish you for not one hitting \n\nI enjoy the combat and dungeon stuff a lot. I've had to use items, equipment, archetypes strategically in order to succeed and it's normally by small margins. There was a period in the beginning where i hit a power spike, then got to the next area and i was back to frantic decision making. Honestly pretty great balance that way.\n\nThe game implements a rewind button which is appreciated if you're about to get dummied. Saves you the time of running back from the save. I do not like how you can't reload saves though, as a lot of the time you've got to walk into a fight blind, see what works, then lose in order to adjust your build before taking the fight again. Just takes a lot of time for the gain of watching yourself die?\n\nThis mechanic makes for no walkthrough required though, which makes finding stuff out myself feel pretty for filling. I'm scratching my head about combinations and builds while building power on the skill trees to try to set myself up for fights in the future. It's a compelling grind\n\nThe ability to one hit lower level enemies really feels great too. It's satisfying trashing guys who used to beat you\n\nI will also say the artwork in this game is stellar. The design of the enemies, the clock at the screen, the layout, everything really taught me how important UI is. This game delivers it and sets a very high bar. Love the nightmarish human designs as well. This art team has incredible talent. \n\nI also enjoy the time constraints. This really forces you to be methodical, especially factoring in travel times and such. For a first playthrough it requires a lot of foresight that other RPG's simply don't require. They let you run around the field grinding till you're overpowered. Here, if you don't make hay while the sun shines, or defeat a dungeon, you're punished by losing that opportunity forever. I could see how some of my more fragile friends might not like this, but i quite enjoy this\n\n\nNow the drawbacks, my -3\n\n-1 Story. I could not care less about the outcome of this kingdom. I haven't finished the game yet, but i skip almost every cutscene (thank god for that) i think my gameplay is like 33 hours, but it would EASILY be up to 50 if i watched all these scenes. A lot of them are character relationship things that i just don't care about. It's simply not compelling, and i'm a big fantasy nerd. Maybe it's the delivery? idk, more is not better\n\n-2 Relationships. You've got to do these quests helping people out which i just don't care about. The reason this gets it's own point is because it's basically mandatory, as you need the relationships to gain access to higher tier archetypes. I've just skipped like all of these. I started a few but what can i say, it's just not compelling. This gets 2 points minus because it's mandatory, AND it sucks\n\nEDIT: I kinda hit the wall on this game getting stuck on a boss and just felt an absolute wave of apathy. I just dont feel the urge to turn back and grind to fight it. I think the fact i skipped like 80% of the dialogue has prevented me from caring enough ironically lol\n\nFun enough game to get on sale tho",

In the beginning, MP is so scarce you either need to leave the dungeon or do a scheme with the mage class, but it takes so long it's better to just rest. Also, there is a swirling effect on the characters? At first I thought it was something on my PC, but no, it's normal. I found that strange. Other than those two points, I enjoyed the game a lot!

      "review": "I initially gave this a negative. It's more of a neutral. I'll attempt to explain.  \n\nI was mostly having fun for most of the runtime.  Combat is engaging.  If you're high enough level over your opponent you dont even enter turn based combat so it saves time. Dungeon crawling is hardcore. Meaning that your mana is finite. It doesn't regen unless you play as a mage and farm mobs for awhile to regen the groups mana pool or use very limited items.  All of these things I enjoyed....and then there was the softlock episodes.  \n\nA few encounters in this game, namely bosses, you have to have a very specific setup to defeat them or you lose, even on the easiest difficulty. This is due to several bosses just being gimmick fights where you need a specific spell to either debuff them or decurse yourself.  Well if you dont have these spells and you can't go back to level up somemore, you're kinda fucked.  You better have an alternate save file or you're cooked.  \n\nThis is why I originally gave this a neg review.  I was pissed.  Luckily I didn't lose too much time but a new player would be very confused by some of the boss encounters here and likely be stuck too.  Ultimately I beat this game and had a good time, even playing new game plus now on Regicide difficulty, which is technically insane difficulty, but with you carrying over your items from the prevoious playthrough, quickly becomes trivial.  The equipment carries you in the early new game plus.  \n\nLike I said, combat is flashy.  You can bash the opponent a few times, dodge their attack, bash them again and then they're stunned.  You can then get an advantage.  Atlus does this in nearly every one of their games. The AI auto battler in Metaphor is truly unique.  I used it many times.  Some of the harder bosses I had to take over but for the most part, the AI will use the most effecient spells to dispatch the enemy. Normally this means overspending mana.  But for about 75% of the game I used the auto battler.  It's just so good.  The AI already knows the weaknesses of your enemy before you do and will sometimes just auto attack to finish the opponent off, because the AI already calculated its health and used a more mana efficient method to kill them. Truly impressive.\n\nThe story sucks.  Characters suck.  Bland, cliche, wooden characters. The main protag is a bag of white rice.   I skipped so many cutscenes and dialogue scenes.  I just didn't care after awhile.  Shame too bc the voice acting is very good.  Music is very impressive as well.  \n\nAt some point in the game you're on a walker type thing.  This reminded me of playing another game called Last Oasis here on steam.  A survival where you build walker vehicles to traverse large distances.  You can leave your walker while traveling to a mission and just look outside.  It immediately reminded me of Last oasis and walking around in the walker I build myself.  \n\nThe pixie voice actor needs to shut the fuck up btw.  ANyone that has played this game knows what I'm talking about.  She will incessently bark in your ear every time someone gets a debuff, misses, gets a crit, is near death, etc.  Very annoying.  \n\nThat's about it.  It's a quality game.",

As a first time JRPG player, I was mind-blown from the graphics, narrative and storytelling. The many gameplay elements inspired from the Persona franchise as well as it's art direction are immaculate. Not to mention it's interpretation of a 500 year-old book that depicts a world that cannot be achieved is just that deep. It's gameplay is very fun to play, not to mention that the spectacular soundtrack by Shoji Meguro, the soundtrack's worth a listen after you finish the game. The story is really good and intersting, and it will question your reality, as to quote the director of the game, Katsura Hashino, \"to encourage people to analyze their own lives\".\n\nIn conclusion, Metaphor: ReFantazio is a phenomenal game for new and old JRPG players and fans of Persona franchise. It will remain as one of my favourite games every played and will be for years to come. Really excited to see what will Studio Zero cook up in the coming years.

      "review": "This was my first Atlus game, and probably my last to be honest. Most people getting it at this point are probably like me, interested in RPGs and probably not die hard Atlus RPG fans which apparently is its own thing (See persona). Also for more context I don't NG+ so I try to get the most out of one play through, often relying on guides. For some reason I chose to forgo it this time to start. Due to my inexperience with the calendar system, I was unable to max out all the companion quests. Apparently you can complete your main quest and still get the time to lull around town later. Should've read the guide to start, Doh! \n\nGiven how much hype this game got from mainstream sites when released, I think it skewed my expectations of it. The game starts out strong but ends with a whimper.  It peters out as it goes, so the opening act is great, the middle game is not too bad and the end just falls apart and then pulls a lord of the rings to make it worse by extending the ending over and over till you want to just reach into the screen and slap Gallica silly till she disappears into a ditch or something. That said I spent 120 plus hours on this game.  Throughout your journey the voice acting kills and really does a great job of bringing the characters and their emotions to life, except for the main guy. He's as exciting as a loaf of wonder bread. I think it's a pretty damn good game. Not perfect and not what the hype made it out to be, but you know what? It's generally on sale now and a great buy.",

The story and characters are really well paced and the main characters are all likable. I do have few criticisms of the game but they will spoil the game a bit so i'll censor them.\n\n[spoiler] On the near end of the game you have until the end of the month to beat the final boss and you are given few quests to strengthen your party. Cool all fine until you go in one of the quest towers and there is a boss that repels every elemental magic attack and physical attack. only way to beat the boss is to do almighty spells and attacks, but at that time i only had few almighty attacks and no way to level archetypes to get them almighty attacks. Ok all right it is an optional quest so i don't complete it and head back to town. Then when i get to the final boss i am once again under leveled and can't do much damage to it. I had to lower my difficulty to beat the boss, but the fight was awesome with one of my favorite battle musics on the second phase. So my problems on both these fights was that i was under leveled, but there is no good way to level up in end game. You could go on a dungeon and go back and forth and kill the respawning enemies, but it would take some time in such high levels.[/spoiler]\n\nOverall really enjoyable game and my GOTY of 2024.

Em Persona 5 é necessário ficar fazendo combinações, usando sites third party e correndo atrás de dicas, até do q falar, para progredir.\r\n\r\nPORÉM, acaba aí a superioridade de Metaphor.\r\n\r\nA música de Persona 5 é melhor. As histórias, apesar de ser um drama colegial, são menos piegas. Não tem romance, o que torna o nosso personagem uma espécie de castrati, o sujeito fala com 300 gurias e n sente atração nenhuma, chega a ser bizarro... Nem depois do plotwist da história, ou seja, bizarro. \r\n\r\nE para piorar, o main plot é completamente bizarro. A visão de mundo q ele tem para o lugar é literalmente uma utopia. Na conclusão do game, sem ele fazer absolutamente nada, o mundo melhora.\r\n\r\n'É só tu por um bando de gente aleatória e diferente num lugar que vai dar certo', como ? Foda-se. Isso msm, foda-se.\r\n\r\nTem uma raça de bandido no game, q rouba e mata os outros. A solução do enredo ? Dar educação. Abriram uma escola.\r\n\r\nSimplesmente n existe conceito de justiça in game. O maluco sai em killing spree e a solução q oferecem é mandar pra escola. Triste.\r\n\r\nA sensação q eu tive ao jogar o game, com este tipo de enredo, é q eu estava ficando mais burro a cada segundo. A cada posicionamento do jogo sobre política era uma tragédia.\r\n\r\nO pior? Vc simplesmente n pode se posicionar de maneira decente ou contrária a essa visão de mundo. Vc precisa ser um amendobobo ambulante. \r\n\r\nEm termos de atuação, é incrível como a pior atuação do game é a do protagonista. Ele é, sem dúvidas, o personagem mais bizarro. é o pior personagem de longe. \r\n\r\nSe tivessem feito ele sem voz e sem pensamentos, seria melhor.\r\n\r\nEnfim, eu acho q esse cara q escreveu os textos do game, principalmente sobre política, n tem ideia nem de por onde as coisas começam. Acho q a equipe da Atlus se sai melhor escrevendo romance colegial do que uma história mais séria, que envolva política e visão de mundo. \r\n\r\nSimplesmente fraco, chegando a ser mais imaturo do q o Persona 5, apesar da temática.\r\n\r\nBasicamente, se vc tem mais de 18 anos e n vê graves problemas no enredo, me desculpa, mas tu é um amendobobo.\r\n\r\nMinha recomendação: Simplesmente skipe tudo q o jogo vai melhorar 10000000000000% e de preferência jogue com a trilha sonora d Persona 5 tocando d fundo ou qualquer outra coisa.\r\n\r\n\r\nO game tinha tudo para ser um 9~9,5, mas o paccing, a história e a trilha sonora são realmente DECEPCIONANTES.",

As always the music, art, and writing are all phenomenal. The game has what feels like hundreds of themes and messages that tie back to the main story; they make the world feel vast and even real at times. It doesn't ask you to think one way is correct or incorrect, it shows both sides and lets you decide, which seems like its the actual main purpose of this game's creation other than the obvious. Each character felt more likeable and more sincere than they did in P5 which is a massive accomplishment. Each character gets a chance to shine and continues to be used in tandem with eachother to further the story and bonds between them. \n\n    The combat never got boring for me thanks to the plenty of archetypes and the various party members introduced at an even pace to bring something new, consistently. The greatest thing about it for me was the rewind button, if you don't like the way the battle has been going, just start over and do it a different way. It allows you to gain info on your enemy such as weaknesses or strengths to use after you rewind. Which you think would cheapen the fights and make them less enjoyable, and to a certain extent, it does. However if you have played any Atlas game before you will know that they love to make you suffer with some enemies and boss designs, where it simply would be completely unfair and unfun without a rewind button. If it didn't exist on quite a few fights you would die simply to not knowing the enemy repels wind attacks; which many times you may be able to intuit but for the times where you can't it doesn't feel like your fault as there was no way to know. Lastly screw the boss that instakills your party if you have repel equipment on. Because it doesn't tell you that repel equipment will get you killed! You have to look at the wiki! It's also just a damage test, which is more strategy than raw stats at the point in the game it appears so it isn't dragging it down.\n\n    Lastly the story is simply incredible, it has it's lows but they serve to elevate the highs. I've never been more afraid of a single fictional man then I did when I played this game. On top of my jaw sitting on the floor due to the plethora of reveals which were so cleverly handled. Very few characters in this game are dull, and if they are, they aren't around for more than a few minutes at a time. Every character that appears again and again is always fun to  hear speak. The world building is mostly found in the memorandum but I love it so it's a plus for me. I don't know of any other game that explains it's economy down to the origin of its tender. I am no good critic, in fact I am very dumb but I love this game despite some of its minor flaws that ultimately come down to preference.",

(BTW I think this company should do a Shining reboot, it would be amazing)\nThe game arc is very good - starts of quite simple and expands as the player progresses.\nThere is a lot of time-sinks in this game, but more original than most other games, like the companion system.\nThere is a metric ton of dialog and it is frankly hard to read/listen to it all without skipping parts due to time constraints.\nSome monster sprites are re-used a bit, but not too bad.\nNot that difficult and I would recommend it to anyone to play, but even on Easy there are a few tough battles in late-game, however grinding is possible without too much effort.\nMusic is incredible and original, the composer is very talented.\nArtwork is beatiful and world very vivid...\nVoice acting is flawless, but they really loved the Scottish accent.\nthanks for the great fantasy",

I think they mix in the graphics with a very unique style that while cozy in the sense it's anime and we've seen it, it has it's own twists, besides being very colorful. The combat is challenging, you need to be strategic, making sure that you use weaknesses, and pay attention to buffs and debuffs, and in some cases, party positioning. The building of the characters are great too, a ton of liberty on how to make them grow in different ways.\r\n\r\nThe story takes a known base and puts a spin on it, one that I think makes people think, In my opinion it's more of a critique on extremes of all sides more than anything. The game plays a lot by surprising the characters and exploring how their reasonings and decisions change. in that regard I think the writing, while of course ideallisic and F A N T A S Y based, it's pretty darn good, the character's psychology all make sense within that world (for the most part) and while I haven't finished it, 40+ hours in I'm still pretty darn hooked. \r\n\r\noverall it's a great game! don't spoil yourself more and play it if you can afford it :D",

Their art, characters, the music, monsters (including such as humans), & anything else in the game truly builds a masterpiece of an game that looks at fantasy & reality. The game has also truly mastered the art of music. It's no wonder that this game has won awards for it such as the Famitsu Dengeki Game Awards 2024 for Best Music. But asides from that, my favorite part of the game is the combat. I enjoyed experimenting many different archetypes skills & synthesis during times where I'm around dungeons or anywhere you have to fight in. I would say that the dialogue of the game to be one of captivating but also one of the most excruciatingly the longest one I had to follow. I am aware that I don't have to read almost everything but the thing is I'm the type of person that fears of not being able to properly follow through the story.

      "review": "I recommend this game, with some caveats and frustrations. An extremely strong start quickly loses momentum and becomes very generic-feeling, but extremely good combat and just enough sappy anime moments kept me playing until the end. Unlike Persona 3 or 5, this game did not leave me devastated when it ended; I was eager to move onto something better. The promise of an incredible story with a 'unique perspective was mostly unfulfilled, which is a shame because that's why I picked this game up in the first place.\n\nAs a huge fan of the Persona series, I was extremely excited for this game. When I played the Prologue Demo, I was blown away by the game's originality, art, music, characters, and themes--to say nothing of the combat system. The opening question, whether fantasy as a genre has any bearing on shaping a better world in real life, is poignant and interesting. The game starts out exploring this concept in interesting ways, and the devs went all-out to pack the first few hours with crazy art, good characters, and amazing boss design. Atlus's PS2-era dungeons are still very much in play here, but as with the Persona games, I could overlook this flaw because the rest of the package was just so damn good.\n\nBut it quickly lost steam. After the first portion of the game (which is all part of the demo, roughly 5-8 hours), the theme of \"fantasy as a catalyst for a better world\" takes a backseat to a far more generic theme of \"we're going to change society by doing stuff better.\" Dozens of hours of the game are spent in pursuit of what feels like a high school class president's campaign: \"The way stuff is done now sucks. Vote for me and I'll do stuff better.\" NPC comes to you complaining of overwhelming prejudice and poverty? Your answer for them never strays far from \"Well, then let's change the world.\" This gets old quickly, especially because it keeps discussion of key themes like racism, prejudice, poverty, militarism, and religious fundamentalism at a very juvenile level.\n\nThe combat system is generally very well done and super stylish, and should satisfy fans of Persona 5 Royal or Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Character moves are varied, the Archetype system gives you lots of party configurations, and enemies are hard enough to provide a challenge without overwhelming you, provided you're doing side content like bounty hunts. The combat system is by far the biggest selling point of this game in my opinion. It kept me going through the more boring parts. Occasionally fights can be unbalanced or hinge too much on luck, but by and large it was great. \n\nAs for characters/party members, this is the least interesting cast of any Atlus game I've played (Persona 3 Reload, Persona 4 Golden, and Persona 5 Royal). The first few characters that join your party quickly become uninteresting or leave. By the 30-hour mark or so, there was only one party member who was still interesting, and that's how it stayed until I finished the game forty hours later. Like many anime-inspired games, Metaphor: ReFantazio plays it safe by picking an anime trope for a character and giving them some quirk that is supposed to make them three-dimensional. Some games succeed at this (see: most Persona games, many Final Fantasy games). Metaphor does not. Good characters always do the right thing. Bad characters always do bad stuff. Characters change their entire worldview at the drop of a hat, again like high school kids.\n\nThis makes the moments that are supposed to be \"big\" feel very small and inconsequential, even eye-rolling. When tragedy struck one of the late-game party members, I did not care at all because the devs did not do the work to make me care. There were moments when I literally rolled my eyes and scoffed at the childish simplicity of the writing. For example, one candidate in the contest to become king/queen is a woman who vows to break up the wealth of the elites and spread it among the people--that is, a socialist. But in one scene, one of her followers announces that he murdered a rich guy and took all of his money. The socialist character said, almost verbatim, \"Huh. I never imagined that my followers would take my ideas of destroying the elite class as a call to KILL the elite class.\" Then and there, she stops running to be queen and endorses your character. I had to put down the game for a few days at this point because I just couldn't take it seriously. Only in badly written anime games do characters put so little thought into their own beliefs that they can be changed so easily.\n\nExamples like this abound. In another scene, your party is exploring the ancient temple of a foreign tribe. A couple of characters comment to a member of the tribe that the murals in the temple do not seem to match up with the teachings of the tribe's religion. And just like that, after some foreigners comment on some art, the tribe abandons key tenets of their religion. This was another moment where I just had to take a few days. I expect more maturity and nuance in writing than this, even in video games.\n\nThe story has a few golden moments of heartwarming sincerity, and I appreciated these. Every few hours something happened that reminded me how much I loved the game's beginning. Despite some wasted opportunities and shoddy writing, the story gets a narrow passing grade from me.\n\nA quick note on graphics: like most Atlus games, this game does not have AAA graphics, or anything even close. At first, the incredible art direction helped me overlook this, but eventually the stiff character animations and weirdly shaped heads/eyes began to rub me the wrong way. Essentially the graphics are on a par with Persona 5 Royal. This is not a good thing. A studio as storied and experienced as Atlus should have the resources to put together a better-looking game to tell their story. There's no excuse for this, particularly because Persona 5 Reload and Shin Megami V: Vengeance both looked so much more modern. \n\nAll in all, I give this game a 7/10. If you have 80 hours to kill and feel like a Persona-like experience, this is the game for you. If you want those 80 hours to feel very well-spent, there are better options, especially if you like your games to have strong stories. Persona 3-5 and Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance each offer similarly excellent combat systems and do more to distinguish themselves. For someone trying to break into JRPG's, I would recommend one of those instead.",

      "review": "Might contain some spoilers.\r\n\r\nI bought this game because I greatly enjoy turn-based RPGs, such as FFX, BG3 and Expedition33. I had heard good things about this game, Steam recommended it for me and it also had a great user score, so I paid the full price and was very excited to play. My only consern was that it seemed VERY anime, which im not big fan of, but maybe I could live with it? WRONG. Im so fcking disappointed, that Im gonna write an angry review about it.\r\n\r\n[h3] Premise [/h3]\r\nSo the story begings in a kindom where the king has just passed and it seems everyone wants to be the new king. There is alot of problems in this world however. Everybody seems to be so racist, that its almost comical. You know, there doesn't even seem to be any stereotypes to the many different tribes, like \"these people steal, these people are violenent\". No, they are different tribe so might as well kick the baby. Also every rich person seems to be evil to the core, and many NPCs seem to suggest something along the lines \"[i] Kill the rich and re-distribute the wealth [/i] \". Im already getting a feeling im being preached to, but whatever. There is also magic in this world, and its often called \"Magla\". More on that later.\r\n\r\n[h3] Story [/h3]\r\nThe story is nothing to write home about. You are one of the thousands of people in this \"Game of Thrones\", but you are the good boy. You want to help everyone, no matter the race, the village of origin or financial status. And you are going to do that with the power of friendship. Im already cringing.\r\nIn my opinion, the story doesn't have that many surprises, and even the \"plot twists\" aren't that surprising or satisfying. I also feel like the story over uses this so called \"magla\", which is like magic flowing in the air. Anything that needs to happen in the story, can be made to happen because of \"mAgLa\". Somebody gets a fatal wound? No worries, Magla manifests itself in away that it heals your wound. Something evil is around? A lady in your party can literally see magla and she says magla around seems twisted. You can see past events happen in front of you? Something to do with local Magla. [b] Dies of cringe [/b]. Overall its way too anime for me and doesn't really get me excited at all. [b] 3/10 [/b]\r\n\r\n[h3] Gameplay [/h3]\r\nThe best part of this game is the part where you get to actually play it. The combat is quite nice and I found the character building fun and interesting. There is many classes to choose from and most of them feel balanced (tho Thief was ass). Sure, most of the dungeons are repetitive and layouts are boring, yet I was always looking forward to get to a new dungeon. However, after the first 20hours of the game I started to realize the biggest problem of this game. YOU BARELY GET TO PLAY IT. \r\n\r\nThis game has a \"day system\", where it tell you that after certain amount of days, you are forced to progess, or in the other words, listen to shit ton of lackluster anime dialogue. Lets say the game gives you 8days before next snooze fest, how long is that? Well, you wonna go to the dungeon? the trip there and back is gonna take a day atleast, and clearing the dungeon always takes 1day, no matter how fast you actually do it, so thats 2days gone already. You might think that thats no biggie, since you still have 6 days left until next dialogue festival, you can do 3 more dungeons right? WRONG. The game also forces you to have a chat with your companions, so that you can unlock other classes that you are going to need later to beat this game. BUT WAIT, THERES MORE. Sometimes you need to increase your Wisdom or Tolerance before you can increase your bond with your companions. So now you are forced to go the town, speak with some commonwealth pig to increase your tolerance. Now you can go and listen to your companion and increase the bond to unlock other classes. Oh did I mention the \"day system\"? Speaking to the people uses half of a day-cycle. So if its morning, its gonna be night once your chat is over. So speaking to one commonwealth pig to increase your Tolerance, and then speaking to your companion to actualle get the class upgrade you want, just wasted one day-cycle. At first you can manage it, since you have only Nico Hülkenberg and Lance Stroll in your group, so not so many people to increase the bond with. But by the end of the game there is like 10 of them, So when the game tells me that we are leaving the town in 14days to take part in pride parade, I know that I can maybe go clear 3dungeons before I need to start focusing on my companions and their uninteresting problems. \r\n\r\n\r\nI just want to play the game, go to the dungeons, kill monsters, upgrade my character and have a good time. But in this game, it feels like only 20% of all the hours wasted I was actually playing, and the rest of the time I was pressing X to advance the dialoge, which btw is mostly about racism bad, rich people bad, help everybody good. There is also no post game, which I very much enjoyed in the games like FFX and E33.\r\n\r\n\r\n[h3] Summary [/h3]\r\nThe graphics are ok I guess. The music is ok I guess. The story is very meh and ultra anime and thats 80% of what this game has to offer. The actual gamePLAY is quite fun but there isn't much of it. If any FFXIV player is reading this, this game is like playing the worst parts of FFXIV main story, but instead of having the freedom to choose when to advance story and when to do other stuff, you are forced to do the MSQ almost all the time. [b] Bad game, 3/10. Maybe worth it for huge anime fans, but even then I would wait for discount [/b]",

The racism is more of a motif or an undertone that eventually fades away in favor of anxiety. Either way Metaphor betrays the themes and motifs anyway. \n\nStarting with the racism, you play as the lowest of the low races and yet in a world where racism is heavily deep rooted, your party members except pikachu (even that is heavily downplayed) are all pretty tolerant of minorities and majorities alike. everyone except Junah and winged morgana realistically should have varying degrees of racism whether it be from a place of superiority, unfair prejudices projected unto them from their elders, or bad experiences from the past. In fact you being the lowest of the low races barely factors as an obstacle within the story outside of a sidequest or like two major event in the story but even those ties more into the political corruption and Louis being literal satan above all else. Speaking of, The game feels more interested in talking about political and religious corruption rather than it does racism since the church is roman catholic levels of corrupt to the point where it tends to be a lot more prominent in the story, sidequests, and social links. It's to the point where eventually the story gets bored talking about racism AND political corruption before anxiety becomes the buzzword of the day. And I do mean buzzword murderous Papirus? Anxiety and ganon herpes has consumed him, Church man steals sick dying people planning to sacrifice them to a volcano in order to apease god? nah he's let the melancholia warp his mind. Take a shot post major twist everytime anxiety comes up you will die.\n\nTurning your Fantasies into a reality is a nice message but what kills me is how literal it is considering it's the crux of the game's several terrible twists (all of the twists are terrible). On one end, I appreciate the optimism on the other, the twists somehow manage to be as god awful as persona 4's to the point where the story suffers despite both working really well in context of the game's central themes. In the case of Metaphor it sucks due to how much it undermines the mc's struggles and his og goal. Main twist 1: [spoiler] The mc is the literal Will (get it?) of the cursed prince which on one end is kind of cool and is vaguely foreshadowed but on the other, the journey feels pointless overall doesn't help that the mc is Jesus with no personality while the game is like \"oh hero thou hast lost something\" I am missing context while the game is acting like this should be obviously strange that the only memory the mc has starts with the prince but like... what if the mc just really cares about the prince idk [/spoiler] which leads into the Main twist 2: [spoiler] More is the Will of the dead king I was already clocked out when this twist was revealed but damn the king basically cheated death twice to orchestrate this whole journey [/spoiler] The other issue is that Louis the main villan is meant to be an embodiment of everything against this theme and yet, he's literally satan all while the game pretends mister might makes right over here has a bit more going on. Before muh anxiety kicks in basically making him be this figure to  scorch earth in order to rid the world of anxiety (it's as incoherent as it sounds).\n\nThe [strike] Social links [/strike]  Confidants are terrible sans a few outliers. They answer the question of \"why does Persona have 12 ranks instead of shortening them\". Followers are your answer. They either waste too much time with their alloted 8 ranks leading to pacing issues, does not have enough time to really develop into something interesting, or in the case of Hulkenberg, need to be available as soon as possible lest she becomes a dead weight for the gameplay but because of that, the story is dead air where if it was Persona 3 her social link would be available right after the first main twist where she makes up for lost time. Morgana with Wings is the exact reason why automatic follower ranks are were a bad idea for this game alone as if you want to play an actual mage you are stuck with the adept mage tree for 75% of the game forcing you to play mostly with cleric since summoner and magic dancer are gimmicks at best.\n\nThe calendar imo was ok the issue comes with how streamlined the game is where a max follower playthrough is actually extremely easy to achieve compared to the Persona series where you need meta knowledge (and or a guide) to do it without NG+ whereas metaphor makes it easy since ranks are gated behind story progress and social stats, by the end of my first run, I basically did everything the game had to offer leaving me with 10 days to spare before the \"final\" fight with Louis. I thought doing that would make the game end quicker but the game is like \"nah you have to wait out those days anyway\" and thank god for the Colosseum because I would have actually dropped the game because the game has little to offer. At least P5R and P4G have mini games while metaphor can be as empty as P3 Fes when you do all the followers and quests leaving next to nothing to do afterwards.\n\nAnd that leads to my other issue this game refuses to fucking end and yet plot points are shoved into your face at breakneck speeds. One of your party members are formally brought into your party after a series of twists and revelations, and afterwards the twists dont fucking stop after that. Every time the game feels like it is about to wrap up it hits you with something that instead of making you think back and even appreciate the hints like P4 or even P5 despite its asspulls Metaphor makes you clock out faster instead as more is reviealed. By the lead up to the final battle I was burnt out beyond belief because the game pulls that shit ALOT. You make several attempts at Louis life and it's as if god himself wants Louis to survive even trying to making you feel bad after attempt 1\n\nMaybe because I've only played persona up until this point but Atlus' inability to make a good epilogue needs to be studied. Just like persona 4 it spins in circles just to basically say \"all's well that ends well\" while really hammering in the main themes of the game for those in the back who were not paying attention to the 90 hour rpg.\n\nGameplay is ok. I played in hard mode only switching to easy in order to grind because the job system in this game makes things a bit more annoying than it has to be. Hulkenberg for example is a tank but in order to take full advantage of the knight tree you have to speck into the mage tree twice. Level 20 for the first branch to access adept and level 10 of adept for the branch dark knight. However, her stat spread makes her a pretty lame mage all things considered so your option is to play with a tank badly roleplaying mage, auto battle fodder or be really liberal with the lvl items. That isn't as crippling for Hulkenberg or pretty much everyone else... unless you're strohl who needs to heavily speck into the commander tree which sucked considering for the majority of the game, he's your go-to option for physical damage unless you spec the MC into physical damage which you kind of shouldn't since the two mages both take too long to join your party and aren't as minmaxed as the two physical attackers. I ended up making my MC a bulky mixed attacker since early on enemies in optional dungeons are mage-phobic. \n\nIf you REALLY want to play Persona 5 just play persona 5. Even if you liked P5 it's not worth playing a diet persona game.",

      "review": "It’s difficult to give this game a clear-cut rating, particularly when viewing it through the lens of the Persona series. However, judging it as a new IP from Atlus, my score unfortunately reflects my overall disappointment.\nStarting from the undoubted positives: the audiovisual presentation. The Atlus Sound Team delivered yet again, creating a soundtrack that stays with you long after you finish playing. It is also visible that the creators had an idea for a graphic setting and world design as such that distinguishes itself from the rest of the titles on the market.\nThe gameplay loop isn't necessarily \"bad,\" but it is the main source of my disappointment. Essentially, this is just Persona wrapped in a High Fantasy setting. The calendar system, the time management, the confidant mechanics, and even the combat and exploration mirror its sister series almost exactly. While we use archetypes (classes) instead of Personas, this feels like a purely cosmetic change. I love Persona, but I expected more innovation and variety from a new IP - especially knowing they are capable of unique titles like Catherine.\nRegrettably, the story and characters failed to grab me. The intro was gripping, mostly due to the mystery of a new world, but the narrative quickly became tedious. The NPCs feel one dimensional, the plot is predictable, and the main antagonist is a generic \"evil for the sake of being evil\" villain. Looking back, only one character from the entire cast actually left a lasting impression on me.\nOn the technical side, the game runs well. Playing a year after launch, I didn't encounter any bugs or issues. I played partially on Steam Deck, and aside from a few minor FPS drops, the experience was smooth. However, the lack of Ultrawide monitor support is a huge negative. I had to rely on unofficial fixes to get it working. This is especially frustrating considering that Persona 5: The Phantom X supports ultrawide natively. How does a gacha spinoff have this feature, but a major new IP doesn't?",

The demo was good enough to spark my interest further, but the full game just falls flat.\n\nAtleast the 12 hours i played the game i felt constantly rushed, pressured, restricted and forced to play the game how the Devs want it to be played.\nI'm pretty sure it gets better later in the game, thats how Persona games are, but for me that's a big flaw - it just takes too long to open up or give you all the possabilities you need to enjoy the game.\n\nThe battles are a pain if you don't start them with the correct archtypes (basically your classes / job).\nIt either goes smooth or you are fucked, forcing you to reload the game and try a different setup.\nI also felt like getting new eqipment or lvling up gave you barely any increase in dmg or dmg reduction\n\nI'm also not a fan of the music, it just irritated me after a while...\n\nGraphics are absolute dogshit for 2024 game.

Even the plot twists could not save the repeating \"hero save them all\" dialogues or a villain who keeps contradicting himself. The main character is so empty, that it's hard to relate. The narrative has to go one way, so the developers could not give the player any meaningful dialogue choices.\n\nThe music is great and grand, but what's with variety? There are a few themes, which are repeated during combat and dialogs through the whole game. I have listened to the same combat tune for tens of hours! Is it so hard to change them at least between chapters? Even the final battle did not get a unique track!\n\nThe combat. Well, I better go play Persona. There is a lot of grinding to unlock the archetypes, so you play the way you don't really want. I have not seen much difficulty either. Very quickly you get an arsenal of skills which allows you to take whatever combination of archetypes you want to a dungeon.\n\nIt's a decent game, but it is much worse than I expected after Persona 5 and all the positive reviews. Yes, visual style is great and animated scenes are gorgeous. Yet, it feels like the game was made after the plot and the movie was done. I \"finished\" the last chapter of the game on youtube because of all the mundane activities. Play Persona series, get this game on a heavy discount or just watch a story on youtube.

      "review": "(before saying anything, I want to say sorry for leaving an overall negative review, but there isn't a \"neutral\" or \"controversial\" option, my opinion is not negative, it's just mixed but the sheer existence of the Persona series brings this game down.)\n\nalthough I do recommend buying this game, I also admit that compared to your average Persona game, it is a big step down.\n\nBut let's start with the pros, the way you Approach a fight is much better, having to attack an enemy first before being able to attack them with an advantage is much better than \"approach an enemy and just press square\" and the gameplay has a bit of improvements here and there, some big, some small, and I do really appreciate them. The akademia especially is as good if not better than the velvet room.\n\nBut there are also Cons and they can't be left unaddressed. First of all the characters are SO ugly, like even Hulkengerg, who I guess is supposed to be the baddie of this game has the ears that are the size of Jupiter and a forehead that is bigger than the sun, how am I supposed to like that? Don't even get me started on that stupid bunny or whatever that monstrosity is, God I wanna strangle it just to put it out of its misery. Even the horses have gigantic pointy ears... WHY?! Was that really necessary?! I severely doubt it, in just 2 minutes of gameplay, you'll immediately realize how much the developers just injected their weird fetishes in this game. \n\nthe story is also much less engaging than an average Persona game, like why am I supposed to care about a lame prince who just got a random illness? At least in P5 it felt much more personal since they were going to expell YOU from school if you didn't act, but here it's just \"well I gotta save this prince I guess... ok...\" like bro I don't know this prince guy and you can't just give me a 2 minute cutscene and pretend like I'm supposed to care. \n\nThe worst of all tho is the MP economy, Now, I like a game with a challenge ok? It was moderately difficult but in like 4 fights I would run out of mp, which is fine, it's what is supposed to happen, but there is almost NO WAY to get your mp back, because safe zones don't regen your stupid mp for some reason, so you either spend numerous afternoons going in and out of dungeons or you look up how to gain mp back while being in a dungeon, and it is doable to be fair, but WHY WOULD THEY REMOVE THE MP REGENERATION WHILE INSIDE A SAFE ROOM?! WHY?!?! that is unironically the single worst decision I've ever seen a game developer do, and you can trust me on that take, I've played R6. I had to redo an entire dungeon and set the difficulty to easy to at least TRY to spare some Mp, and although it worked a little, I still ran out of them like halfway through the dungeon.\n\nAt the end of the day I do think this game is good (to a degree) but I also think that if you've played a persona game you'll be disappointed (unless you have a fetish for extremely big pointy ears and massive foreheads) and if you haven't, then you should just play any other Persona game first.\n\nAlso the music is mid",

I kept running into enemies I could one-shot, only for attacks to randomly miss, and then those same enemies suddenly get two turns in a row and instantly kill me. That’s not a battle system, that’s straight-up roulette wearing a fantasy costume.\n\nThe constant “X days until…” timers make it feel like the game doesn’t even want you to explore. Every time I wanted to wander off, try a sidequest, or just soak in the world, I felt punished for it. Nothing kills motivation faster than a ticking clock breathing down your neck in what’s supposed to be an adventure.\n\nLeveling up barely matters, which makes grinding basically pointless. You push your stats up a bit, but it rarely changes how fights play out. Combine that with dungeons offering zero real healing options outside of items, and good luck finding a merchant when you actually need one.\n\nAnd honestly? I do love the visual style.

I've uninstalled it twice, only to come back to it half a year later, dump some hours into it, then uninstall it.\n\nThe plot is, ok. If your not used to on the nose political messages, the plot will probably land better than it did for me. Political elements in the games I play is normal, and this games use of those elements is very surface level. Very early on you get hit with all the major politics of the game, and it boils down to \"this species good, everyone else less good or bad.\" Ok, so racism. Fine. Then you think the big plot twist will change things...and it doesnt. Despite everything the game wants you to believe, it means nothing. \n\nThe characters are fine. Very much your typical Anime archetypes. If that works for you, great. For me it was just bland. You got your foodie, you fallen knight whos really super honorable, your robin hood character, priest/priestess whos actually very shady, etc. You know the deal if you know Anime tropes.\n\nCombat is fun enough, but has one glaring issue; you are punished for not playing perfectly. The game doesnt so much as actually punish you, but it rewards perfect play. This can be done on the regular vs trash mobs, but becomes harder as you fight harder baddies. So about being punished. If you dont play perfectly vs some of the easier mobs, you get just your basic rewards, not the extra little bit. However, the game fully expects you to play perfectly. So when you dont, you will slowly fall behind, little by little. This is only exacerbated by the game being on a clock and not being able to grind to catch up.\n\nFinally the time crunch. This is a genuine mixed bag. It pressures you to get stuff done in a timely manner, but at the same time limits your own ability to try new things out, unless you want to start a new game. Starting a new game is largely out of the question unless you already love the game, so your single completion better be the best you can make it...so better go use a guide. Thus the real problem. To feel like you are getting what you want with your time, a guide is nearly required. \n\nSolid 6/10\n\nMany games dont do the things this game does well, as well as this game. But it also falls short of being one of those games that will really stick around in your memory.

The combat is not awful but it is nothing to write home about and becomes a chore as you start to finish the game.\n\nIt's follows the same time gated pacing if previous games but felt extremely off to the point I couldn't put my thumb on it until I had nearly beaten the game. Where previous Atlas games I couldn't wait for more side stories and character progressions this game I just wanted to continue progressing through the main story. \n\nThe realization came to me after completing some of the side characters stories. Unlike previous games these side characters have nothing but the MC to connect them. There is no school they go to, no town they all live in, every side story is just you the MC and that character. There is no character progression amongst the side characters themselves at all. It makes the entire \"off time\" just feel like a disconnected mess of stories. For characters who are fighting for their lives with one another the side stories don't make them give a shit about one another at all. They are just way to drawn out background stories with no actual substance. \n\nThis is the main reasoning why the pacing just feels awful. You go from the main story progression with all these characters to do side stories where you are getting 0 character progression amongst the main cast, side cast, or minor characters and ONLY getting character background for the current one you are working on. This is just awful story telling.\n\nAlong with the poorly written side characters the overall dialogue is written like a teenager writing their first fan fiction. Persona games have always been somewhat cheesy with their dialogue choices and that works fine considering the overall theme that this games entail but it DOES NOT work for a game that is about political assassinations and actual serious topics.\n\nIt's like Atlas just copy and pasted previous dialogue from other games an changed names if characters and places but didn't think at all about how that dialogue is supposed to be impacted by the theme of it. This becomes more apparent after about 35 hours or so.\n\nThe game is mid at best and I'd give it a 6.5 and only that because the first 20 or so hours are actually a very solid experience but it drops hard after that.

Nearly unforgivably generic overdone fantasy troupe with barely palatable anime cringe. I guess if you can stomach the FF7 Remake its probably fine; for me I couldn't and also found that game too bad to enjoy. The overarching \"lesson\" or \"Politics\" or whatever is so fundamentally flawed with how black/white, simplified it is that I cant take the game seriously at all. Its difficult for me to become emotionally invested in the main character, villain, or really anyone. Unlike other Atlas games where im glued to whats happening on the screen I find myself either distracted by real life more interesting things like my phone or im sighing in dissappointment. \n\nThe Average: Soundtrack is basically passable, but I expected better after experiencing other titles from Atlas. The pacing is about what you would expect from Atlas, but for me its been more noticeable because im not into the story at all. The soundtrack is mediocre; comparing this to other Persona games is heartbreaking for me. The map/dungeons so far are not as good as other Atlas games, but standard for other games.\n\nThe Verdict: I don't even know why they bothered to make this game. It is so samey in terms of gameplay that it doesn't offer anything new. Persona 5 Royal is my favorite JRPG, experiencing this in comparison has me mostly flustered with the creative decisions. This is one of those games that is a thousand times better for me when the story isn't in the way (BAD sign for an RPG by the way).

I thought I should give this disclaimer because most of what I'm going to write is negative of its core aspects, but I do want to make a point that, in its totality, I found my experience with this title to be average.\n\nI had high hopes and expectations for this title, especially as someone who got into Atlus' work through Persona 3-5. The first 10 hours or so I was thoroughly engaged and it made me stop playing my main game for quite a bit, so I can solely play Metaphor. However, once I got to the dungeon in the first main city, I was already feeling the fatigue of the combat loop. This feeling would continue to pester up until the very last dungeon. The gameplay loop is very much derived from the Persona series and it feels incomplete or lacking, in comparison. While I enjoyed the direction of the story up until we recruit [spoiler]Heismay[/spoiler], the events following it made me felt less interested as I gone through each major plot points. \n\nThe themes of Metaphor are something I appreciate, but the way they handled them is so ham-fisted and almost naive. It made me not care after hearing how discrimination is bad and equality is good so much times. The characters are such a mixed bag for me because I like some of them while most I couldn't give much a second thought to. By the final mission, I found myself skipping almost every character's dialogue due to a lack of interest and rushing to see the conclusion of the story, after 60 hours with Metaphor. Despite my negativity about the cast of characters, I didn't think they were badly written, just average or forgettable.\n\nThe true highlights of Metaphor for me were the art style and some of the soundtracks. I looked forward every time the gauntlet runner stopped by a vista point. The menu is visually appealing to look at too. Overall, I had a very average experience with Metaphor and I think a part of that is due to going into the title through the lens of a Persona fan. For the $70 price point, I wouldn't recommend Metaphor. Try to get it on sale if possible. I'm curious to see if there will be a sequel or another title within this series, but I'll be very cautious.",

      "review": "As a long time Atlus fan, this is the only game where I had stopped playing right at the start of the final dungeon, uninstalled the game, and was glad to never bother with it again. it's not a bad game by any means, but I find it baffling that it gets such an overwhelmingly positive reception, despite having plenty of flaws both in story and gameplay.\n\nThe main reason that I'm so disappointed by it, is because that this is a new IP, which meant that they could go wild and do whatever they wanted, crafted a well written and in depth story, explore new gameplay ideas, innovate on their formulas, but instead what we got is basically \"Persona 5, medieval edition\" with incredibly poor writing and stagnant gameplay. \n\nGenerally speaking, Atlus games never did have the best writing in them, but they did tackle their themes and plots in a decent way that it didn't constantly bother me, so I could give them a pass and enjoy the gameplay and character moments in them, however, in M:R, the worldbuilding and plot are so poorly written that I couldn't take the story seriously at all at any point. The main theme the game tackles is Racism, a heavy, complex, and important theme, however, the way you are shown how racism is portrayed in this world is just throwing shallow stereotypes at you about the various races in the game, and that's it. And hilariously enough, in many cases, the stereotypes turn out to be completely correct, further undermining the point of the main theme. In many points in the plot, it felt to me that the writers think that race and culture are one and the same, meaning that if you're one race, no matter your upbringing or your personality, your race determines everything, which, again, undermines the main point of the plot.\n\nThe writing, beyond the main theme, is again, not very good. Your party members are one dimensional, most of the plot is your basic JRPG plot of \"Kill the main villain with the power of friendship and save the day\" and some of the \"twists\" if you can call them that, just made me roll my eyes, because they too, manage to undermine the main theme.\nI had hoped that the game would go into depth about it's themes with the main party, with each person conveying a different point of view, having conflicts about different matters ,but most of the party feel really samey. They are all nice, agreeable and get along just fine, which is really nice if it was real life, but in a story that's pretty boring. The last two characters that get added to your party are the exception, but even they aren't particularly outstanding or have too much time to shine, unfortunately.\n\nThe gameplay side of things isn't much better, which isn't to say that the gameplay is bad, far from it, it's just that if you played any of the recent Atlus titles, you won't be too amazed by the gameplay, and considering that this is a new IP, one would imagine that they would want to innovate instead of retreading old ground, and unfortunately, they didn't really innovate. The main difference in M:R between other Atlus games is Archtypes.\n\nThe Archetype system, which is essentially your \"job\" system in this game, is pretty okay, nothing too mind blowing. You can freely set your party members to different Archtypes based on the situation and try out different strategies, such as warrior, mage, healer etc, which is pretty nice, however, the amount of menuing you have to do every time you decide to change between Archtypes and their gear is pretty annoying.\nAn additional annoyance that I found about the system, is that by the endgame, every party member has a a unique Archtype only they can use, and they require two specific Archtypes to be maxed before being unlocked, if you're like me, and you enjoy experimenting, and you might find, like I did, that you weren't close to getting the relevant Archtypes to max, and you'll feel like you were punished for experimenting by the game telling you \"oh, you didn't level these specific two archtypes to max for character x? too bad, get to grinding if you want it\". In the game's credit, you don't have to unlock them, the game isn't too difficult on its normal difficulty, but it does feel like it arbitrarily punished you for using the system as it was supposedly meant to be used.\n\nDungeons are pretty lackluster, both main story dungeons, and side dungeons. The main dungeons feel like they're big for no reason and don't really have any interesting gimmicks or mechanics to make the gameplay more varied, for example, in one dungeon you have 30 minutes before you die, in another, you have to hide occasionally from a difficult monster, not very unique or interesting in both ideas or execution.\nThe side dungeons are pretty bland, they look boring, mostly long brown or grey hallways sometimes broken up with a large empty room or a ladder to a different floor of bland brown or grey hallways and big empty rooms with nothing in them except enemies, sometimes it's caves, sometimes it's ruins, sometimes it's a big empty, flat forest. I have no idea if the side dungeons were randomly generated during development, but I won't be surprised if they were.\n\nMany times during the game I had hoped that I will encounter unique situations that require you to really experiment with the Archtype system and really challange you in more than a \"big damage number\" or \"HP bloat\" type of way, but unfortunately, that isn't the case. Mobs are usually dealt the same way they are dealt in the persona games, which is to say, abuse elemental weakness, kill enemy, move on. Boss fights weren't particularly memorable to me, so I can't recall any interesting gimmicks if there were any at all, take it as you will.\nI will say that there was one dungeon in the beginning of the game that if your party had a certain Archtype present during combat the common enemy type in the dungeon would enrage and could cause a wipe to your party, which meant that you had to change your Archtypes to deal with the situation, but that's literally the only dungeon I remember that happening, which is unfortunate,  because that kind of mechanic could be really interesting to explore and could provide much gameplay vareity and depth in my opinion.\n\nIn short, if I had to give the game a score, I'd give it a 5, it's not bad, it's not the worst game ever made, it's okay. If you're really interested in the game, or just want another JRPG to play and you think it needs to be this one, I would suggest to wait until a deep sale.",

      "review": "This game would have been great if not for the unnecessary grinding towards the end. I never had any trouble clearing content: as long as you complete all side content (bounties, side quests, etc.), you'll always be just the right level for your upcoming fight.\n\nHowever, for NO REASON at all, the game wants you to be level 65 - 70 for the final dungeon. With all content cleared up until this point, I was only level 56... Which means you need to grind for hours on end just to be able to play the story. The game also needs so much MAG (the currency to unlock new archetypes) towards the end game to obtain powerful new archetypes, the grind feels unavoidable.\n\nThe gameplay also felt clunky at times: if you go into a fight without the right archetypes, you have no way to reload the fight to change them and adapt to your enemies. Either you wait to die so you can change them, or you just ALT+F4 to reload your save and change (which is often faster to do....). There IS a button to restart the fight, but this doesn't give you the ability to switch your archetypes. So you're essentially closing and reopening the game just to adjust your characters... Yeah.\n\nTo nitpick one last time, (story spoilers) [spoiler] the story felt a bit repetitive towards the island arc. Also, the game baits you 2 SEPARATE TIMES into thinking you're about to reach the final fight of the story, which essentially gives you the feeling the story keeps making itself longer for no reason. [/spoiler]\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my time playing this game (the story is fairly good with an interesting villain and themes, cool characters, great art style and all) but I cannot recommend a game that requires you to grind simply to clear its main story. If you haven't played any Atlus game before, I'd recommand checking any of the Persona games before this one. HOWEVER, if you don't mind the grind, then go ahead and enjoy this game.",

There is no way to restore SP that's straight forward, and the dungeons overstay their welcome a lot. The limited time mechanics simply do not fit well in a game that makes you either use a guide or take several days to beat a dungeon simply because SP is limited. At several points I felt I was being punished for playing with the mechanics and using multiple underleveled archeotypes, because even normal enemies are quite tough and will eat your SP if you don't use one specific \"economy\" build and level that. Most bosses also expect a specific build you can't possibly predict (with some exceptions), but the game doesn't even have an option to load a save during combat, so you have to quit, adjust your build and then do the fight. This isn't difficult, it's just a chore, and I don't care how \"typical JRPG\" this is - other Atlus games do this better already.",

Glad you asked. Atlus has a nasty habit of being very interested in talking about politics. This is fine, politics are everywhere in our life and they spill into our work whether we like it or not. However, Atlus also has the horrible problem of being thoroughly politically illiterate and tediously centrist in all of their vaguely present opinions. \n\nIn a game like Persona 3 where the story is deeply personal, this doesn't matter. In a game like Persona 5 where the point is defeating a politically propped injustice, this is a snag on the story's integrity. In a game like Metaphor where the entire game hinges on political thought and counter-thought, plan and counter-plan, the story becomes a meaningless slop where the \"right way out\" is the power of friendship, as is the case with all Persona games (at least starting with 3). Except, it just falls short here.\n\nTo add to that pile of gooey nice smells, the gameplay (as cool and novel as it is if you're coming here directly from Persona) wears out its welcome thoroughly by the time you get to the end of the game. So much so that I'm pretty sure almost none of the sparkly reviews given by professional reviewers were done having finished the game.",

      "review": "Might contain some spoilers.\r\n\r\nI bought this game because I greatly enjoy turn-based RPGs, such as FFX, BG3 and Expedition33. I had heard good things about this game, Steam recommended it for me and it also had a great user score, so I paid the full price and was very excited to play. My only consern was that it seemed VERY anime, which im not big fan of, but maybe I could live with it? WRONG. Im so fcking disappointed, that Im gonna write an angry review about it.\r\n\r\n[h3] Premise [/h3]\r\nSo the story begings in a kindom where the king has just passed and it seems everyone wants to be the new king. There is alot of problems in this world however. Everybody seems to be so racist, that its almost comical. You know, there doesn't even seem to be any stereotypes to the many different tribes, like \"these people steal, these people are violenent\". No, they are different tribe so might as well kick the baby. Also every rich person seems to be evil to the core, and many NPCs seem to suggest something along the lines \"[i] Kill the rich and re-distribute the wealth [/i] \". Im already getting a feeling im being preached to, but whatever. There is also magic in this world, and its often called \"Magla\". More on that later.\r\n\r\n[h3] Story [/h3]\r\nThe story is nothing to write home about. You are one of the thousands of people in this \"Game of Thrones\", but you are the good boy. You want to help everyone, no matter the race, the village of origin or financial status. And you are going to do that with the power of friendship. Im already cringing.\r\nIn my opinion, the story doesn't have that many surprises, and even the \"plot twists\" aren't that surprising or satisfying. I also feel like the story over uses this so called \"magla\", which is like magic flowing in the air. Anything that needs to happen in the story, can be made to happen because of \"mAgLa\". Somebody gets a fatal wound? No worries, Magla manifests itself in away that it heals your wound. Something evil is around? A lady in your party can literally see magla and she says magla around seems twisted. You can see past events happen in front of you? Something to do with local Magla. [b] Dies of cringe [/b]. Overall its way too anime for me and doesn't really get me excited at all. [b] 3/10 [/b]\r\n\r\n[h3] Gameplay [/h3]\r\nThe best part of this game is the part where you get to actually play it. The combat is quite nice and I found the character building fun and interesting. There is many classes to choose from and most of them feel balanced (tho Thief was ass). Sure, most of the dungeons are repetitive and layouts are boring, yet I was always looking forward to get to a new dungeon. However, after the first 20hours of the game I started to realize the biggest problem of this game. YOU BARELY GET TO PLAY IT. \r\n\r\nThis game has a \"day system\", where it tell you that after certain amount of days, you are forced to progess, or in the other words, listen to shit ton of lackluster anime dialogue. Lets say the game gives you 8days before next snooze fest, how long is that? Well, you wonna go to the dungeon? the trip there and back is gonna take a day atleast, and clearing the dungeon always takes 1day, no matter how fast you actually do it, so thats 2days gone already. You might think that thats no biggie, since you still have 6 days left until next dialogue festival, you can do 3 more dungeons right? WRONG. The game also forces you to have a chat with your companions, so that you can unlock other classes that you are going to need later to beat this game. BUT WAIT, THERES MORE. Sometimes you need to increase your Wisdom or Tolerance before you can increase your bond with your companions. So now you are forced to go the town, speak with some commonwealth pig to increase your tolerance. Now you can go and listen to your companion and increase the bond to unlock other classes. Oh did I mention the \"day system\"? Speaking to the people uses half of a day-cycle. So if its morning, its gonna be night once your chat is over. So speaking to one commonwealth pig to increase your Tolerance, and then speaking to your companion to actualle get the class upgrade you want, just wasted one day-cycle. At first you can manage it, since you have only Nico Hülkenberg and Lance Stroll in your group, so not so many people to increase the bond with. But by the end of the game there is like 10 of them, So when the game tells me that we are leaving the town in 14days to take part in pride parade, I know that I can maybe go clear 3dungeons before I need to start focusing on my companions and their uninteresting problems. \r\n\r\n\r\nI just want to play the game, go to the dungeons, kill monsters, upgrade my character and have a good time. But in this game, it feels like only 20% of all the hours wasted I was actually playing, and the rest of the time I was pressing X to advance the dialoge, which btw is mostly about racism bad, rich people bad, help everybody good. There is also no post game, which I very much enjoyed in the games like FFX and E33.\r\n\r\n\r\n[h3] Summary [/h3]\r\nThe graphics are ok I guess. The music is ok I guess. The story is very meh and ultra anime and thats 80% of what this game has to offer. The actual gamePLAY is quite fun but there isn't much of it. If any FFXIV player is reading this, this game is like playing the worst parts of FFXIV main story, but instead of having the freedom to choose when to advance story and when to do other stuff, you are forced to do the MSQ almost all the time. [b] Bad game, 3/10. Maybe worth it for huge anime fans, but even then I would wait for discount [/b]",

      "review": "I'm mostly writing this to remind myself to never play this game again. \n\nMetaphor Refantazio is terrible beyond belief and I genuinely question how this ever got nominated for any goty award outside of visuals.\nIt is literally medieval persona 5 but bad with the (lack of) sublty and the refusal to fucking end just like persona 4 \n\nThe game's main theme is making your fantasies reality and anyone who says racism is either has not payed attention or are so politically brainrotted that the racism overshadowed the main theme. The racism is more of a motif or an undertone that eventually fades away in favor of anxiety. Either way Metaphor betrays the themes and motifs anyway. \n\nStarting with the racism, you play as the lowest of the low races and yet in a world where racism is heavily deep rooted, your party members except pikachu (even that is heavily downplayed) are all pretty tolerant of minorities and majorities alike. everyone except Junah and winged morgana realistically should have varying degrees of racism whether it be from a place of superiority, unfair prejudices projected unto them from their elders, or bad experiences from the past. In fact you being the lowest of the low races barely factors as an obstacle within the story outside of a sidequest or like two major event in the story but even those ties more into the political corruption and Louis being literal satan above all else. Speaking of, The game feels more interested in talking about political and religious corruption rather than it does racism since the church is roman catholic levels of corrupt to the point where it tends to be a lot more prominent in the story, sidequests, and social links. It's to the point where eventually the story gets bored talking about racism AND political corruption before anxiety becomes the buzzword of the day. And I do mean buzzword murderous Papirus? Anxiety and ganon herpes has consumed him, Church man steals sick dying people planning to sacrifice them to a volcano in order to apease god? nah he's let the melancholia warp his mind. Take a shot post major twist everytime anxiety comes up you will die.\n\nTurning your Fantasies into a reality is a nice message but what kills me is how literal it is considering it's the crux of the game's several terrible twists (all of the twists are terrible). On one end, I appreciate the optimism on the other, the twists somehow manage to be as god awful as persona 4's to the point where the story suffers despite both working really well in context of the game's central themes. In the case of Metaphor it sucks due to how much it undermines the mc's struggles and his og goal. Main twist 1: [spoiler] The mc is the literal Will (get it?) of the cursed prince which on one end is kind of cool and is vaguely foreshadowed but on the other, the journey feels pointless overall doesn't help that the mc is Jesus with no personality while the game is like \"oh hero thou hast lost something\" I am missing context while the game is acting like this should be obviously strange that the only memory the mc has starts with the prince but like... what if the mc just really cares about the prince idk [/spoiler] which leads into the Main twist 2: [spoiler] More is the Will of the dead king I was already clocked out when this twist was revealed but damn the king basically cheated death twice to orchestrate this whole journey [/spoiler] The other issue is that Louis the main villan is meant to be an embodiment of everything against this theme and yet, he's literally satan all while the game pretends mister might makes right over here has a bit more going on. Before muh anxiety kicks in basically making him be this figure to  scorch earth in order to rid the world of anxiety (it's as incoherent as it sounds).\n\nThe [strike] Social links [/strike]  Confidants are terrible sans a few outliers. They answer the question of \"why does Persona have 12 ranks instead of shortening them\". Followers are your answer. They either waste too much time with their alloted 8 ranks leading to pacing issues, does not have enough time to really develop into something interesting, or in the case of Hulkenberg, need to be available as soon as possible lest she becomes a dead weight for the gameplay but because of that, the story is dead air where if it was Persona 3 her social link would be available right after the first main twist where she makes up for lost time. Morgana with Wings is the exact reason why automatic follower ranks are were a bad idea for this game alone as if you want to play an actual mage you are stuck with the adept mage tree for 75% of the game forcing you to play mostly with cleric since summoner and magic dancer are gimmicks at best.\n\nThe calendar imo was ok the issue comes with how streamlined the game is where a max follower playthrough is actually extremely easy to achieve compared to the Persona series where you need meta knowledge (and or a guide) to do it without NG+ whereas metaphor makes it easy since ranks are gated behind story progress and social stats, by the end of my first run, I basically did everything the game had to offer leaving me with 10 days to spare before the \"final\" fight with Louis. I thought doing that would make the game end quicker but the game is like \"nah you have to wait out those days anyway\" and thank god for the Colosseum because I would have actually dropped the game because the game has little to offer. At least P5R and P4G have mini games while metaphor can be as empty as P3 Fes when you do all the followers and quests leaving next to nothing to do afterwards.\n\nAnd that leads to my other issue this game refuses to fucking end and yet plot points are shoved into your face at breakneck speeds. One of your party members are formally brought into your party after a series of twists and revelations, and afterwards the twists dont fucking stop after that. Every time the game feels like it is about to wrap up it hits you with something that instead of making you think back and even appreciate the hints like P4 or even P5 despite its asspulls Metaphor makes you clock out faster instead as more is reviealed. By the lead up to the final battle I was burnt out beyond belief because the game pulls that shit ALOT. You make several attempts at Louis life and it's as if god himself wants Louis to survive even trying to making you feel bad after attempt 1\n\nMaybe because I've only played persona up until this point but Atlus' inability to make a good epilogue needs to be studied. Just like persona 4 it spins in circles just to basically say \"all's well that ends well\" while really hammering in the main themes of the game for those in the back who were not paying attention to the 90 hour rpg.\n\nGameplay is ok. I played in hard mode only switching to easy in order to grind because the job system in this game makes things a bit more annoying than it has to be. Hulkenberg for example is a tank but in order to take full advantage of the knight tree you have to speck into the mage tree twice. Level 20 for the first branch to access adept and level 10 of adept for the branch dark knight. However, her stat spread makes her a pretty lame mage all things considered so your option is to play with a tank badly roleplaying mage, auto battle fodder or be really liberal with the lvl items. That isn't as crippling for Hulkenberg or pretty much everyone else... unless you're strohl who needs to heavily speck into the commander tree which sucked considering for the majority of the game, he's your go-to option for physical damage unless you spec the MC into physical damage which you kind of shouldn't since the two mages both take too long to join your party and aren't as minmaxed as the two physical attackers. I ended up making my MC a bulky mixed attacker since early on enemies in optional dungeons are mage-phobic. \n\nIf you REALLY want to play Persona 5 just play persona 5. Even if you liked P5 it's not worth playing a diet persona game.",

      "review": "It’s difficult to give this game a clear-cut rating, particularly when viewing it through the lens of the Persona series. However, judging it as a new IP from Atlus, my score unfortunately reflects my overall disappointment.\nStarting from the undoubted positives: the audiovisual presentation. The Atlus Sound Team delivered yet again, creating a soundtrack that stays with you long after you finish playing. It is also visible that the creators had an idea for a graphic setting and world design as such that distinguishes itself from the rest of the titles on the market.\nThe gameplay loop isn't necessarily \"bad,\" but it is the main source of my disappointment. Essentially, this is just Persona wrapped in a High Fantasy setting. The calendar system, the time management, the confidant mechanics, and even the combat and exploration mirror its sister series almost exactly. While we use archetypes (classes) instead of Personas, this feels like a purely cosmetic change. I love Persona, but I expected more innovation and variety from a new IP - especially knowing they are capable of unique titles like Catherine.\nRegrettably, the story and characters failed to grab me. The intro was gripping, mostly due to the mystery of a new world, but the narrative quickly became tedious. The NPCs feel one dimensional, the plot is predictable, and the main antagonist is a generic \"evil for the sake of being evil\" villain. Looking back, only one character from the entire cast actually left a lasting impression on me.\nOn the technical side, the game runs well. Playing a year after launch, I didn't encounter any bugs or issues. I played partially on Steam Deck, and aside from a few minor FPS drops, the experience was smooth. However, the lack of Ultrawide monitor support is a huge negative. I had to rely on unofficial fixes to get it working.

The demo was good enough to spark my interest further, but the full game just falls flat.\n\nAtleast the 12 hours i played the game i felt constantly rushed, pressured, restricted and forced to play the game how the Devs want it to be played.\nI'm pretty sure it gets better later in the game, thats how Persona games are, but for me that's a big flaw - it just takes too long to open up or give you all the possabilities you need to enjoy the game.\n\nThe battles are a pain if you don't start them with the correct archtypes (basically your classes / job).\nIt either goes smooth or you are fucked, forcing you to reload the game and try a different setup.\nI also felt like getting new eqipment or lvling up gave you barely any increase in dmg or dmg reduction\n\nI'm also not a fan of the music, it just irritated me after a while...\n\nGraphics are absolute dogshit for 2024 game.

Even the plot twists could not save the repeating \"hero save them all\" dialogues or a villain who keeps contradicting himself. The main character is so empty, that it's hard to relate. The narrative has to go one way, so the developers could not give the player any meaningful dialogue choices.\n\nThe music is great and grand, but what's with variety? There are a few themes, which are repeated during combat and dialogs through the whole game. I have listened to the same combat tune for tens of hours! Is it so hard to change them at least between chapters? Even the final battle did not get a unique track!\n\nThe combat. Well, I better go play Persona. There is a lot of grinding to unlock the archetypes, so you play the way you don't really want. I have not seen much difficulty either. Very quickly you get an arsenal of skills which allows you to take whatever combination of archetypes you want to a dungeon.\n\nIt's a decent game, but it is much worse than I expected after Persona 5 and all the positive reviews. Yes, visual style is great and animated scenes are gorgeous. Yet, it feels like the game was made after the plot and the movie was done. I \"finished\" the last chapter of the game on youtube because of all the mundane activities. Play Persona series, get this game on a heavy discount or just watch a story on youtube.

      "review": "(before saying anything, I want to say sorry for leaving an overall negative review, but there isn't a \"neutral\" or \"controversial\" option, my opinion is not negative, it's just mixed but the sheer existence of the Persona series brings this game down.)\n\nalthough I do recommend buying this game, I also admit that compared to your average Persona game, it is a big step down.\n\nBut let's start with the pros, the way you Approach a fight is much better, having to attack an enemy first before being able to attack them with an advantage is much better than \"approach an enemy and just press square\" and the gameplay has a bit of improvements here and there, some big, some small, and I do really appreciate them. The akademia especially is as good if not better than the velvet room.\n\nBut there are also Cons and they can't be left unaddressed. First of all the characters are SO ugly, like even Hulkengerg, who I guess is supposed to be the baddie of this game has the ears that are the size of Jupiter and a forehead that is bigger than the sun, how am I supposed to like that? Don't even get me started on that stupid bunny or whatever that monstrosity is, God I wanna strangle it just to put it out of its misery. Even the horses have gigantic pointy ears... WHY?! Was that really necessary?! I severely doubt it, in just 2 minutes of gameplay, you'll immediately realize how much the developers just injected their weird fetishes in this game. \n\nthe story is also much less engaging than an average Persona game, like why am I supposed to care about a lame prince who just got a random illness? At least in P5 it felt much more personal since they were going to expell YOU from school if you didn't act, but here it's just \"well I gotta save this prince I guess... ok...\" like bro I don't know this prince guy and you can't just give me a 2 minute cutscene and pretend like I'm supposed to care. \n\nThe worst of all tho is the MP economy, Now, I like a game with a challenge ok? It was moderately difficult but in like 4 fights I would run out of mp, which is fine, it's what is supposed to happen, but there is almost NO WAY to get your mp back, because safe zones don't regen your stupid mp for some reason, so you either spend numerous afternoons going in and out of dungeons or you look up how to gain mp back while being in a dungeon, and it is doable to be fair, but WHY WOULD THEY REMOVE THE MP REGENERATION WHILE INSIDE A SAFE ROOM?! WHY?!?! that is unironically the single worst decision I've ever seen a game developer do, and you can trust me on that take, I've played R6. I had to redo an entire dungeon and set the difficulty to easy to at least TRY to spare some Mp, and although it worked a little, I still ran out of them like halfway through the dungeon.\n\nAt the end of the day I do think this game is good (to a degree) but I also think that if you've played a persona game you'll be disappointed (unless you have a fetish for extremely big pointy ears and massive foreheads) and if you haven't, then you should just play any other Persona game first.\n\nAlso the music is mid",

I kept running into enemies I could one-shot, only for attacks to randomly miss, and then those same enemies suddenly get two turns in a row and instantly kill me. That’s not a battle system, that’s straight-up roulette wearing a fantasy costume.\n\nThe constant “X days until…” timers make it feel like the game doesn’t even want you to explore. Every time I wanted to wander off, try a sidequest, or just soak in the world, I felt punished for it. Nothing kills motivation faster than a ticking clock breathing down your neck in what’s supposed to be an adventure.\n\nLeveling up barely matters, which makes grinding basically pointless. You push your stats up a bit, but it rarely changes how fights play out. Combine that with dungeons offering zero real healing options outside of items, and good luck finding a merchant when you actually need one.\n\nAnd honestly? I do love the visual style. The art direction and anime-mixins are gorgeous. But the beauty can’t save a system that constantly drags my through irritation after irritation. It pushed me to rage-quit more than once.",

I've uninstalled it twice, only to come back to it half a year later, dump some hours into it, then uninstall it.\n\nThe plot is, ok. If your not used to on the nose political messages, the plot will probably land better than it did for me. Political elements in the games I play is normal, and this games use of those elements is very surface level. Very early on you get hit with all the major politics of the game, and it boils down to \"this species good, everyone else less good or bad.\" Ok, so racism. Fine. Then you think the big plot twist will change things...and it doesnt. Despite everything the game wants you to believe, it means nothing. \n\nThe characters are fine. Very much your typical Anime archetypes. If that works for you, great. For me it was just bland. You got your foodie, you fallen knight whos really super honorable, your robin hood character, priest/priestess whos actually very shady, etc. You know the deal if you know Anime tropes.\n\nCombat is fun enough, but has one glaring issue; you are punished for not playing perfectly. The game doesnt so much as actually punish you, but it rewards perfect play. This can be done on the regular vs trash mobs, but becomes harder as you fight harder baddies. So about being punished. If you dont play perfectly vs some of the easier mobs, you get just your basic rewards, not the extra little bit. However, the game fully expects you to play perfectly. So when you dont, you will slowly fall behind, little by little. This is only exacerbated by the game being on a clock and not being able to grind to catch up.\n\nFinally the time crunch. This is a genuine mixed bag. It pressures you to get stuff done in a timely manner, but at the same time limits your own ability to try new things out, unless you want to start a new game. Starting a new game is largely out of the question unless you already love the game, so your single completion better be the best you can make it...so better go use a guide. Thus the real problem. To feel like you are getting what you want with your time, a guide is nearly required. \n\nSolid 6/10\n\nMany games dont do the things this game does well, as well as this game. But it also falls short of being one of those games that will really stick around in your memory.

Incredible soundtrack, colors and presentation, character designs, atmosphere, story premise, it all seems like a complete package. A medieval fantasy Game of Thrones-esqe tug and pull of political power to overthrow a tyrannical General who commits Regicide. and that's just in the first few hours. Such a powerful start.\n\nHowever, thats when it all falls apart too. The combat in this game is beyond unforgiving and oppressive. I had an easier time with Shin Megami Tensei on the SNES, and that should tell you how bad it is. I don't know if this game is geared toward the small percentage of Persona fans who are obsessed with perfecting their playthroughs by beating every dungeon in 1 day with perfect mana management, but it certainly feels like it. The first dungeon in the game is an 8 floor tower. Yes, you are given 2 weeks to do it, and the game warns you to not put in off in lieu of sidequests and other content, but it still feels like its not enough. I spent at least 5 days getting thru the whole tower, a few more grinding levels to beat the boss, and it still was not enough. he spawns nonstop zombie adds and powers them up while spamming mundoon, a medium level spell at you. All this for the FIRST DUNGEON BOSS. Absolutely insane. the ramp up in this game is oppressive and the mana management requires an excel spreadsheet if you dont want to run out of mana in 3 encounters. I am playing on normal difficulty for reference. I cannot beat the first boss and dont have time to experience any other content within the time constraint either. I cant reccomend a game that won't even let me play it unless I make perfect combat decisions every turn. no room for error whatsoever. Not to mention the game is designed to not allow you to grind forever, you have limited mana and mana restorative consumables, and you have to advance a day to get more. you only get so many days and in every other one of these games it felt like enough. not in this one.",

This lead to the third boss battle in sequence, against an enemy you cannot damage who has allies that heal and are resistant to all magic. Additionally, your 'powerful' attacks cannot be used, as his invulnerability cancels the action and you lose your turn for trying. There is no way to know in advance, so, you have to die, respec and try again.\n\nIts a sucker punch pure and simple. No build up. No way to plan ahead.

Just a sucker punch.\n\nNice window dressing, some slick visuals, but ultimately frustrating, unfulfilling, and as I see it right now, a waste of my money and time.\n\nEdit: I went back, re-specced, won the fight. spent an hour talking to people.

The combat is not awful but it is nothing to write home about and becomes a chore as you start to finish the game.\n\nIt's follows the same time gated pacing if previous games but felt extremely off to the point I couldn't put my thumb on it until I had nearly beaten the game. Where previous Atlas games I couldn't wait for more side stories and character progressions this game I just wanted to continue progressing through the main story. \n\nThe realization came to me after completing some of the side characters stories. Unlike previous games these side characters have nothing but the MC to connect them. There is no school they go to, no town they all live in, every side story is just you the MC and that character. There is no character progression amongst the side characters themselves at all. It makes the entire \"off time\" just feel like a disconnected mess of stories. For characters who are fighting for their lives with one another the side stories don't make them give a shit about one another at all. They are just way to drawn out background stories with no actual substance. \n\nThis is the main reasoning why the pacing just feels awful. You go from the main story progression with all these characters to do side stories where you are getting 0 character progression amongst the main cast, side cast, or minor characters and ONLY getting character background for the current one you are working on. This is just awful story telling.\n\nAlong with the poorly written side characters the overall dialogue is written like a teenager writing their first fan fiction. Persona games have always been somewhat cheesy with their dialogue choices and that works fine considering the overall theme that this games entail but it DOES NOT work for a game that is about political assassinations and actual serious topics.\n\nIt's like Atlas just copy and pasted previous dialogue from other games an changed names if characters and places but didn't think at all about how that dialogue is supposed to be impacted by the theme of it. This becomes more apparent after about 35 hours or so.\n\nThe game is mid at best and I'd give it a 6.5 and only that because the first 20 or so hours are actually a very solid experience but it drops hard after that.

Graphics are good and no issues running the game so far with max settings. For me this is where the good ends. \n\nThe Bad: Unlike other Atlas main titles the story is... bad. Like REALLY bad. Nearly unforgivably generic overdone fantasy troupe with barely palatable anime cringe. I guess if you can stomach the FF7 Remake its probably fine; for me I couldn't and also found that game too bad to enjoy. The overarching \"lesson\" or \"Politics\" or whatever is so fundamentally flawed with how black/white, simplified it is that I cant take the game seriously at all. Its difficult for me to become emotionally invested in the main character, villain, or really anyone. Unlike other Atlas games where im glued to whats happening on the screen I find myself either distracted by real life more interesting things like my phone or im sighing in dissappointment. \n\nThe Average: Soundtrack is basically passable, but I expected better after experiencing other titles from Atlas. The pacing is about what you would expect from Atlas, but for me its been more noticeable because im not into the story at all. The soundtrack is mediocre; comparing this to other Persona games is heartbreaking for me. The map/dungeons so far are not as good as other Atlas games, but standard for other games.\n\nThe Verdict: I don't even know why they bothered to make this game. It is so samey in terms of gameplay that it doesn't offer anything new. Persona 5 Royal is my favorite JRPG, experiencing this in comparison has me mostly flustered with the creative decisions. This is one of those games that is a thousand times better for me when the story isn't in the way (BAD sign for an RPG by the way).

      "review": "Tl;dr: I give Metaphor: ReFantazio a 6/10. I thought I should give this disclaimer because most of what I'm going to write is negative of its core aspects, but I do want to make a point that, in its totality, I found my experience with this title to be average.\n\nI had high hopes and expectations for this title, especially as someone who got into Atlus' work through Persona 3-5. The first 10 hours or so I was thoroughly engaged and it made me stop playing my main game for quite a bit, so I can solely play Metaphor. However, once I got to the dungeon in the first main city, I was already feeling the fatigue of the combat loop. This feeling would continue to pester up until the very last dungeon. The gameplay loop is very much derived from the Persona series and it feels incomplete or lacking, in comparison. While I enjoyed the direction of the story up until we recruit [spoiler]Heismay[/spoiler], the events following it made me felt less interested as I gone through each major plot points. \n\nThe themes of Metaphor are something I appreciate, but the way they handled them is so ham-fisted and almost naive. It made me not care after hearing how discrimination is bad and equality is good so much times. The characters are such a mixed bag for me because I like some of them while most I couldn't give much a second thought to. By the final mission, I found myself skipping almost every character's dialogue due to a lack of interest and rushing to see the conclusion of the story, after 60 hours with Metaphor. Despite my negativity about the cast of characters, I didn't think they were badly written, just average or forgettable.\n\nThe true highlights of Metaphor for me were the art style and some of the soundtracks. I looked forward every time the gauntlet runner stopped by a vista point. The menu is visually appealing to look at too. Overall, I had a very average experience with Metaphor and I think a part of that is due to going into the title through the lens of a Persona fan. For the $70 price point, I wouldn't recommend Metaphor. Try to get it on sale if possible. I'm curious to see if there will be a sequel or another title within this series, but I'll be very cautious.",

      "review": "As a long time Atlus fan, this is the only game where I had stopped playing right at the start of the final dungeon, uninstalled the game, and was glad to never bother with it again. it's not a bad game by any means, but I find it baffling that it gets such an overwhelmingly positive reception, despite having plenty of flaws both in story and gameplay.\n\nThe main reason that I'm so disappointed by it, is because that this is a new IP, which meant that they could go wild and do whatever they wanted, crafted a well written and in depth story, explore new gameplay ideas, innovate on their formulas, but instead what we got is basically \"Persona 5, medieval edition\" with incredibly poor writing and stagnant gameplay. \n\nGenerally speaking, Atlus games never did have the best writing in them, but they did tackle their themes and plots in a decent way that it didn't constantly bother me, so I could give them a pass and enjoy the gameplay and character moments in them, however, in M:R, the worldbuilding and plot are so poorly written that I couldn't take the story seriously at all at any point. The main theme the game tackles is Racism, a heavy, complex, and important theme, however, the way you are shown how racism is portrayed in this world is just throwing shallow stereotypes at you about the various races in the game, and that's it. And hilariously enough, in many cases, the stereotypes turn out to be completely correct, further undermining the point of the main theme. In many points in the plot, it felt to me that the writers think that race and culture are one and the same, meaning that if you're one race, no matter your upbringing or your personality, your race determines everything, which, again, undermines the main point of the plot.\n\nThe writing, beyond the main theme, is again, not very good. Your party members are one dimensional, most of the plot is your basic JRPG plot of \"Kill the main villain with the power of friendship and save the day\" and some of the \"twists\" if you can call them that, just made me roll my eyes, because they too, manage to undermine the main theme.\nI had hoped that the game would go into depth about it's themes with the main party, with each person conveying a different point of view, having conflicts about different matters ,but most of the party feel really samey. They are all nice, agreeable and get along just fine, which is really nice if it was real life, but in a story that's pretty boring. The last two characters that get added to your party are the exception, but even they aren't particularly outstanding or have too much time to shine, unfortunately.\n\nThe gameplay side of things isn't much better, which isn't to say that the gameplay is bad, far from it, it's just that if you played any of the recent Atlus titles, you won't be too amazed by the gameplay, and considering that this is a new IP, one would imagine that they would want to innovate instead of retreading old ground, and unfortunately, they didn't really innovate. The main difference in M:R between other Atlus games is Archtypes.\n\nThe Archetype system, which is essentially your \"job\" system in this game, is pretty okay, nothing too mind blowing. You can freely set your party members to different Archtypes based on the situation and try out different strategies, such as warrior, mage, healer etc, which is pretty nice, however, the amount of menuing you have to do every time you decide to change between Archtypes and their gear is pretty annoying.\nAn additional annoyance that I found about the system, is that by the endgame, every party member has a a unique Archtype only they can use, and they require two specific Archtypes to be maxed before being unlocked, if you're like me, and you enjoy experimenting, and you might find, like I did, that you weren't close to getting the relevant Archtypes to max, and you'll feel like you were punished for experimenting by the game telling you \"oh, you didn't level these specific two archtypes to max for character x? too bad, get to grinding if you want it\". In the game's credit, you don't have to unlock them, the game isn't too difficult on its normal difficulty, but it does feel like it arbitrarily punished you for using the system as it was supposedly meant to be used.\n\nDungeons are pretty lackluster, both main story dungeons, and side dungeons. The main dungeons feel like they're big for no reason and don't really have any interesting gimmicks or mechanics to make the gameplay more varied, for example, in one dungeon you have 30 minutes before you die, in another, you have to hide occasionally from a difficult monster, not very unique or interesting in both ideas or execution.\nThe side dungeons are pretty bland, they look boring, mostly long brown or grey hallways sometimes broken up with a large empty room or a ladder to a different floor of bland brown or grey hallways and big empty rooms with nothing in them except enemies, sometimes it's caves, sometimes it's ruins, sometimes it's a big empty, flat forest. I have no idea if the side dungeons were randomly generated during development, but I won't be surprised if they were.\n\nMany times during the game I had hoped that I will encounter unique situations that require you to really experiment with the Archtype system and really challange you in more than a \"big damage number\" or \"HP bloat\" type of way, but unfortunately, that isn't the case. Mobs are usually dealt the same way they are dealt in the persona games, which is to say, abuse elemental weakness, kill enemy, move on. Boss fights weren't particularly memorable to me, so I can't recall any interesting gimmicks if there were any at all, take it as you will.\nI will say that there was one dungeon in the beginning of the game that if your party had a certain Archtype present during combat the common enemy type in the dungeon would enrage and could cause a wipe to your party, which meant that you had to change your Archtypes to deal with the situation, but that's literally the only dungeon I remember that happening, which is unfortunate,  because that kind of mechanic could be really interesting to explore and could provide much gameplay vareity and depth in my opinion.\n\nIn short, if I had to give the game a score, I'd give it a 5, it's not bad, it's not the worst game ever made, it's okay. If you're really interested in the game, or just want another JRPG to play and you think it needs to be this one, I would suggest to wait until a deep sale.",

      "review": "This game would have been great if not for the unnecessary grinding towards the end. I never had any trouble clearing content: as long as you complete all side content (bounties, side quests, etc.), you'll always be just the right level for your upcoming fight.\n\nHowever, for NO REASON at all, the game wants you to be level 65 - 70 for the final dungeon. With all content cleared up until this point, I was only level 56... Which means you need to grind for hours on end just to be able to play the story. The game also needs so much MAG (the currency to unlock new archetypes) towards the end game to obtain powerful new archetypes, the grind feels unavoidable.\n\nThe gameplay also felt clunky at times: if you go into a fight without the right archetypes, you have no way to reload the fight to change them and adapt to your enemies. Either you wait to die so you can change them, or you just ALT+F4 to reload your save and change (which is often faster to do....). There IS a button to restart the fight, but this doesn't give you the ability to switch your archetypes. So you're essentially closing and reopening the game just to adjust your characters... Yeah.\n\nTo nitpick one last time, (story spoilers) [spoiler] the story felt a bit repetitive towards the island arc. Also, the game baits you 2 SEPARATE TIMES into thinking you're about to reach the final fight of the story, which essentially gives you the feeling the story keeps making itself longer for no reason. [/spoiler]\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my time playing this game (the story is fairly good with an interesting villain and themes, cool characters, great art style and all) but I cannot recommend a game that requires you to grind simply to clear its main story. If you haven't played any Atlus game before, I'd recommand checking any of the Persona games before this one. HOWEVER, if you don't mind the grind, then go ahead and enjoy this game.",

There is no way to restore SP that's straight forward, and the dungeons overstay their welcome a lot. The limited time mechanics simply do not fit well in a game that makes you either use a guide or take several days to beat a dungeon simply because SP is limited. At several points I felt I was being punished for playing with the mechanics and using multiple underleveled archeotypes, because even normal enemies are quite tough and will eat your SP if you don't use one specific \"economy\" build and level that. Most bosses also expect a specific build you can't possibly predict (with some exceptions), but the game doesn't even have an option to load a save during combat, so you have to quit, adjust your build and then do the fight. This isn't difficult, it's just a chore, and I don't care how \"typical JRPG\" this is - other Atlus games do this better already.",

Glad you asked. Atlus has a nasty habit of being very interested in talking about politics. This is fine, politics are everywhere in our life and they spill into our work whether we like it or not. However, Atlus also has the horrible problem of being thoroughly politically illiterate and tediously centrist in all of their vaguely present opinions. \n\nIn a game like Persona 3 where the story is deeply personal, this doesn't matter. In a game like Persona 5 where the point is defeating a politically propped injustice, this is a snag on the story's integrity. In a game like Metaphor where the entire game hinges on political thought and counter-thought, plan and counter-plan, the story becomes a meaningless slop where the \"right way out\" is the power of friendship, as is the case with all Persona games (at least starting with 3). Except, it just falls short here.\n\nTo add to that pile of gooey nice smells, the gameplay (as cool and novel as it is if you're coming here directly from Persona) wears out its welcome thoroughly by the time you get to the end of the game. So much so that I'm pretty sure almost none of the sparkly reviews given by professional reviewers were done having finished the game.",

The racism is more of a motif or an undertone that eventually fades away in favor of anxiety. Either way Metaphor betrays the themes and motifs anyway. \n\nStarting with the racism, you play as the lowest of the low races and yet in a world where racism is heavily deep rooted, your party members except pikachu (even that is heavily downplayed) are all pretty tolerant of minorities and majorities alike. everyone except Junah and winged morgana realistically should have varying degrees of racism whether it be from a place of superiority, unfair prejudices projected unto them from their elders, or bad experiences from the past. In fact you being the lowest of the low races barely factors as an obstacle within the story outside of a sidequest or like two major event in the story but even those ties more into the political corruption and Louis being literal satan above all else. Speaking of, The game feels more interested in talking about political and religious corruption rather than it does racism since the church is roman catholic levels of corrupt to the point where it tends to be a lot more prominent in the story, sidequests, and social links. It's to the point where eventually the story gets bored talking about racism AND political corruption before anxiety becomes the buzzword of the day. And I do mean buzzword murderous Papirus? Anxiety and ganon herpes has consumed him, Church man steals sick dying people planning to sacrifice them to a volcano in order to apease god? nah he's let the melancholia warp his mind. Take a shot post major twist everytime anxiety comes up you will die.\n\nTurning your Fantasies into a reality is a nice message but what kills me is how literal it is considering it's the crux of the game's several terrible twists (all of the twists are terrible). On one end, I appreciate the optimism on the other, the twists somehow manage to be as god awful as persona 4's to the point where the story suffers despite both working really well in context of the game's central themes. In the case of Metaphor it sucks due to how much it undermines the mc's struggles and his og goal. Main twist 1: [spoiler] The mc is the literal Will (get it?) of the cursed prince which on one end is kind of cool and is vaguely foreshadowed but on the other, the journey feels pointless overall doesn't help that the mc is Jesus with no personality while the game is like \"oh hero thou hast lost something\" I am missing context while the game is acting like this should be obviously strange that the only memory the mc has starts with the prince but like... what if the mc just really cares about the prince idk [/spoiler] which leads into the Main twist 2: [spoiler] More is the Will of the dead king I was already clocked out when this twist was revealed but damn the king basically cheated death twice to orchestrate this whole journey [/spoiler] The other issue is that Louis the main villan is meant to be an embodiment of everything against this theme and yet, he's literally satan all while the game pretends mister might makes right over here has a bit more going on. Before muh anxiety kicks in basically making him be this figure to  scorch earth in order to rid the world of anxiety (it's as incoherent as it sounds).\n\nThe [strike] Social links [/strike]  Confidants are terrible sans a few outliers. They answer the question of \"why does Persona have 12 ranks instead of shortening them\". Followers are your answer. They either waste too much time with their alloted 8 ranks leading to pacing issues, does not have enough time to really develop into something interesting, or in the case of Hulkenberg, need to be available as soon as possible lest she becomes a dead weight for the gameplay but because of that, the story is dead air where if it was Persona 3 her social link would be available right after the first main twist where she makes up for lost time. Morgana with Wings is the exact reason why automatic follower ranks are were a bad idea for this game alone as if you want to play an actual mage you are stuck with the adept mage tree for 75% of the game forcing you to play mostly with cleric since summoner and magic dancer are gimmicks at best.\n\nThe calendar imo was ok the issue comes with how streamlined the game is where a max follower playthrough is actually extremely easy to achieve compared to the Persona series where you need meta knowledge (and or a guide) to do it without NG+ whereas metaphor makes it easy since ranks are gated behind story progress and social stats, by the end of my first run, I basically did everything the game had to offer leaving me with 10 days to spare before the \"final\" fight with Louis. I thought doing that would make the game end quicker but the game is like \"nah you have to wait out those days anyway\" and thank god for the Colosseum because I would have actually dropped the game because the game has little to offer. At least P5R and P4G have mini games while metaphor can be as empty as P3 Fes when you do all the followers and quests leaving next to nothing to do afterwards.\n\nAnd that leads to my other issue this game refuses to fucking end and yet plot points are shoved into your face at breakneck speeds. One of your party members are formally brought into your party after a series of twists and revelations, and afterwards the twists dont fucking stop after that. Every time the game feels like it is about to wrap up it hits you with something that instead of making you think back and even appreciate the hints like P4 or even P5 despite its asspulls Metaphor makes you clock out faster instead as more is reviealed. By the lead up to the final battle I was burnt out beyond belief because the game pulls that shit ALOT. You make several attempts at Louis life and it's as if god himself wants Louis to survive even trying to making you feel bad after attempt 1\n\nMaybe because I've only played persona up until this point but Atlus' inability to make a good epilogue needs to be studied. Just like persona 4 it spins in circles just to basically say \"all's well that ends well\" while really hammering in the main themes of the game for those in the back who were not paying attention to the 90 hour rpg.\n\nGameplay is ok. I played in hard mode only switching to easy in order to grind because the job system in this game makes things a bit more annoying than it has to be. Hulkenberg for example is a tank but in order to take full advantage of the knight tree you have to speck into the mage tree twice. Level 20 for the first branch to access adept and level 10 of adept for the branch dark knight. However, her stat spread makes her a pretty lame mage all things considered so your option is to play with a tank badly roleplaying mage, auto battle fodder or be really liberal with the lvl items. That isn't as crippling for Hulkenberg or pretty much everyone else... unless you're strohl who needs to heavily speck into the commander tree which sucked considering for the majority of the game, he's your go-to option for physical damage unless you spec the MC into physical damage which you kind of shouldn't since the two mages both take too long to join your party and aren't as minmaxed as the two physical attackers. I ended up making my MC a bulky mixed attacker since early on enemies in optional dungeons are mage-phobic. \n\nIf you REALLY want to play Persona 5 just play persona 5. Even if you liked P5 it's not worth playing a diet persona game.",

      "review": "It’s difficult to give this game a clear-cut rating, particularly when viewing it through the lens of the Persona series. However, judging it as a new IP from Atlus, my score unfortunately reflects my overall disappointment.\nStarting from the undoubted positives: the audiovisual presentation. The Atlus Sound Team delivered yet again, creating a soundtrack that stays with you long after you finish playing. It is also visible that the creators had an idea for a graphic setting and world design as such that distinguishes itself from the rest of the titles on the market.\nThe gameplay loop isn't necessarily \"bad,\" but it is the main source of my disappointment. Essentially, this is just Persona wrapped in a High Fantasy setting. The calendar system, the time management, the confidant mechanics, and even the combat and exploration mirror its sister series almost exactly. While we use archetypes (classes) instead of Personas, this feels like a purely cosmetic change. I love Persona, but I expected more innovation and variety from a new IP - especially knowing they are capable of unique titles like Catherine.\nRegrettably, the story and characters failed to grab me. The intro was gripping, mostly due to the mystery of a new world, but the narrative quickly became tedious. The NPCs feel one dimensional, the plot is predictable, and the main antagonist is a generic \"evil for the sake of being evil\" villain. Looking back, only one character from the entire cast actually left a lasting impression on me.\nOn the technical side, the game runs well. Playing a year after launch, I didn't encounter any bugs or issues. I played partially on Steam Deck, and aside from a few minor FPS drops, the experience was smooth. However, the lack of Ultrawide monitor support is a huge negative. I had to rely on unofficial fixes to get it working. This is especially frustrating considering that Persona 5: The Phantom X supports ultrawide natively. How does a gacha spinoff have this feature, but a major new IP doesn't?",

I had heard good things about this game, Steam recommended it for me and it also had a great user score, so I paid the full price and was very excited to play. My only consern was that it seemed VERY anime, which im not big fan of, but maybe I could live with it? WRONG. Im so fcking disappointed, that Im gonna write an angry review about it.\r\n\r\n[h3] Premise [/h3]\r\nSo the story begings in a kindom where the king has just passed and it seems everyone wants to be the new king. There is alot of problems in this world however. Everybody seems to be so racist, that its almost comical. You know, there doesn't even seem to be any stereotypes to the many different tribes, like \"these people steal, these people are violenent\". No, they are different tribe so might as well kick the baby. Also every rich person seems to be evil to the core, and many NPCs seem to suggest something along the lines \"[i] Kill the rich and re-distribute the wealth [/i] \". Im already getting a feeling im being preached to, but whatever. There is also magic in this world, and its often called \"Magla\". More on that later.\r\n\r\n[h3] Story [/h3]\r\nThe story is nothing to write home about. You are one of the thousands of people in this \"Game of Thrones\", but you are the good boy. You want to help everyone, no matter the race, the village of origin or financial status. And you are going to do that with the power of friendship. Im already cringing.\r\nIn my opinion, the story doesn't have that many surprises, and even the \"plot twists\" aren't that surprising or satisfying. I also feel like the story over uses this so called \"magla\", which is like magic flowing in the air. Anything that needs to happen in the story, can be made to happen because of \"mAgLa\". Somebody gets a fatal wound? No worries, Magla manifests itself in away that it heals your wound. Something evil is around? A lady in your party can literally see magla and she says magla around seems twisted. You can see past events happen in front of you? Something to do with local Magla. [b] Dies of cringe [/b]. Overall its way too anime for me and doesn't really get me excited at all. [b] 3/10 [/b]\r\n\r\n[h3] Gameplay [/h3]\r\nThe best part of this game is the part where you get to actually play it. The combat is quite nice and I found the character building fun and interesting. There is many classes to choose from and most of them feel balanced (tho Thief was ass). Sure, most of the dungeons are repetitive and layouts are boring, yet I was always looking forward to get to a new dungeon. However, after the first 20hours of the game I started to realize the biggest problem of this game. YOU BARELY GET TO PLAY IT. \r\n\r\nThis game has a \"day system\", where it tell you that after certain amount of days, you are forced to progess, or in the other words, listen to shit ton of lackluster anime dialogue. Lets say the game gives you 8days before next snooze fest, how long is that? Well, you wonna go to the dungeon? the trip there and back is gonna take a day atleast, and clearing the dungeon always takes 1day, no matter how fast you actually do it, so thats 2days gone already. You might think that thats no biggie, since you still have 6 days left until next dialogue festival, you can do 3 more dungeons right? WRONG. The game also forces you to have a chat with your companions, so that you can unlock other classes that you are going to need later to beat this game. BUT WAIT, THERES MORE. Sometimes you need to increase your Wisdom or Tolerance before you can increase your bond with your companions. So now you are forced to go the town, speak with some commonwealth pig to increase your tolerance. Now you can go and listen to your companion and increase the bond to unlock other classes. Oh did I mention the \"day system\"? Speaking to the people uses half of a day-cycle. So if its morning, its gonna be night once your chat is over. So speaking to one commonwealth pig to increase your Tolerance, and then speaking to your companion to actualle get the class upgrade you want, just wasted one day-cycle. At first you can manage it, since you have only Nico Hülkenberg and Lance Stroll in your group, so not so many people to increase the bond with. But by the end of the game there is like 10 of them, So when the game tells me that we are leaving the town in 14days to take part in pride parade, I know that I can maybe go clear 3dungeons before I need to start focusing on my companions and their uninteresting problems. \r\n\r\n\r\nI just want to play the game, go to the dungeons, kill monsters, upgrade my character and have a good time. But in this game, it feels like only 20% of all the hours wasted I was actually playing, and the rest of the time I was pressing X to advance the dialoge, which btw is mostly about racism bad, rich people bad, help everybody good. There is also no post game, which I very much enjoyed in the games like FFX and E33.\r\n\r\n\r\n[h3] Summary [/h3]\r\nThe graphics are ok I guess. The music is ok I guess. The story is very meh and ultra anime and thats 80% of what this game has to offer. The actual gamePLAY is quite fun but there isn't much of it. If any FFXIV player is reading this, this game is like playing the worst parts of FFXIV main story, but instead of having the freedom to choose when to advance story and when to do other stuff, you are forced to do the MSQ almost all the time. [b] Bad game, 3/10. Maybe worth it for huge anime fans, but even then I would wait for discount [/b]",

The demo was good enough to spark my interest further, but the full game just falls flat.\n\nAtleast the 12 hours i played the game i felt constantly rushed, pressured, restricted and forced to play the game how the Devs want it to be played.\nI'm pretty sure it gets better later in the game, thats how Persona games are, but for me that's a big flaw - it just takes too long to open up or give you all the possabilities you need to enjoy the game.\n\nThe battles are a pain if you don't start them with the correct archtypes (basically your classes / job).\nIt either goes smooth or you are fucked, forcing you to reload the game and try a different setup.\nI also felt like getting new eqipment or lvling up gave you barely any increase in dmg or dmg reduction\n\nI'm also not a fan of the music, it just irritated me after a while...\n\nGraphics are absolute dogshit for 2024 game. It looks so much worse then P5 and has aliasing from hell\n\nOn the positive site.\nThe MC is not completely silent anymore!\n\nTL;DR\nIf you are a Persona fan go for it.\nIf you hoped for something new and fresh from Atlus stay away.",

      "review": "The story started well and kept me interested till midgame, but then it started to drag. Even the plot twists could not save the repeating \"hero save them all\" dialogues or a villain who keeps contradicting himself. The main character is so empty, that it's hard to relate. The narrative has to go one way, so the developers could not give the player any meaningful dialogue choices.\n\nThe music is great and grand, but what's with variety? There are a few themes, which are repeated during combat and dialogs through the whole game. I have listened to the same combat tune for tens of hours! Is it so hard to change them at least between chapters? Even the final battle did not get a unique track!\n\nThe combat. Well, I better go play Persona. There is a lot of grinding to unlock the archetypes, so you play the way you don't really want. I have not seen much difficulty either. Very quickly you get an arsenal of skills which allows you to take whatever combination of archetypes you want to a dungeon.\n\nIt's a decent game, but it is much worse than I expected after Persona 5 and all the positive reviews. Yes, visual style is great and animated scenes are gorgeous. Yet, it feels like the game was made after the plot and the movie was done. I \"finished\" the last chapter of the game on youtube because of all the mundane activities. Play Persona series, get this game on a heavy discount or just watch a story on youtube. You are not going to miss much.",

It just made me start skipping a lot and im now just pushing through it to finish the game.. I also find the side characters and their stories rather plain and uninteresting.",

      "review": "At once an  entertaining yet also deeply irritating  game . Over complicated and annoyingly repetitive forcing me to take the auto battle route too oten in an attempt to move the action/story forward. Am sticking with it in the hope the good things about it will become   more evident and at some point I will be given an opportunity to strangle that blasted fairy . The stupidly repetitive refrains which she/he is apparently  required to utter at the end of every minor victory is possibly the major deterrent to any immediate desire I might have towards continuing the story.. Which is a pity because the story and the fantasy ideas could work if they were allowed to get out from under the mountain of trashy dialogue that accompanies every little combat sequence. So no real semse of immersion or depth for me .\n It  will be another game that is probably destined to languish in the dusty recesses of a library already overpopulated by the average the  ordinary and  the  downright dreadful .",

I think its a wonderful fantasy adaptation of persona, but it feels so dreary, and time wasting. In persona, accessing your \"personas\" and skills were really ironed out. It was nice quick and easy to change personas and update skills. Not in this game. Cycling through menus just to change classes and inheritable skills is so tiring.\r\n\r\nAs for the story, the dialogue and story is just... bland. There's nothing to relate to. Prejudice this, justice that, nobility this, inclusion that, discrimination there, suffering here, oh my sons is dead btw for the 20th time.... the general theme is just so repetitive. Gallica and Maria are the only ones i currently look forward to talking in the game.",

      "review": "This is from the perspective of someone who has put hundreds of hours in both the mainline Megami Tensei series and the Persona series. \n\nFirst, the good. Incredible soundtrack, colors and presentation, character designs, atmosphere, story premise, it all seems like a complete package. A medieval fantasy Game of Thrones-esqe tug and pull of political power to overthrow a tyrannical General who commits Regicide. and that's just in the first few hours. Such a powerful start.\n\nHowever, thats when it all falls apart too. The combat in this game is beyond unforgiving and oppressive. I had an easier time with Shin Megami Tensei on the SNES, and that should tell you how bad it is. I don't know if this game is geared toward the small percentage of Persona fans who are obsessed with perfecting their playthroughs by beating every dungeon in 1 day with perfect mana management, but it certainly feels like it. The first dungeon in the game is an 8 floor tower. Yes, you are given 2 weeks to do it, and the game warns you to not put in off in lieu of sidequests and other content, but it still feels like its not enough. I spent at least 5 days getting thru the whole tower, a few more grinding levels to beat the boss, and it still was not enough. he spawns nonstop zombie adds and powers them up while spamming mundoon, a medium level spell at you. All this for the FIRST DUNGEON BOSS. Absolutely insane. the ramp up in this game is oppressive and the mana management requires an excel spreadsheet if you dont want to run out of mana in 3 encounters. I am playing on normal difficulty for reference. I cannot beat the first boss and dont have time to experience any other content within the time constraint either. I cant reccomend a game that won't even let me play it unless I make perfect combat decisions every turn. no room for error whatsoever. Not to mention the game is designed to not allow you to grind forever, you have limited mana and mana restorative consumables, and you have to advance a day to get more. you only get so many days and in every other one of these games it felt like enough. not in this one.",
