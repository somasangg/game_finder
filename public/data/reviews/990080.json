      "review": "This review is from a non–Harry Potter fan who ended up loving the Harry Potter world!\nI had never watched any of the Harry Potter movies before playing this game, nor did I manage to finish the Harry Potter novel that one of my teachers had gifted me.\nLooking at the reviews and some interesting shorts on YouTube, I bought this game thinking I might abandon it just like many other games in my library, but to my surprise I got interested in the Harry Potter world right from the very start of the game, where I had to answer questions and get into one of the Houses, i also ended up watching all the movies just after completing the first few quests.\n\nThe gameplay is fun and very repetitive at the same time, and might get boring unless you encounter new enemies or unlock new spells.\nThe gear and equipment system is one of the most useless features in the game that should have never been there.\nThe world is fantastic and dynamic, with many interesting things scattered all around.\nThe art style is amazing — gives Red Dead Redemption vibes with its polished graphics.\nThe story is not that interesting; the threat doesn't seem that big and there is nothing at stake (there is actually, but it doesn't give that feeling at all).\nFor me the performance was fine with DLSS and Intel’s FG, with no lags, good frametime, and 100 FPS on an RTX 3060 with Medium to High settings.\n\nOverall, the game is pretty fun when it comes to exploring new areas on the map, trying out new spells, seeing new people and enemies, but quests become boring at times and gameplay is repetitive. Still, it is definitely worth buying and immersing yourself into the Harry Potter world.",

Everything [i]feels[/i] very \"Harry Potter\" - Hogwarts  is imposing and labyrinthian, and Hogsmede is whimsical and charming.\n\nHowever, performance is an issue (granted, I don't have a powerful desktop), and the control during combat sometimes feels clunky - its difficult to switch between targets, and button inputs are sometimes not registered. Controller-based menu control is minimal and mostly involves navigating menus by steering a cursor with the joystick. Character animations don't always match up with what is being said, and I've missed important dialog because owl letters from other characters narrate through cutscenes. The worldbuilding alternates between being very interesting and nonsensical, and character dialog options are typically limited to \"enthusiastic yes\" and \"demeaning no\", often with no impact on gameplay.\n\nMy recommendation: turn your brain off, ignore the jank, and just enjoy being in a whimsical world where everything revolves around you.",

Normally I’d expect something like an HP game to just be some sort of point and click adventure game, and if not that then I’d expect it to be completely on rails, but they seemed to have managed to create a “real” game with character progression and a map with fast travel gates.\n\nI mean it’s not Fallout 4, Skyrim, Legend of Zelda BOTW, but they managed to at least get some of that sort of gameplay, such as wand battles and character improvement over time.\n\nThe only thing that really bugs me personally is the overabundance of cut scenes, and the length of the cut scenes, but I guess it isn’t surprising for anything based on a movie franchise. It does make the game take up a lot of disk storage though.\n\nI think I could sum this up as recommended for those who are actually HP fans, unsure about those who aren’t HP fans because the game is good enough that anyone who likes kind of “fluffy” semi-RPGs with a lot of “adventure game” stuff like puzzle-type things will probably like it. But definitely not recommended for hardcore RPG players as this is definitely not a hardcore battle-oriented RPG.",

The world is stunningly detailed—I often found myself flying around just to enjoy the scenery instead of fast traveling, because exploring the landscape truly felt magical.\r\n\r\nThe combat was a major highlight. It’s incredibly fluid, and mixing different spell combinations made every fight feel dynamic and stylish. Experimenting with spell setups was some of the most fun I had in the entire game.\r\n\r\nI also absolutely loved the Room of Requirement. Such a cool concept, with entire spaces dedicated to your magical creatures—raising them, breeding them, and caring for them. Plus the customizable areas for brewing potions and growing plants were amazing. I didn’t explore it nearly as much as I could’ve, but I still made sure to decorate it and make it look good.\r\n\r\nI fully completed the game and 100%ed all the achievements, and while the endgame gets a bit grindy, it added to the sense of progression instead of dragging it down.\r\n\r\nOverall, Hogwarts Legacy is a beautiful, immersive, and endlessly fun experience that captures the magic of the Wizarding World better than any game before it.",

We were all at that age reading Harry Potter, fantasizing about one day an owl would land on our window and take us to a magical world. Call this game boring or even \"pre-made\", it doesn't matter. I'd still like it even more. We don't need it to be more creative or have a more open world. What we want to go to is the little world Rowling created. Do we really think just going to class and looking at the scenery is boring? But that was all the fantasies of that child ten years ago. Back then, after reading the book, I dreamt of going to Hogwarts, catching chocolate frogs on the train at Platform 9¾, walking up the spiral staircase, and visiting my common room. I remember back then there was no chance to see the movie, let alone the AI-generated content like we have now. I could only look at the blurry illustrations on the pirated pages and use my meagre imagination to fantasize about that magical and mysterious world. Calling it a game was less accurate than calling it a trip down memory lane; it was more like taking me back to my childhood dreams.",

Those were quite annoying, getting stuck if u try to run through... Had to stop, walk like a polite student... Sometimes would still bug so id go back a bit and walk slowly... Really wasnt fun needing to do that most the times... \nThere was another bug that i didnt actually encounter on my first playthrough (but in the other 3 runs i started for the achievements up until the map chamber point)... The audio of the quest where we get introduced to the merline trials bugged so bad in one run, nothing was showing, no sound of the old lady talking, no subtitles, skipping it was taking forever, even my character wasnt talking or showing any sign of responsiveness, that bug was at its peak on my second run when playing as gryffindor, then it was less as slytherin and wasnt there as ravenclaw (forst runthrough) or hufflepuff.\n\nTLDR; id rate this game a solid 9/10 and would recommend it strongly for the story, sound, gameplay and geaphics and the ideas in the game!",

Hogwarts feels alive: moving staircases, secret passages, cozy common rooms, and beautiful outdoor areas make exploration genuinely exciting.

      "review": "Short Summary: \nIf you are a Hogwarts fan who is new or getting into gaming then this is probably the perfect game for you. The atmosphere and world building is amazing even if the game has a very linear and simplistic story. On the other hand if you are more of a gamer (am gamer) the game will get a little repetitive for you especially if you are trying to 100% it. \n\n\nGetting into it:\nI have nothing against linear storytelling in games, not every game has to have alternative endings but when player choice doesn’t matter then what's the point? You don’t really get to be your own wizard in the game, you are the selfless hero or a mean spirited hero. Choosing the “meaner” option doesn’t impact your gameplay whatsoever and the main story along with many of the other character quests feel more like you are experiencing the story yourself rather than taking that much part in it. Yes you need to get things done to progress but when everything is laid out for you it's really not your story. As you get later into the game the story starts really lacking depth and the side quests get repetitive, I wish it was more of you trying to discover things on your own rather than the character telling you to do this so you have to do this or do something else to be able to then do this. There are some really interesting and fun parts of the story but a lot of duller moments that just feel like panning out the game as much as possible. (especially if you are not playing the game casually as in more than an hour or 2)\nCharacter storylines; Amit was chill not much to mention there is he doesn't really have a storyline like the other characters, Sebastian is the main one that we follow so his was the most interesting, Poppy’s really gave the game a lot of world building and if I were to be honest was probably my favorite character (Second of course to Professor Garlick, I’d go plant the Garden of Eden and hunt down Enchanted Golden Apples just for some more story with her ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)), Natty’s felt the most forced and annoying and makes the least sense if you weren’t in Gryffindor. In my main run I ran it down as a Ravenclaw want to learn all the spells which was easy enough, even on the hardest difficult I never really struggled with any fights, the gear system is pretty simplistic: just equip gear with bigger number, I like that you can change your appearance and not have mix matched looking gear but have a quality of life change where you don't have to change your appearance for each gear you equip it starts to get annoying. Running around as a knight looked pretty goofy and fun. Overall a very simple game mechanically and story wise so its hard to get to hooked on it for too long of a play session but playing casually as you probably should would be more recommended.  \n\n\nPros:\n- Fun puzzles\n- An immersive Hogwarts world setting\n- Fun and easy to get into combat\n- Better with mods (I didn't really play with mods since I wanted to 100% the game but they probably make the game better)\n\nCons:\n- Why tf does Merlin have so many trials, I didn’t read every lore or page that I picked up but from what I gather Merlin is a fricking troll\n- Zero replayability: there is literally only three differences when playing in a different house: your dormitory, your house specific color for certain clothing, and where you have to go in one of the intro quests (which made the achievements in the game so annoying)\n- Forced relationship with characters (no there is no dating in this game), what I mean is you are only seen as one way to the characters even if you are trying to get on their bad side so there is a lack of consequences for the actions gameplay wise and mostly story wise\nThings might get repetitive when playing for a while",

Wow amazing, it directly gives you back the Magic of Harry Potter feelings when you see hogwarts for the first time on the screen again. \n\nI played the PC games of Harry Potter 1-3 (yes I am a bit older^^) and really like the way how you learn the new magic spells and SO MUCH more comoared to the old games. \n\nIts amazing ehat you can do in this came, from flying through an open (big) world of the wizard world, taking clases, visit the room of wishes and fighting in great combat with using spells or your harvested plants (alraune and much more).\n\nIt is a must have for Potter Fans.\n\nI played now 22h (my son was born in beween so not so much time for a while but thats totally ok^^), reached Level 27 of my character, learned almost all spells but there still a lot of main mission and even muvh more side quest waiting for me (I heard the main mission requires around 40h to play and complete it).\n\nI installed it now on my steam deck and it runs perfect!!\n\nLove this game!!!",

Adding proper classes and a night curfew system would have made it even better.\n\nThe main quest felt a bit dull at times, and the Merlin Trials along with the collection achievement were quite a pain to complete 100% achievements.\n\nOverall, it’s a fantastic game, and I’m really looking forward to seeing a sequel.

I could use 1000 words and it would not be nearly enough to describe the beauty of the places you can visit. This goes both for the worldbuilding as for a lot of the NPCs you encounter.\n\nGameplay is a big plus too. It's super fluid and makes a lot of fun to string combos and juggle multiple enemies at once, particularly since/when you are able to switch between ablititysets on the fly (for most of the game i did not use this feature because i thought you still have to go into the menu to change your set (-.-') )\n\nThe story was ok. It was nothing special but it wasn't bad either but lets be real. Most people are not here for the story and it's engaging enough to keep you going. I actually liked 2 of the 3 sidesstories better than the main plot nut who cares. You get to be a student at Hogwarts and just roaming the castle or Hogsmeade in itself is more than enough to justify this game... If you are Potter Fan that is.\n\nWould i recommend? \n\nFor fans of the original series (since none is a fan of J.K. anymore these days) I would say yes, especially if you both read the books and watched the movies. \n\nFor people who never heared of Harry i really can't say, maybe probably still yes, if it's on sale sure why not.\n\nSincerely Rin",

I believe the game will evoke positive emotions both from fans of the saga and new players alike.\r\n\r\n[b] Gameplay [/b]\r\n\r\nThe gameplay in such AAA titles is often formulaic, yet it differs in its set of key mechanics. In this case, the world exploration and spell-casting are implemented quite diversely. You can brew potions, tame magical beasts, and master combat spells.\r\n\r\n[b] Visual component [/b]\r\n\r\nRegarding the visuals, I can only say one thing: playing on max settings is a magical experience, which is why you can get much more enjoyment from the process by running Hogwarts Legacy on a powerful PC or a next-gen console.\r\n\r\n[b] Bottom line [/b]\r\n\r\nHogwarts Legacy is a game that will appeal both to connoisseurs of the original universe and mere muggles who don't know how to spend a free evening with a controller in hand.\r\nㅤ",

      "review": "If you are a casual player it might suit you. This game have no consequences of your actions, everything is tailored in a way you simply can’t miss anything and general difficulty of puzzles and combat is just as much simple as it could be. Ability to put your OC into Hogwarts it’s also a good thing for someone I guess.\n\nHowever, if you are expecting the game to be anything more, then oh boy. Welcome to the wizarding world of corporate game developments where magic is used to fuck up every single thing it’s possible. Get ready for voice acting so charismatic you would think your refrigerator have legitimate chance at becoming a voice actor, for plot so uninteresting that would make doing laundry the most dopamine packed thing in the world, characters so shallow and one-dimensional who will make you think that wattpad smuts protags are model characters to be inspired in life, and game mechanics that is not “E for everyone” but “E for EEEEEEEEEEE” sound your brain makes because they are just brainless.\nThe beginning might be promising, however game is quickly telling you that Hogwarts and Hogsmeade are only a small, and only well designed part of the entire game. Apparently the “legacy” part appears to be a shitload of kilometres of the same looking areas answering the question of “how the unreal engine asset store looks like”. Only occasional things out in this uninteresting world will remind you that this is supposed to be a game in the universe of Harry Potter books.\nAnd I think that’s the main problem that drags this game down. I could stand the almost non-existent enemy variety, magic that don’t really feel like magic, brainless activities in the open world, puzzles with no difficulty, the combat so shallow it doesn’t matter if you fight goblins or spiders, and almost no freedom in game that is supposed to be so open if not for lack of atmosphere. After first hours this game is looking rather like a fantasy game inspired by HP universe than a HP game with some original ideas from the creators. Even when plot relates to stuff only known in this world (like dark magic), it makes it really bad. I can’t even say how bad. Characters cast unforgivable curses like they have AK-47 instead of a wand and there is no narrative weight to it, even when avada kedavra comes into the story. There are no morals to any quest including the main one.\nAnd speaking of the story – it sucks so hard it need a separate paragraph. I am a very story-heavy person and I like some fucking substance in a media I’m consuming so it doesn’t turns to be a consumption out of a spite. It feels like someone wrote the entire thing on their bathroom breaks, but I think what was left in the toilet would be a better idea. Even the best character out there – Sebastian Sallow who have any drama and decisions questioning your morality is lead in a way that in the end made to take a break from the game cause’ I couldn’t stand the lack of any moral and weight to anything that was happening. Even you being a student don’t really matters at all – house you pick don’t affect anything and instead of at least trying to simulate a student life at Hogwarts they rather put you into separate room to play Sims.\n\nOverall, it feels like people behind it loves Harry Potter, but I don’t know if either ambitions were too big, there wasn’t enough time, corporation forces too many things to strip it down from any soul or everything mentioned happened during the development. It is better to find a way to play previous Harry Potter games since they still have the charm and are much better to play than this disappointment. There they didn’t even bother to record the name of the house who wins the cup.",

Much of the world feels empty, and that is unfortunate because otherwise the world isn't a small world at all.   \r\n\r\nThe Castle, where many missions happen, is not remotely intuitive to navigate, which is its worst crime... Its designed to look populated, and they put tons of people in it, but mostly these people add nothing. They designed the interior to b  huge to fit those useless people in, which takes away intimacy. The interior layout of the castle, also -plainly- doesn't look right, and not in a \"magical\" way, just in a weird, this-level-designer-has-never-seen-a-castle, and might not understand Physics, sort of way.   Also, aesthetically its neither what I imagined nor what you'd see in the movies. \r\n\r\nI only played a couple dozen hours. I found most of the missions to be a bit boring. The puzzles are kinda simplistic and leaned on far too hard, imo. There WERE a few good ones - like the flying time trial - so I know there is good content in here. I explored the Map a ton- again it felt huge and empty. I didn't see a point to most of it but maybe I was jumping ahead and there was supposed to be a story not triggered yet. The Mechanics of the game play, like enlarging your inventory, remain a mystery to myself. \r\n\r\nI waited a long time before I wrote this review. I played it for ~30 hours before I uninstalled it. I don't even remember why I uninstalled it.  Whatever this game was, I think it could have been done completely differently.  Maybe it should have been MORE tightly scripted, so that you play a character within a Movie. Just roaming around Hogwarts and randomly flying off to battle random baddies , without Teachers asking me what the hell I was doing leaving campus. Here's an Example of how to improve it: Make leaving the Castle Campus meaningful and target to accomplish some objective. Make sneaking out a mini game. Maybe there's several ways out but if you're caught you don't get to use that exit anymore. Give it a timer- you have to be back before Sunrise. Is the Mission far away? Why isn't there a Magical scripted story driven way to get there, why do I fly around for half an hour and not just touch a port key or something and jump right into the mission? You see what I'm getting at? The Game Play isn't like the books or the movies in terms of how the characters behave or what they must do in-universe to accomplish their goals.",

I wish I could do more in the classes and have more options to interact and build relationships with characters rather than running around trying to complete tedious quests and trials.

But the moment you look past the stunning scenery and try to actually play, the experience collapses under the weight of its own \"Frankenstein code.\"\nThis is not a polished AAA release; it’s a beautiful world running on broken, mismatched systems. The clunky movement, the console-first controls awkwardly mapped to PC, and the unresponsive, laggy inventory menus prove that the separate development teams never properly integrated their work.\nThe lack of polish is embarrassing. You routinely see glaring, game-breaking visual bugs: student NPCs glide across floors in static T-poses, and character models constantly clip through robes and scenery. The core gameplay loop is continually fighting against its own disjointed technical execution. The game is a beautiful, ambitious, and fundamentally unfinished monster.

      "review": "I want to start by saying the design of Hogwarts is phenomenal and whatever team that was working on that did a fantastic job putting together the different references from the movie and the books.\n\nThat's about where my praise ends. This game has many problems, with the biggest one being:\n\n- Unimaginative and bland characters\nThe game has two types of characters. The first type is cheerful, quirky and nice. The second type is brash, arrogant and evil. So far there is nothing else. This has frankly ruined my experience of the game as every character feels soulless and exactly the same.\n\nOther issues:\n- Uncanny valley voice acting\nThe voice acting on its own is actually quite good! However, there are some striking cases where the voice acting does not at all feel realistic given the character that's speaking and it destroys immersion every now and then. Examples are Arthur and Sirona.\n\n- PC port and optimisation\nThis game does not feel like it was made for PC, especially when using keyboard and mouse. There are the usual issues with the camera and enemy targeting when using a mouse.\n\n- Dialogue options\n Usually in games I love exploring the different dialogue options, but not this one. I rarely ever press a dialogue option and think \"huh, I'm glad I decided to ask that\", usually it's \"Wow I wish that ended sooner\". Not sure what it is.\n\n- The combat, talents and spell slots\nI think they did okay with the combat and what they had to work with, although it feels like I spend most of my time spam-clicking like it's old Minecraft. Overall I wouldn't say I enjoy the combat. I think talents could be better in a lot of different ways, I don't really think that most of the talent \"trees\" offer anything, with some trees barely offering any talents at all. I think Skyrim's system with the different magic trees did a much better job.\nThe 4 spell slot system is a ridiculous system to have and its restrictive for no reason whatsoever, it takes away from immersion because I constantly have to dive into the menu and switch my spells out.\n\nWill continue to update my review as I progress.",

It's pretty to look at, but has the depth of a puddle.\n\nThey did an excellent job on the castle, but the gameplay outside of the main quests is a repetitive snore fest. Merlin Trials quickly become the most boring slop content in recent memory.\n\nThe combat quickly becomes routine once you learn which spells are most effective against which enemies and the required reflexes are not a high bar. There's nothing super innovative about the combat.\n\nThe graphics, especially in the castle, are impressive. Hogwarts has never been more fun to explore... But once you've seen it all, there's little else to do. I'd say the castle is like a beautiful lake, but when you get inside it you realize it's only thigh deep. You can't actually swim in the lake, it just looks pretty.... But there's nothing worthwhile or immersive you can do in it.\n\nNo quidditch, but broom flying is in the game. Enough said.\n\nClasses aren't really a thing outside of scripted events. House points don't factor in at all IIRC. There's only one or two quest differences between the Houses, it's not worth multiple playthroughs as a result. Unforgiveable curses are very forgiveable as no one will care if you use them or not.",

The world design is incredible (genuinely one of the best game worlds I've ever stepped foot in), but the gameplay, questing, dialogue, and story are frankly juvinile and unnacceptably bland. I can get behind playing a game designed for a younger audience/non-gamers, but this game feels like it is made for 10 year olds in the year 2003. Side quests are almost entirely the blandest form of fetch quests. The \"puzzles\" and collectables in the open world are just tedious and pointless. The dialogue is so predictable and drawn out, you might as well skip through most of it and you'll still know exactly what's going on. Somehow they made the menu in the game an absolute chore to navigate. The main story, while having a few interesting ideas, is extremely safe and underwhelming. The game is full of locks that you can't open until you have completed the stupidest \"collectibles\" quest for items that can only be collected at night time. Uggggh. On top of all that, how did this studio seemingly get away with making a Hogwarts game without including any Quidditch? I could rant further about what a missed opportunity this was, because I can see what it could have been, but this is sadly one of the most overrated games I've ever seen.

Every story of a side quest is just some uninteresting excuse why you have to cross half the map to fetch something.\r\nThe breaking point for me was when a middle-aged lady asked me to follow some random butterflies into the forbidden forest, because when she was a student, she wondered where they would fly to, but back then she was too scared to go look by herself. And now she sends me, a random student, into the forbidden forest despite telling me that it is forbidden to risk my life because she was interested 20 years ago???. It just doesn't make sense.\r\nOn top of the bad writing comes the equally bad synchronization.

Instead, just as you think the story and side quest is getting interesting, you are limited with a linear storyline, and false choices.  The morality is oversimplistic.  The \"unforgivable curses\" in this game are just bog standard spells in any other RPG.  So, it's kind of teeny bopper young adult RPG.  IF you want witcher 3 style moral dilemmas, you won't find it here.  No reflection on the complexity of adulthood and the world.  In the slithering side quest, you HAVE to kill the uncle if you learn the dark arts, and when you do, you're like \"what?  this is so irrational\".  The field guide is super annoying, i wish i could turn it off.  if you are a huge harry potter fan, maybe you'll love all the notes, but it should have been a feature for super fans, NOT a compulsory path to advancement.  It destroys revelio, you're always hearing pinging everywhere!  I did enjoy flying on the broomsticks, but it took me two full days just to leave hogwarts, which is huge and meticulous, but...  compared to how big hogwarts is, the rest of the map feels tiny.  once you get the broom stick, and get the field guide mostly out of the way, it's fun.  you can easily finish the game without upgrading anything.  i did thoroughly enjoy all the pets i captured, and have to admit that feedign and grooming them gave me an inexplicable amount of joy, so that was a nice little touch.  but.  i never actually upgraded my stuff.  \r\n\r\nIf you're a super fan, play this game, you'll enjoy it.

Now, it was still fun to play, and the graphics were amazing, it's all very pretty.  It just feels like such a shame, because it COULD have been a game and a story that you remembered for years afterwards, with rich characters that you fell in love with, and story choices that kept you coming back and always wondering, and reflecting on life.  Instead, the characters are all just OK.  The story was linear.  The morality was oversimplified.  so.  again.  if you're a mega fan, you'll love it.  if you like the movies/books, you'll have a good time jaunting down a bit of memory lane.  just.  don't expect to be whisked away on a magical adventure that you'll always look back on fondly.",

On one hand the story telling is okay but honestly doing any other quest or class assignments was more intriguing, and felt like I actually had an impact choice whether or not to just accept it. The main story is full of railroading and false dialogue option moments. I wasn't expecting to have major moments scripted and when things didn't really matter only then were we able to choose an option. The truly only impactful choice we get is what house we are in. Also the sorting hat was stupid as it's only a single question to pick your house. This game was not optimised for pc, so many times my keys wouldn't respond to inputs (no it's not my keyboard). Auto-targeting needs work as well, on multiple occasions it would shoot my spell at someone behind me or someone not even on my screen, they just happen to be a little closer than my target. Also why can't I target/stop someone turning into a wolf, there really isn't a reason to make them intangible. PLEASE ADD MORE SETTING OPTIONS!!! Why are we so limited in our settings??? I can't even change toggle RUNNING to hold running isntead, can't lock map from rotating. FIX YOUR DOORS!!!!! HOW DID THIS GAME GET APPROVED WITH THE CURRENT DOOR ANIMATIONS!?!?!? I have been caught by so many doors and had to back up and ROLL through the door, and with how many doors there are in hogwarts alone, it adds 10min to every 45min just trying to open the door. WHO DID YOUR SOUND AND LIGHTING??? The sound levels are so fluctuated and unbalanced that it makes it really hard to keep a level of volume, having to adjust the sound levels for most conversations and open world and combat, with some points having such a reverb that it can make it  hard to understand what they are saying. FIX the lighting in most areas of your open world dungeons and vaults specifically, I have been flashbanged on SOOOOO many occasions just trying to walk through the game. A bit more of immersion of the world we are in would be great. Why am I able to casually go into RESTRICTED areas, compete in an underground off-book fight pit, have a teacher learn about and then just nothing happen. Back to combat (sorry for this disorganised review) we need more spell slots, 4 is just not enough for how fast the coloured shields regenerate to how slow your spells recharge 4 is not enough slots please double it if you make a new one. TO ALL PLAYERS WONDERING IF THEY SHOULD GET THIS GAME, PLEASE ONLY GET IT ON AN 80% DISCOUNT OR HIGHER, OTHERWISE THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY.",

The world, Hogwarts, and Hogsmeade are pretty to wander around.\r\n\r\nBut then you face a few crucial issues:\r\n\r\n1. You can't progress with your main story because the game constantly pushes you to do stupid side activities to simulate your school life. While I can tolerate a tiny bit of sims-like activities for tutorial purposes - like owning a goddamn pet, painting your goddamn room, or crafting goddamn potions required for a quest - it’s hard to stand these lifeless activities with short-lived characters.\r\n\r\n2. There is virtually no life in the dialogues. While some of the main scenes related to the plot might have more action, the other 90% of everything happens exactly the same: two or more characters standing still in front of each other and talking. The voice of the main character (male in my case) is constantly calm no matter what is happening, as if he's elaborating on topics in history class rather than talking to real people and having real, life-like reactions. Often, the face of the main character not only doesn’t reflect what is happening in the dialogue but even contradicts the context (like smiling when a woman NPC is talking about the death of her husband). Every dialogue feels very straightforward and naive.\r\n\r\nOn top of that:\r\n\r\n1. No quicksave button in a game from 2023 (at least you can mod it on PC). If you save the game, you won’t necessarily start in the same spot; it might still throw you back to a checkpoint.\r\n\r\n2. The menu loads every time for a couple of seconds.\r\n\r\n3. The map in the menu has a separate loading process that happens every time you switch between your map and any other category like quests or inventory.\r\n\r\n4. You can't wander too far from a quest character, otherwise the quest-abandon timer starts (very immersive…).\r\n\r\n5. The only kind of puzzles you encounter (at least for the first 8 hours of my gameplay) during main or side quests are basically moving boxes from one place to another, which makes you feel as if the developers thought the player was going to be retarded.",

      "review": "(No spoilers)\nWell, let's start by saying this game definitely has some interesting pros and quite a few cons.\nOverall, as a game, it's pretty bad. During my playthrough, I encountered quite a few bugs, control issues, and camera glare.\nI'll list some of the pros here first:\n- The atmosphere of magic and Harry Potter is more than present here. Hogwarts Castle itself is quite large, intricate, and interesting to explore (in the beginning).\n- There's also a good soundtrack, basically like in the film series.\n- I liked the creatures featured here; at least we can interact with them and breed them.\n\nNext comes the cons.\n- TONS OF SIDE QUESTS!!! There are simply too many of them, there's absolutely no point in doing them, they don't give you anything, and the side quests themselves aren't particularly interesting. All the puzzles and other tasks scattered around the map are just a waste of your time. Don't do them. You don't have that inner worm in your head that tells you to complete the game 100%.\nAll the puzzles and \"secrets\" in Hogwarts are only interesting for the first couple of hours. Then you realize they're all the same old story and incredibly simple, and all interest simply vanishes.\n\n- Performance issues. Even on my fairly good PC (4070, i7-13th gen), my FPS never rose above 60-70 and was mostly around 50. (If you don't care about achievements, you can use performance mods; fortunately, the developers decided to add official mods.)\nThere are also issues in locations. I often encountered camera flares that just shine in your face and you can't see anything, which was just infuriating. It's especially cool to get one during combat. Cool, excellent, awesome!\n\nSpeaking of combat, you'll just get pelted with meat. There are tons of enemies crawling out of every nook and cranny, and you seem to have defeated them all, BUT! A few more enemies have arrived. Most of these enemies are just punching bags that you simply click on, and after you click on a mob, your focus can say goodbye. Seriously, I had enough moments during battle when my character would automatically lock onto a defeated enemy or simply some object, and no matter what I did, my character wouldn't stop hitting it. I had to just run and dodge all enemy attacks while waiting for my camera control to return.\n\n- Trials of Merlin and Alahamora. Pure torture. After completing the Trials of Merlin, I'm tempted to press skip to avoid watching the pre-recorded video, but unfortunately, there's no such option, so I have to watch the same thing over and over again.\nThe same goes for Alahamora; it's nonsense. Who the genius was who decided to add it as a minigame for hiding a castle is unclear. It would be fine if there weren't so many of them, but there are hundreds of them in the game, and you have to pick them, and every time you do, you look at it with a face like, \"AGAIN?\" It's unclear who the genius was who thought this would be cool, since it's just a waste of time that you can't skip if you want to complete all the content.\n\nThe game is also completely scripted. There are plenty of instances where a merchant starts telling you something, but the problem is, he's simply not there! He shouldn't be there according to the plot, but alas, the script demands a line from him. It's the same with enemies: some are covered in spiders and are effectively already dead, but the script demands a line from them.\n\nThere's nothing to say about the plot; it's just there. We'll ignore the fact that an ordinary schoolboy is destroying everyone and everything left and right, like a real Terminator, and the organization that was created to protect the magical world is always busy. You have goblins killing civilians—we're busy. You have poachers chasing everyone – we're busy. You have goblins staging a coup – we're busy. It's the same with the constable in Hogsmeade: you hand him all the information on a silver platter, but the answer is – don't bother.\n\nThe final battle, like the final mission, is extremely comical. Even Disney cartoons have more tension than that final scene; it's simply surreal.\n\nBottom line.\nFor all HP fans and regular players, my advice: Play only the story, complete a few side quests, explore the castle a bit, and as soon as you feel you're getting bored – FORGET IT, it's not worth it.",

      "review": "Although the game is Ok, it is boring. All you do is basically fetch items by transporting to the desired location and then transport back to hand the associated quest in. Yes there are fights, but you can usually avoid them unless you are in a \"dungeon\" or you have to in order to finish a quest. But that is Ok and expected in an Open World game.\n\nThe biggest downfall of the game is, that it wants to be every type of game at the same time. But it effectively can not achieve any of it. The characters are boring (contrary to the characters in the movies and books) with boring voices and unusually acting face expressions. All voices have overly British and/or Scottish accents (I lived in the UK for 13 years, so I can compare). Maybe this is the American view of British/Scottish voices!?\n\nFurthermore, the controller handling is awful. Loads of things are controlled by the R2 button and you will ultimately make mistakes, when not having R2 released properly. As an example when pressing R2 and the dircetion down button you switch to another command set, but the derection down button on its own will heal the character. When you are in a fight and want to heal directly after a spell, you might accidentally switch to a different set of magic when not having fully released the R2 button before hastily heal. L1 is also sometimes a problem.\n\nAdditionally the total number of levels you can gain is 40. All other Open World games I know have at least 10 more levels to complete.  And this is not all. After level 40 there is nothing that would make you want to progress as you do not gain anything. In all other games I know (and play; examples HZD, HFW), there is at least some hidden levelling, like Ghost or Paragon Levels. Also in all other games there is an additional NG+ option, which is missing here as well.\n\nThe Portkey is just something, that is developed by WB for this their Harry P games. So You should ignore this as a game item and/or in-game.\n\nAnother thing: If you fly you do not see the tracking of your current target.\n\nLast but not least: I Hogwarts itself there is no proper map. So you never know exactly know where you currently are.\n\nSo basically this game is boring, has nothing to offer than a little Harry Potter feeling.\n\nOh, BTW, I also play the game on the PS5 with about 30 hours play time.",

But despite that, a lot of the gameplay systems didn’t click for me—maybe my expectations were too high.\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue for me is the loot and dynamic level scaling.\r\nEnemies and gear scale with your level, which leads to strange frustration: some players even recommend avoiding chests until you’re higher level so the loot isn’t wasted. That completely kills the joy of exploration. Because the gear always scales, side systems like crafting, the Room of Requirement, and the ranch feel pointless—you’ll replace everything anyway.\r\n\r\nThe inventory is also tiny: you start with 20 slots and can only upgrade to 40. That makes experimenting with different passives nearly impossible because you simply don’t have the space.\r\n\r\nCombat was better than expected, but still limited. You can only have 4 spells equipped at once (plus 3 loadout sets), so swapping spells becomes annoying if you want to try new things or need specific utility spells. Enemy variety is pretty small, and there are only around five bosses—though a couple of those fights are genuinely fun.\r\n\r\nThe game has a ton of collectibles and challenges, but many of them feel more tedious than rewarding. The story didn’t do much for me either. I barely felt any tension, and the dialogue is pretty flat. Choices don’t matter, and I eventually started skipping optional conversations because they lacked emotion. (To be fair, the last game I played was Expedition 33, so most games would probably feel weaker in comparison.)\r\n\r\nOne positive worth mentioning is the accessibility options.\r\nThe game includes a surprisingly large range of accessibility settings, which is genuinely nice to see and makes the game more approachable for different players.\r\n\r\nOverall, it’s a beautiful world with underwhelming systems.

The music, world design, sound design, and voice acting is very evocative of scenes from the beloved movies but suffers in the aspects that make video games a really compelling medium.\n\nCombat:\nThe combat is made to be easy to learn and quite casual, fun even, but ultimately shallow as it devolves into \"match the enemy's shield color with your own colored spell.\" There are some enemies that have unique spell interactions such as plunging a certain spider's head into the soil with descendo (purple spell) when it rears into the air, the pick 4 cards spell systems makes uncovering these fun and rewarding interactions unlikely for the average player who may gravitate to 1 or 2 spell decks without swappping out spells too often after picking one they may end up partial to. This is how the colored spell system ends up hurting any semblance of depth with a large chunk of enemies. Purple and Yellow to break a shield and Red to hurt with \"Green forbidden magic\" to just be a debuff or instakill. If you play on the hardest difficulty then mages may now have a red shield. WOW! I think the card system holds back all the special effects from inffluencing better enemy design since attacks are easily parried or dodged with ample amounts of warning. Spells like expeliarmus being fantastic for mages is a good thing but you may opt to ignore that spell in your limited decks since a large chunk of enemies in the 40 hours i played, werent mages. You can have 4 decks of 4 cards but seeing as there are noncombat spells for creatures and the magical room you get to customize, realistically you will have 2 decks with the other 2 filled with the noncombat seplls for those respective parts of the game, limiting you to 8 spell slots for the pragmatic player that hates always going into the card menu to constantly swap around spells as they need. The card system ends up being a detriment to bot the cozy aspect of the game and the combat.\n\nWorld and Characters:\nAmazing level of detail on display but quite little put into characters that live in this world and even some seemingly silly additions to worldbuilding. You really only have 2 friends in this game, 1 boy from slytherin and 1 girl from gryffindor (as they have some narrative significance) and no real sense of attachment to any of your dorm mates as there aren't any real group activities outside of minor quests where you interact with their very one dimensional personalities, such as helping creatures or learning a spell. For a game set in a magical school, not having real friends is a terrible missed opportunity to liven up the \"gallery\" this game ends up being more often than not.\nHere would be that example of that silly world building: The 1 friend from gryffindor comes from a school in Africa, where students dont use wands to which you can ask if that can be done without downside. The response is \"yes, with no penalties, benefits, or differences from using a wand.\" If that were really true, wands wouldn't exist any longer. The narrative is a forgettable chosen one story that i couldn't be bothered to finish. Some activities for side content is fun and engaging but once you realize they usually result in a cosmetic item you won't particularly care for, you''l do them less frequently, most notably the merlin puzzles. The world is filled with quests that may interest you with the worldbuilding or oil down to a boring fetch quest to reward you with \"better\" gear item or an underwhelming cosmetic.\n\nTo elaborate on gear, it's mainly artificial number go up for the sake of level gating story quest and padding playtime with very little meaning for why this game even has a looting system. No buffing a specific spell or enhancing spell effects, just your take less dmg and deal more because arbitrary number is higher.\n\nThe devs probably fought hard to make this game so artistically faithful to the IP considering they worked under WB (and with all the harassment from Rowlings's online presence), but as far as a game in this genre goes, there are ones out there with a lot less bloat, more depth, less shallow characters, better narrative, and even more engaging combat. It's a very pretty look into the idea of a harry potter video game but that passion for recreating the world in a modern game comes at the cost of making a good game.\n\n5/10",

      "review": "Let's start with the massive, inescapable problem: CRASHING and performance. This game crashes 24/7—it is absolutely incapable of running right. My PC is well beyond capable of maxing this game, yet I struggle for stable frames even on \"minimum\" settings. The optimization is ABYSMAL, HORRIBLE, and frankly embarrassing. The half-hour shader compilation every time you launch is a joke, only for the game to crash five minutes later. Unless the developers fix this mess, it will continue to suffer. \nAdding insult to injury, the gear and loot system is utterly useless; gear stats barely matter, making the endless cycle of collecting and managing inventory feel like meaningless busywork tacked onto an already tedious open world. Money system is awful and \"punishes\" the player. The core design of the game is stretched out to a groan-worthy extent. The linear plot is severely padded, leading to disastrous pacing. A fairly significant story progression is always accompanied by five useless, annoying fetch quests and filler missions, making the whole experience feel like a chore rather than a magical adventure. The game is far too long for what it offers, quickly becoming a slog. Furthermore, the characters are shallow, annoying, and instantly forgettable, carrying zero emotional weight, and the voice acting is maddening. The world is riddled with buggy collectibles and an excessive number of puzzles that eventually make you loathe the sight of any locked door.\n\nDespite these massive cons, among others I won't go on about, the game is genuinely good at its core. When it works, the combat is pretty fun and fluid. Fighting with powerful magic, chaining huge combos, and deploying massive abilities feels great. The enemy/mob and world design(s) are fantastic, and the overall graphics are good, even when suffering performance issues. There is tons of cool stuff to do, from flying on a broom and fighting goblins to designing your workshop-room. It's a fun experience that doesn't actually require any prior Harry Potter knowledge. However, the developers make you fight harder against the optimization than against any in-game boss. As it stands, it’s fun, but barely playable.\n\nOn a massive sale it's not a bad buy, but keep all of this in mind. As it sits I can't give it more than a 5.5/10 with a clear conscience. If at least the crashing/performance issues are ever fixed, I'd rate it at as a potential 7.5/10, but until then it's a mid experience overall.",

The combat is interesting for a bit but really doesn't progress in any way. You unlock new spells, but they don't really do anything all that different from the spells you get first. There's nowhere near enough variety in enemies so every fight feels the same. Hogwarts is probably the best part of the game but after a couple hours you've explored the entire thing and the only new things that get unlocked are being able to open new rooms that have one item in them and nothing more. The map outside of Hogwarts is really disappointing. Hogsmede is cool, but all of the other towns are so small and there really isn't much to do, and honestly the bottom half of the map is an absolute joke and clearly was an afterthought. The story is pretty mediocre, but the absolute worst missions in the game are required in order to progress it so sometimes it just feels like a chore. I finished the game, but I was pretty ready to be done after maybe half way through and honestly I don't think sticking it out was worth it as the end of the game is one of the weakest parts",

The characters were also very shallow in story and motivations, e.g., that boy using dark arts was not very well written or believable to me. The magic gameplay was mid, which was disappointing. The flying and scenery were nice because I could use max graphics.

      "review": "From technical standpoint of how this game functions, plays and accepts mods, this is just another UE4 garbage. On top of that, main story is also garbage.\r\n\r\nTo my suprise, there are nice mods that can let you adjust the experience a little to make the gameplay pleasant, Sell all items button, auto pick up, alohomora skipping the minigame, quicker revelio, more outfits, etc. Some side missions were interesting, and i couldn't wait to start blazing avada kedavra at anything that moves, but sadly, it doesn't work on everything (Thanks a lot plot armor), and once i had it, my damage was so high, i could just whip 2 simple spells to defeat most enemies. This is not Harry Potter/Hogwart game that people wanted/expected, its some delirious trip that makes no sense if you think about it logically. Kids being taught magic for good and kindness, and doing harm is bad, but oh, game says freeze and blow up this enemy for extra points. And then our character blames the antagonist for their death... What kind of twisted logic is that, you're the one murdering all of those people/beasts... Limited options and purposes of each game mechanic renders them useless after 2-3 visits (Loom/Menageries/Discovery table/brewing potions, hell even alohomora minigame). The biggest crime is the faces of all the kids. They look so fake and weird when they smile, i wish i could spam Crucio every time i see that. The Finale is also a letdown, not only is our antagonist a goblin, but we don't even choose the ending, the game just decides it all for us, so most choices are pointless.\r\n\r\nSide quests and some locations are gated behind main story progression, which means that you can't just do side missions and enjoy the game your way, you gotta suffer the story too. On top of that, its often a main mission that rewards you with spells that you will need for side missions, so its an unpleasant chore in order to unlock the \"fun\" parts.\r\n\r\nThis game was a long weird trip, a rollercoaster of hitting the bottom (of entertainment) and rescueing a dragon, but from technical side this game is a nightmare, invisible walls, ceilings, so you won't jump off places, even though there is death from fall damage, so i don't get it why they would prevent us, then there are places where they did not place them, leading to cases where you can soft lock yourself in those invisible cubes unless you load up a save, terrible character placement based on character size/scale (So if you change your model/size, cutscenes go wild), light going crazy in some caves if you pop revelio, flickering as game loads maps \"In background\", which in some cutscenes is a constant issue (Have fun people with seizures). If it wasn't for mods, i would have dropped it forever after my initial 20 hours. Its not worth its price and praise, but its not unplayable or unbearable all the time.\r\n\r\n\r\nStory: 3/10 (Shallow, stupid, stretched for no reason, in some places just unbearably stupid)\r\nSide missions: 6/10 (Some are fun, some are meh, some are decent)\r\nExploration:  5/10\r\nMusic:   4/10\r\nPerformance: 4/10 (It improved compared to release date, but the constant flickering due to how the world map was build is unbearable sometimes).\r\nCombat: 5/10 (Repeatative, enemies are damage sponges until they are not).",
