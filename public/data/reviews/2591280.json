I'm just having so much fun roleplaying and making fictional F1 teams with fictional drivers (Porsche F1 team with Estre yeeeees!), or making fictional drivers and putting them in pre-existing teams. Pleaaaase don't give up on this series! There's so much creativity and free imagination right next to the real-time strategy-like gameplay, that's to be had in this kind of game -- and especially when you think of what a future title could be, that I don't think anyone else will try to attempt.",

      "review": "Was having fun, despite some glaring errors UNTIL it corrupted my save file for no apparent reason after my first podium. I grinded for half a season to get to my first podium, and I don't want to go through the few races to get back to Austria again to do it.\r\n\r\nOther infuriating things? Sitting in the pit because your driver won't go into a gap that any IRL driver would. Losing half a dozen places because of this during a safety car.\r\n\r\nBlue flaggers blocking you through enough corners they would be penalized IRL. Cars with blown tyres/major issues sitting on the racing line, your driver just sitting behind them while other people pass you. I've seen more red flags than safety cars/VSC combined. All of these issues I saw in F1 Manager 22 which I played as well.\r\n\r\nUninstalled. Having your save file corrupted after your biggest win of the season really makes you wonder why you played this at all.",
