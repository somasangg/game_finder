I just wished they had built upon the gem that ascension was.\n\nEdit after replaying sphere of influence ascension.(A game i have 135 hours on ps5) Look if you want graphics and more animations, with some new mechanics implemented, definitely try this game as a veteran of the previous titles. I wouldn't recommend this game to a new player at all, the historical quests just arent as abundant as in sphere of influence. I love this game only because of all the beautiful memories I made with ascension where I can just play this game without having to worry about history accuracy or anything else.

I use Decky powertools and DISABLE \"SMT\" so the game runs on only 4x CPU cores and limit them to 2500hz.

I just wished they had built upon the gem that ascension was.\n\nEdit after replaying sphere of influence ascension.(A game i have 135 hours on ps5) Look if you want graphics and more animations, with some new mechanics implemented, definitely try this game as a veteran of the previous titles. I wouldn't recommend this game to a new player at all, the historical quests just arent as abundant as in sphere of influence. I love this game only because of all the beautiful memories I made with ascension where I can just play this game without having to worry about history accuracy or anything else.
