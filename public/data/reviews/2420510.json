Roboco was my favourite for her simplicity yet very fast XP gain + battery collection gimmick, and a really satisfying main weapon(when fully leveled, it changes from a pew pew gun to a giant plasma cannon).\n\nSince then, it has also implemented a bunch of other completionist side content, such a fishing minigame, building your own house, gambling in a casino(purely ingame currency, no IRL money involved), and its own version of Jump King. You might need to look at the wiki to figure out the item combinations(called \"collabs\") even if you have some familiarity with Hololive.\n\nWould recommend, but be aware that time will fly as you play and grind achievements for this!",

      "review": "Great game, feels better than other similar games. \r\n\r\n\r\npositives:\r\n1) Strikes balance between player skill and rng. \r\nGame allows player to exploit it in a way that it feels intended. Rng is supporting game, not defining it. Its unfortunate that most games of this genre are either pure rng(Mgeabnko), or balacned in such way, that rng and skill dont matter(mobile VS clones)\r\n\r\n2) Easy to learn hard to master.\r\nGame is easy and may feel boring when you have a set of strong collabs you are always doing. Think about characters who feel weak. Are they weak? Or they are not supposed to be used they way you use them? Should you even try figuring it out? What if by learning limits of weaker characters, you could find holes in your logic and become more capable in real life? Thing about this game, is that you dont need all the characters maxed to beat it, you dont even need to summon because Orange Cat waifu available from the beginning will carry you. That is if you play the game to farm coins and finish maps. Is that the only thing you want to do?\r\n\r\n3) Characters are gameplay enabling.\r\nOne problem that other games of this genre have is their characters. They are different in superficial ways, like a starting weapon(VampireSurwives and all of its clones), or their abilities interfere so much with core game, that half of them are unplayable.(Mgebanok - labubu of the genre) \r\n\r\n4) Grind is simple.\r\nSome of the grind is passive accumulation over time. But the most powerful bonuses are farmed in an hour, and then you never have to do for the character again. Maxing out a character takes 45-60 minutes depending on how fast player chooses power ups. And there is around 50 of them, conveniently putting, in my opinion, the longest COMPLETIONIST grind in the game to <50 hours (give me slack it could be taking 3 runs to max instead of 2 that i used but still can be done in an hour for each charatcter) IF player chooses to max out every character fandom like this, then by the end, other main game features should be maxed or close to maxed on its own.\r\n\r\n5) Good achievemns.\r\nMost achievements are some form of challenge, to step out of comfort zone. Its interesting to do.\r\n\r\n6) All of the above, but the game got a theme to it. Colourful pixelated anime girls are actully real people. You can find most of them on youtube and, either fall acompletely in love, or become hopelessly disappointed. But disappointment only lasts until you find the real heroine. To help you In your quest to finding Oshi, i will tell you both important secrets: \"Good people don't get a lot of views\" and \"Bad people don't get a lot of views\". So i sincerely hope, that you will find your Oshi. And when you do, and as a result end up kanojo-less, remember advice that helped you on the way there.\r\n\r\n\r\nnegatives:\r\nNegatives dont come enumerated. They are instead a progression of life after playing this game.\r\n\r\n- Become part of the crew, part of the ship.\r\n- Compulsively learning nihongo.\r\n- Start liking Shoujo Ai.\r\n- Must always make time to watch your Oshi.\r\n- Have to buy merch.\r\n- Have to cosplay girls, despite being man.\r\n- Can you show yourself to your parents in a sorry state such as this. Embarassing.\r\n- Isolating in room.\r\n- Order sushi.\r\n- Polish katana replica.\r\n- Want to go to japan, but can't, because unemployed and spend all money on posters, plushies, and figurines(including real life size) of the Oshi.",

      "review": "[h1]Definitely my favourite survivors-like to date.[/h1]\n\nGenuinely, the most important thing I could say about this game is that it stands on its own apart from Hololive at least for me. If you’re like me and would be worried you might not enjoy the game with a lack of knowledge about VTubers then don’t be. The extent of what I know about them really is that I listen to some of their music, and that I’ve obviously seen some of them around online recognizing some of the designs here and there. Quite frankly I don’t really get it to be honest, the success of VTubers has always been a mystery to me. I personally don’t see the appeal, but I do see the appeal of this game.\n\nLike the title says this is most definitely the best survivors-like game I’ve played to date as of writing this review. If you like this type of game you will definitely enjoy this one. The thing that brings it to a status of my favourite I’ve played is that you can tell lots of work went into the game all for the price tag of absolutely nothing because it’s a fan project.\n\n[h3]Here are some highlights for me (as of November 2025):[/h3]\n\n- 48 unique playable characters, all with their very own unique starting weapon, special attack that has a set cool-down time, and three skills. None of the characters weapons, specials, or skills end up feeling very samey which is awesome. I imagine most of them are probably references to the VTuber the character is made from but I don’t really get any of them.\n\n- Overall the art is really amazing, tons of unique sprites for enemies, weapons, items, skills, bosses, etc. A big strong suit for the game which makes sense as I believe the dev is an artist not a game dev.\n\n- Boatloads of content if you enjoy the mindless grind like I do.\n\n- I really like the “Fandom” system in the game which rewards XP to the character you complete a stage on and they level up and gain bonuses to HP, attack, and start the game with more of their skills unlocked so you don’t need to use your hard earned level-ups on getting them. (Curse you achievements for getting every character to Gachikoi level on fandoms but I still did it…)\n\n- Very satisfying sense of progression because of the Fandom system but also just the base stat upgrades and such in the shop that you spend your cash on.\n\nSo the hours displayed above the review is about how long it took me to very casually, not really efficiently “100%” the game which in my opinion was going for all [b]201 in-game achievements (as of writing this review),[/b] and ignoring stuff like the scam items in Usada’s Casino, and getting all of the Fan Letters that I didn’t exactly deem necessary as part of the 100% completion. Cause those are super grind money, and complete RNG.\n\nAs a non-fan of Hololive the Holo House feature was an absolute nothing burger for me so I didn’t think it was really worth leaving my opinion on, I suppose it’s probably great for fans. You can decorate a house with a bunch of stuff to make it look how you want. I personally would have preferred the effort that went into Holo House to have gone into just more main game content, but I understand why people might like it.\n\n[h3]Included in the Holo House are:[/h3]\n\n- Your obligatory fishing mini-game.\n\n- Casino to gamble in (hell yeah).\n\n- A place to grow crops and a place to cook with those crops to get food items that will give you buffs in stage mode.\n\n- A Jump King style mini-game called Tower of Suffering.\n\n- A fence area where you keep little critters and they generate you money passively if you feed them fish and vegetables you grow.\n\n- A spot made for mining ores and chopping down trees so you can craft items to make some cash if you’re looking for a change of scenery.\n\nDespite the mindless grind it sometimes became, the game is completely free, just try it. Like it or don’t like it I don’t care but I definitely agree with the very high positive review rate that it has gotten. [i][b]If you have ever held off on trying it because of your lack of knowledge of the subject . I don’t know almost anything about these characters or references and I spent 160 hours in the game. If that’s not enough I don’t know what is.[/b][/i]",

Every run feels different, every character feels unique, and every upgrade drags you deeper into the rabbit hole until you suddenly realize you’ve played 100 hours — and you’re still having fun.\n\nThe attention to detail is amazing. Every VTuber has abilities that fit their personality, the animations are adorable, the music is pure energy, and the fan service (in the best sense) is overflowing. You can tell this game was made with love, not just for the characters, but for the entire community around them.\n\nIt’s simple, it’s free, and it’s dangerously addictive. What more could you ask for?\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h2]Final Thoughts[/h2]\nHoloCure is more than a fangame — it’s a celebration. Of Hololive, of creativity, and of how fun games can be when made from passion.",

      "review": "I went into the Vtuber rabbit hole back in 2019 and of course it was Hololive that introduced me to the world of Vtubing. So when a fan-made game of Hololive based on Vampire Survivors (i haven't play it and i might soon) called Holocure released i was really shocked and hype to try it out. It was fun, chaotic and addicting more than anything else.\n\nTwo things that made me appreciate this game every time i play it, the first one is that it has a gacha system for the characters but it won't cost you any payment instead the characters are unlocked by collecting coins in the game and then spending them a thousand at a time on an in-game gacha mechanic. Yu, the developer is keen to emphasise that the gacha is purely in-game currency and does not involve any sort of monetisation, you just need to play the game a few times to unlock the additional characters.\n\nSecond and this might be the best thing about Holocure is that you don't need to know anything whatsoever about Hololive to appreciate it. If you have never explored VTuber culture at all, the game’s intro sequence provides a brief bit of context, and from there the playable characters can all simply be seen as cute girls with unique abilities. At the other end of the spectrum, however, if you are deeply immersed into VTuber culture and Hololive culture specifically then the game is absolutely rammed full of references and in-jokes that will continually delight your experience.",

Stupidly fun, with builds for everyone, flawless presentation, endless amounts of upgrades to buy with exclusively in-game money, and a really challenging difficulty curve.

Doesn't matter.\nHolocure is an incredibly solid vampire survivors-like with well over 20 characters, EACH with unique skills and mechanics that actually change how you play. \nThe gameplay rivals paid games in the genre that cost 10-15€ and this one is FREE as in free beer. \nHow can you beat that?The amount of variety and polish here puts some paid titles to shame.\nEasy recommendation.",

Want some fun, interesting characters, weapons and unique loadouts for each character?  Want it to be VR Model Idol themed?  Here ya go!\n\nOnly w downsides.  It does add content all the time, and the list of general weapons is a bit low...but it has a heavy modifier system each run, with enchantments, stickers for main weapons, fandom boosts, and some fun extras.  For a few bucks, or 2 dozen hours, a fun Vamp. Survivors light, with some management and building sim elements.  Fun, light, and a great second screen game.
