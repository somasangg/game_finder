Basic stuff that makes you more efficient at fighting while playing one of the 4 current modes out rn (TDM, Get em all, Deathmatch, and 1v1s). Get em all is like Plunder in CoD Warzone, get money around the map, don't get hacked. Deathmatch (Kill em All) is one life TDM 3v3s. All modes have different maps to play on (4 TDM, 3 GEA, 3 KEM, 3 1v1). There are currently 16 heroes to play categorized by their skillsets (6 Slingers, 4 Stikers, 4 Disruptors, 2 Infiltrators).\r\nDo I like it? There's some jank in the gameplay, but I like what it has going for it. It is free to play, while playing you earn diamonds which you buy envelops to roll for skins. Dupes net silver and gold coins to spend in the shop for items you want. There are some skins like the Frontier skins that I wish they would add into the shop, but they did add the previous rotation of skins to the shop to buy with gold coins, but not the Frontier skins before that, so idk what they plan to do for that. I'd recommend giving this game a try.",

Basic stuff that makes you more efficient at fighting while playing one of the 4 current modes out rn (TDM, Get em all, Deathmatch, and 1v1s). Get em all is like Plunder in CoD Warzone, get money around the map, don't get hacked. Deathmatch (Kill em All) is one life TDM 3v3s. All modes have different maps to play on (4 TDM, 3 GEA, 3 KEM, 3 1v1). There are currently 16 heroes to play categorized by their skillsets (6 Slingers, 4 Stikers, 4 Disruptors, 2 Infiltrators).\r\nDo I like it? There's some jank in the gameplay, but I like what it has going for it. It is free to play, while playing you earn diamonds which you buy envelops to roll for skins. Dupes net silver and gold coins to spend in the shop for items you want. There are some skins like the Frontier skins that I wish they would add into the shop, but they did add the previous rotation of skins to the shop to buy with gold coins, but not the Frontier skins before that, so idk what they plan to do for that. I'd recommend giving this game a try.",

Players engage in intense battles where strategy and tactics determine victory—whether through long-range gunfights, close-quarters brawls, stealth ambushes, or chaotic all-out fights. Customization is key: tune your weapons to suit your playstyle and stand out on the battlefield. Choose a master and define your role in combat, adapting to diverse game modes. Maps are designed like cinematic sets—from abandoned subways to luxury rooftops—immersing players in a gritty cityscape of betrayal and crime.",
