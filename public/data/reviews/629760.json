Even today, it’s a low population game that still attracts returning veterans, because the combat system is unmatched and nothing in the genre fills the same gap imo.\n\nThe melee gameplay is incredibly satisfying. Not perfect, but easily the best slasher combat I’ve experienced. Once you understand timing, feints, footwork, and the mind games behind each fight, the whole thing becomes addictive. Even after 3k hours, I still catch myself pulling off things that make me grin like an idiot.\n\nThat said, the game has its issues. The community can be toxic, cheaters often slip by without much consequence, and the devs gave up on what could’ve been something truly great. Mordhau deserved more support than it got.\n\nA Note for New Players\n\nThe learning curve is massive, and the game doesn’t go easy on newcomers. You’ll get destroyed, confused, cornered, and whacked by shirtless lunatics with frying pans. It happens to everyone.\n\nBut don’t let the chaos push you away. Even with the low player count, there’s a tight-knit group of OGs and returning vets who still help new players, answer questions, and offer tips if you ask. And if the game is on sale? Definitely worth picking up. Stick with it, learn the basics, and once the combat “clicks,” you’ll understand why so many players come back years later.\n\nTLDR - Buy it if it's on sale.",

Blocks only last for a short period of time, and have a cooldown. Naturally this is to prevent block spamming, but it creates a meta that revolves around circumventing blocks through abuse of the non speed based damage system. (The feint isn't abuse as its meant to interact with the block mechanic naturally) Also shields are weirdly not physical objects unless activated to block or if something is thrown at them.

Then there is a tons of weapon that all work diferently with speed,damage and reach.  You unlock new weapons overtime.\n\n* Lots of maps\n\n* Different mapmodes, my favorite are Objective mode where you for example take part of a siege and take keypoints and move forward your position.\n\n* Sound design. Very loveable with the bloodgurgling  and screams from dying. Also a big bunch of Voice emotes that is quite hilarous when u get the hang of it and communicate with enemies back and forth.\n\n* 64 player bot matches with friends are superfun\n\n- Downside is that you can only earn ingame money in online combat to create your own characters and a lot of players online are fantasticly good, but you earn money in each battle. Real players are just so much harder to kill than bots :)\n\n- The whiny community of the old glory days of this game that just give bad reviews because the developer stoppped with developement. I mean what developer would continue to support with new stuff for a 7 years old game? Come on!\n\nFav mediaval combatgames:\n1. Mordhau\n2. Chivalry 1\n3. Chivalry 2\n4.

      "review": "Mordhau is an FPS game created out of love for Chivalry and heavily inspired by HEMA (Historical European Martial Arts). It relies on a physics-based collision model. In layman's terms, the game features a rather advanced melee combat system, allowing for a variety of complex maneuvers: feints, ripostes, and lock-ons.\n\n🧠Mordhau, like any self-respecting game, likely has a plot, and it's likely dramatic and full of twists and turns, and the characters' decisions are tear-jerking. Although, to be honest, I didn't follow it closely. I imagine it's about two groups of knights: blue and red, who set out on a crusade to the Holy Land. During their journey, a discussion arose between them: should one pray to God before a sword, which, when stuck in the ground, looks like a straight cross, or before an axe, which looks like a tau cross?\n\nObviously, God, who is love/king of kings, cannot be worshipped before a sword, which is a tool of the devil and war/an axe, which is an attribute of the peasantry, so the other side insults him.\nThe rest was easy to predict...\n\nThe game is entirely multiplayer-based; there's no single-player mode at all, which makes the gameplay frustrating at times. Generally speaking, most battles involve 20 or even 40 blue knights on one side, and an equal number of red knights on the other, resulting in chaos and a general mess. People, however, kill each other seemingly at random. Arrows fly out of nowhere, enemies run from all directions, rocks fall from above, and hot tar pours…\n\nSometimes, in the middle of it all, there's a clown with a lute, or two guys punch each other in the face, while people stand around them in a circle, clapping their hands (there's an unwritten rule among players that an enemy bard, at least as long as he doesn't try to kill you with a lute, and his audience doesn't get killed, and you don't interrupt a boxing match).\n\nThen suddenly, a naked man with a frying pan in his hands appears out of nowhere and bashes your head in (a frying pan is one of the weapons, and some players equip it for fun).\n\nUnfortunately, this means you have to get used to the fact that you're going to die, often in stupid ways. The upside is that most players (fortunately) aren't very good at swordplay. Unfortunately, among them are master swordsmen who can get between 7-8 enemies and dispatch them one by one. Besides, even an encounter with an average player is a death sentence for a typical noob.\n\nYou also have to get used to bear traps hidden everywhere, arrows flying from the other side of the map, falling from towers, and cunning players hiding behind doors to bash in the heads of anyone who tries to pass.\n\nThe essence of the game is, of course, the swordplay. You create your own character. There are a few pre-made archetypes, but let's be honest: they're poor. We can't influence stats (this isn't a cRPG), we can only choose weapons, armor, and abilities.\n\nWhat truly sets the game apart, however, are the melee weapons. As you might guess, each type differs in range, swing speed, damage, and their intended use for both slashing and thrusting (moreover, they have two modes of use, so, for example, a bastard sword can be wielded with one or two hands), as well as how they cope with different types of armor (for example, swords are usually very good against characters without armor and those in light armor, but weak against opponents in heavy armor, while warhammers are the opposite).\n\nWe also have a huge selection of armor, helmets, and leggings, although it's important to remember that the better protected a character is, the slower they move.\n\nThe maps themselves are also very attractive. In one, for example, you fight on a trampled plain with trebuchets firing overhead. In another, you defend a small castle. In yet another, you fight for a large castle with its outlying areas. The attackers must first push the siege tower, which the defenders attempt to set on fire. Then the assault begins, during which the defenders pour boiling oil on them and throw stones from the walls. Then we break into the city, and the carnage begins in the streets… Meanwhile, the defenders try to escape…\nIn addition, the maps also feature various catapults, mortars, and horses that can be captured and used.\n\n✅Pros.\n- Many character development options for more experienced players\n- A great melee combat system that offers a wealth of possibilities\n- Every kill feels earned and rewarding\n- Pre-made character classes for beginners\n\n❌Cons.\n- Steep Learning Curve\n- Exploitative Tactics\n- Team‑Friendly Fire\n- Toxic Community\n\n🧾Overall.\nMordhau stands out as a brutal yet highly skill-based medieval combat game that rewards strategy, timing, and precision. Its deep customization, diverse game modes, and intense melee system create a rewarding experience for both casual players and hardcore enthusiasts.\n8/10🔚",

      "review": "💬Mordhau has earned a cult following, and for good reason – it's an incredibly addictive, yet still demanding online slasher set in the Middle Ages.\n\n🎮Using melee weapons isn't easy. Sure, you can simply pick up a sword and swing it around, but in such a situation, the chance of harming someone is slim (you'll likely get hit first). Mordhau perfectly demonstrates this. While it's certainly not a full-fledged simulator, it boasts a combat system refined enough to give you a sense of what a medieval warrior would experience on the battlefield. To be precise, in Mordhau, you won't inflict damage on yourself, but you certainly can on your allies.\n\nMordhau could easily be described as an \"easy to learn, hard to master\" game. You really don't need a wealth of knowledge to start swinging a sword, axe, or spear, or even trying to shoot someone with a bow. Performing all these actions – colloquially speaking – by feel is one of the philosophy behind the game developed by Triternion studio. While it does include a rather extensive tutorial, which takes about fifteen minutes to complete, it's still difficult to remember everything your instructor tells you. It's a bit like driving a car, where only after passing the driving test do you truly begin learning how to drive, despite having previously devoted dozens of hours to theory and practice.\n\nWhat's the reason for this? Complexity. This manifests itself not only in the number of strikes you can deliver, but also in the fact that each one can be executed in a completely different direction. If you remember how it was in For Honor, you'll know that a somewhat similar, albeit more complex, system is used here. There are more directions, and therefore, the game offers greater room for maneuver during combat. In addition to standard slashes, you also have thrusts, and you can turn the sword blade towards yourself at any time to attack an unsuspecting enemy with the hilt. In addition, there's the ability to parry attacks, perform kicks, and more. However, mastering all these skills and timing are crucial, as in addition to the health bar, there's also a stamina bar, so you can't attack and defend endlessly.\n\nThe biggest attraction is the one-on-one duels. These are the moments where you can prove your skills, rather than hoping for a miraculous victory over your opponent. Only in these moments do you see who has mastered the art of skillful striking and parrying, and who has mastered stamina management. However, this doesn't change the fact that when you start the game, you have to be prepared to die even moments after respawning.\n\nWhile the melee combat itself is truly excellent, using ranged weapons is still far from perfect. Shooting someone with a bow is a huge challenge, requiring incredible precision. It's also worth remembering that after just a few seconds of aiming, our character starts to, well, cramp up? Anyway, they swing their bow in all directions, just not where they should. The catapult system is also poorly executed. While the controls themselves are clear and easy to understand, the exact placement of the weapon is sometimes a complete gamble.\n\nIn terms of gameplay modes, Mordhau is somewhat surprising with its battle royale mode, which doesn't quite work for me. Fortunately, it's not the main attraction, as the developers have opted for tried-and-true solutions when it comes to gameplay options. We have the typical Deathmatch (both individual and team), Frontline, where our task is to capture specific points on the map, divided into several rounds, Skirmish, and Horde, where instead of fighting other players, we must cooperate, repelling waves of incoming enemies. So, there's not too much to choose from, but enough for everyone to find something they enjoy.\n\n👍Pros.\n- Easy to understand, difficult to master\n- A multitude of well-made, diverse weapons, armor pieces, etc.\n- A variety of game modes and maps\n- Everything can be unlocked with gold (no microtransactions)\n\n👎Cons.\n- What's the point of this battle royale?\n- Optimization could be better\n- The bow, crossbow, and catapult systems leave much to be desired\n- Combat can get hectic, friendly fire is an issue\n\n🏁In Conclusion.\nMordhau will certainly appeal to fans of Chivalry, Mount & Blade, War of the Roses, and For Honor, but you don't need any experience with these games to enjoy this game from Triternion. It's important to remember, however, that when you begin your Mordhau adventure, you'll be dying in droves, and only after a while will you begin to understand what it's really all about. The path to becoming, perhaps not a master, but a reasonably good player isn't easy, but making even the smallest progress is a ton of fun. And therein lies the power of Mordhau, which rewards the willing and persistent, not those with deep pockets.\n🎯7/10",

      "review": "It's the best in the genre, and one of my favorite games, so it's painful not to recommend this.\nHowever, it is the honest thing to do. My reasoning is below:\n\nUnfortunately the player count plateaued a long time ago and only seems to get smaller month over month. We've finally dropped below the 1,000 player count peak on PC, and console players maybe add a few hundred on top of that. Only those with an undying love for game are still playing, which means if you're new, you're going to have a hard time understanding why you're getting absolutely destroyed by anyone you run into purely due to mechanical depth that is not immediately apparent, and poorly taught via in-game sources.\n\nTriterion have more or less abandoned the game, with the last update being nearly a year ago, and that was a PvE horde mode about demons in a game people obviously picked up for PvP. It was odd to watch them have a potential strangle-hold on a genre only to lop off its' head and leave it festering in a dumpster with the occasional spritzing of Febreze to keep the smell at bay. Also, to be clear, Chivalry 2 was never a threat to that.\n\nI believe they also started work on an unannounced new IP some time ago, so it's unlikely they'll return to drop new [PvP] maps, weapons, or a balancing update barring a 10th anniversary. I'm not going to include the questionable cosmetics they've released in an attempt to further fund whatever they're up to now. I hope it's good, but after witnessing the development cycle of this game, I wouldn't go out of my way to pre-order it.\n\nIt's only fair you know what you're getting into if you are going to pick this up on sale for $5-$10 USD, otherwise I wouldn't have bothered leaving this review. I'll still be playing, but I'm a masochist, or a sadist. It's hard to say.\n\nThanks to the players for the memories, if nothing else.",

      "review": "TLDR: Mordhau was one of the best melee combat games ever made.\r\nBut it died a slow, silent death, neglected by its creators and abandoned by everyone else.\r\n\r\n\r\nMordhau was - and in many ways still is - one of the finest multiplayer games I’ve ever played. Its melee combat system remains one of the most intricate and satisfying mechanics in gaming. It took what Chivalry built, refined it, and surpassed it in (almost) every conceivable way. When it launched, it felt \r\n[i]alive[/i].\r\n\r\nThe movement was fluid, the combat was sharp and responsive. Every swing, every parry, every feint carried weight. The maps were... alright..., and even the bots held their own reasonably well. Nothing meaningful was locked behind a grind or a paywall, only cosmetics, and even those felt fair for the most part. Servers developed their own small communities, each with its own culture and regulars. You’d recognize names, rivals, even friends. It was, for a time, something truly special.\r\n\r\nBut despite all of that, I can’t recommend Mordhau anymore. And there’s only one reason why:\r\n\r\n[b]If you’re a new player, you’re going to hate it. [/b] \r\n\r\nUpdates came few and far between, each one smaller and more disappointing than the last. Promises faded into silence, and the developers’ once-bright enthusiasm dimmed into neglect. The community began to crumble. And with no fresh content, no new players, and no reason to stay, people left.\r\n\r\nAlmost everyone who once populated the game has moved on, and what remains is a core of hardened veterans: players who have spent thousands of hours mastering every feint, chamber, riposte, and emote abuse. They know every weapon’s swing radius, mastered every animation trick, and got their timings precise to the millisecond. If you’re just starting out, you will be torn apart before you can even raise your sword.\r\n\r\nThere’s no learning curve. It's a learning mountain climb. You’ll have to endure hundreds of hours of brutal, demoralizing losses before you start to stand a chance.\r\n\r\nIt’s tragic, because Mordhau is not a bad game, in fact, it’s one of my all-time favorites. But without fresh blood, it’s a corpse animated by the ghosts of those who refused to move on.\r\n\r\nFor once, it’s fair to use the phrase:\r\nThis is a dead game.\r\n\r\nRest in peace, Mordhau.\r\nYou were brilliant, and you deserved better.",

The interplay of the various elements and mechanics is glorious, and it feels rewarding to master.\n\nBut you probably won't master them. I've been playing this game effectively since its release and I can tell you this: levels 0–100 are generally considered the learning curve just to grasp the basics. The Tutorial is hot garbage that doesn't teach you any of the true essentials, assuming a new player even plays it. There’s very little reason to do so beyond the gold bonus you receive for completion.\n\nIf you want to learn the basics, you need someone to teach you. Things like swing manipulation, accels, drags, chambers, or even ripostes are misunderstood by some players.\n\nDueling and team fighting require entirely different skill sets. Being good at one will not automatically make you good at the other.\n\nThe Devs don't know how to balance team skill either. They ought to take the average level of every player on the server and then try to create two teams with an approximate combination of skill. This is why only 26 people were on the server at a time when the game was free.\n\nPlayers have complained about \"team stacking for ages,\" but it's a myth. At the time of writing, team selection has been disabled. Teams get crushed more thoroughly now than they ever have before. This shows us that the issue wasn't that good players would join the same team to win games previously. Instead, simply using autoselect at the start without any true balancing mechanism would lead to this situation. Now, as a level 218 player, I can't even swap to the losing team to try and balance things myself.\n\nThe Devs don't play their own game. The Devs don't moderate their own community. They don't push content at anything close to a reasonable speed, and if something's broken, expect at least 6 months of sitting on the busted issue without seeing a resolution, or maybe only a partial fix at that.\n\nThey change things drastically from patch to patch, often nerfing non-issues simply because they themselves struggle with a mechanic or weapon. Crucially, they don't listen to feedback from the community. They make the same mistakes over and over, and they don't really learn from it.\n\nI love this game, but it's garbage on so many levels for new players.\n\nPS: I played on ps. I just checked how many people are still playing the free game. \n\nPlay chivlary instead",

People pretty much no lifed this game to the point where people developed tactics to trick the physics and movement to have an unfair advantage against not so experienced players. High ranking players feel themselves too much to the point where their whole steam page becomes their game personality. It's not rare that you have people in your game that have Sir or some other bs in their name. I spent my time training on so-called duel servers that's where you can truly improve and that's where I met the nice part of the community. I feel like the part of the community that stayed are mostly the toxic people that made the game their entire personalities and I think it's time for Mordhau to die out.

      "review": "It's the best in the genre, and one of my favorite games, so it's painful not to recommend this.\nHowever, it is the honest thing to do. My reasoning is below:\n\nUnfortunately the player count plateaued a long time ago and only seems to get smaller month over month. We've finally dropped below the 1,000 player count peak on PC, and console players maybe add a few hundred on top of that. Only those with an undying love for game are still playing, which means if you're new, you're going to have a hard time understanding why you're getting absolutely destroyed by anyone you run into purely due to mechanical depth that is not immediately apparent, and poorly taught via in-game sources.\n\nTriterion have more or less abandoned the game, with the last update being nearly a year ago, and that was a PvE horde mode about demons in a game people obviously picked up for PvP. It was odd to watch them have a potential strangle-hold on a genre only to lop off its' head and leave it festering in a dumpster with the occasional spritzing of Febreze to keep the smell at bay. Also, to be clear, Chivalry 2 was never a threat to that.\n\nI believe they also started work on an unannounced new IP some time ago, so it's unlikely they'll return to drop new [PvP] maps, weapons, or a balancing update barring a 10th anniversary. I'm not going to include the questionable cosmetics they've released in an attempt to further fund whatever they're up to now. I hope it's good, but after witnessing the development cycle of this game, I wouldn't go out of my way to pre-order it.\n\nIt's only fair you know what you're getting into if you are going to pick this up on sale for $5-$10 USD, otherwise I wouldn't have bothered leaving this review. I'll still be playing, but I'm a masochist, or a sadist. It's hard to say.\n\nThanks to the players for the memories, if nothing else.",

      "review": "TLDR: Mordhau was one of the best melee combat games ever made.\r\nBut it died a slow, silent death, neglected by its creators and abandoned by everyone else.\r\n\r\n\r\nMordhau was - and in many ways still is - one of the finest multiplayer games I’ve ever played. Its melee combat system remains one of the most intricate and satisfying mechanics in gaming. It took what Chivalry built, refined it, and surpassed it in (almost) every conceivable way. When it launched, it felt \r\n[i]alive[/i].\r\n\r\nThe movement was fluid, the combat was sharp and responsive. Every swing, every parry, every feint carried weight. The maps were... alright..., and even the bots held their own reasonably well. Nothing meaningful was locked behind a grind or a paywall, only cosmetics, and even those felt fair for the most part. Servers developed their own small communities, each with its own culture and regulars. You’d recognize names, rivals, even friends. It was, for a time, something truly special.\r\n\r\nBut despite all of that, I can’t recommend Mordhau anymore. And there’s only one reason why:\r\n\r\n[b]If you’re a new player, you’re going to hate it. [/b] \r\n\r\nUpdates came few and far between, each one smaller and more disappointing than the last. Promises faded into silence, and the developers’ once-bright enthusiasm dimmed into neglect. The community began to crumble. And with no fresh content, no new players, and no reason to stay, people left.\r\n\r\nAlmost everyone who once populated the game has moved on, and what remains is a core of hardened veterans: players who have spent thousands of hours mastering every feint, chamber, riposte, and emote abuse. They know every weapon’s swing radius, mastered every animation trick, and got their timings precise to the millisecond. If you’re just starting out, you will be torn apart before you can even raise your sword.\r\n\r\nThere’s no learning curve. It's a learning mountain climb. You’ll have to endure hundreds of hours of brutal, demoralizing losses before you start to stand a chance.\r\n\r\nIt’s tragic, because Mordhau is not a bad game, in fact, it’s one of my all-time favorites. But without fresh blood, it’s a corpse animated by the ghosts of those who refused to move on.\r\n\r\nFor once, it’s fair to use the phrase:\r\nThis is a dead game.\r\n\r\nRest in peace, Mordhau.\r\nYou were brilliant, and you deserved better.",

Some might say this game isnt dead but i beg to differ some people depending on  their location can hardly find full servers and have to wait for certain times of the day to find frontline lobbies. No new player wants to invest time into a game that barly manages to scrape by with 1k players let alone learn the fundamentals thats required in order to be a valid competitor. If devs capitalized on mordhaus twitch era and further advertised, listened ,and updated the game while it was at its high this game could have more than likely retained a large amount of players but alas devs smoked crack on their high horses while the playerbase dwindled. \n\n10/10 would smoke from my pipe again",

There are a lot of weapons to choose. nice maps, funny voice lines from different characters, beautiful character customization and cool players on community servers. The game has a few bugs, but i think that´s just part of the battlefield experience.\nBUT ...\n-this game is so frustrating... The skill gap between new players and veterans is HUGE ! You have to put hundreds of hours in this game to get good. \n-The servers are nearly dead, you will often play against the same lvl 200 that will kick your ass. \n-Packet loss is a part of the game that you should get used to.\n- The game is almost never updated.\n- There are like 2 groups that you will meet in Mordhau: The funny troll people who don't take the game too seriously and the toxic tryhards who just insult you in the global chat.\n\n\nIf the points mentioned above don't bother you, I'd recommend buying the game on sale. \nOverall it is a fun little game. All you need is A LOT OF TIME to improve.\n\nIf you ignore the negative aspects, you'll have a lot of fun with it. Otherwise, you don´t",
