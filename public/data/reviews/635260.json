I don't mind sporting 5 or 6 different GTR skyline models. \n\nThe weak points of the game are lack of verity of maps, and the music is nothing great at all. Its not like annoying or anything, but it's definitely not appealing in anyway. \n\nBut overall I do really enjoy the t is game and will still be putting time into it to at least get all the single player achievements.

This title is a nostalgic part of a franchise I’ve loved for years, but after buying it, I realized the greedy developers didn’t spare even the smallest and most basic items. They turned almost every little thing in the game into paid DLC!\nI hope you wake up and put an end to this blatant greed, because as things stand, I will never be willing to purchase any new installments of this game again.",

Only 30 or so cars.\n3. Tracks are not that good but you can add more through workshop and mods.\n\nBonus: Cant seem to join any multiplayer server so this makes me not recomend it. \n\n15$ is a good price for it, and is pretty accurate representation of what you get. Its not great its not awful.",
