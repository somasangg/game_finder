      "review": "My Review of Gwent\n\nWhen I sit down with Gwent, it doesn’t feel like a game meant to pass time or bait quick dopamine hits—it feels like stepping into a world that understands where I’m at in life. The Witcher universe has always carried weight, but Gwent translates that maturity into something more than flavor. The card art alone tells stories of hardship, struggle, and consequence. It’s not childish spectacle; it’s grit and realism wrapped in folklore, politics, and war.\n\nWhat sets Gwent apart for me isn’t just the atmosphere, but the way it rewards patience, calculation, and composure. It doesn’t beg me to play flashy for the sake of it; it demands foresight, resource management, and the ability to read not just my hand, but my opponent’s mind. This resonates with my own approach to competition: I don’t play games to stumble into victories, I play to dissect, outthink, and sharpen myself through the process.\n\nUnlike games that thrive on chaos or gimmicks, Gwent makes me feel like my victories carry meaning. Every round I win comes from strategy, timing, and restraint. Even in defeat, there’s value, because I can trace back exactly what I misread, what I wasted, or what I should have held onto longer. That kind of clarity isn’t common in games—and I appreciate it because it mirrors how I live: owning my mistakes, learning, and using them to rise stronger.\n\nIn short, Gwent doesn’t try to be for everyone, and that’s why it works for me. It’s a mature card game built for players who think deeply, who want to win with their mind rather than noise. It feels like a conversation with people closer to my age, not a playground of kids chasing thrills. And that makes every match, win or lose, feel like time well spent.",

      "review": "[h2]Let me just start by saying that it's such a shame that, should you choose to spend no money on the game, you are still matched up with players who buy their way into a winning position.[/h2]\n\nMore often than not, my opponents either have way more hours under their belt (fair enough, I joined late - I have no issue with this) or they’ve bought their way into a completely stacked deck. And honestly? That’s fine. If someone wants to drop half their rent to lose to someone with a starter deck, I’m not going to stop them. To be fair, I [b]do[/b] get why the matchmaking works this way - it keeps queues fast and the player pool healthy. And yes, every card can technically be earned through play - it’ll just take a lot of hours and patience to get there. At the end of the day, it’s still not as fair a system as it could be, and whales do have a clear edge early on.\n\nAside from the unfair matchmaking in the previous regard, when I [b]am[/b] playing against people my own level or economic situation, it is an incredibly fun experience. It certainly feels rewarding to overcome your opponent with a supreme strategy, which are, most of the time, dynamically changing as the game goes on. This keeps me on the edge of my seat and has me constantly thinking ahead as to what the opponent might do and how I might react - it's great!\n\nOn another note, the graphics & animations are very pleasing, the variety of cards is impressive, and despite my earlier complaint about people essentially paying to win, you do indeed get a great amount of content and opportunities to build a formidable deck without spending any money. To date, I have won most of my games, and again, that's without spending a cent. Also, there is a draft game-mode where you and your opponent both build a deck from scratch by choosing from randomly presented card packages - which is a neat break in between things.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to anyone who falls into the following groups:\n- You enjoyed playing Gwent in The Witcher 3\n- You're a fan of strategy OR tabletop games and like to flex your strategic superiority\n- You have some money to burn and enjoy having the upper hand on lower level players as a result\n- Are a fan of The Witcher in general\n\nSo yeah, ultimately, it’s a very fun game - especially when a whale drops a small fortune on cards and still gets wiped by someone who spent $0. [i]At this point, they’re basically just paying to boost my ego, so who am I to complain?[/i]",

I then forgot about the game and didnt play it for quite sometime, I played again around the Ciri Journey right before the Witchers set. My favorite decks were Devo Symbiosis, Thrive Monsters, Point Slam Monsters, Firesworn Swarm, and Northern Realm Siege Engines and sometimes Reavers. I had a great time with the game back then and got to Rank 2 on the ladder, I never hit Pro Ladder because at the time it felt like Nilfgard was incredibly oppresive to me. I stopped playing again for quite some time.\n\nRecently I tried playing again and after giving the game some time to relearn the cards and the meta, I can tell you the game fucking SUUUCKS now. It feels terrible. The player councils have nerfed anything that remotely feels fun. The game feels VERY reactive now, and decks with high complexity are pushed way further than simple fun decks. The game feels oppresive to new players and is VERY unforgiving and overall just not worth playing. \n\nThe player council balance factions are adverserial against each other and will frequnetly just tit for tat nerf/buff decks that they prefer. It feels awful. If you are a new player stay away, while the game is built to be rewarding, it is also very punishing and unfriendly in the sense that you will be made to feel like a loser for not having any powerful decks, you will repeatedly be farmed by better players for A LOOOOONG time before you get anywhere.  \n\nIf you are a returning player, you should stay away, long gone are the days of playing big splashy cards that feel fun to put on the board, and instead the game has been replaced with what essentially feels like two blue players in MTG playing counterspells against each other for 3 rounds. Instead of trying to buff all the bad cards to be more powerful and fun, the game has pretty much nerfed all of what used to be good impactful cards, and buffed meaningless reactionary cards so that the game tilts way into rewarding reactive players just for being reactive and punishing proactive for daring to do anything. \n\nStay away and dont waste your money and time. The game feels awful now, its frustrating that I cant ever go home again to when I was playing the game, but it is what it is. DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL.\n\nAdditionally the game interface has several display bugs now that used to not be present, and will not update even after you complete quests, which can feel infuriating. The quests for the seasons feel unfairly difficult to complete for the amount of rewards you get.  \n\nThe community on reddit is borderline toxic, with a lot of player refusing to see the other side of the argument and are just paritsan and unhelpful. They want to turn Gwent from something which was fun for a majority of players to a game that is focused on just appealing to the top 10% of ladder and players and thats it. They could care less about anyone else, to them that's balance and fun. If you dare to complain they just say you can't understand their grand vision.\n\nDon't expect any meaningful changes or updates to the meta, it will continue to degrade until its just the most boring/meaningless cards in the world being buffed while anything that could even remotely fun or powerful continues to get nerfed.\n\nGwent?
