      "review": "Battle royale game where you land on a large map, gather weapons and equipment, and fight enemies to be the last one standing. The game combines elements of tactical shooter, survival, and strategy, forcing you to make quick decisions under the pressure of a shrinking zone\n\nI dont have many hours in this game because I primarily play single-player games and rarely play it, but I recommend playing it with friends\n\n✅A wide variety of weapons (shotguns, pistols, machine guns, sniper rifles, as well as explosive grenades, flashlights, and smoke grenades)\n✅Varied equipment - vests, helmets (which have different levels from level 1 to level 3), first aid kits, scopes, and many other items\n✅Free to play\n✅Very large, beautiful maps\n✅The game can be played with up to 4 players\n✅Good optimization\n✅Good sound\n✅Several game modes (Classic, Arcade, Custom, Training)\n✅Minimal bugs\n✅After finishing the game, you can check your statistics\n✅Good graphics\n✅Frequent updates by the game developers\n✅Vehicles that often save your life from enemies and the zone\n✅If you kill an enemy, you can take their equipment and the skins they use\n✅In Classic mode, if you play with 2 or 4 players and If we die, our ally can revive us if they have the right items in the right place\n✅If we fall to the ground but aren't killed, our ally can revive us and save our lives\n✅We can buy skins for Battle Points (the in-game currency)\n\n❌As with any multiplayer game, unfortunately, there are active cheaters\n❌The game pace is too slow for me\n❌A very large map, and 100 players for such a large map is too few (150 players is the minimum, or smaller maps. There were times when after 5 minutes, only 50 enemies remained, and nothing happened for most of the game)\n\n✅✅ Verdict: [strike] Very Bad [/strike], [strike] Bad [/strike], [strike] Average [/strike], [strike] Decent [/strike], [strike] Good [/strike], [b] Very good [/b], [strike] Excellent [/strike], [strike] Masterpiece [/strike]\n\nIf you have any questions about my reviews, feel free to ask. I'm happy to answer them. All reviews are my own!! Best regards, King Viking Bezimienny, Polish Game Reviewer.",

On the other hand, if you play Solos mode, it's pretty chill since there are plenty of bots to shoot.\r\n\r\nCommunication is key, but it's tough since you often match with international players. So, if you want a relaxing game, stick to Solos or play with friends ONLY!! Playing with randoms gives me a massive headache.\r\n\r\nOverall 7/10. Lots of things still need fixing: bugs, hackers, and macro users. Events are rare and mostly feel like cash grabs. Still, it's not a bad game. Enjoy!\"",

Every match is a mix of sneaky strategy, heart pounding firefights, and moments that make you scream at your screen. Then, if luck (and skill) are on your side, you survive the final circle and feel like a god. Repeat.\n\nThe maps are huge, gunplay is satisfying, and every match tells its own story.\nYes, RNG can be cruel. Yes, getting sniped from across the map will make you rage.\n\nBut the highs are incredible that “winner winner” moment is unmatched in gaming.\n\nRecommended for anyone who thrives on tension, strategy, and survival chaos",

It's a 100-person therapy session where the couch is a military-grade jeep and the therapist is a stranger named xX_Shotgun_Sniper_Xx who just ended your 20-minute looting spree with a well-aimed pan.\n\nI have a love-hate relationship with PUBG, and by \"hate\" I mean the kind of pure, unadulterated rage that makes me immediately queue up for another match. This game is a beautiful, janky, heart-pounding masterpiece of chaos.\n\nThe PUBG Experience, in Three Acts:\n\nAct I: The Serene Looterella.\nYou drop onto the island. The sun is shining. Birds are... probably dead, let's be real. But for you, it's a peaceful shopping spree. You're in a secluded compound, humming to yourself as you pick up a nice backpack, a solid vest, and enough energy drinks to power a small festival. You feel like a post-apocalyptic Marie Kondo, organizing your inventory until everything sparks joy. \"This sparkly helmet brings me joy. This extended quickdraw mag? Immense joy.\" This is the calm, the zen, the beautiful lie.\n\nAct II: The Sudden, Deafening Symphony of \"WHAT WAS THAT?!\"\nA sound. A single, distant crack. Your heart instantly becomes a drum solo. You are no longer a person; you are a pair of eyeballs glued to a screen, sweating pure adrenaline. You crawl through a field, believing yourself to be a shadow, a ghost, one with the grass. In reality, you are a very obvious man in a bright yellow shirt commando-crawling through a meadow. Someone from 500 meters away, using a scope you didn't even know existed, politely informs you of this fact. Your screen goes black. The panic was real. The failure is absolute.\n\nAct III: The Unlikely Hero (or the Glorious Pan-ic).\nBut sometimes... sometimes you are the one who gets the drop. You stumble into a house, and a guy is there, looting a body. You both freeze. In a shared moment of pure, unscripted comedy, you both empty your entire magazines into the wall next to each other. In the ensuing panic, you switch to your trusty frying pan and, with a triumphant BONK, you emerge victorious. You didn't win the match, but you won that moment. And you will tell the story of \"The Pan of Destiny\" for weeks.\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nPUBG is janky. The cars sometimes have a personal grudge against physics. You will get stuck on a tiny pebble. You will be killed by the dreaded \"Blue Zone of I Forgot to Pay Attention.\"\n\nBut you know what? I wouldn't have it any other way. It's this beautiful, unpolished chaos that creates the most unforgettable gaming stories. It's the game where a cross-country road trip with three randoms in a UAZ turns into a lifelong (in-game) friendship, only for it all to end in a fiery explosion because Steve saw an airdrop and \"just had to go for it.\"\n\nIt's tense, it's ridiculous, and that moment when you're in the final top 10, heart pounding in your ears, is a feeling few other games can replicate.\n\nFinal Score: 99/100. (Docked one point for that time I punched a fence for a solid minute instead of vaulting it.)\n\nSee you on the battlegrounds. Try not to shoot me. Unless you have a pan. Then all bets are off.",

It had its own charm, tension, realistic gunplay, and that unique excitement every match brought. It was safe, stable, and enjoyable to play – especially when you knew every opponent was there because of skill, not because of cheating.\n\nUnfortunately, things have changed.\n\nIn the last several seasons, the game has been taken over by cheaters. No matter the rank, map, or time of day – every other encounter feels unfair. Fair play has become a rarity, and fighting against cheaters is nearly impossible. The anti-cheat exists only on paper, while in reality regular, honest players are punished for trying to play the game properly.\n\nThe saddest part is that normal, long-time, loyal PUBG players are slowly leaving the game, not because they stopped loving it, but because it simply makes no sense anymore. It’s hard to enjoy a game where your effort and skill can be erased by someone using software the system can’t stop.\n\nPUBG used to be a legend. Today, unfortunately, it feels like a battlefield without rules.\n\nI truly hope things will improve, but until something changes drastically, it’s hard to recommend this game to anyone looking for fair and stable gameplay.",

Every match feels different, and the combination of realistic gunplay, strategic movement, and high-pressure decision-making creates an experience that never gets old.\n\nThe sound design is fantastic—footsteps, gunshots, and vehicles all play a huge role in building tension. The maps are beautifully crafted, each offering unique terrain and playstyles. Whether you prefer long-range engagements in Erangel or chaotic close-quarters combat in Sanhok, there’s always something fresh to enjoy.\n\nWhat I love most is the sense of accomplishment. Winning a match isn’t easy, but when that “Winner Winner Chicken Dinner” finally pops up, it feels incredibly satisfying.\n\nThe developers continue to update the game with new content, balance patches, and quality-of-life improvements, showing real dedication to the community.\n\nIf you enjoy tactical gameplay, teamwork, and heart-pounding moments, PUBG is absolutely worth playing.\n\nHighly recommended!",

So many good guns like M249, Beryl, AKM etc. Definetly useful to buy new pc for pubg, cuz all games but especially pubg looking so much better u enjoy to the fullest the game with new pc.",

      "review": "PUBG is one of those games you keep coming back to even after long breaks — it has a unique mix of chaos and strategy that’s hard to find elsewhere. Every match feels different: sometimes you land in a quiet spot and spend minutes listening to every little sound, and other times you’re thrown straight into a fight over a three-building compound. The “survive for that top-1” atmosphere still works incredibly well, especially when the circle shrinks and every movement feels risky.\n\nI really like that the maps differ not just visually but in how they shape the gameplay. Some reward stealth in tall grass, others push you into constant motion, and some favor tight, building-to-building fights. The sound design is excellent too — you can clearly tell where shots are coming from or who’s creeping nearby. Once you start understanding footstep distance and direction, catching opponents off-guard becomes especially satisfying.\n\nWeapons all feel distinct, and the variety lets you experiment match after match. Squad play is another strong point — with good communication, games become much more intense and fun.\n\nIf there’s a downside, it’s that optimization can still be inconsistent — occasional frame drops at the worst possible moments do happen. Not game-breaking, but a bit more stability would be welcome.\n\nOverall, PUBG remains that rare battle royale where the tension builds from the first seconds to the final firefight. It’s a game you return to for the emotions few others can recreate.",

It gets even worse when players of different nationalities are involved, causing a language barrier. Also, your matchmaking system isn't that good. You should ban players who intentionally kill their teammates. On top of that, you face full squad opponents with max-level tiers.

I've lost so many rounds to a blatant hacker and whilst you can submit a report, they rarely take action quick enough.\n\nCouple that with the limit of 3 'casual' games a day (WHY on EARTH would you ever impose a LIMIT on casual play for the casual playerbase?) you're inevitably going to be thrown in with the groups you'd rather avoid if you play for anything more than about an hour a day.\n\nThen because it's a free to play experience, it's easy to just create multiple steam accounts so you can play more casual games.  It's just bad game design at that point and a complete waste of people's time.\n\nLastly, the free to play aspect means the game is loaded with so much clutter, special coins and fortnite style skins it's just embarrassing a lot of the time to see how silly it looks in game.  I get it, they need to make $$ somehow and there's always a crowd of 'those types' who will flock to silly skins, dances and cosmetics - but it's heavy distraction from what the game is at it's core (a quality FPS experience).\n\nI wish there were more first person only servers to play on, it's fairly typical everyone wants to play 3rd person to peek those corners, but I think it lowers the skill cap overall to play that way - just my personal preference.\n\nEnd of the day it's still a good game as far as free to play experiences go, but there's just too many cheap distractions and annoyances for this gamer to want to spend my time on a tailored experience like this when I have so many other higher quality FPS experiences in my Steam Library that I pay a premium for.\n\nIf 'free to play' is all your gaming budget can manage then sure, I'd recommend PUBG as a decent game for what it is and you'll have a pretty good time with it (especially playing with friends and keeping a casual attitude to the experience).\n\nBut even if you can afford an old Battlefield game on a Steam sale for a few bucks, I'd still say it's more worth your time over fighting the pitfalls of a free to play game like PUBG.\n\nThis is just not a game for me sadly, but I can appreciate people do enjoy it.  I definitely loved it 'back in the day' when it was a fully paid game on Xbox and have very fond memories of the experience - but now it's free to play on PC I think it's lost a lot of it's appeal and I would rather play different games.\n\nYour milage may vary and for some, this will be their 'favourite game of all time' - but this one is just not for me sadly.",
