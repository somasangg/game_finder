If you like difficult games and don't mind sinking a lot of hours in, reading the wiki or watching Youtube tutorials, then this is the game for you. You can get it on sale for super cheap and I've played this game along with the together version and will continue to do so.\n\nThe problem is that the game doesn't tell you how to do anything. Don't get me wrong, it's fun to figure stuff out on your own. But how am I supposed to know that giving meat to a bird in a bird cage enables me to make amazing new food or that bunnymen will attack you just because of you holding meat items, causing me to die 15+ hours into my run. I know dying, learning from your mistakes and starting over is the whole point of the game, but it can get frustrating and repetitive.\n\nAlso certain parts of the game like the adventure/story mode are poorly designed in my opinion. It's running around searching for random items on your map for 4 levels, just for you to die on level 5 because you didn't know the final level was in total darkness.\n\nReading the wiki, watching Youtube tutorial and using mods like display food values, geometric placement, craft pot and minimap feel like necessities for me to enjoy this game.",

The atmosphere is incredible, the survival loop is addictive, and the game still holds up after all these years. Combat is the weakest part, but everything else pulled me in. For the price, it’s absolutely worth it.\n\nThe Good:\n• Amazing Tim Burton-style art and quirky tone\n• Strong survival loop with great early-game pacing\n• Realistic mechanics that actually matter (fire spreading, sanity, sleep)\n• Weather, darkness, and nightfall create genuine tension\n• Lots to discover and experiment with\n• Time flies, easy to get absorbed\n\nThe Not-So-Good:\n• Combat feels basic and predictable\n• Early sanity confusion until you understand the system\n• Building in a 2.5D space can feel a little awkward\n• Requires trial-and-error before things start to really click\n\nFinal Verdict: 7.5/10\n\nOne of the better survival games out there if you like creepy whimsy and grounded mechanics. Combat needs work, but the atmosphere and loop are excellent.\n\nMy Recommendation:\nAt full price ($11.49 CAD), it’s easily worth it.\nOn sale? Even better.\nIf you like crafting survival games with a creepy twist, you should try it.",

      "review": "I’ve spent some time with this game and honestly, it surprised me in a way I didn’t fully expect. I don’t want to sound dramatic, but there’s something oddly satisfying about how everything fits together — not in some perfect, polished “advertisement” way, but more like a game that knows exactly what it wants to be and just… goes for it.\n\nThe first thing I noticed is the atmosphere. Every part of the game — the visuals, the sound, the pacing — kind of blends into this feeling that you’re actually inside its world, even if you’re just casually playing. I know that sounds a bit cliché, but it’s true. Sometimes it’s chaotic, sometimes slow, sometimes you’re just wandering around thinking “ok, what now?” but that’s honestly part of the charm. The game doesn’t try to rush you unless it actually needs to.\n\nGameplay-wise, it has this mix of familiar elements and small twists that keep things from feeling stale. Nothing groundbreaking, maybe, but it all works together in a way that feels natural. There were moments when I thought “yeah, I’ve seen this in other games,” but then the game throws in tiny details or unexpected interactions that make it stand out just enough. It’s the kind of thing you only notice after a few hours, when you start connecting the dots.\n\nPerformance has been mostly fine. A little rough spot here and there, but honestly, show me a game these days that doesn’t have something weird happening once in a while. Nothing game-breaking on my end, at least. You can clearly tell the developers put effort into this, even if a few edges are still a bit sharp. Again — part of the charm.\n\nWhat I really appreciate is that the game gives you space to play the way you want. Some people will rush through every objective, others will take their time exploring or messing around, and both approaches actually feel valid. I like games that don’t punish you for not following some “correct” path.\n\nOverall, I’d say this is one of those titles that grows on you the longer you play. It doesn’t try too hard to impress in the first five minutes — instead it slowly builds its identity, layer by layer, until you suddenly realize you’ve been playing way longer than you planned. If you’re looking for something that balances comfort with challenge, familiar mechanics with fresh touches, and a world that’s just fun to be in, then I genuinely think this one is worth giving a shot.\n\nWould I recommend it?\nYeah, I would — maybe not to everyone, because no game is for everyone, but definitely to anyone who likes getting lost in a game for a bit and discovering things at their own pace.",

      "review": "Don't Starve is one of the grown up survival games that has it place in my heart since the very beginning more then ten years ago.\n\nYou can choose between several characters that have their individual advantages and disadvantages while playing the game. The main goal is to reach Maxwell's Door and go through the story.\nOr just survive as long as you can and fight the different Giants that might appear in the seasons the game has.\n\nI most played offline, so the hours I spent are much more than shown in steam (I would say about 500hrs?). \nThe game is still unique and very special. I like it most, because it is not mainstream and has its own style and feeling.\nNothing is explained and the player needs to figure out everything by themselves.\n\nInteresting to mention is, that you can create your own rules for the world that is created and define what you want to have appeared less or more like certain giants or certain resources.\n\nThere are some basic mechanics the game has, which the player needs to understand:\n\nHunger - your character needs to eat from time to time\n\nSanity - you need to do something for the brain of your character to get not insane, otherwise the shadow hands and shadow creatures will appear that attack the character\n\nHealth - the environment, the creatures, some consumable and too hot or too cold circumstances can heart the character\n\nLight - the light is the protection against the shadow creatures and the player needs to stay in light to prevent beeing attacked by them and losing sanity\n\nTemperature - not visible directly, but it can be too hot or too cold and the player needs to do something to protect against heat and cold by wearing certain clothes or hats or by staying near a fire\n\nCrafting - one base mechanic is to craft things and structures out of the resources (not all are renewable) one found in the environment\n\nResearch - you can upgrade your gear and your base buildings by finding the right resources for it and you will need to to survive over time\n\nThe fun part is the challenge the game offers to the player. You have a lot of stress the first runs to survive the harsh environment and to understand the game mechanics.\nAfter meeting the first giants you will get a more deep understanding, what survival means, when the burning sun in summer or the shadow creatures that appear when you lost sanity in spring because the frequent rain depleted your sanity didn't kill you until then.\n\nAnd this is only tip of the iceberg.\nThere is Adventure Mode in the Story Mode which gives you different gameplay compared to the bare survival\nThere are different Giants that appear in different seasons\nThere are the caves you can jump in\nThere are the add-ons that give almost a completely different gameplay:\n - Shipwrecked with islands to hop over\n - Hamlet with Pig Villages\n - Reign Of Giants with a lot of extra resources and stuff to encounter\nAnd much more\n\nIf you like unique survival games with well balanced game mechanics and crafting, you might like this game and I recommend it to you.\nIf you do not want to learn a lot and you really don't like to start over and over again at the beginning, you might avoid this game.\n\nAt the end, Klei Entertainment made it to stay to their uniqe style of games and this counts a lot nowadays in my humble opinion.",

The thing I truly respect about this game is that instead of making itself accessible to appeal to as many people as possible, it decided to stick to its own identity in spite of pandering to a mainstream audience.\n\nSomething you should take note is that this game WILL kick your butt on your first few runs, and you will constantly be on edge as you'll never truly feel safe at any given moment. The game was intentionally designed to be vague and let players figure out how things are done for themselves. (For the most part, anyway.) Though this can either be a good or a bad thing depending on who you ask. Myself, I'd say I'm somewhere down the middle. While I appreciate the game not shoving tutorials in my face, it can lead to some parts being confusing and you're always second guessing whether you're doing something right or not. If you truly want to optimize everything you do, a wiki is practically a requirement.\n\nStill, I admire the balls Klei had when they stuck to their guns and designed the game they way they did even if it might drive certain players away. That's not something you usually see from a lot of games nowadays. Sacrificing universal appeal for the sake of keeping the game cohesive.\n\nIf you haven't already, pick this game up. The lack of direction at the start my be daunting for newcomers, but once you get the hang of how the game works, it's satisfying as hell.",

Quite chaotic if you have ADHD like me, you'll forget you need any light source at night, will probably lose track of time trying to hunt a butterfly for food, and you will probably start a fight with something you shouldn't have. 10/10 experience \r\n\r\nJokes aside, I really enjoy this game probably more than the Don't Starve Together one (no friends to play with). It's got amazing art, very interesting mechanics, lovely music you can vibe to, and hours of content that I promise you won't get tired of (seen people with more than 1k hours on this game)",

      "review": "First, let me preface that my playthrough was without any of the DLC. I do own all of the DLC for this game, but I decided since it was my first time giving the single-player version a proper shot, I'd play it vanilla. No Hamlet, no Shipwrecked, not even Reign of Giants. Despite that though, I still had a very fun time with the game! I love the sketchy Burton-esque art style and the way the world is set up both on a technical and thematic level, with the use of 2D sprites and rigs not only giving the game a unique look, but an opportunity to sell the world as a stage-play, which I think it does very well.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Don't Starve is very unforgiving. That's the point. The game will rarely, if ever, have something that has no downside. Almost everything has a cost attached to it and if you're not adequately prepared beforehand, the game will punish you. Sitting in the dark? It hurts you! Hoarding food? It'll spoil and become inedible. Made your base around the pigs for protection from enemies? They'll turn into \"warepigs\" during full moons and start attacking you. This style of gameplay is a very acquired taste and it's understandable if it's not your thing. This uncompromising style of gameplay makes Don't Starve a much more intense survival game than something like Minecraft, since things can and will go wrong at any time.\n\nSurviving for long periods of time before death or regenerating your world will level you up and unlock additional characters. These characters have their own quirks that make them separate from the default character, Wilson. Willow, for example, has a lighter and is completely immune to fire damage. Webber is friendly with the spiders, but the pigs will attack him. Wendy has her twin sister, Abigail, who is a ghost. The game has this hostile world mixed with a twisted sense of humour and I love it for that, it adds a lot of personality to the game beyond it just being hard.\n\nLastly, I'd like to discuss Adventure Mode. Don't Starve has a story you can complete, but unlike modern survival games that integrate their story into the world, the story in DS is kept separate and doesn't interact with regular survival in any way. In Adventure Mode, you must complete 5 levels of increasing difficulty, culminating in the final level with permanent darkness. If you do make it through all of these levels, you'll come face to face with the supposed villain, Maxwell, and free him from his prison, ending adventure mode and the plot of Don't Starve. I don't enjoy Adventure Mode much. It culminates into running around looking for the pieces to continue onto the next level, over and over again. It gets boring quick. I think how modern survival games approach plot is much, much better.\n\nOverall, very fun game, if a bit lacking in a few areas, but the DLC and sequel fix those issues, so I can't complain too much.",

If you like difficult games and don't mind sinking a lot of hours in, reading the wiki or watching Youtube tutorials, then this is the game for you. You can get it on sale for super cheap and I've played this game along with the together version and will continue to do so.\n\nThe problem is that the game doesn't tell you how to do anything. Don't get me wrong, it's fun to figure stuff out on your own. But how am I supposed to know that giving meat to a bird in a bird cage enables me to make amazing new food or that bunnymen will attack you just because of you holding meat items, causing me to die 15+ hours into my run. I know dying, learning from your mistakes and starting over is the whole point of the game, but it can get frustrating and repetitive.\n\nAlso certain parts of the game like the adventure/story mode are poorly designed in my opinion. It's running around searching for random items on your map for 4 levels, just for you to die on level 5 because you didn't know the final level was in total darkness.\n\nReading the wiki, watching Youtube tutorial and using mods like display food values, geometric placement, craft pot and minimap feel like necessities for me to enjoy this game.",

And learning that you need to capture and then plant butterflies to grow flowers, well, that is what this game is really all about. The satisfaction one gets from mastering a very very deep set of arbitrary rules. One downside is it can be hard to learn, as the things that will kill you are infrequent and require you to start over and repeat the grindy stuff again and again.
