Although the game is simple at its core, the resource management side of the game, alongside the long collection grind makes it more than the childish game. As someone who refuses to move on from a game before doing everything (achievements, decorating, all additional content), this game has not felt like a chore whatsoever as it requires minimal playtime (when you have done the basic tasks you can simply log off).\r\n\r\nI would not recommend spending any money in game, as it is simply more fun to manage your resources, only having to log in occasionally (so you shouldn't burn out/overplay the game). Even if you do spend money, I would still strongly recommend limiting yourself to the cheaper seasonal deals, as the currency you buy definitely isn't worth what you spend for it.\r\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend this game if you're looking for a low-commitment game to play here and there (despite being an unusual choice). \r\n\r\nHave fun!",

I will say there's a lot of waiting around for monsters to breed and hatch, and buying monsters with gems would takes weeks if not more to be able to do. The mines only give you 1 diamond a day, and otherwise the only other way you can make sure you get diamonds is by spending real money. A good bit of monsters require diamonds, and a lot of diamonds for how few you can get. That's really the only thing I dislike, it's still a good game though",

      "review": "I think I like this game? I've made different tools to keep track of whatever I'm doing, currently making a cheat sheet for breeding times and best combos for all the monsters in the game [on hold]. I really enjoy just listening to (most of) the songs/islands. You probably could play a maximum of a second of any song and I would be able to name the island without fail, along with singing/humming the remainder. :D\n\nWhenever a new Island gets released (which is surprisingly often, at least this year) I at first am unsure about whether I like it or not. The new gameplay mechanics feel confusing and annoyingly rng based at first (and still do), but since every new monster gives a completely new layer to the songs I am encouraged to keep at it. Though sometimes it literally takes months to get that single last one remaining.\n\nI truly hate the way epics and rares are time sensitive things[spoiler], but with the addition of the mirror Paironormal Island giving wildcards, grinding for rare / epic Wubboxes ect. box monsters can now be more painlessly (than spending diamonds) skipped past by just waiting. [/spoiler]\n\nIf you plan on trying this game out, and come to \"love\" it like I have, be prepared to spend some money for QOL features. I recommend buying whatever the cheapest item in the store is, during some sort of deal (like double the diamonds than \"regular\", or for cheaper). For me, it happened to be like 2-3€, but I have not seen those deals in like a year++ so the cheapest will most likely be roughly 5€. I would not be still playing this game without the collect all and retry breeding/baking buttons.",

Over the years, its world has remained just as magical and immersive as the first time I experienced it. The gameplay feels nostalgic yet surprisingly timeless, proving how well it was designed. Even now, I can remember the excitement I felt learning its mechanics and uncovering its secrets for the first time. The characters and story have grown with me, leaving a lasting emotional impact. Every time I revisit it, I’m hit with a wave of memories that make the experience even richer. The soundtrack, especially, brings back the sense of wonder I had as a child. Despite all the new games I’ve played, few have matched the charm and creativity of this classic. It’s one of those rare titles that feels better each time I return to it.

There are many an advertisement/pop-up. However, you can just sit and vibe to some music. You can play for free and get everything enjoyable about the game. You can do a tribal island with friends, hand selecting which creatures to put on the island. Oh, that reminds me that the islands have specific monsters available to them. Which means you get variety on the songs and music that you explore with time. This is not a 2hr game. This is a 10 minutes a day thing that you come back to every once in a while.

Собирайте милых (и не очень) монстров, каждый из которых приносит свой уникальный звук в общую композицию. Игра затягивает постепенно: от выращивания первого Нога до создания целого оркестра на острове полной гармонии.\n\nНравится, что есть множество островов для открытия, каждый со своей атмосферой и набором монстров. Процесс скрещивания и выведения новых существ – это всегда приятное ожидание и сюрприз.\n\nНесмотря на кажущуюся простоту, игра предлагает достаточно глубины. Нужно грамотно управлять ресурсами, оптимизировать расстановку монстров для повышения дохода и постоянно следить за их уровнем счастья.\n\nЕдинственный минус – это необходимость терпения. Продвижение может замедляться, особенно если не тратить реальные деньги, но в этом и есть часть очарования игры. Наблюдать, как твой остров постепенно оживает и наполняется музыкой – бесценно.

It was a fun yet novel distraction that was really unique for the time, being a sort of gacha game where you gather and breed monsters that sing or offer more to the island's music.\n\nThanks to it's mobile nature, it's something you can pop in for about five or ten minutes to see how your progress is going, with lots of monsters and activities to do if your willing to check out everything. Since it's release, there's PLENTY to discover and grow, so you could be here for weeks or months on end! \n\nHowever, like most of these mobile games, there will be an insane amount of grinding, waiting, and premium currency shortage that will wall you hard, thankfully it is manageable with the amount of updates they've added, but it will always be a tough sell for those who are turned off by this stuff.\n\nIt's simple, but it's extremely charming in it's presentation, growing your islands to hear the songs to their full potential, and breeding all the colorful monsters to collect! The devs are really great too with constant updates and communication, showing that they care about the community and happy to have joined the ride since 2023!",
