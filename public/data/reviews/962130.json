      "review": "Well, after 378 hours and finishing the game twice (almost 3 times now), I figured it was time to write a review for Grounded.\n\nGameplay is great: Being able to switch weapons, armor, trinkets, mutations and other things on the go makes for a unique experience every time you leave your base and complete your next quest.\n\nStory: Story is fair, some parts a bit cheesy but wasn't too crazy. You kind of get a bit of a choice with how you want to continue the story, and when to continue it. It kept me wanting to know more of the mystery as to where, why, and how I was shrunk in the Backyard.\n\nBuilding is easy: You get many options with how to build your base in the Backyard, be it a small log cabin in the Grasslands, or a mushroom castle on the House Deck, you can build just about anything your imagination brings to you. There are some building limitations however, such as not being able to build in certain places or building during combat, but nothing enough to be overly annoying. Overall though, very easy to learn how to build advanced structures.\n\nCombat is a challenge, but not too difficult: Combat with the bugs in the backyard was one of the things that stuck out to me when wanting to get Grounded. To fight a lumbering ladybug to then be surrounded by spiders sneaking up on ya can be quite the surprise challenge. But after you learn the mechanics and which weapons to use, it can be very fun taking on the challenge. Also, when playing multiplayer, the bugs get tougher the more friends you have with you, so it doesn't get too easy when 3 of you are taking out that pesky stinkbug by your base. Teamwork is key!\n\nThe summary: Grounded is a very fun game to play, whether it be building, fighting, exploring solo, or surviving the Backyard with your friends, it's a game I can highly recommend! I received this as a gift but would say it is well worth the full price. I will be doing this until I'm ready for Grounded 2 (that is looking very promising so far) and hope this helps anyone considering the game.\n\nHappy shrinking!",

The game nails its theme—think Honey, I Shrunk the Kids meets The Forest—with clever mechanics, a reactive world, and some of the best creature design in the genre.\r\nThe survival loop is deeply rewarding. Gathering resources, crafting gear, and building bases all feel intuitive and satisfying. The insect enemies are not just visually impressive—they’re smart and challenging, pushing you to adapt and strategize. The game’s progression keeps you moving into new areas, each with its own threats and surprises.\r\nMultiplayer is a blast. Up to four players can team up, and the co-op experience adds a whole new layer of fun and coordination. Whether you're fending off spiders or exploring hidden labs, teamwork makes everything more exciting.\r\nCustomization and accessibility are top-notch. From difficulty settings to arachnophobia mode, Grounded ensures players of all types can enjoy the game comfortably.\r\nFinal verdict: Grounded is a polished, imaginative survival sim that stands tall among the greats. If you love exploration, crafting, and a touch of whimsy, this game is a must-play.",

All fights are based on managing your stamina and parrying, uses similar gear, build system is identical, BUT:\r\nValheim is less cartoonish, less forgiving, maps are randomly generated and so the world seems larger\r\nGrounded has many QoL features such as automatically emptying your inventory of stuff and sorting it in the apropriate container. Grounded has more \"story\", but at the same time is very forgiving: you keep all your gear and weapons if you die. Enemies are more varied and they have a more comprehensive list of weaknesses and resistances which can be looked-up in-game. So I am currently playing Grounded for the novelty factor, but I'm tired of the childish repetitive puns. Still I'd recommend it to people if you don't mind being infantilized.",

      "review": "A fun, fresh take on the survival genre that hits all the right notes. \r\n\r\nGrounded is full of nostalgic easter eggs and fun quirks from the 80s and 90s, putting a unique spin on the survival/building genre with a genius idea, taking from Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, to throw four inexperienced kids into a backyard setting. \r\n\r\nBuilding and crafting actually feel rewarding and customizable in this game. When it comes to base building in particular, there are very few limitations. Want to build a mushroom mansion in a koi pond surrounding a fountain? Go for it. A massive grass treehouse? No limits on height. A bunker under the front porch? No problem. Grounded really does let you build anywhere and everywhere with a variety of materials and fun, bug-based items and decor. There's even a cozy meter.\r\n\r\nThere is a large variety of bugs to fight, an engaging overarching story, and a lot of armor sets and weapons to choose from to customize a build.\r\n\r\nThe game has hours of content, and both encourages and rewards new game plus by adding in new unlocks and increasing difficulty up to NG+ 9, making for a very rewarding and enjoyable experience that actually values your time.\r\n\r\nWhile there are a handful of minor bugs (sound issues, mostly), the game is an absolute blast built around  great idea. The end-game new game plus grind is a bit much, and there are a few quality of life improvements I'd love to see in the sequel, including more building materials and decor, as well as the ability to haul items on a companion, I would highly recommend Grounded.\r\n\r\nFor achievement hunters, this game will take at least 1 NG+ run to complete, and took me about 80~houurs.",

      "review": "Grounded has been one of my favorite games, Since the first day of its early access on my Xbox, up until now. I Recently repurchased the game on steam, and it's even better than i remember.\r\n\r\nConcept? Chefs KISS, Absolutely perfect execution of the idea. Characters? Though there are not many, They All possess humour, personality and express themselves greatly for pixels dancing on my monitor!\r\n\r\nThe Combat? Great! No issues, Most Weapon types that appeal to players from other games would be present in the Fighting System, Axes, Spears, Katanas, Your Bare Knuckles, Crossbows, All of it. (Though i am QUITE annoyed there is NO GLAIVE weapon!) Simple Blocking system, Easy to understand, Quick to get the hang of, The Armor is a little more weird, but its fairly straightforward too\r\n\r\nThe Difficulty can catch some people off guard, Myself included. Some Enemies are Pretty Tough to fight, but if they're that bad? you Probably shouldn't even be there.\r\n\r\nThere are a Decent Number of bossfights across the game. 7, To be Precise. Which are all pretty diabolical in their own ways, but also really fun to challenge, and adds plenty to the game and story!\r\n\r\nThe Plot is mainly straightforward, Im not spoiling here. (You want the plot? Search it up, watch a video)  But Despite its simple story, it has a good amount of branches that can test story seekers to hunt every last detail it has to offer.\r\n\r\nThe Building aspect is near flawless. in my opinion. (Key word, NEAR) But it has a FEW limitations, like Areas you can build, Or, Cant build. Building is also often accidentally used to screw up progression, so if you cant get somewhere? You can. you're just not at that stage of the game yet.\r\n\r\nThere is no shortage of collectables to keep you occupied. there is Lots of Secrets, Cool Details, and Things you would never think of to put in a game of your own!\r\n\r\nOverall, Grounded is my BEST OPTION to recommend for Any person looking for a Fantastic Survival game. Unless you dont got the money, which is my ONLY REAL COMPLAINT.\r\n\r\n35/10",

You'll see I don't have a lot of hours of steam, but I have a few hundred hours on console and have stuck with the game since it's initial alpha release.\n\nFirst of all, the gameplay: This game put a lot of work into the combat, every enemy has resistances and weaknesses that you learn to exploit as you play around with the large variety of weapons and armors. Every armor set gives different buffs and are made for a clear playstyle of your choosing. Combine that with the many trinkets and mutations you'll find throughout the game, you can make a truly deadly combo. The exploration is just as good. The map is the perfect size for the game, not too big and not too small. And with many unique POI's scattered across the map it's not easy to get lost. Going back to armors and mutations, there are items that help increase movement speed. The game also gives you other options like ziplines (and later in New Game+, teleporters) you can place anywhere on the map, ziplines you can move BOTH WAYS on.\n\nBuilding: I would go as far as to say this game has the BEST building in any survival game I've played. There are hardly any limitations on what you can place and where, it's very forgiving when placing floors and walls half inside of terrain. The options for materials are pretty vast, and the devs made an entire update on base building post 1.0 Adding TONS of decorative items. The game also rewards you for good base building and decorating with the feature called \"Coziness\" which gives you buffs while at home.\n\nStory: The story is alright, nothing groundbreaking and a little cliche, but it has a nice charm to it. The only real captivating thing is figuring out the mystery of why you're shrunken down in some dude's backyard.\n\nQuality Of Life: Holy frijoles the QOL is so good. The devs put a lot of work into making sure you have the best possible experience. You can craft and build with items in nearby chests, there's 3 hotbars you can instantly switch between, on-demand switching between first and third person, hot deposit items, sort items, and so much more.\n\nAll in all, Grounded is an incredibly charming survival experience with something for everyone, whether you like exploring and finding secrets, building big bases, or partaking in challenging fights and boss fights, I guarantee there's something you'd like. And with the addition of New Game+ you can have a save that just never ends.",

Why is that? Any actual story or progression is interspersed with prolonged periods of grinding for materials that may go on for in-game days, or several irl hours before you've prepared enough to advance the questline. That kind of gameplay loop seems awfully boring and just an expected experience in a survival-crafter.\n\nSo how does a survival crafter like grounded come out with this rating? It's setting, art design, bugs, clunky combat, and it's fluid builds and variety, but the game heavily favors melee over range. And, having a proper ending that makes all that time invested feel worthwhile.\n\nIf you're new to survival crafters and need for something to be happening to stay engaged, this one may be a tough one for you to bring yourself to finish. There's a NG+ mode, but I don't care for it and it's RNG rigmarole and damage sponges.",

Ranged combat is less fleshed out, but still useable, especially in co-op.\r\n-Really enjoyed the shared saves function.

      "review": "I have always wanted to know what it feels like to be a discarded Cheeto on a suburban lawn, and thanks to  Grounded, I now know the experience mostly involves screaming, running, and developing a complex relationship with aphids. The game is a masterpiece of anxiety and joy where the Wolf Spiders don't just walk—they patrol like they own the mortgage. Even with \"Arachnophobia Safe Mode\" on, being chased by a floating, aggressive meatball that hisses at you is somehow worse than the real thing. Between the terrifying wildlife and the \"farm-to-table\" cuisine of roasted gnats and dirty soda can water, the survival mechanics offer a primal satisfaction that really makes you appreciate the little things in life, literally.\r\n\r\nBeyond the terror, the base building is fantastic; I spent hours fighting ants just to construct a multi-story mansion on a baseball, which I felt was a strategic genius move until I realized I couldn't get down without breaking my legs. The atmosphere captures that 90s \"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\" magic perfectly, blending whimsical adventure with the constant threat of being eaten by a ladybug you accidentally punched. It is a chaotic, beautiful experience that makes carrying grass planks feel like being a Titan of Industry, and honestly, it’s the most fun I have ever had being at the bottom of the food chain. 10/10, would get punted by a grasshopper again.",

      "review": "I'm currently only partway through the game, maybe done half the story, but so far it's been quite fun.\r\nThere's a few annoying bugs - the multiplayer audio in particular is an issue* - but overall it's an enjoyable game.\r\n\r\nThere's a big yard filled with tiny creatures. The problem, of course, is that you're even more tiny, being reduced to about 1-2cm (think approx. 1/2 in to an inch) in height, so you're even smaller. Spiders roam and hunt for prey, ants protect their hive, bees and mosquitos fly about being a pain.\r\nTo survive, you need to craft equipment, build a base out of grass, pebbles, clay, and weed planks, and there's plenty of progression systems. Even the coziness of your base gives bonuses when you're there.\r\n\r\nHunting tiny insects while they tower over you is an interesting experience, although like many survival/crafting games, the inventory inevitably feels constricting, forcing many runs back and forth to the base to drop of items. This is especially true if you happen to kill many different types of insects rather than focusing on farming one type.\r\nAnother typical survival game issue is the need for food and water, it's not a constant issue, but it eats into your inventory which is my main issue with it. You need to organise your base well to compensate, but that's not something that'll be obvious to everyone.\r\n\r\n* As far as audio issues are concerned, a lot of it stems from a lack of a dropdown menu to pick your audio devices - it seems to default to whatever is first in Windows' list of devices, which might be the default, but could also be something stupid like the microphone in your main monitor, and the speakers in a secondary monitor. Or worse, if you have speakers in some other random USB-device. The fact that support recommend \"temporarily disabling\" other audio devices says a lot.\r\n\r\nNo updates are planned for the game, it's apparently going to stay in the state it's in, so if this is a dealbreaker for you, know that they don't plan on changing things any time soon.

It has a lovingly crafted map, a fun story, raids and raid defenses, and wonderful base-building mechanics. Also lots of QoL improvements and basic survival-craft improvements that make this game set the bar for the genre.\n\nMy only gripes are that the combat can be difficult (not always because it's challenging, but sometimes because it's just hard to do) and there's a lot of combat required, some of the exploration felt forced, and the quirky \"upgrades\" you get from found objects which are a little too required to ignore (I'd rather have had them be challenges instead of things you really needed to have).\n\nBut in the end the setting is absolutely brilliant and they 100% nailed the \"Honey I Shrunk the Kids\" world while adding a bizarre series of twists. Several other games have attempted the \"survival-craft world of being tiny\" and nothing comes close to the level of polish this game has.",

      "review": "Another game i'd argue deserves a mixed review rather than bad outright, but I admit there is fun to be had with the game. \n\nFirst, I can't imagine this being a solo game in any capacity. Stay very far away as a solo player if you want to enjoy the game. A Majority of the combat is balanced and designed around Co-operative interactions. \n\nSecond, don't keep yourself in the dark with this game. The Story is 'fine', but playing through blind only hindered my experience with the game, forcing major backtracking constantly for special items or even required items in places you'd never think to look. This is in large part a majority to blame on the design of a lot of the areas. Dark, Cramped, small caves and holes filled with enemies that surround and clobber you. This requires you to practice PERFECT BLOCKING. This mechanic polarizes everything this game has to offer, where fighting enemies has you learn their attack patterns to perfect block. It prevent all damage taken, builds stun onto the enemies and \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"sometimes\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" staggers them when it feels like it. This mechanic creates a 'git gud' atmosphere where if you aren't perfect parrying annoying or harder enemies, you just have to suck it up and take the damage. This is readily apparent endgame when the devs decided to slap Poison (Or VENOM!!!! Can't forget VENOM!!! YIPPEE!!) or Bleed on every single 'hard' enemy to punish you for not perfect blocking. It's too centralizing of a mechanic to ignore on most builds, and trivializes everything if you master it. \n\nThird, what is it with the obsession of platforming? You can create diverse and interesting environments (Sandbox, Haze Lab, etc) without forcing the player to deal with floaty controls, unreactive sprint, and asinine jumps constantly. If it was purely for collectables i'd understand but so many required areas just shove it in for no reason. On top of this, Enemy placement feels nonsensical. The Pond is especially egregious with this as the devs almost felt worried you'd be missing out on fighting basic spider enemies and shoved Water Spiders into every single Nook and cranny of the water and explorable areas. It already took me 15 minutes to find this mini cave, and forced me to craft a level 2 dagger, why does it need a long tunnel and 3 spiders floating inside? This is the same in the Hedge Lab too, where random Orb Weaver Jrs are placed inside.  This leads to my biggest complaint-\n\nFourth, Enemy Health Bloat is the single most ruinous part of the game's experience. Enemies will have enormous health bars that make zero sense to be applied. From the very start of the game, Orb Weaver Jrs are insanely tanky even with the correct damage types. They still shrug off hits from Spicy Axes, or anything else like its nothing. As you continue you encounter other fat bloated enemies. Ladybird Larvae are easily the worst with immense health, damage and terrible attack tells. Mites/Ticks are up there too for somehow having these massive healthpools just 'because'. They're already small and ranged, why give them health equal to Wolf spiders? On top of this, enemy attacks are baffling at times, with the devs forcing them to stand a chance against any movement, giving them lunge attacks that teleport  to you, or making them ignore terrain to still hit you. Flying enemies are the worst offenders as Bees and Especially Wasps and Mosquitoes will never miss with certain attacks, unless you're running Natural Explorer (a necessary mutation sadly).\n\nFifth, the building mechanics are just bad and refuse to work well, bases are wonky, setting up coziness is a pain as it just forces you to make one corner of your base filled with random garbage for the Coziness buff, and the fact that you never at any point can put Grass Planks or Weed Stems in my inventory causes me to never want to actually build anything since its a hassle doing so, even with hauling and red an armor all maxed out, as its just boring back and forth, especially when looking for stems. \n\nSixth optionally, connection issues plagued our playtime, i would disconnect nearly 5-15 times  a play session and the server would eat up memory and suffer intermittant crashing. This disconnect bug in particular seems to have been in the game since EARLY ACCESS and still has no fix.\n\nEverything great about the game with the Atmosphere, Weapon design, Mutation creativity and loadout potential and decently interesting enemies are thrown out the window with all the negatives above and other things i haven't mentioned. I think if you're looking for a casual game, it might be fine, but don't come here as a completionist, as this game doesn't respect your time in the slightest.",

Since The Outer Worlds, probably.\r\n\r\nIf there's one thing Obsidian does best, it's mediocrity. Their games are never awful, but rarely are they good either. I gave Grounded a chance because everyone says it's great and because it was a decent price on sale but... like, people are full of it.  Grounded sucks.\r\n\r\nThe tech tree is boring. Enemies have WAY too much HP (another Obsidian specialty - they don't know how to make combat that's actually engaging so they just shrug and inflate numbers on both sides and never bother to actually test any of it), resulting in every encounter being a complete slog.\r\n\r\nThe second major destination in the game features a pain in the ass climb through an area with poorly indicated pathways and sloppy movement physics. Your reward for making this climb is a lab full of spiders that spawn pretty much incessantly and have way too much HP.\r\n\r\nAnd how do you advance down the tech tree, anyhow? Why, by killing even bigger bugs with even more absurd health pools! They can kill you in two or three hits and chase you down almost immediately while you're having to stand still after your stamina runs out after 10 seconds of movement, and it'll take like 150 arrows or so. But your reward for killing them - assuming they drop the item you need! - is... a slightly better axe that lets you cut down a slightly more advanced type of \"tree\" so you can eventually get the next tier of weapons, which kill enemies in like 10 hits instead of 20.\r\n\r\nI'm very upset with myself that I wasted money on this game, even knowing Obsidian's reputation for incompetence. Worse, instead of just writing the game off immediately and refunding it as soon as I saw the climbing nonsense that the second area would require, I thought I would explore some more and try to find a more sensible way to the destination. By time I understood that there was no alternative, I was past the 2 hour mark.\r\n\r\nDon't make the mistake I did. Don't waste money on Obsidian products. Except Pentiment. Pentiment is amazing.",

      "review": "Without a doubt one of the most thoroughly mediocre games I've played in a very long time. Since The Outer Worlds, probably.\r\n\r\nIf there's one thing Obsidian does best, it's mediocrity. Their games are never awful, but rarely are they good either. I gave Grounded a chance because everyone says it's great and because it was a decent price on sale but... like, people are full of it.  Grounded sucks.\r\n\r\nThe tech tree is boring. Enemies have WAY too much HP (another Obsidian specialty - they don't know how to make combat that's actually engaging so they just shrug and inflate numbers on both sides and never bother to actually test any of it), resulting in every encounter being a complete slog.\r\n\r\nThe second major destination in the game features a pain in the ass climb through an area with poorly indicated pathways and sloppy movement physics. Your reward for making this climb is a lab full of spiders that spawn pretty much incessantly and have way too much HP.\r\n\r\nAnd how do you advance down the tech tree, anyhow? Why, by killing even bigger bugs with even more absurd health pools! They can kill you in two or three hits and chase you down almost immediately while you're having to stand still after your stamina runs out after 10 seconds of movement, and it'll take like 150 arrows or so. But your reward for killing them - assuming they drop the item you need! - is... a slightly better axe that lets you cut down a slightly more advanced type of \"tree\" so you can eventually get the next tier of weapons, which kill enemies in like 10 hits instead of 20.\r\n\r\nI'm very upset with myself that I wasted money on this game, even knowing Obsidian's reputation for incompetence. Worse, instead of just writing the game off immediately and refunding it as soon as I saw the climbing nonsense that the second area would require, I thought I would explore some more and try to find a more sensible way to the destination. By time I understood that there was no alternative, I was past the 2 hour mark.\r\n\r\nDon't make the mistake I did. Don't waste money on Obsidian products. Except Pentiment. Pentiment is amazing.",

      "review": "TLDR; I can't recommend it because some of the aspects absolutely infuriate me. \n\nI liked New Vegas, but it didn't age well. This game is very similar in that it has the Obsidian charm in the story and concept departments, but falls flat on it's face when it comes to important details. Companions create an unending stream of noise and their collision hit boxes can bump you off of precarious places. The movement feels terrible, floaty and over sensitive to geometry, jumping puzzles are a time consuming chore. Thrown weapons can vanish or get stuck in places where they can't be retrieved. I could get over a lot of the issues like resetting my power level every time I enter a new area or being CONSTANTLY harassed by creatures that have not been useful to left click on for hours but the fact that the multiplayer is an annoying complicated mess is what kills this game for me. I've seen the negative reviews for this game, a lot of them were left by people that didn't want to put in the effort to learn the game's mechanics. But every review talking about how bad the multiplayer is, is valid. If you're going to have a poorly mechanically designed game with a fun setting and great art direction, you have to have an easy and accessible multiplayer to distract people from the problems.\n\nI will not complete this game to 100% even though I've already invested over 100 hours into it. I cannot recommend this game to anyone unless you can get it for 20 dollars or less. I will not revisit this game years down the road like I have with so many of my favorites. Obsidian has finally tarnished my trust in them. I don't know how much longer they will be developing games and Grounded 2 already has a tons of issues. This is very likely the last Obsidian game I will play.",

      "review": "Another game i'd argue deserves a mixed review rather than bad outright, but I admit there is fun to be had with the game. \n\nFirst, I can't imagine this being a solo game in any capacity. Stay very far away as a solo player if you want to enjoy the game. A Majority of the combat is balanced and designed around Co-operative interactions. \n\nSecond, don't keep yourself in the dark with this game. The Story is 'fine', but playing through blind only hindered my experience with the game, forcing major backtracking constantly for special items or even required items in places you'd never think to look. This is in large part a majority to blame on the design of a lot of the areas. Dark, Cramped, small caves and holes filled with enemies that surround and clobber you. This requires you to practice PERFECT BLOCKING. This mechanic polarizes everything this game has to offer, where fighting enemies has you learn their attack patterns to perfect block. It prevent all damage taken, builds stun onto the enemies and \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"sometimes\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" staggers them when it feels like it. This mechanic creates a 'git gud' atmosphere where if you aren't perfect parrying annoying or harder enemies, you just have to suck it up and take the damage. This is readily apparent endgame when the devs decided to slap Poison (Or VENOM!!!! Can't forget VENOM!!! YIPPEE!!) or Bleed on every single 'hard' enemy to punish you for not perfect blocking. It's too centralizing of a mechanic to ignore on most builds, and trivializes everything if you master it. \n\nThird, what is it with the obsession of platforming? You can create diverse and interesting environments (Sandbox, Haze Lab, etc) without forcing the player to deal with floaty controls, unreactive sprint, and asinine jumps constantly. If it was purely for collectables i'd understand but so many required areas just shove it in for no reason. On top of this, Enemy placement feels nonsensical. The Pond is especially egregious with this as the devs almost felt worried you'd be missing out on fighting basic spider enemies and shoved Water Spiders into every single Nook and cranny of the water and explorable areas. It already took me 15 minutes to find this mini cave, and forced me to craft a level 2 dagger, why does it need a long tunnel and 3 spiders floating inside? This is the same in the Hedge Lab too, where random Orb Weaver Jrs are placed inside.  This leads to my biggest complaint-\n\nFourth, Enemy Health Bloat is the single most ruinous part of the game's experience. Enemies will have enormous health bars that make zero sense to be applied. From the very start of the game, Orb Weaver Jrs are insanely tanky even with the correct damage types. They still shrug off hits from Spicy Axes, or anything else like its nothing. As you continue you encounter other fat bloated enemies. Ladybird Larvae are easily the worst with immense health, damage and terrible attack tells. Mites/Ticks are up there too for somehow having these massive healthpools just 'because'. They're already small and ranged, why give them health equal to Wolf spiders? On top of this, enemy attacks are baffling at times, with the devs forcing them to stand a chance against any movement, giving them lunge attacks that teleport  to you, or making them ignore terrain to still hit you. Flying enemies are the worst offenders as Bees and Especially Wasps and Mosquitoes will never miss with certain attacks, unless you're running Natural Explorer (a necessary mutation sadly).\n\nFifth, the building mechanics are just bad and refuse to work well, bases are wonky, setting up coziness is a pain as it just forces you to make one corner of your base filled with random garbage for the Coziness buff, and the fact that you never at any point can put Grass Planks or Weed Stems in my inventory causes me to never want to actually build anything since its a hassle doing so, even with hauling and red an armor all maxed out, as its just boring back and forth, especially when looking for stems. \n\nSixth optionally, connection issues plagued our playtime, i would disconnect nearly 5-15 times  a play session and the server would eat up memory and suffer intermittant crashing. This disconnect bug in particular seems to have been in the game since EARLY ACCESS and still has no fix.\n\nEverything great about the game with the Atmosphere, Weapon design, Mutation creativity and loadout potential and decently interesting enemies are thrown out the window with all the negatives above and other things i haven't mentioned. I think if you're looking for a casual game, it might be fine, but don't come here as a completionist, as this game doesn't respect your time in the slightest.",

      "review": "Without a doubt one of the most thoroughly mediocre games I've played in a very long time. Since The Outer Worlds, probably.\r\n\r\nIf there's one thing Obsidian does best, it's mediocrity. Their games are never awful, but rarely are they good either. I gave Grounded a chance because everyone says it's great and because it was a decent price on sale but... like, people are full of it.  Grounded sucks.\r\n\r\nThe tech tree is boring. Enemies have WAY too much HP (another Obsidian specialty - they don't know how to make combat that's actually engaging so they just shrug and inflate numbers on both sides and never bother to actually test any of it), resulting in every encounter being a complete slog.\r\n\r\nThe second major destination in the game features a pain in the ass climb through an area with poorly indicated pathways and sloppy movement physics. Your reward for making this climb is a lab full of spiders that spawn pretty much incessantly and have way too much HP.\r\n\r\nAnd how do you advance down the tech tree, anyhow? Why, by killing even bigger bugs with even more absurd health pools! They can kill you in two or three hits and chase you down almost immediately while you're having to stand still after your stamina runs out after 10 seconds of movement, and it'll take like 150 arrows or so. But your reward for killing them - assuming they drop the item you need! - is... a slightly better axe that lets you cut down a slightly more advanced type of \"tree\" so you can eventually get the next tier of weapons, which kill enemies in like 10 hits instead of 20.\r\n\r\nI'm very upset with myself that I wasted money on this game, even knowing Obsidian's reputation for incompetence. Worse, instead of just writing the game off immediately and refunding it as soon as I saw the climbing nonsense that the second area would require, I thought I would explore some more and try to find a more sensible way to the destination. By time I understood that there was no alternative, I was past the 2 hour mark.\r\n\r\nDon't make the mistake I did. Don't waste money on Obsidian products. Except Pentiment. Pentiment is amazing.",

My biggest gripe is locking certain resources and progression behind 3 tiers of tools. I go off exploring and all of a sudden I can't do a certain task as I don't have a specific T2 tool, unless there is a decent linear progression system, trying to find out how to unlock that specific tool is very unfriendly. I understand this is mean to be a longer game to play but it gets very tedious very quickly when playing for the first time without guides. There's a reason why less than 10% of players have actually finished the game.

Then she got kicked from my hosted game, and needed to sign into an XBox account (that she doesn't have, nor need 6 hours prior). She got back in for another 2 hours and we finished for the evening. Fast forward to early afternoon the next day, and now my game asks for XBox credentials (which I do happen to have) but as soon as I'm signed in, the game says it can't find my credentials. I even went to the credentials manager in Windows and erased them and tried another XBox account with the same results. 8 hours in game, can't play multiplayer, can't refund, no word from Obsidian or XBox about what is causing this. \n\nHopefully someone will see this and it will keep them from purchasing this for multiplayer until they fix it.

      "review": "Another game i'd argue deserves a mixed review rather than bad outright, but I admit there is fun to be had with the game. \n\nFirst, I can't imagine this being a solo game in any capacity. Stay very far away as a solo player if you want to enjoy the game. A Majority of the combat is balanced and designed around Co-operative interactions. \n\nSecond, don't keep yourself in the dark with this game. The Story is 'fine', but playing through blind only hindered my experience with the game, forcing major backtracking constantly for special items or even required items in places you'd never think to look. This is in large part a majority to blame on the design of a lot of the areas. Dark, Cramped, small caves and holes filled with enemies that surround and clobber you. This requires you to practice PERFECT BLOCKING. This mechanic polarizes everything this game has to offer, where fighting enemies has you learn their attack patterns to perfect block. It prevent all damage taken, builds stun onto the enemies and \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"sometimes\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" staggers them when it feels like it. This mechanic creates a 'git gud' atmosphere where if you aren't perfect parrying annoying or harder enemies, you just have to suck it up and take the damage. This is readily apparent endgame when the devs decided to slap Poison (Or VENOM!!!! Can't forget VENOM!!! YIPPEE!!) or Bleed on every single 'hard' enemy to punish you for not perfect blocking. It's too centralizing of a mechanic to ignore on most builds, and trivializes everything if you master it. \n\nThird, what is it with the obsession of platforming? You can create diverse and interesting environments (Sandbox, Haze Lab, etc) without forcing the player to deal with floaty controls, unreactive sprint, and asinine jumps constantly. If it was purely for collectables i'd understand but so many required areas just shove it in for no reason. On top of this, Enemy placement feels nonsensical. The Pond is especially egregious with this as the devs almost felt worried you'd be missing out on fighting basic spider enemies and shoved Water Spiders into every single Nook and cranny of the water and explorable areas. It already took me 15 minutes to find this mini cave, and forced me to craft a level 2 dagger, why does it need a long tunnel and 3 spiders floating inside? This is the same in the Hedge Lab too, where random Orb Weaver Jrs are placed inside.  This leads to my biggest complaint-\n\nFourth, Enemy Health Bloat is the single most ruinous part of the game's experience. Enemies will have enormous health bars that make zero sense to be applied. From the very start of the game, Orb Weaver Jrs are insanely tanky even with the correct damage types. They still shrug off hits from Spicy Axes, or anything else like its nothing. As you continue you encounter other fat bloated enemies. Ladybird Larvae are easily the worst with immense health, damage and terrible attack tells. Mites/Ticks are up there too for somehow having these massive healthpools just 'because'. They're already small and ranged, why give them health equal to Wolf spiders? On top of this, enemy attacks are baffling at times, with the devs forcing them to stand a chance against any movement, giving them lunge attacks that teleport  to you, or making them ignore terrain to still hit you. Flying enemies are the worst offenders as Bees and Especially Wasps and Mosquitoes will never miss with certain attacks, unless you're running Natural Explorer (a necessary mutation sadly).\n\nFifth, the building mechanics are just bad and refuse to work well, bases are wonky, setting up coziness is a pain as it just forces you to make one corner of your base filled with random garbage for the Coziness buff, and the fact that you never at any point can put Grass Planks or Weed Stems in my inventory causes me to never want to actually build anything since its a hassle doing so, even with hauling and red an armor all maxed out, as its just boring back and forth, especially when looking for stems. \n\nSixth optionally, connection issues plagued our playtime, i would disconnect nearly 5-15 times  a play session and the server would eat up memory and suffer intermittant crashing. This disconnect bug in particular seems to have been in the game since EARLY ACCESS and still has no fix.\n\nEverything great about the game with the Atmosphere, Weapon design, Mutation creativity and loadout potential and decently interesting enemies are thrown out the window with all the negatives above and other things i haven't mentioned. I think if you're looking for a casual game, it might be fine, but don't come here as a completionist, as this game doesn't respect your time in the slightest.",

While this game is insanely creative and well put together, the grindiness in the mid to late game make it one I dread returning to. It would be one thing to make late game items difficult to grind, but those items (weapons, armor) also have a deterioration, and to be repaired requires grinding even more of the materials you already spent a ton of time gathering. Failing a late game boss fight could mean spending hours repairing your equipment. It just really slows the game pacing down.\n\nFurthermore, reading about Fully Yoked, this is exacerbated with necessary upgrades that are insanely expensive to get, making the game even grindier, which I can't believe is possible. All for minimal performance improvement (~5%!). \n\nFun game and a great idea, but in my opinion, the materials grind really dampens the experience if you're aiming to finish the story or 100% the game.",
