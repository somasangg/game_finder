I keep booting it up no matter how frustrated I get with it, it really is just that fun.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it runs buttery smooth. Most well optimized UE5 game I've ever seen. It's pretty and vivid and colorful and a joy to look at. All on my 1660 SUPER?? \r\n\r\nSecondly, doing well in races requires that you, well, race well. The items obviously give you a boost when youre behind, but I always have to make sure Im hitting my lines if Im actually going to catch up to the head of the pack. I don't think bagging without thinking is gonna get you on the podium, at least in my experience. \r\n\r\nThere's definitely a meta forming around certain gadget combos, but I've seen SO MANY viable builds that it doesnt feel like theres a \"correct\" waya to play online, which is really nice. It lets me experiment and play to different vibes without worrying about my rating taking a hit!\r\n\r\nI havent experienced the Online issues others seem to be talking about. Theres a stray Communication error here and there but no more or less than Id expect from any other game? It was kinda bad at launch, but the situations definitely improved. Its a BIT annoying not being able to play World Race while a Festival is going on. Thats not a very big complaint tho, considering how quickly you can get all the festival rewards, you dont have to engage with it much if you dont want to. \r\n\r\nMy only real complaint, and this is really just a factor of luck, but sometimes you can get stuck in a rubberbanding void that kind of dooms you to not be able to place well in a race. I know its just the way the cards fall sometimes, but when matchmaking seems to be skill based, it can really frustrating when youre just stuck coming in like 8th all the time bc youre locked in a position that will only ever give you white wisps.\r\n\r\nAll in all though, excellent game! Cant wait to see what characters the rest of next year brings! (Super looking forward to NiGHTS!!!!)",

      "review": "The game is almost addictive in how good it is. However even if 70 dollars is a large price this seems to be the norm for all games and not just Crossworlds. That being said i have very few complaints about it, they are pretty big ones though. The AI, especially the rivals, are somewhat unbalanced with the rivals  basically getting cheats at higher levels with unreasonable stats and things like rubber-banding to first instead of the player. The rival teams in race park also get invincibility for the first lap, and to top it all off the other AI also seem to help the rival in any way possible from hitting you with items you cant dodge to getting ahead of you just give you less points in Grand Prix's. The only other big complaint that i have being that the item distribution system is F***ED. Not only do the AI always get the strongest items at the worst times but you can't get strong items from non-special item boxes ( even thought the AI can at any time no matter what you do ), it also makes it so that you get the worst items at the worst possible times as well.  I do also have to say that it seems like the creators expect you to put hundreds of hours into the game with achievements than are nothing but grind-fests that want you to spend thousands of tickets on things you will probably never use so 100 percenting the game feels more like a chore than an actual reason to keep playing the game. If you can ignore that though its a game you can comfortably sink days into with no problem to a point where you will not even want to put it down, so at least if you don't care about things like arbitrary challenges you can play this game knowing that it's money well spent, and is going to have both free and paid content updates until early next year meaning that even if you don't play it every day you will still have a good reason to come back every now and then, and frankly that's not even mentioning the new characters you can play from non sonic IP's as well as fan favorites like tangle and whisper from IDW. Honestly i just wish they came out with more tracks and crossworlds, maybe they could give the riders fans some more service and make more options for Extreme Gear too.

There's a surprising amount of skill that goes into this, I'm not the best at it (I'm better at more conventional racers like Gran Turismo and Tokyo Xtreme Racer). For a UE5 game I'm surprised it doesn't run like ass. Though I wish my frames weren't capped to 60.\n\nIf you like Sonic (or if you're a Jet enthusiast like me), you'll probably like it. The tracks and soundtrack are great (save for a couple that lag behind slightly). Get it on sale though, a friend bought this for me and I feel bad he had to spend more than $40 for a racing game.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly addicting, and Sonic Team frankly has something good going with this. All we can really do is hope that there's post launch support past 2026 while we wait for the next (hopefully good) entry in the Sonic series.\n\nTLDR; better than mario kart world, doesn't feel like a generic kart racer, and you can play as the babylon rogues (bumps it up immediately)",

      "review": "Let's get this out of the way first: this is easily the most fun racing game I have ever played. The core gameplay is fun, chaotic, yet also very rewarding of player skill, even if you don't experiment too deeply with the Gadget system. The item balance can sometimes be a bit much, but I didn't find it to be too bad.\nThe tracks are all fun, the CrossWorld gimmick adds a very good level of variety to every single race, and the unique character interactions are perfect for a huge Sonic fan like myself. The game offers a decent ammount of different modes, and the soundtrack is fantastic.\nThe game is, however, lacking in a couple of areas.\nThe most obvious one that everyone points out: the DLC characters don't have any voice acting. While understandable for some, it really is especially baffling that this was left out for characters such as Joker or Ichiban, though it's not enough for me to be a deal breaker. The servers when playing online races can also be quite iffy, with disconnects and network errors being something you will see a lot. Sometimes you'll go hours without seeing one, and other times you'll get 5 in a row, it's really odd. \nNow, while the game has a bunch of stuff for the player to unlock, and can definitely keep you busy in that regard, the game is honestly lacking in terms of single-player content, especially when compared to the previous two Sonic Racing titles. Despite being the most expensive game in the series so far, the only real gameplay variety in this game outside of the standard Grand Prix and Time Trial is the different modes in Race Park. While they are fun, they pale in comparison to what the previous games offered, yes, even the first All-Stars Racing. All-Stars Racing had Mission Mode, Transformed had World Tour and Team Sonic Racing had Team Adventure. All three of these - but in particular World Tour and Team Adventure - did an EXCELLENT job of offering a ton of single-player content, while also having very good variety, especially World Tour. So many different game modes that actually felt very different to one another, and were fun in their own right. Unfortunately, CrossWorlds does not have anything of the sort. The closest you'll get is the Race Park modes, which is a real shame, and even a little disappointing. \nWith all that said, you may notice that despite this, I easily have the most playtime on CrossWorlds, and I'm still giving it a Recommended. Yeah, the core gameplay really is THAT fun. What the game lacks in single-player offerings, it MORE than makes up for by, as I stated right at the very start, being the most fun racing game I have ever played. It's also a little easier to swallow when the game at least tries to make the most of the \"standard\" racing game modes, offering a more in-depth Rival system in Grand Prix, and offering actual rewards for Time Trials to entice even the people who would normally never bat an eye at it to give it a try. It also has the most varied character roster and track selection in the series, at least when it comes to Sonic, easily eclipsing whatever Team Sonic Racing was trying to do.\nEven if you're not a Sonic fan, you're bound to have a ton of fun with this game - it's really good!",

      "review": "I was really afraid we were going to have another Team Sonic Racing, but this game defied all my expectations for a Sonic game. I can't believe how fun this game is.\n\n\nAlright, let's start with the good:\n\n\nIt takes almost all the good features from Team Sonic Racing: The cool cars, custom paint kits, custom horns, characters, certain tracks, and trashed bad features like the awful story mode, always being on a forced team, and abusing Team Ultimates by constantly swapping items with your team, or [i] locking paint kits behind awful mini-games that require an absolutely perfect performance or you don't get anything. [/i] This is very refreshing and shows that the dev team clearly understood what was good and bad about Team Sonic Racing. One of the most important things I look for in games these days is recognizing a development team wants to ACTUALLY make a game and not corporate slop, cutscene slop, nostalgia slop, etc.\n\nRight from the start, we have a lengthy timeline of free content. They are communicating to the player-base that there will be plenty of content to keep players coming back and they are trying their best to convince consumers to accept the steep price of $70 for a base game. There's also lots to do in the game like the Grand Prix, but no terrible story mode this time. Then there's the Race Park, where you have a lot of modes to choose from that provides variety. My favorite from Race Park is Extreme Match, where all items on the track are the most powerful items in the game and since everyone has crazy items, there's less of a chance that you'll get bagged by the CPU. The race park also features the team racing from Team Sonic Racing and solo racing events. And of course there's time trials, and they are super challenging this time around. It's very satisfying to break records.\n\nThe character rival interactions are very charming and add depth to characters that haven't seen exploration in decades.\n\nThe gadget system is outstanding. The way it works is that you have a plate that you can upgrade over time to put more gadgets into to give yourself extra abilities during races. There's all sorts of combinations of upgrades you can pick from and it is clearly fine-tuned to ensure that there is not a superior strategy that would cause every other gadget set to be inferior and not worth trying out. However, there is a specific set I see being used online quite a lot used by top players, but that gadget set and vehicle loadout doesn't guarantee you'll win races. If you're curious, the loadout gives you invulnerability for a few seconds if you're able to get your drift meter to level 4, but other players can SEE your loadout and vehicle before a race and they will bum-rush you because they know what you're trying to do.\n\nThen they replaced the in-game currency of Mod Pods with Donpa Tickets. In my opinion, you unlock every part in Team Sonic Racing way too fast because the game overrewarded you and it doesn't feel satisfying to get all the parts. Donpa Tickets elongate this process and make it feel rewarding to unlock things, but I'll expound on this later when I start talking about the bad parts of the game.\n\nThere's also the festivals that occur every two or three weeks where you can race online to unlock more free content. Unlike the Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled events, you simply unlock things from playing. You don't need Donpa Tickets for unlocking Festival items, but the Festivals ARE time-limited. I'm unsure what the dev team will do for people that missed Festivals, but I really hope it's not future microtransactions to purchase things you missed. That's what most games would do. Oh yeah, there's absolutely NO monetization. [i] Yet. [/i]\n\nThe modding community is bustling and incredible. While there are no plans I've heard for official extensive skin customization, like in CTR:NF, there are so many great skin mods to customize your characters, music, and even track pallettes with.\n\n\nNow unfortunately, this is a Sonic game, so here's the bad:\n\n\nMy main concern, and I'm sure most of the player-base agrees, is that the grind for Donpa Tickets is [b] absurd. [/b] Most races you'll get about 14-16 tickets, and the parts can go up to 200 tickets. Doesn't sound too bad, right? But then each decal is 200 tickets and there's 30+ purchasable decals, each individual horn this time are 500 tickets, and there's 20+ horns. The auras for cars are 2000 tickets, but thankfully there's only just a few. [spoiler]After you finish the entirety of the base game Grand Prix, you get access to a friendship menu where you can get cool titles, decals for your car, and AI skins. But this is where you start realizing you're gonna need to grind tickets for DAYS. There's seven tiers for each character, and to max out friendship for just one character you need [i] 50,000 tickets. [/i] This virtually impossible goal clearly looks like a scheme for the game to introduce real-life currency purchasing in the future, and are not being upfront about it to keep people from abandoning the game.[/spoiler]\n\nWhile the base game character interactions clearly have a ton of love put into them, almost all extra and future characters have absolutely no interactions and they don't even have voices. It's really lazy.\n\nIf you're on the grind for Donpa Tickets, you'll quickly find out that you're finishing most of the in-game achievements from constantly doing Grand Prix, Race Park, Time Trials, etc. Before you know it, the ticket grind becomes fake longevity where you're mindlessly grinding Donpa tickets because of the crazy high ticket prices, starved for content and waiting for the next Festival to occur.\n\nOnline connectivity is relatively fine, but online is really unstable at times and you'll get booted out of races for all sorts of reasons and that can be really frustrating at times. Speaking of online frustrations, festivals are exclusively online so the pro of free content becomes a con to people with unstable internet. Furthermore, certain auras and gadgets, AKA more free content, is locked behind an online ranking system. I understand that this is a way to encourage players to play online to get cool stuff, but again - what if someone just doesn't have internet? What if someone was barely able to download the game and has terrible internet connectivity? This puts these players at an unfair disadvantage that they can't control. What's worse is that some of the best gadgets come from online play.\n\nWell I'm looking back at my review and I see I put more good than bad, so this game is probably worth your time. But please wait for a sale. This game is NOT worth $70.",

      "review": "This game is absolutely fast-pacing, and fun! I've been enjoying this game for a few months now and I've been coming back to this a lot of times. There are so many stuff to do and it's really enjoyable. \n\nPROS:\n\n1. Each race course including crossworld courses are so very detailed and unique! Bringing back the good ol days of sonic games from Sonic Adventures 2 all the way to Sonic Frontiers. Definitely amazing!\n\n2. Battling rivals (Grand Prix) and AI racers (Race Park) are really fun and challenging. Changing the difficulties is a smart choice for newcomers who are just getting started into doing sonic racing games and for pro racing gamers who always love a challenge.\n\n3. Donpa Tickets are a very interesting currency to collect for goodies. Of course it is only for 2 things you can do for the tickets and that's friendship, and garage. But doing more races on higher difficulty to get even more tickets makes up for it.\n\n4. Customizable Vehicles is a HUGE hit for me, making so many creative vehicles for everyone's liking is always the best thing. You can create up to 5 vehicles for each type and it is absolutely worth it. You can even unlock more vehicles in race park so you can purchase them with donpa tickets in the garage so you can create more styles to your heart's content!\n\n5. The Festivals for online matches is a crowd gatherer. Each month when a new free character or a paid DLC character is added into the game, the festival comes for only 3 days. Players can get lot of goodies such new titles, decals, and a new horn for the vehicles and their profiles. Even though the festivals can be short, there's still a chance that they will come back in the future either by rotations or by other means so that newcomers can get a chance at getting the rewards they don't have from previous festivals.\n\n6. The soundtrack for SRC is absolutely astounding to listen to! It definitely gets you motivated on certain things you want to do while listening to it.\n\nWhile all of these are absolutely great, there are some gripes that does get me very annoyed...\n\nCONS:\n\n1. The Online Match is unstable sometimes. Whenever I'm doing Festivals to get the rewards from doing Online Matches, it boots me out every time for no apparent reason all because of 3 things.\n\nA. I got timed out\n\nB. The host communication was lost\n\nC. Lobby not found\n\nIf that happens multiple times then the number of Donpa Tickets will be deducted in the racing match and that is absolutely annoying. SEGA really needs to fix this kind of problem if players are having that same kind of issue.\n\n2. No voices for the free/DLC characters. Yeah I know, that's another problem that still urks me sometimes. Sure I did bought the Season Pass, even though it was costly but worth it in my opinion, but a lot of players including myself are still baffled that SEGA didn't want to put in voices for those crossover characters. That's absolute bullcrap! They added voices in Sonic and All-Star Racing Transformed why couldn't they do it for SRC? There could've been so many interactions to see for Grand Prix but it never came to be. So much wasted potential.\n\nAll and all, this game is absolutely great to play, If you want to race fast and have your vehicle all styled out, then I highly recommend this game.

      "review": "I've played numerous Sonic / SEGA racing games before. And while I still think All Star Racing Transformed is still the best in the series, Crossworld is a close second!\n\nWhat makes this game great is its crossworld gimmick. Because every races has a 2nd lap which \"crosses\" between different track, it makes each racing experience different, keeping it fresh & exciting!\n\nWhile the game doesn't have a single player campaign like the other games, there's still plenty of things to do in Crossworlds. You can compete in Grand Prix mode (which has PLENTY of cups to go through), play some custom races via Race Park, or beat your best times in time trial. All of these modes has progression thanks to the in-game challenges, which rewards you with achievements and sometimes donpa tickets.\n\nAnd these dompa tickets are the main currency of unlocking all the different vehicle customization of the game, which is quite in-depth. There's a lot of vehicle parts you can mix and match, while being able to change colors and applying some decals.\n\nOne of the other best aspect of Crossworld is online mode. Thanks to it supporting cross platform between many consoles, the game is VERY active, with matches always being filled with players. I find Crossworlds to be THE definitive online experience to play not only by yourself, but also with friends! Unlike previous games, you can EASILY invite 3 other online friends to play in Race Park, or online matches. And while the races are always against everyone, occasionally there's festivals that run throughout a weekend, that pairs a group of players into teams of 3. And somehow, the teamwork aspect in this game is better executed then Team Sonic Racing lmao.\n\nHowever, the reason why I don't consider Corssworld to be the best Sonic/SEGA racing game is because of its controls, music, and complexity of its mechanics. While Transformed has tighter controls, with advanced mechanics sprinkled on like boost stacking, all the while having an absolute BANGER of a soundtrack. Crossworld on the other hand, has controls can sometimes feel stiff, doesn't have enough technicality to REALLY further improve you racing abilities outside of making better turns or finding best paths. And I also find most of the music to be quite bad, espeically the final laps, which has these ANNOYING choirs that takes away from the experience. And to say an OST is bad is a TRAVESTY to utter out in a Sonic game!\n\nOverall, I still have a great time with Crossworlds. With its fun & addicting gameplay, and good amount of content to keep me entertained, even in solo. I wouldn't say its worth the full price, unless you're a die hard fan of Sonic or SEGA racing games. On sale though, I'd say it's worth picking up!",

      "review": "[h1] After the last Sonic Racing title was a mediocre mess, Sonic Racing CrossWorlds has stepped it up considerably. Granted with a few issues that could be ironed out later. [/h1]\n\n[h2] From the outset, this game has extremely good arcade racer controls similar to previous entries [/h2] with nuances to learn and adapt to as you race with tracks readily taking advantage with tight corners and a wide variety of shortcuts to plan and look out for.\n\n[h2] Laps 1, 2, and 3 are all different from each other. [/h2] Laps 1 and 3 take place on the same track albeit lap three will always have some differences to ramp it up with new shortcuts, hazards, and increased rings for maxing out that speed-o-meter. Lap 2 is where the signature CrossWorlds gimmick comes to play, every race will give the leading player two tracks to pick and race on. This helps add some uncertainty and leave every match different from the last.\n\n[h2] Adding on is a feature that definitely shines just as much as the CrossWorld gimmick is the Gadget system, [/h2] allowing different sets of unique buffs to alter the way you play. From simple stat increases to allowing you to turn your drift boost to be invincible and last longer with an additional level. These can change the outcome of a race and makes it worthwhile to experiment in casual and experienced settings.\n\n[h2] The player base will definitely last a good amount of time [/h2] and fill up lobbies with a consistent update schedule to come back to for in-game events and Cross platform support.\n\n[h2] Network issues can sporadically happen, [/h2] disconnecting you from races, and will hopefully be ironed out as the game's lifespan goes on.\n\n[h2] The crossovers with different IPs are underwhelming in most extents. [/h2] Characters expected to talk or at least grunt will be mute and only have their home media's SFX to accompany them when emoting. Which leads to them feeling lifeless compared to the base cast which is voiced pretty ok for the most part. Emotes commonly don't align in art style compared to others in the base roster. They also don't interact with any of the game's single player's features like rivals or friendships which again is disappointing. So no, you won't be seeing Miku interact with Spongebob.\n\n[h2] Speaking of, this game visually is pretty meh. [/h2] UI doesn't have much style aside from the emotes, and can come off bland or in some cases poor quality. Race tracks can look good in some scenarios but have obvious muddy textures or lacking modelling. It's definitely not too bad but should be better for a 70$ title.  \n\n[h2] Vehicle customization is good but could be better. [/h2] The main issues being the lack of tools like mirroring decals for symmetrical designs, changing the decal's material to be different from the body of the vehicle, or copying an existing decal to use again. The next being that decals are arbitrary limited in use by having them unable to stack on top of each other by a bounding box, only having EIGHT slots, and having spots on cars that just can't have decals over them. This may be a lack of time to expand the feature or most likely, fear of player's voice in what they can depict on their vehicles. Despite the crippling limitations however, players have still creatively used these to create unique looking cars for better or for worse. (How did they manage to depict 9/11)???\n\nThese issues [b] COULD [/b] be fixed later down the road, but mods are safe and readily available to improve or alter the visuals and sounds of the games.\n\n[h2] Overall, I think this is a game that should be gotten on sale. [/h2] Given that if you want ALL of the non-Sega crossover content you'll have to shell out 30 dollars for the season pass alone.",

      "review": "Sonic Racing Crossworlds is a fine successor to Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, which is still one of the best kart racers ever released. But if you're not in withdrawal because you can't find online matches in that game anymore, or you're not already a die-hard fan of the Sonic franchise, then I can only recommend this game if it's been discounted below your country's standard AAA price.\r\n\r\nI say this mainly because this game's singleplayer offering does not at all compare to that of S&ART. Grand Prix and Time Trials, two fairly standard offerings for a racing game, are the only dedicated offline components. There is also the Race Park - which comes the closest to the unique objective-based gamemodes that were jam-packed into S&ART's World Tour - but that's best enjoyed with multiple people, and the modes offered within are generally insignificant team-based variations on regular races. What's especially odd is that many of the custom modes - and even some in-game unlockables - are exclusively available through online, the former only playable during \"Festival\" events. In other words, this is very much a multiplayer-first game.\r\n\r\nOne aspect in which Crossworlds does lap S&ART is in both its gameplay and cosmetic customisation. The highlight here is the \"Gadgets\" system: perks that give you (tangible) special benefits on the track, such as improved boosting or being able to manipulate item odds. Some gadgets are clearly better than others and there is a \"meta\" in place, but nevertheless I had a lot of fun experimenting with gadget builds in the Race Park. You're also able to mish-mash car parts together within predefined vehicle classes; but while picking and choosing won't significantly alter your stats, I'd say that's to the game's benefit, since it lets you prioritise cosmetic expression over perfect min-maxxing. Although this game could do with additional gadget slots (the five that are available quickly didn't cut it for me) and a way to more easily configure a preset combination of gadgets, character and vehicle.\r\n\r\nSR:C loosely copies over the \"Transformed\" concept from S&ART, in which your vehicle seamlessly transforms between a car, boat and plane when dictated to do so by the track. The cars are the obvious highlight here: in land mode, each of the five vehicle classes control notably different from one another and are all very reactive/responsive in their own way (except maybe the Power vehicles with their [i]awful[/i] handling). I'd go as far to say that this controls much tighter than S&ART did; but I wouldn't say the same for the boat and the plane. Both of these remove traditional drifting in favour of a charge jump and a charge boost respectively, which actually decrease the control you have over your vehicle. While a well-timed charge jump rewards you with rings (which increase your top speed), the plane's charge boost (which is supposed to funnel rings towards you) has far more situational use. The omission of \"risk boosting\" in air mode is also rather glaring. It all serves to make the implementation of the Transformed mechanic, a highlight of the previous game, appear as more of a boring afterthought.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for an affordable singleplayer kart racing experience, I'd recommend [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/212480/]S&ART[/url] instead. Yes, even thirteen years later. But if you're looking for a great kart racer with multiplayer staying power, then this game is your best bet. The promise of at least a year of post-launch updates, and occassional Festival events themed around the release of new characters, seem to help keep the multiplayer waiting times short. Honestly, that was my only expectation going into this game: a new take on S&ART with the benefit of an active online playerbase. It's been thoroughly met.\r\n\r\n(P.S. Sonic Team, let people hear each other's horns mid-race, you cowards.)",

It's not a Mario Kart killer, IMO, and I honestly still think All-Stars Racing Transformed is the best official Sega kart racer style game, but CrossWorlds is fun enough.\r\n\r\nThat said, I so have some gripes. First, the game doesn't really respect your time. If you want to make out friendship with a single character (required if you wanna do all of the missions, but not required for any achievements), you're looking at 50+ hours for just that alone. That's on top of unlocking the other stuff.\r\n\r\nSecond, none of the DLC characters (excluding Miku) have voice, not even the Sega ones. I would've much rather they spent money given those characters voice than including characters like Spongebob and Aang, who I don't feel belong in this game. Nobody is asking for rival interactions, but is it that hard to give characters dialogue in the menus, results screen, and for emotes?\r\n\r\nThird, there are decals for official companies in the game. You don't have to use them, but it is a form of advertising. It may seem harmless enough, but Sega still couldn't use that money to pay for voice for characters they own,\r\n\r\nLastly, the items are no balanced at all. Sandbagging is basically required for online play in the high-level rankings. It's on the level of Mario Kart Wii for unbalanced it is.\r\n\r\nSo anyway, the game is fun and I do recommend it, but it has flaws.",

      "review": "After 300 hours, it's safe to say that Sonic racing is back and better than ever. Cross worlds does a great job filling in the blanks for previous entries in the Sonic racing series; from the visuals to the roster to how satisfying and exciting it is to race and control oneself, this game thoroughly outdoes its predecessors. Compared to Mario Kart World this game does lack that extreme technical Flair that Sonic is known for, which is ironic since one of these series is known for rail grinding and wall running and it isn't the one that includes these techniques in their latest cart racer entry. This doesn't necessarily hold the game back, neither visually or mechanically; there is plenty to master within the game that will keep your hands busy as well as feeding the eyes with satisfying visual feedback. As someone who preferred Mario Kart before we were customizing vehicle part options, the 180 I've turned about on vehicle customization as a result of this game through its gadgets and combining parts of vehicles to min max stats and equally importantly, the appearance of the vehicle, is worth studying. There are several different types of vehicles, one type for each type of stat: speed, power, acceleration, handling, and boost. If you know anything about Sonic Riders you may have noticed that all of the Boost machines are the Sonic series own hoverboards, known as extreme gear. We have not been able to use these hoverboards in a good game since 2006, so seeing them here is fantastic even if they do not function the way Sonic Riders functioned as a game.  \n\n\n\nThe other equally important part of customization is the gadget system. Gadgets and the plates you slot them into, are unlocked as you continue to play the game. Some gadgets require that you play online to unlock them, but there isn't a large amount of those in the game and the ones that are there aren't particularly earth-shattering anyway. The gadgets affects rain from adding a few ticks into a stat you particularly like to causing your character to be in a constant Spin Attack State like f-zero while drifting. The amount of skill expression and player expression on offer through the gadget system is Bar None for a Kart Racer and maybe even for racing games in general. You are given five different Gadget plates to work with. My friendly rival races with gadgets that allow them to get ahead of the pack early by increasing their speed through ring acquisition and making him difficult to move from his path with power types in power vehicles while I prefer to add a fourth level of drift boost for Speed and invincibility on  extreme gear making me as fragile as I am agile if I'm not careful. These play styles are nothing alike, yet all are present within the game and can be mixed and matched.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe game's music is phenomenal and matches the vibe of the stages which also look very good. Aside from the opening theme the game's music either remixes tracks from earlier parts of Sonic's history makes new tracks for new stages or via unlocks in time trials, has rips directly from previous entries. You would be hard-pressed to find a track in the game that genuinely sounds bad and it happens to be lap 3 of dragon Road. Speaking of which, each track, even the crosswords, have lap 3 variants that up the tempo and intensity accompanying your race to the Finish. Certain tracks even become completely different songs related to the initial song from lap 1 creating an intense and dynamic final lap experience that Mario Kart has yet to deliver. Though, the sheer density and quality of Mario Kart worlds tracklist is easy to argue as better than crosswords, but we're comparing a 9 and 10.\n\n\nSo, what's the bad? For starters $70 is crazy For a game who's DLC isn't even voiced outside of Hatsune Miku.  The online connection is serviceable, usually getting you into matches pretty quickly with little hiccups. However, the game struggles to retain connectivity between players who have queued up for the games only random matchmaking mode, Ranked, as a group of 2 to 4 players. The game will almost as often as it succeeds, fail to keep all of the players in one group connected for more than a few races, giving one or two players a communication error with frustrating frequency. It's even worse when not playing the ranked mode. Past a certain point getting players to be able to join a Lobby is its own struggle because the connection will either time out over and over as a player tries to join or players will be dropped at random from the lobby. Had I not received this game for $60 I would be a little more outraged.\n\nThe balance of the gadgets is mostly fine, though there are some standouts above the rest. In ranked, I am above the 8000 ELO mark and noticed but before even reaching the 4,000 mark The Meta of the game had been solved down to two or three different Gadget combinations; but, there are many different fun and viable builds even if a couple stand out as the best. That's okay.\n\nOnto the topic of items, the balance for them isnt great even if its better than mario karts in alot of places. \"Slime\" signals a warp ring over all the users opponents for a short time frame before dropping green goop on all of them, causing them to spin out, drop all of their items, and splotch slime all over their screen. The slime on their screen also slows the racer down for as long as it remains. Like all items that signal a warp ring over your head, this can be dodged with a Boost Wisp (the mushroom equivalent), a Shield, or a Tornado on reaction. This is far better design than unreactable instant lightning, but it affecting players behind you too is a little absurd. Im unsure why we need an item like this, nor why we're going for something so generic. The slicer is a generic shuriken that you can get in any position lower than 1st it seems, and it cuts the back half of a players vehicle, making them drop one item and lose an intense amount of speed temporarily.It's a super red shell.  this item is capable of being drawn when in 9 through 12th Place. You never want to pull this item in the positions that you are likely to get it and getting hit by this item is always miserable, making it one of two items I think have grounds for removal entirely. The second of which, drops a weight on first and second that flattens and makes them drop an item. This is effectively a projectile mega mushroom that not only locks onto two players from anywhere on the map, but also is effectively a blue shell as it targets the player in first. This combined with the existence of King boom boo, the actual blue shell in the game provides us with a game that has two blue shells and three Global means to affect the first place player from anywhere. The fact that the items are so uninspired and generic is part of what pushed me away from All Stars Racing. Stuff like the slicer and slime make the game feel as unsonic as they look. I'll even say they could have just textured the Slime to be purple and we would have all said it's the goop from chemical plant I get it! But they couldn't even do that. Couldn't Sharah from Secret Rings have casted a fire ring around us instead of the generic tornado? Couldn't we have used any of the shields throughout Sonic's series instead of the generic literal Shield? What was wrong with using other attacking wisps?\n\nAs I approach the 3,000 word mark, I realize I may have said far too much. Though Im mostly okay with that given how passionate I am about this game and how much it has to offer despite its flaws. These flaws do not stop it from being a fun game but they do stop it from being a complete game so it's hard to justify buying this game for $70. It has always felt as though Sonic racing games with the exclusion of riders have felt very cheaply put together and somewhat soulless for the last decade and a half there about. If you can find this game for ~60 you will arguably be getting your money's worth. A must have.",

      "review": "It's a fun video game that actually resists to the player (although sometimes a bit unfairly so), boasts good optimisation considering it's made with Unreal Engine, it's loaded with references and interactions that'll make Sonic fans smile, and manages to be a fresh addition to the kart-racing genre.\n\nCustomisation can also go pretty far, giving players tons of room to heavily change their playstyle by providing both vehicle parts and perks to mess around with and try to make different builds.\n\nThis does imply that characters are essentially just skins though. Playing as Sonic, Knuckles, Dr. Eggman or Silver doesn't have any bearings on how your races will play out. \"Types\" are tied to the vehicles, although what they do is more of a passive thing as they do not grant active skills like in Riders.\n\nI do also wish extreme gears were more than just a different type of skin for the vehicle, because they handle exactly the same as anything with wheels in this game, which is frankly a shame considering many of us wanted a new Riders game. This doesn't play like one at all.\n\nThe music is pretty good (although maybe a bit [i]too[/i] high energy which is saying something considering this is a kart racing game), although I'm having trouble recalling certain themes, which is a first for me in a Sonic game personally. It usually sticks to me instantly.\n\nThe audio mixing is all over the place though, very often the music gets drown out in the mess of sound effects and voice clips, and even the way the music itself is mixed doesn't help it stand out, whereas this was never an issue in Mario Kart games. This might explain why I'm having trouble remembering what the music sounds like. The remixes of themes such as Radical Highway or Dragon Road are really cool though.\n\nThe voice acting ranges from decent to pretty great in the English version. The French version is actually quite good too, but relies way too much on the English translation for its script, only going \"off-track\" when literal translations wouldn't work.\n\nI appreciate that a lot of the stuff that is usually implicit in other kart racers (how much drifting is required to get a boost, how long we must hold the acceleration button to get a fast start, etc) is shown in great detail here. If you fail at these things, it literally is a skill issue on your part.\n\nWe can also bind everything to our liking, which is great as I prefer to accelerate with the right trigger instead of a face button.\n\nLocal multiplayer is an absolute blast and also counts towards your overall progression, so you always have a reason to play offline. I haven't tested online play yet.\n\nThe game runs great on the Steam Deck provided you use medium-quality graphics. Just don't use the highest anti-aliasing parameter and you should be hitting 60 FPS consistently.\n\nThe 70€ price point is kind of insane though. I can't find what justifies it. I feel this is more of a 40€ game to be honest. Thank Gaben for Steam Family Share.",

The online is also very addicting and fun especially when playing with friends. The controls & gadget system is very fun & experimental due to the various builds you could make to suit your playstyle.

But Amy is the main one who has worse lines. Thankfully you can play the game in Japanese & get a mod for the subtitles.\r\n\r\nThe models/animations are kind of stiff.

      "review": "In the modern age of games trying to feel accessible to everyone (and sometimes failing to be fun) CrossWorlds does a great job feeling like a classic arcade challenge while still appealing to a broad playerbase. \r\n\r\nCrossWorlds is the first Sonic game I've ever played that has had friends and family interested in it through gameplay alone, despite not caring about Sonic. Sure, the crossovers proabably play some part but I know people who are coming to love the Sonic cast thanks to this game's animations and dialogue. \r\n\r\nNearly every track has interesting routes, challenging shortcuts and advantages for all different gamemodes between World Match & Festivals. The gadget system also shines the brightest during Festivals thanks to its varied nature forcing you to experiment. The optimal gadget build (tech drift + lvl 4) actually feels better than playing normally; which is a blessing. \r\n\r\nWhile multiplayer is the highlight, the singleplayer content is jam-packed. The rival feature sold me on the game honestly, but I didn't expect the CPUs to put up such a fight! Not only that, but you get rewarded various songs from the franchise for A-Ranking the time trials. And for once they're actually challenging! \r\n\r\nThrough your potentially hundreds of hours playing, you'll earn tickets which can buy character-specific decals to pimp your ride! The artwork is great and the overall customization system is what I wished we got in Mario Kart. You can even earn exclusive skins for every character! I wish this feature got expanded on. \r\n\r\nThe DLC tracks are pretty solid and are done with respect for their original franchises. Funny enough, I think the free update characters are way cooler than the paid ones. Tangle & Whisper are in this game, so that's +100 points right there.",

I really like how there's a whole lot of vehicles and gadgets you can use to fit your playstyle and how the game allows you to listen to whichever game soundtrack you want on each lap.\r\n\r\nMost races online have you feeling overwhelmed at the beginning with how many things are happening on screen but after you understand the items, how they work, learn the stages and their shortcuts, you start to get the hang of it. Currently, the game has these events during some weekends where you earn mostly cosmetic rewards that revolve around the dlc character that released a few hours before the event. The events change the online race rules a bit by putting players in teams, adding bonus points and giving them to the team that gets or does the most of something (most rings collected, most air tricks performed, etc.) My friends and I get on to play mostly when these events are live and we play during the weekend to unlock all of the rewards.\r\n\r\nThe game is really fun.

Sonic Racing Crossworlds evokes this same feeling; it's pure fun that I can enjoy without the need for any purpose. The game is full of content to keep you busy and even past the challenges, there are plenty of rewards to grind tickets for. Multiplayer is genius and so innovative; tapping your teammates gives you both a boost and really adds incentive to working as a team. The interaction between each other feels fantastic and meaningful. Grand Prix is designed really well and it almost feels like a direct response to MK World's terrible decision to run with 1 lap per track in addition to travel laps. The crossworld is the perfect mixup and the final race of the GP is an awesome mashup of the 3. The ticket acquisition could be a lot quicker because as of now the 100% (of which I am 2 ticket sink achievements away from) is a huge sink and aiming for all the friendship rewards in the game is virtually impossible.

It just seems very odd to me that the developers seemed to so thoroughly give Hideki Naganuma the shaft when his music is excellent and so well renowned within and outside of the community.

It's not perfect, but I did enjoy it.\r\nThe visuals here was good, I like how a lot of the environments looked, but I wished Kronos had actual grass textures instead of the ZA effect of \"bitch your grass textures are on the ground\"\r\nI also was surprised that Crossworlds ran well, since I hear a lot about UE5 games not running the best, so I was pretty happy it didn't run like ass.\r\nThe gameplay here is pretty good, it was honestly quite addictive, and even as I'm writing this review, I'm still planning to play more of it. The levels they had in this game were good, I liked they had some new areas here, like E-Stadium, and that Train crossworld. They were cool. I do wish there were a bit more tracks to go through, since I felt a massive \"I want more from this game.\" When I finished all the tracks in the game, except the DLC tracks since I'm not getting them YET.\r\nI did get the Blue Star Extreme Gear, and it was cool af, I liked Riders already, so I liked using it.\r\nSpeaking of the Extreme Gear, I was REALLY happy with them coming back, while they're not as in-depth as Riders 1's Extreme Gear, I honestly prefer it that way.\r\nAs much as I enjoyed the original Riders, my thoughts were very polarizing because of those mechanics. I kept thinking \"This game is fun\" and \"I hate this game\" all the time. So, I'm glad they're not that complex so I'm just able to have fun here without having to deal with me being super fucking annoyed through the in-depth mechanics.\r\nThe other vehicles were good as well, none of them really made me hate them, but I usually sticked with the Extreme Gear, so I'll plan to use them when I try to play the other modes of speed.\r\nThe options for how fast you can go are good. I went for Sonic Speed and had fun with it; it was my way to go. I plan to test Super Sonic Speed to see how fast I could go, and if I would stick with it or keep going with Sonic Speed. It'll be cool.\r\nI also liked the Rival System they had here, and your mission to beat them. I did get my ass handed to them at times, like me losing to Egg Pawn twice as Amy, and losing to Shadow as Metal Sonic.\r\nYeah, it was embarrassing, since they were even at the highest level, but I was motivated to keep getting better, until I beat them.\r\nThe customization was neat, I liked it. I don't have much to say since I wasn't able to play around with it, but I was able to do so in the Open Network Test and I liked it.\r\nI also want to mention the items here, since this was one of my biggest issues with the ONT, since I felt the items were too unbalanced, since it felt like a lot of them felt like the \"random bullshit, go!\" meme, so I wanted them to be toned down in power, mainly the attack ones, since they did a lot of shit.\r\nI do think they did a good job here, since they don't feel THAT overwhelming compared to their ONT counterpart, I still think they have the random bullshit feeling, but I think I'll need to get used to it since if you nerf them too much, they'll just be useless to use. I want to keep seeing how they are in online matches since that was where I felt the random bullshit feeling there, so I hope to see if that feeling is still there, or is less emphasized, but still there to keep the Online Matches having the \"chaotic, but fun\" feeling I had with Crossworlds.\r\nThe online here was good, I think it's annoying that I sometimes get disconnected, but it's whatever. I want to play more of it since I wasn't able to play all that much from the ONT since it was mainly playing on the Joker Festival.\r\nSpeaking of the Festivals (having to speak for the ONT and the not the final game, but I like them, but I do wish there was more things here, but I didn't hate it. I also wasn't a fan of not being able to do the regular online. I get wanting to focus on the festival but let me have the option to play the regular online way.\r\nI want to mention the set of character here, I wasn't expecting much, but the guest characters baffled the fuck out of me.\r\nHatsune Miku!??!????!?!, Joker!?, Ichiban!?, SPONGEBOB AND PATRICK!? MINECRAFT STEVE!?!?!?!?! NIGHTS!?!?!?!?! AIAI!??!!??!?! TANGLE AND WHISPER?!?!??!?!?!??!?!!?!?!!?!?!!??!?!??! NINE, RUSTY ROSE, DREAD, AND WEREHOG!?!?!?!?! PAC-MAN!? MEGA-MAN!?!??!?!?\r\nThese are characters I did not expect to see here (except for Nights, SpongeBob, and Whisper since they had things that leaked their existence, SpongeBob had leaked gameplay, Nights was the back of the games box, and Whisper's Extreme Gear got leaked.\r\nEven with those leaks, I was excited to see them here, even though some of these are characters I haven't played their series (I own Y0 DC, but I don't have a Switch 2 yet.)\r\nI do hope they can the P3MC, Will, Aigis, Lupin III (Sega owns TMS it's a possibility), and maybe another Capcom character could join, maybe Ryu, Dante, Vergil, Nero, or Nico (it'd be funny af with her using the van).\r\nI doubt it'd happen, but if Mega Man could show up\r\nThe sonic characters were good, it's a lot more than the characters they added in TSR, at least, I hope they can add more of them, that'll be cool. I really want to see Marine, Surge, Kit, and more here.\r\nAs much as I love the characters they have here, but I have one issue.\r\nWhere the fuck is the voice acting for some of the characters?\r\nI can get it for characters like SpongeBob, but why are characters that Sega owns lack voice acting? They can just reuse voice acting if they don't feel like rerecording them. It's not going to be that hard, RIGHT SEGA?\r\nI still like them showing up, I wish they can have voices for the Sega characters.\r\nEspecially Werehog, it's super lame that Roger doesn't have a chance to do a voice for him, it'd be cool.\r\nSpeaking the voice acting here, it's neat. I do think it could be better.\r\nI do think that these VAs are good, I think some of them are stuck by weird direction, I think the thread that was made on Twitter on how to improve voice direction does a good job on how to improve it, except I would probably just replace Mike and Karen, really weird for Mike to call kids that die in a genocide to be \"collateral damage\" and Karen just doesn't sound that great, alongside with her questionable views on vaccines, and other shit like that.\r\nAnyway, before I end this review, the OST is good. I liked it. I like the lock in of the third lap for Kronos Island, I felt like the Neuron activated meme when I heard it. I wish the Third Lap song for Water Palace was better, but I think it's a massive not my cup of tea song, so hopefully someone likes it more than me.\r\nOverall, I liked Sonic Racing: Crossworlds, I had a lot of fun with it.\r\nDo I think it's worth $70?\r\nFUCK NO.\r\nIt should be $40-50.\r\nBut when it goes on sale, then I'd say go for it, it's a fun time.\r\nAlso, this was a 3-day late birthday gift to me, so that was cool.",

The racing feels quite different than Mario Kart, but once you get the hang of it, it's very fluid and rewarding. There's a ton of content to keep me interested while playing solo, and it's a great local multiplayer game as well. I wasn't prepared to pay full price for this game (Sega WHY did you make it $70 😭) but it going on sale after I tried (and enjoyed) the demo for a few hours was more than enough to convince me.\r\n\r\nThis also runs surprisingly well on Steam Deck given that the game uses Unreal Engine.

There is no way to play online multiplayer without weapons. Not even a boost only mode. Every race comes down to spamming random items and whoever ends up in the lead at the finish line is basically the lucky one. Yes, skill does factor in some but the ranks aren't really based upon actual skill, but rather time invested into playing. \r\n\r\nOther than that, the game is very good. It's visually beautiful, the sound effects and music are dope. It feels decent mechanically. I do not like turning into the boats, however. The boats seem kinda buggy or janky in some way. Sometimes I just cant turn in them and run into the wall and there's nothing I can do about it. \r\n\r\nI also don't like these festivals that go on periodically because it forces you to play the game in certain ways and if you don't want to do that, well then too bad. You have to, or simply not play at all. \r\n\r\nThe worst part BY FAR is the randomness, though. It almost feels like it's not even worth it to try to race perfectly... hitting every line, every boost, perfect drifts, etc.  None of that technical precision matters when you are going to get anally assaulted by random weapon at the worst possible moment, guaranteed. Or get attacked 2 or 3 times in a row while your opponents are spamming. \r\n\r\nIt's fun to play as long as you don't take it too seriously, I guess. I don't see this as a real competitive game due to its random nature.",

Right now, I have bought a single-player game, if I don't have a VPN.\n\nThese are minor nitpicks:\n- No HDR :(\n- UE5. When lighting is pure white (it is noticeable on sunny maps), all game models, map, player models and everything has plastic look to it, models look like plastic if to be exact.\n- UE5. I wish for portals to not look blurred. They start to load when you enter them, but before you enter them, they look like a giant blur. My settings are on High with 150% rendering scale. I have spare processing power to load them earlier. Would be nice to have more freedom with the settings :(\n- When you finish a mission and it shows you progression, menu's animation are way too slow and you have to wait even more before you can click a button to continue. It is a minor nitpick, but when you upgraded your gadget, won against a rival and you won a Grand Prix, the wait time for each thing is stacked on top of each other. In other areas, it is exceptionally noticeable when you enter Online for the first time - you are greeted with free NPCs, stickers, music. Ichiban, Joker, Miku, Miku's music, Sonic Adventure sticker and you have several seconds with each one of them before you can click to close the menu. It is just a minor annoyance that stops the flow.\n\nOverall, game is really good and awesome, I really love it.

      "review": "If this game was $40, I would recommend it. Being $70 for the base game sets the expectations way higher, and this doesn't meet them. To start, if you grind for tickets (which are used to unlock cosmetics and vehicle parts) just playing normally, even getting first place you get around 35 tickets per race (doing rivals at 70 tickets per 3 races you win). To unlock everything in the game you need around 240,000 of these tickets. It is ridiculously grindy just for that.\r\n\r\nThe networking and online is in an abysmal state. No other game I have played recently has ever had the amount of networking issues this game has. Constant server disconnects and with finding a lobby, then map selection, then readying up. Even if everybody is fast at selecting and readying up, you're still looking at about 3-4 minutes of wait time per 1 race which averages about 2 minutes for 3 laps. So imagine how frustrating it is when you get into a match and then 3/4 of the way through you get disconnected back to main screen?\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is fun enough and fast-paced, but if you are looking for a multi-player game that is similar to Mario Kart, then you should look elsewhere for this price point.\r\n\r\nA couple nitpicks is to have the option to turn off or get rid of the main theme song with the lyrics that starts being spammed when you beat the Grand Prix for the first time, it's awful and should just remain as the regular instrumental version. Also, if the crossworlds-only maps such as the casino level could be selectable as full maps, that would be much better. I don't see why so many crossworlds levels are not their own maps considering you really only do 1 lap of a race on the base level before going through portals and having it wildly change by lap 3.",

In this case, though... Skill really doesn't mean much of anything, and \"luck\" (read; powerful catch-up items being doled out at extremely high rates) accounts for far too much of the outcome.\n\nAnd if you think they're going to put out a balance patch at any point to responsibly fix any of the myriad issues that plague the game, I'll just point out now that two months in, I think, not a single even minor balance patch of any kind has been dropped.\n\nEvery time I turn the game on, any sense of joy or whimsy I have is steadily sucked away from me until I can't bear to play it any longer and begrudgingly turn it back off for another week.

It was so fun progressing to playing the highest speed and slowly discovering the meta from watching time trial runs just to learn my favorite technique from Mariokart 8 (the original) and F-Zero GX, that being snaking, has made its way into Crossworlds and is fun as hell. Let me tell you there is no feeling skillfully playing time trials going 255+ km/h down a racetrack while carefully timing straightaway drifts into turns. There is no other game that has gotten my blood pumping this much, I love this game to death.\n\nNow is the point where you are asking why my review is negative. Well, imaginary reader, that is because the highest speed in the video game is not available online (even in private lobbies).\n\nFuck me, okay. fuck. okay. Let me play online anyways.\n\nAndddd nevermind. Online is terribly slow, I'm pretty sure regional matchmaking is nonexistent and the netcode  can only be described as dogwater. Doesn't help that consoles are matched with PC with no option to change it.\n\nBack to offline then...\n\nSo yeah, time trials. That's it. That's all that's fun about this game, Grand Prix gets real boring real quick. I'm still going to play this game for now, this is just really disappointing.\n\nsmall side note\n\nSome guy on reddit did the math to actually %100 the game and you need like over 1.3 million of Crossworld's \"Tickets\" which you get simply by racing but no more than like 25 per race. So quickly chugging some numbers assuming one race is like 2.7 minutes that is well over two thousand hours to actually complete this game assuming all that time is spent on Grand Prix and that you WIN every time.\n\nYeah, I have a high tolerance for video game BS but that is too much (I %100 Sonic Frontiers, game is also pretty dogwater)",

This hyped me up for both games and influenced my decision to purchase this game.\n\nHowever, it turns out Pac-Man will not appear in Sonic Racing Crossworlds until at least Q1 2026, despite being leaned on heavily for marketing purposes. As I feel significantly misled by these marketing messages, I’m leaving a downvote.\n\nRegarding the game itself, it’s actually a damn good karting game. Finally someone is giving Mario Kart a run for its money. You need to progress somewhat in the game, by unlocking parts and customizing your kart/plate, before it gets good.\n\nThe intro theme song is highly cringe, and they probably should have just hired Patrick Stump like everyone else is doing these days, but you’ll get past it. The lack of voice acting for crossover characters (Sponge Bob etc) is also somewhat disappointing. But these are relatively minor issues.\n\nIs this value for the money at this price point? Almost certainly not. You can easily beat all grand prixes in 6-7 hours and by then you’ve seen everything there is to see. But if you like kart racers and have money to burn, you know what to do.",

      "review": "I was extremely hyped for CrossWorlds, after playing both the Open Network Test (ONT) and the demo. However, the full release disappointed me in a multitude of ways. I do not recommend buying this game at full price. I believe it should be thirty dollars, forty at most, and should've released in a much more finished state than it currently is in.\n\nMy issues are as follows: \n\nTerrible netplay (Playing with 4 players in your squad seems to be nearly impossible. I don't know if it's a crossplay issue, a network issue, or just the game, but it NEEDS to be fixed. I literally cannot play with more than 3 players, and even then, I can barely play with three. Two is also a challenge, with me or the other person getting disconnected every few matches, or sometimes even after every single match.)\n\nUnfinished game state (There are a lot of notable bugs. The game also completely lacks a story mode, unlike in the previous Sonic racing game, Team Sonic Racing. You may think this doesn't matter much, but given the fact that Dodon Pa is back in this game, and characters make various comments about him/about the race tracks that elude to a story being present, it is extremely strange that there is zero story mode/story-adjacent modes in this game. You get to the credits after beating every Grand Prix, much like Mario Kart or other such games. It feels very unrewarding, as someone who expected more. There are also VERY FEW voicelines for every character, with each character repeating the same voiceline over twelve times per race in my estimate, and with some characters, such as the Werehog, not even having a voice at all. This is also extremely disappointing to me. Especially since the Werehog is the pre-order bonus, causing me to feel ripped off, in a way. I paid for the Digital Deluxe version of this game. I did have high hopes for it, and I did expect it to be good.)\n\nTerrible jukebox implementation (I am VERY passionate about music. This game pissed me off with the way they implemented the jukebox; you can only set playlists as custom tracks for each lap, NOT individual songs, and the only way to really get individual songs is to \"favorite\" a song, which even then, you can only have ONE playlist of \"favorite songs\", making it extremely tedious to get any sort of order in your jukebox usage. For example, if you wanted to listen to the original Metal Harbor song on Metal Harbor, you would have to favorite Metal Harbor from the SA2 soundtrack, then set your \"favorites\" playlist as the BGM for a lap. But if you have ANY other songs than just Metal Harbor, it'll screw it up and cycle through all the songs in the playlist randomly/shuffled instead. You cannot choose songs individually. You cannot choose songs specifically, either. Also, you can only unlock songs from doing Time Trials, which I find incredibly annoying as someone who doesn't enjoy that game mode in the slightest. I feel as if there is a very big missed opportunity to implement a shop system, one where you can spend your Dodon Pa Tickets to buy tracks, gadgets, ETC, but that just doesn't exist in the game. ALSO, you cannot even rewind, skip, or pause jukebox songs. It is overall terribly implemented and should've been handled with much more care.)\n\nLack of game modes (It's very, very straightforward what you can do currently. Either go offline to play Time Trials, Grand Prix, or Race Park, or go online to play World Match or Friend Match. Friend Match is an issue in itself. It is unfortunately the only online gamemode that won't disconnect you every 5 seconds, which seriously shouldn't be the case, but it is. This means that, if you want to have a smooth experience in online multiplayer, you are forced to play in a custom lobby, most likely with bots filling in for the 8 or so extra friends you probably don't have on standby. Worst of all, you have the option to enable Rival Teams in this mode, but only the HOST will be able to receive the vehicle rewards for beating the rival teams, which pretty much defeats the point of doing it for anyone else in the lobby. Why did SEGA make the game like this?)\n\nTimed DLC (This is more of a personal issue. But, the fact that we have to wait for DLC characters & stages to come out, some for MONTHS, it just makes the game feel like it isn't even ready to be released yet. I know that maybe to some this is just seen as a marketing strategy, or a way to build up hype, but to me, it comes across as lazily delivered content that isn't ready for release and should've been kept in the oven longer.)\n\nOverall, I am really enjoying Sonic Racing CrossWorlds after overcoming my initial huge, blaring problems with it, as well as accustoming myself to the gameplay style, and getting cosmetic mods to make the game less disappointing, but that long list of requirements I just listed should NOT be essential for enjoying the game. You should be able to enjoy it right out of the box, no? \n\nI think that Sonic Racing CrossWorlds could be an amazing game, if it were given longer to be developed, and had a bit more thought put into it. There is clearly a lot of ambition within this project, and a lot they aimed to achieve, but it ultimately falls flat in some crucial ways that are, frankly, hard to recover from. I sincerely hope it will get updates that fix all of my issues with it; that is my biggest hope for now.",

      "review": "This game is decently fun, first and foremost. If money is not an issue, then go for it by all means. But I do not recommend this game. This game is $70 for just the base game. If you want the \"season pass\" with all the unique characters from other franchises, it is an additional $20-30... This game is nowhere near fun enough to justify a $100 post-tax price tag. \n\nI love racing games, especially games in the kart racing niche. I loved MK8D the most, and as someone that felt let down by MKW, I was ~hoping~ to find this as a replacement. Finding out it would cost $70 SUCKED, especially when it was advertised against MKW. BUT then I find out that this price point is only for half the content.\n\nAlso, I mentioned the game is decently fun. I know I didn't play much (because I'd like my refund), but I do tend to get a feel for how \"good\" a kart racing game feels pretty quickly. This one feels better than a lot of games you could get on steam, sure, but this is still not up to snuff with the Mario Kart series. Comparatively, the cars feel bulky, the risk-reward for shortcuts feels unaligned, the items don't feel overly balanced, etc. I don't think they are bad, they're just okay. And for $100, I don't want my kart racer to feel just okay. \n\nI'm sure the reviews will stay super high for this game and I'm fine with that, I just think these are critiques worth airing out.",

      "review": "OK HOLD ON! It's a good game. Like it's fundamentally a good game, I think. But in my opinion, it's plagued by the lack of polishing and no one is talking about it. The price/content ratio is not great.\n\nThe game is fun, the base stuff you expect from a karting game is good: the amount of vehicles, the roster, the tracks (really good tracks), etc. The crossworld gimmick is fine but you'll realize it's a bit forgettable although it gives you an incentive to be first before 2nd lap so you get to choose the crossworld you want. I like the same stuff as other people do.\n\nBut it feels unfinished for everything that's outside of gameplay. Now don't get me wrong: what the game offers is fine. But for that price tag? No, it absolutely doesn't. Let me give you a list of what is wrong in this game:\n\n- The progression system\nThe game has a very boring and uninspired progression system. Most unlockables are through using the in-game currency. Gears, decals, wheels, everything. There is zero incentive to play other characters, other types of cars, or do particular things like using a certain gadget or achieving anything in particular. There's so many cars and characters, it's daunting to try all of them and the game doesn't have any milestones or incentives for that. Only content unlocked outside of that is the AI racers' cars that you unlock through beating the racers.\nThere's a friendship system that gives you character specific rewards (decal of that character, etc.) and you become friends... by giving them tickets. Which is SO boring (and kinda weird when you think about it).\n\n- The game has no skins.\nFor $70, I simply don't like that. Extreme gears are finally back and characters don't even have their Riders skin. But we have that awful AI skin (an edgy monochromous recolor), I guess so a skin system in the game is already there. I find it baffling that the AI skin is what we got. It's just the worst set of cosmetics ever imo. They have no voices, just cyberized grunts and I can't recommend downloading the cyberized AI voices mod enough. It gives AI racers their original voice with a robot filter. It's stunning work. Skins could have been friendship unlockables or rewards for playing with extreme gears (for Riders costumes for example). Having so many cars but no skins just doesn't sit right with me, I'm sorry. Not at that price. In the era of cosmetics in video games, releasing a game that could have so many cosmetics feels like a huge fumble especially when you look at Sonic mobile games that are literal museums of unlockable skins for free.\n\n- The voice acting philosophy\nOne of the few issues people mentioned: DLC characters aren't voiced, not even Sega characters. There's no justification for this. I have no reason to play Joker if he doesn't say anything. You could just reskin any DLC with a mod for free since they don't speak. Even Werehog has no voice. Like, please. This is so unacceptable for that price. Also, they spent so much time on the rivalry thing with the voice lines and the banter but I didn't feel it was that impactful. It's very corny and it doesn't happen online. It's an offline feature in Grand Prix. However, characters only have very few grunts and it's SO irritating. When you trick, characters always do the exact same grunt or say the same thing 100% of the time. You trick 50 times per race, you hear the same shit 50 times per race. It's so irritating to the point there were mods day one to mute that. Some characters have very irritating voice lines like Rouge. Sonic goes \"good good good good, good nice, good, good nice\" omg SHUT UP!\n\n- The BGM can't be assigned to stages.\nYou can unlock so many songs from so many earlier games but they only work in a playlist. You make a playlist and each song will be assigned to each lap regardless of the stage. You can't assign a song to a stage. Completely pointless.\n\n- The offline content is too light.\n You have the Grand Prix, the park with some challenges but nothing crazy really. No real solo mode and it looks like a game that's made mostly for the online, but...\n\n- The online mode has NOTHING either.  \nYou just join a lobby, do one race (you can vote out of three + one random track among the three options), you play it and it's over. Thanks for playing! It's not a Grand Prix, there's no way to use the different gadgets to adapt to your opponent throughout the course of a GP like in offline. Oh that track? I'll use that build! Oh my opponents are playing a certain build, maybe I should take something else to adapt. No, doesn't exist. It's one track and you don't get to change your gadgets to the track because the track is selected once the race is starting. It's just one random race for fun and that's it. Also, another detail, when you finish the race, you don't see the time for completion. It's such a staple in racing games and yet...\nThere's an endorsement system but you can only endorse a player (teammate or opponent)... before the race. Not after. What's the point? There are also emotes to say \"hi!\", \"bye\", \"no!\", \"yes!\", \"oh!\" but they can only be used in the lobby. Again, what's the point? Why would I say \"YES!\" in a lobby with no chat anyway? However, playing online grants good rewards like auras and unique gadgets and it's a very good incentive.\nServers flop all the time. You get disconnected very often but this will hopefully be fixed.\n\n- World Match is disabled during events.\nIt lasts three days so it's alright I guess, but people don't like it. Don't force stuff like that on people. Also the rewards for Hatsune's festival are just stickers and a honk. It's just giving free battlepass on a mobile game. At least give her one outfit or something, those work so much better. However, Festival is really fun imo, it makes the competition less redundant and I hope to see tweaks to regular races like that more often. You don't need to solely rely on being first place to win.\n\n- The tutorial is garbage and lacking.\nIt's a racing game so there's nothing crazy about the game works but the tutorial is a bunch of little GIFs with a caption. As a teacher, I find this type of tutorial really ass for new players because you don't get to practice in a race. You have to memorize THEN play. Also we still don't know what stats are fully about. There are five and no one knows for sure what Power does. Weird game design choice here.\n\n- Nitpicking, the game's colorful but there's a very dull filter over the game and it looks a bit grey and washed out on some tracks (Apotos/Bikini Bottom/Kronos Island/Mine). I don't know why they did that. There's quite a lack of shadows in the game as well. Look at when the racers enter the track. There are no shadows around their cars. Now the game runs very well but on PC, I'd expect to have better graphics settings for those who can afford it (and it's not me lol)\n\n- There's clunkiness to the game.\nThe air tricks are tied to the same buttons as directions and sometimes you can trick, sometimes you can't but you have to move the stick if it works and it's a bit off putting sometimes. Apparently they eased  out trick animations... but only on Silver. It was not applied to every character apparently.\nThe controls are fine by themselves. Even the main menu UI doesn't feel very well thought out.\n\n- We still don't know how the game will be supported outside of their voiceless DLCs. Right now, being purposefully last to get the drill item to go from 12th to 1st is a very viable strat. A clear meta may be found (edit: as of November at least, the meta was going full drift build and people are already sick of it lmao) but I hope the devs will address and shake things up or it will remain a very casual arcade game and I personally want it to be more than that. Just an opinion.\n\nNow, reread this, realize the game is $70 with free DLCs sure, but with no voices, and a $30 SP. With no voices either. It's $100. For this lack of polish, it's simply unacceptable. Unacceptable.",

      "review": "I will TRY TO keep this review short and sweet. \r\n\r\nI do not recommend the game primarily because of the fact that whoever wins a match is blind luck, every race. There is no way to play online multiplayer without weapons. Not even a boost only mode. Every race comes down to spamming random items and whoever ends up in the lead at the finish line is basically the lucky one. Yes, skill does factor in some but the ranks aren't really based upon actual skill, but rather time invested into playing. \r\n\r\nOther than that, the game is very good. It's visually beautiful, the sound effects and music are dope. It feels decent mechanically. I do not like turning into the boats, however. The boats seem kinda buggy or janky in some way. Sometimes I just cant turn in them and run into the wall and there's nothing I can do about it. \r\n\r\nI also don't like these festivals that go on periodically because it forces you to play the game in certain ways and if you don't want to do that, well then too bad. You have to, or simply not play at all. \r\n\r\nThe worst part BY FAR is the randomness, though. It almost feels like it's not even worth it to try to race perfectly... hitting every line, every boost, perfect drifts, etc.  None of that technical precision matters when you are going to get anally assaulted by random weapon at the worst possible moment, guaranteed. Or get attacked 2 or 3 times in a row while your opponents are spamming. \r\n\r\nIt's fun to play as long as you don't take it too seriously, I guess. I don't see this as a real competitive game due to its random nature.",

So I attempted to refund the game but was refused because I had put more than 2 hours into the game, now I have to delete my game save, start again AND my online rank has persisted meaning I am still my same rank meaning I cannot get the rewards for those ranks again meaning I will be missing those items FOREVER, unless this is addressed which Sega have shown no sign of doing, leaving me crippled in a competitive online game. Fun. The worst part of it all? I have no idea what caused the corrpution so I could start again crippled but I have no way of knowning if and/or when it might corrupt my save again put me further and further onto a back foot.

Which country is blocked so far? Russia. This is the reason for negative review.\nBut will I get a game ban for avoiding a geolocation ban? Who knows. Right now, I have bought a single-player game, if I don't have a VPN.\n\nThese are minor nitpicks:\n- No HDR :(\n- UE5. When lighting is pure white (it is noticeable on sunny maps), all game models, map, player models and everything has plastic look to it, models look like plastic if to be exact.\n- UE5. I wish for portals to not look blurred. They start to load when you enter them, but before you enter them, they look like a giant blur. My settings are on High with 150% rendering scale. I have spare processing power to load them earlier. Would be nice to have more freedom with the settings :(\n- When you finish a mission and it shows you progression, menu's animation are way too slow and you have to wait even more before you can click a button to continue. It is a minor nitpick, but when you upgraded your gadget, won against a rival and you won a Grand Prix, the wait time for each thing is stacked on top of each other. In other areas, it is exceptionally noticeable when you enter Online for the first time - you are greeted with free NPCs, stickers, music. Ichiban, Joker, Miku, Miku's music, Sonic Adventure sticker and you have several seconds with each one of them before you can click to close the menu. It is just a minor annoyance that stops the flow.\n\nOverall, game is really good and awesome, I really love it. But I can not play multiplayer, developers have not made it clear or even subtle that there might be something preventing me from playing the game and connecting to their servers.",

      "review": "Sadly, there's a ton I don't like about this game. It's still fun to play with friends, but - for such a high price - this game is a letdown. That being said, let me focus on the negatives:\n\n-----\n\n** Audio **\n\nSound effects suck. They are noisy as hell, and there is no background ambience. Muting the music results in a dead silent main menu, which is just extremely lazy. Putting together a basic stereo background audio asset for a company that certainly already has a huge audio library shouldn't even take an hour...\n\nThe music is a repetitive mess. Though the main theme and its main motif are catchy, all music feels over-hyped, with a ton of it sounding like 16-bar loops that a music student put together in a bedroom studio...\n\n** AI Players **\n\nWhy are high-level \"Rival\" AIs essentially cheating the game? Couldn't the devs simply design AI that's genuinely challenging without having to resort to cheats? Playing against AI feels... cheap as hell.\n\n\"Rival\" AIs recover from hits extremely fast, seem to be speed up to unreasonable speeds to catch up when left behind, and drive over off-bounds areas (e.g. grass) boost-less without any sort of penalty (e.g. slowing down). Also, non-\"Rival\" AIs seem to NEVER target the \"Rival\" AI - they often hold onto their items and slam them on me as soon as I'm between them and the \"Rival\" AI.\n\n** Menu Flow **\n\nThe menu is not the worst - don't get me wrong - but there are issues with the NUX (New User Experience) in this game. I have friends over for dinner and games every now and then. The first time we played, it took us 2 hours to figure out how to add gadgets to the gadget cards - then, randomly after some Cup, a tutorial notification popped up teaching us how to do it... lmao.\n\n** Characters **\n\nWhy do all characters sound annoying af? They all behave and sound like 12-year-olds trying to play it cool. That in itself is not a problem - but why all of them? I'm honestly tired of hearing squeaker voices going \"YoU dArE cHaLlEnGe Me? hA! YoU wIlL nEvEr BeAt mE!!1!1!!1\" or \"HuH, YoU JuSt GoT LuCkY. ThAT'sAlL\" every few minutes.\n\nCan we also address the ultra-expensive DLC characters that are just dead-silent? Take Joker (Persona 5), for example: SEGA could've literally just supplied some voice lines from the Persona 5 game and called it a day - but they didn't even do that, which is a f-ing joke. In fact, for the asked price, the least they could've done is hired alt voice actors for a few voice lines...\n\n-----\n\nI'm only keeping this game because I haven't found another decent kart game on Desktop yet. Love the Crash Team Racing games, but unfortunately the currenty publisher somehow had what I'm assuming to be a severe stroke and didn't release the latest entry for Desktop platforms.",

      "review": "If there's one thing I dislike about Sonic Racing Crossworlds, it's gotta be the festivals.\n\nI missed the first one (Hatsune Miku) because I wasn't aware that it was going on (thanks for not announcing that on Steam) and all the stuff I wanted from it became unavailable to me, really hammering in that FOMO mindset that sucks every bit of fun out of any game. I started treating the game like a job for the next two festivals until I realised that I wasn't having fun. I haven't touched the game in over a month now.\n\nI wouldn't mind them if I was able to obtain the festival stuff in single player (like the bond system, though it's ridiculously expensive, that's another issue) and be able to play regular multiplayer while the festivals were going on. I can't even begin to imagine how much worse this is for the people who play on consoles and have to PAY to play online to unlock all the festival stuff.\n\nThe fact that I went from pre-ordering the deluxe edition because I liked what little I got to play to not playing it a all really goes to show just how badly the festivals ruined my enjoyment of the whole package. At least it's not a battle pass (well it is, but it's free and lasts less than a week).",

Where's the cosmetic shop, what do I do with all these tokens besides cosmetics????~\nThose are the questions I had when playing. I didn't get that answer, instead I got a Mario Kart 8 clone. \n\nNow don't get me wrong I wasn't being ironic when I was saying I was having fun, it really is a fun game, the courses are a well designed, the character selection is basically all you'd ever want (though more alt skins would be nice please), the music is better than I thought (that's the one surprise I got when playing after the Open Network Test) and the controls are pretty good too. Driving is awesome, driving on water is my favourite way of playing and flying is kinda eeehhh.. pretty janky even after the ONT, I think they should've gone the Sonic All Stars Racing Transformed approach with drifting. \nI also liked the item balancing actually, dark chao is the only confusing addition but maybe that's because I don't like hording items.\n\nThere's just those little additions and changes you could make to make this game truly worth £65 because right now I can only see it being worth £20, this is your issue SEGA and Sonic Team and nobody is buying your game FULL PRICE if it comes out like this.\n\nMy conclusion is: I can't honestly see a reason for you to buy this unless you're a diehard Sonic fan or if you want a Mario Kart that isn't MK World. Otherwise you should steal this off your IRL friends in the family share and try it out.\n\nAlso this game is like £30 on CDKeys.",

      "review": "If this game was $40, I would recommend it. Being $70 for the base game sets the expectations way higher, and this doesn't meet them. To start, if you grind for tickets (which are used to unlock cosmetics and vehicle parts) just playing normally, even getting first place you get around 35 tickets per race (doing rivals at 70 tickets per 3 races you win). To unlock everything in the game you need around 240,000 of these tickets. It is ridiculously grindy just for that.\r\n\r\nThe networking and online is in an abysmal state. No other game I have played recently has ever had the amount of networking issues this game has. Constant server disconnects and with finding a lobby, then map selection, then readying up. Even if everybody is fast at selecting and readying up, you're still looking at about 3-4 minutes of wait time per 1 race which averages about 2 minutes for 3 laps. So imagine how frustrating it is when you get into a match and then 3/4 of the way through you get disconnected back to main screen?\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is fun enough and fast-paced, but if you are looking for a multi-player game that is similar to Mario Kart, then you should look elsewhere for this price point.\r\n\r\nA couple nitpicks is to have the option to turn off or get rid of the main theme song with the lyrics that starts being spammed when you beat the Grand Prix for the first time, it's awful and should just remain as the regular instrumental version. Also, if the crossworlds-only maps such as the casino level could be selectable as full maps, that would be much better. I don't see why so many crossworlds levels are not their own maps considering you really only do 1 lap of a race on the base level before going through portals and having it wildly change by lap 3.",

The game is egregiously unbalanced, with whole categories of characters (handling and power for example) being borderline worthless if you want to place above 8th or so with any frequency.\n\nSpeaking of unbalanced, the fact that there is only a single character belonging to the entire Boost category, is the perfect showcase of this issue that pervades the whole game.\n\nIn general, games of this genre are meant to be casual sorts of experiences, balancing luck and skill so that everyone can have fun. In this case, though... Skill really doesn't mean much of anything, and \"luck\" (read; powerful catch-up items being doled out at extremely high rates) accounts for far too much of the outcome.\n\nAnd if you think they're going to put out a balance patch at any point to responsibly fix any of the myriad issues that plague the game, I'll just point out now that two months in, I think, not a single even minor balance patch of any kind has been dropped.\n\nEvery time I turn the game on, any sense of joy or whimsy I have is steadily sucked away from me until I can't bear to play it any longer and begrudgingly turn it back off for another week.
