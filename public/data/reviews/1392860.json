      "review": "I don't see why this game is getting the hate that it is. I've played the previous Little Nightmares games (including the DLCs and Very Little Nightmares), read the comics, and have now finished this game's story. While Supermassive Games had some big shoes to fill in terms of my expectations, I'm still quite surprised at how well they emulated Tarsier Studios in terms of gameplay and design. I'll go ahead and breakdown my overall opinions on Little Nightmares 3, for what little they're worth.\n\n\n[h2] Pros [/h2]\n- Outstanding visuals: others have said it, but the devs nailed the look and feel of the world of Little Nightmares. From player character designs, to backgrounds, to monsters, everything looks as though it was taken straight from its predecessors' concept art.\n\n- Varied environments: the Spiral has a more hodgepodge approach to its set dressing, especially compared to the previous games. Whereas the Maw and the Pale City were fairly homogeneous, taking place almost entirely within their respective enclosures, each area of the Spiral feels like a completely different part of the setting's world.\n\n- Interesting gimmicks: whether you choose Low or Alone, there are a number of instances throughout the levels where the player(s) will have to use the specific tools at their disposal to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles.\n\n- A pleasant story: I won't lie, I was entirely lost in terms of what anything meant in Little Nightmares 3, up until the right near the ending, where everything seemed to finally click. Aside from the story told in cutscene form, it is also told through the interactions our two main characters share. It's plain to see how much they care for one another, and emotions are portrayed very clearly despite lacking any real dialogue.\n\n[h2] Cons [/h2]\n- Inconsistent AI: The greatest hurdle preventing enjoyment of the game is easily how rough the partner AI can be. I played this game solo (and as such, I'm sure that this con does not apply in multiplayer; however, the lack of split-screen co-op is another point of contention), and so I relied greatly on the AI for the many puzzles that require both players. While there were certain points in the game where I was pleasantly amused by how smart the AI was, there were twice as many times where I'd be forced to return to a prior checkpoint because my AI companion didn't want to follow me through a hole in the wall, or refused to help tear down a plank of wood as an enemy bore down on us.\n\n- Cost/Playtime ratio: As you can see by my played time, it only took me 4 hours to beat LN3. This includes running around when a puzzle solution wasn't readily apparent, multiple deaths while doing so, and restarting due to the aforementioned glitchy AI. Even counting Very Little Nightmares, it could be argued that this is the shortest entry of the series. I find it hard to justify a $40 purchase of this game to anyone other than a diehard Little Nightmares groupie.\n\n- Unclear progression: the aforementioned con is particularly glaring if you consider that there are multiple spots in each chapter where the way to progress is just not apparent at all. Certain gaps and cracks can be difficult (or even impossible) to see thanks to poor camera placement, missed grabs lead you to believe that a particular object isn't interactive, and at times the AI will simply ignore any command you give it to shoot/smash something or give you a boost.\n\n\n[h1] OVERALL SCORE: 3.5/5 [/h1]\n\n\ntl;dr - get this game on a 25% or more sale, you're welcome",

      "review": "[h1] 8/10 + Spoiler free review (until the end) [/h1]\n\nFinished the game last night, and just wanted to throw my two cents in, before work. I've played the first two, and I wasn't going to buy this until Christmas. But the influx of negative reviews is what really made me check this out. Especially from my terminally online brother. Surely it couldn't be [b] THAT [/b] bad, right? Needless to say, it wasn't!\n\nI wouldn't bother leaving a review, if so many of the negative reviews weren't borderline baseless. It's not disengaging, and it isn't devoid of depth. Even though the first two present theirs better (in my opinion), the third game clearly has a story to follow. Half of the reviews I've seen are fans moping about the series being \"ruined,\" and the studio change being a dramatic stake through its heart. That would make sense, if one, Halloween wasn't over. And two, the flaws they're so worked up about made a genuinely bad game. Which they didn't. \n\nBoth the core gameplay and visual storytelling feel almost flawlessly identical to the previous entries. To the point that, if the change in studio wasn't public, I'd wager 90% of players wouldn't notice. And the designs of the enemies felt more original than they did uninspired, which was a welcome relief.\n\nThe reviews that provide actual criticism, like the recycling of previous puzzles and mechanics, are sadly few and far between. While I like the game, I also think there's more to uncover, both story and gameplay-wise. Hopefully, the DLC ties everything together.\n\nOverall, this is nowhere near the [b] nightmare [/b] I was described. Could it have been better at launch, like the first two? Of course. But I had fun playing, especially with a friend. And I think I'll try to have even more fun piecing together the new lore! Maybe.\n\n8/10\n\nSPOILER(?):\n[spoiler] And maybe we can have a happy ending? One day? Please? Please. Please... [/spoiler]",

Very clear example in the first map my umbrella bugged at a certain point and we had to play from the start cause there is no way to go back to a previous save or to fix the bug, so the level was basically impossible for us to do. \n\nStorywise the game is not there. It's just imagination with a bit of lore, you don't get a sense of deep connection like the first 2 games. \n\nThe only appeal to the series was the sense of nostalgia that some of the rooms or scenes give you.\n\nI'll wait for the DLCs and hope they make something out of them.",

The in game locations are well desinged and the atmosphere is just as good as it was in the previous games. \nI also loved that the first Boss of the game was taken from the Artbook of LN II and the fourth and fifth bosses also appear in the Podcast. The Bossfights and chase scence might not be on the same Level as in LN II but they are close to it. Although, one of my favourite chase scence out of all the games was the final one with the KIn in Chapter four of LN III.\nGameplaywise the game has improved some of the flaws the previous games had. There were less bugs even befor the patch and the AI in this game generally worked better than the Six AI. They also found a new and improved way to add some small combat scenes into the game. The cooperative nature of these fight scenes make them much less frustrating than the fight scenes with the Bullies in LN II or the Shadow Children in the RK DLC. \n\nI can definitely recomend this game and I can´t wait for what´s more to come!",

I was excited to play this game. rip my bank account- but i did really like that my friend didn't also have to spend $50, however maybe my friend shoulve payed me money... I digress. Uhhh i kinda forgot why i was writing this. Ok so, review right- Come on guys lets do a shallow dive into the hit game little nightmares 3!\r\n\r\nTo start off I'd like to say it took me and my friend 9 heckin hours to complete this game, however I assume nobody else has the skill issues we have. Originally we played the game near release which is obviously when it was very buggy, bugs. everywhere. So at one of the chase scenes we spent a whole like hour and half being idiots not realizing it was glitched. Therefore we basically are better than you and played the game on extra super hard mode... and it was actually incompletable so we had to go back and start the chapter over again after a week or two... I think normal people can probably do this game faster is what im saying- however maybe if u wanna get your money's worth i'd recommend playing it with an idiot (hi its me your local idiot) because we will definitely make the time stretch out.  \r\n\r\nOverall i cant even remember anything that happened, i remember basically the plot of mary poppins. \r\n...\r\nok maybe i only remember an umbrella BUT that was epic and HEARTBREAKING that they didn't let us umbrella all up over the place. \r\n\r\nalso candy and also teeth. I think that sums up the environment. \r\n\r\nI really liked the past little nightmares games and thought \"no way epic they're making a third\" and it was epic. However, out of the other two absolutely peak games, this one is the least peak. I mean I still enjoyed it, but if ur mr serious mr no fun mr gamer idk if you'd like it as much. \r\n\r\nStory wise, I am an idiot. I missed an insane plot point and my friend had to tell me what was going on, but once i did understand i was like ohhhh cool rad epic. I think this whole little story was silly and only slightly ruined my week. It was a nice extension of the little nightmares universe though im not entirely sure what happened tbh… but you know what? It was a game. A game i gamed. And a game i gamed poorly but still was able to game. And god dang it I gamed that game real game like!\r\n\r\nIdk the point of this review guys, i just think its really funny to write them while i procrastinate. \r\n\r\nLets seeee tldr? Yeah good game i really liked it and will probably play it again (with it hopefully not taking 9 hours) but if youre not a little nightmare hype man, then maybe wait for a sale??? I think it good, i like. U may not like. That ok. \r\n\r\nWait no- maybe its not okay… maybe ur supposed to like this game. Maybe if u dont think ur gonna like it buy it anyways. Buy it and play it and if u still dont like it play it again, and again, and again. Learn to like it. People put hard work into making this game for the little nightmares community okay??? So idc if u wait for a sale but you ARE gonna buy it and then youre gonna appreciate it and the art and effort that went into it. Ok? YOURE GOING TO PLAY THIS GAME. So have fun out there champ, and keep playing until youre hecking grateful. Anyways, i love you, i love this game, and you're gonna love it too",

      "review": "[h2]Rating: 3/5[/h2]\r\nI wasn’t exactly keen on hearing that another Little Nightmares game would be made after Tarsier ended things with LN2, and unfortunately, Little Nightmares III didn’t fully change my mind. As a long-time fan, the experience just didn’t match the feel of its predecessors. The time windows for actions are often extremely tight, leaving almost no room for error, and it’s not always clear where to go or what to do. The story also feels rather bland, without a clear sense of how the different areas connect—though that might be intentional.\r\n\r\nEnemy interactions are noticeably weaker too. I often found myself just waiting for [i]something that is basically a cutscene[/i] to finish in while doing very little gameplay-wise. I also struggled to get attached to Low and Alone, and the lack of couch co-op was a real letdown since I had planned to play with a friend.\r\n\r\nOn the positive side, the music, atmosphere, and visuals are absolutely stunning, I personally haven't had much trouble with the AI and the game doesn't feel clunky to play for the vast majority of the time. The new mechanics are fun to experiment with, and the characters' unique abilities have strong potential. Side note: the accessibilty features are quite useful and a nice addition for players who need them. Despite its flaws, I still enjoyed my playthrough overall, and I’m looking forward to the DLC in hopes of some meaningful improvements.",

I got this game as a birthday gift and was quite surprised by the negative reviews but i didn't want to judge the negative reviews straight away so i decided to try the game and i played it in Co-op.\r\n\r\nRight off i can say that the atmosphere is THERE, the proper atmosphere of the Little Nightmares franchise but a lot of the things seemed super reused, from mechanics to the music, to a bunch of other things, which is normal since the developers are not the same and i suppose they were trying to make the game as similar as the first and second one.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is nothing wrong with the artstyle, atmosphere and colors, they could have done a better job with the lighting since in some levels its almost impossible to see certain vents and holes you're supposed to reach, especially when you're being chased by the boss.\r\n\r\nTHE CONTROLS.. the controls were super annoying at times and often didn't work, there are tons and lots of bugs... a LOT of bugs.\r\n\r\nTHE STORY... this is a little bit hard to judge from a one person perspective but i must say for the majority of the game, i felt like i was running into nothing and nowhere, without much meaning or explanation. The beauty about LN 1 and 2 was that they not only explained the story of the character but they also explained the reality and the way our world is going in extremely creative ways, where as the LN 3 went for a more psychological way rather than explaining why things are the way they are or why they happened.\r\nI was expecting a continuation of Six' story and to understand what really happened, but i must say i was quite surprised to see the devs choosing completely new characters with their own stories. The big reveal and the ending was pretty interesting and cool but i kinda wish there was MORE to it, the game already did the big reveal quite early into the game and so afterwards you kinda already knew what was going to happen... in a way? Overall, i don't want to be negative about the game, it is still super fun to play in coop, not sure for singleplayer, the mechanics seem kinda pretty boring and super reused, only one mechanic i really really liked was the gift of the second sight.\r\n\r\nOverall, i like the design of the characters, monsters, artstyle and the atmosphere, but it feels super reused. They should have went for something new mechanic wise like what i mentioned, but overall, its a game anyone should try. Is it worth 40 euros though? ABSOLUTELY NOT! It really does feel like a scam on that part.. and seeing as how you need to pay an extra 15 euro for the upcoming chapters.. yeah no.\r\n\r\nI put it as recommended because i believe anyone should try the game, no matter the negatives, there could still be some beauty and fun in it. But i highly recommend that you try it in coop, its better that way, but it will never be nowhere near as fun and rewarding as LN 1 and 2.",

People acted like it’s some disaster, but when you actually play it, the core experience is solid. The atmosphere is still creepy and imaginative, the visual style is tight, and the world design carries that same unsettling “childhood nightmare” energy the series is known for. The sound work is on point, the environments feel alive, and the puzzles and they did that in a perfect way  . The co-op concept is actually a strong idea, and when it works, it brings a fresh dynamic that the older games never had , i really liked how smooth the coop actually is \n\n-Where the game actually drops the ball is the theme and the sound design along with the narrative of the event , its kinda sad  the one part that clearly didn’t reach the level fans expected is the strong structured narrative  It's  too thin, and doesn’t tie its ideas together in a satisfying way. you really have to do a full check out to understand the little details but other than then its good \n\n- the game is overpriced maybe it wouldve get less hate if the price was around 15-10 bucks \n\n-Outside of that? The game plays well, looks great, and nails the mood. It’s short, yeah, but so were the others. The hate mostly comes from expectations, not reality. LN3 is absolutely worth experiencing for its atmosphere, tension, and craftsmanship  the narrative just isn’t the highlight this time. Everything else? Rock solid. Overhated for sure.",

I hope DLC will brighten it up because out of all LN games now we have 2 with bad / sad ending and 1 with Dark Ending.\n\nIt's an okay game maybe a bit too expensive maybe the expansion pass that will take a year to come out is a bit overkill but I'm glad I got to goof off by being a tiny kid with a friend of mine. Something about the world interactions is just wholesome it still has that childish innocence that many of us forget about as we grow older and I think that's my fondest impression from the game. Nothing beats \"Hey'ing\" off with your friend or running across a hallway with a teddy or tossing candy at your friend.\n\nSo yeah I think it's not a bad game, it's another LN entry but I'd really prefer to start seeing things getting connected finally. \n\nSix is central character if I'm to evaluate it based on her role in LN1 and LN2, What about Mono? Is the Mono's ending truly the end for Mono? What about Low and Alone, I've been on this journey long enough that I'd like to start seeing connections.\n\nLets see what the DLC brings and unless you a big fan on Little Nightmares and Got a friend to play with maybe hold off on that one for a discount not like you lose much if you wait a year until all the content is out.\n\n(Also I'll admit we bought 2 copies not knowing Friend pass would be included. Not sure if it's a good or a bad message to the devs considering what I think about LN3)\n\nNOTE: I do hate the collectibles whole-heartedly I hate them...

      "review": "Look it doesn't reach the heights of LN 1 or 2 but the fact that LN 3 comes close in any capacity to touching the first two games atmosphere is nothing short of remarkable.  These games aren't about thrilling gameplay (except for the chases of course) or hyper-complex puzzles.  It's always just about sitting back and soaking up the beautiful horror, which is something that LN 3 does better than I honestly thought it could.  \n\nThere is a running need in the reviews section here to directly compare Tarsier's Little Nightmare games to Supermassive's, which are of course unavoidable.  But context is everything, so to that end it's important to remember that Tarsier's parent company told them to start working on new IP and drop the LN series.  They had no say on the matter as they were freshly bought out, so they went along with it and now we'll be lucky enough to play ReAnimal in February as a result.  This is a great thing.  \n\nBut this also leaves a sizeable problem as to who could even attempt to continue this series after the first two amazing entries, and Supermassive stepped up and delivered.  LN 3 doesn't reach the level of raw menace that the first two games conjured on their own but it still nails the series' unsettling nature.  The graphics are stunning and while a few plot elements went directly over my head [spoiler] Killer plants at the Institute?  Wat? [/spoiler] , the mood was something that can really only come from the LN series.  \n\nI did not experience a single bug but played the whole thing solo, in case that made a difference.  The co op angle is neatly explained by the plot and I never resented the game for forcing it, and the companion AI always did what needed to be done so there was truly nothing to complain about.  I missed the lonely nature of LN 1+2 but the co op was a nice angle of comparison, even though it was of course only jammed in there to get a few extra bucks for Daddy Bandai.  \n\n39.99 seems a little stiff for the total run time, even though I felt every minute was high quality on its own.  I think this game would have a lot less negative reviews if the price point was 29.99 instead.  \n\nI'm glad this game exists and really feels like LN, since I was never sure if anyone other than Tarsier could really sell it but Supermassive did a terrific job.",

First, there are cons- I constantly struggled with the ai being a problem the entire game, and many times I’ve had to figure out a way to its stupidity. I had to play co op at the end of the game because I could not beat the last boss fight bc of the ai which is sad..That is mostly the only con I have, but most of the puzzles were very easy compared to other games, but I still like it. I wasn’t really surprised the ending was bad, but this one had a kick to it compared to the 2nd game. I cried so quickly bc I’ve waited for this game for 3 years and it was so heartbreaking even after I got spoilers. \n\nI do have to say I love this game so much, low and alone definitely have the best dynamic out of all the games, and I will love them for eternity ♡︎. I could not tell of the difference between the other games with this one besides only a couple things, but I still think it is identical to the other 2 games. The extra animations they added and dynamic between low and alone were cuter than the 2nd game, and I notice new things everytime I play. People hating on it for not being ‘hard enough’ or because it was a different collab, is useless because we all waited for it. Overall, even with with issues from the ai and the ending, I still love this game and i cannot wait for the extra 2 chapters next year :)",

However I keep running into mission blocking issues where the AI companion just breaks preventing me from progressing. \nWhen I caped the FPS to 60, things started to work a lot better. \nFor an UE5 game in 2025 this is crazy to me.",

That being said, LN3 is still a good game, but has some nagging issues that keep it from being great. These include:\n[list]\n    [*]So many double doors/vents. These are frustratingly clunky and far too overused. By the time you see the end credits, you likely would've spent 15 minutes holding LT + <- and waiting for an animation to finish (which is ridiculous for a 4-5 hr game).\n    [*]Unintuitive game design. Why are there chases that immediately go into hiding sequences with no transition? Why are there rooms where you're actually just supposed to wait for the enemy to leave (instead of, I don't know, exploring/leaving)? Why is the first introduction of a blind enemy them having their back to you with no way of knowing that don't have eyes??\n    [*]No connection between chapters, both in story and in physicality. Some of the best parts of LN1 and 2 is transitioning between chapters and slowly entering the next dangerous space. This game transitions chapters by you teleporting through mirrors, completely forsaking any opportunity to build tension or world-building.\n    [*]Story is lowkey buns. Why do I need to listen to a podcast to get context for what's happening in the video game.\n[/list]\nDespite these flaws, I still had fun in my experience with the game. But I can't accept this installment in the franchise without addressing how it does this series worse. On its own, it's a beautiful puzzle-horror game that takes you through some interestingly-themed chapters and enemies. Compared to its predecessors however, it's a notable downgrade that hurts compared to what it could have been.\n\nTLDR: 6/10, buy on a sale and play with a friend; maybe the future DLC will be better.",

I've heard complaints about them throwing out the desert aesthetic early on, but I think what they did instead with the using mirrors to go between different areas was pretty cool. My main complaint would be that they don't linger on the first section or monster long enough, and overall the game feels pretty short compared to the first two (another reason that the price increase was a big mistake).\n\nI only had a few hiccups with the AI companion acting weird. Them blocking a vent that I was trying to backtrack through, them not following me in a certain section, things like that. A quick reload was all it took to get things back on track, so it was more of a minor inconvenience than something that actually hurt my experience.\n\nAnother thing that fans are understandably upset about is that this is completely separate from the story of Six from the first two games.

I don't care what the negative reviews say, I suggest you don't listen to them, you'd be missing out. \n\nedit: also I read a review that said its repetitive, it's a story-based game, you're not supposed to play it more than once in a short space of time. And the gameplay itself definitely wasn't repetitive.\n\nPersonally, I absolutely loved this game:\n\n- The soundtrack was beautiful, it keeps the same eerie, yet gorgeous, vibe as the music from the original creator's games, while putting their own unique spun on it.\n\n- And the locations are extremely Immersive, especially the first location (after the large, open desert section), it reminds me of the city from little nightmares 2, and it gave me a sense of deja-vu while also feeling completely new.\n\n-I Addition, the monsters fit the franchise perfectly. If you were to show images of them to someone who has seen the monsters from the previous games and didn't know there was a third game, I can tell you right now, they would definitely point out the fact that they look like monsters from little nightmares. They share the creepy and unsettling aspects of all the previous monsters, while each having their own unique \"personality\" if that's the good word for it.\n\n- It's gameplay keeps both of the previous game's classic, 2d-3d (2.5d?), side-scrolling, platforming and puzzle-solving perfection, with some of Little Nightmares 2's combat added in to keep it entertaining. Not much more needs to be said about the gameplay, but I will say, that there is a certain completely new puzzle solving mechanic, that gets added in, that absolutely BLEW MY MIND!\n\n- And last but not least, the story is... I'm not sure if I can describe this awesome roller-coaster (the good kind, not the \"I don't remember eating that for breakfast\" kind) of a story, in a way that would be even close to doing it justice. It kept me guessing, trying to figure out what was happening, how it connected to the Little Nightmares storyline, why we were there, what the goal was, things like that, and once things start getting revealed, oh boy did I have a smile on my face. And yet, it still leaves many questions, but hey, that's Little Nightmares for you.\n\nThat'll be all from my review of this game.

And the fact that they are adding 2 new chapters later on makes it more enjoyable to see our characters in some new adventures.

(I should say that I am not a hardcore fan of the series, though I do find it very appealing.)\nI think moving toward a co-op experience was a natural step, since the idea had already started to take shape back in the second game, so that is definitely a plus for this one.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3586465348\nIn my view, the game also managed to preserve its signature visual style (although I have read that many players did not like the level design or the bosses, I can only partially agree with that criticism).\nI have also seen people mention that the game is buggy. I personally did not encounter a single bug during my playthrough, but of course that is a subjective experience. I assume the bugs do exist, but I can only judge based on what I have seen myself.\nHowever, I think the negativity comes from a combination of factors, including:\nSupermassive Games currently has a mixed reputation after the uneven The Dark Pictures series, which led to skepticism even before Little Nightmares 3 was released.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3584204356\nThe game’s price went up. It started as an indie project, but as the brand grew, the publishers raised the price accordingly. Unfortunately, aside from the co-op element, the game did not manage to offer much more (some even say it made certain aspects worse than in previous entries) and certainly did not surprise players.\nThere is also Reanimal, a similar game made by former developers of the series, whose demo was released around the same time. Many people liked it more, making comparisons inevitable.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3585606447\nIn the end, Little Nightmares 3 is a decent co-op experience with the series’ recognizable style. However, beyond the co-op addition, it fundamentally fails to bring anything truly new or exciting. It is not a bad game by any means, but fan expectations played a cruel trick on it, and I think it will inevitably go down as a failure in the eyes of many.",

      "review": "I really wish Steam had an option somewhere in the middle when it comes to reviewing, because I can’t say that this is a bad game on its own. It was a solid attempt. But as a Little Nightmares sequel, and with the way Bandai was hyping it up? Boy, was it a mess. Buckle up, because this will be a longer one.\n\nWhen LN2 came out, it was a step up from the first game in every possible aspect: the story, the enemies, the locations, the overall scale. This one, however, feels more like a botched DLC than anything else. It seems like Supermassive was trying to recreate LN2 instead of moving the series forward or elevating it in any meaningful way. But, as they say, you really can’t catch lightning in a bottle twice. The game relies on reused assets, reused rooms, reused shots, and reused puzzles. It’s a copy even down to the issues I had with the previous entry. Like what do you mean you can still fall off the platform due to bad perspective? And don’t even get me started on the character AI..\nEven though they managed to imitate Tarsier’s distinct style, the game still lacks everything that made Little Nightmares great. First of all, it’s unfortunately not scary at all. The sense of dread and anxiety that gripped you in the previous installments? Gone completely. Even the chase scenes couldn’t salvage it (the baby is goofy af, I’m sorry). The only section that came somewhat close to the original atmosphere was in the final location. That should have been the whole game! Second, the gameplay and puzzles… boring, unimaginative, and unchallenging. The number of times you have to press a button or fetch the fricking fuses again (always the fuses) to proceed is way too high. I understand that Supermassive was trying to play it safe, and I also understand that living up to Tarsier’s legacy is near impossible, so all of this I was willing to overlook. But the story? That was, I think, the biggest disappointment for me. It feels like a non-cohesive patchwork of locations glued together without any overarching goal, and the visual storytelling that was essential to the series? Non-existent. This is especially unfortunate if your only other source of narrative explanation is a podcast that most players probably haven’t listened to. Which brings me to my next point, what was Bandai thinking? The last thing anyone wants is for this to turn into the Little Nightmares Cinematic Universe. Cross-referencing your other media can be fun and even welcome, AS EASTER EGGS, but basing the entire ending on it and making casual players feel obliged to consume your other content just to understand the plot is a very poor strategy from Bandai.\n\nNow, just so this review isn’t all negative: I genuinely enjoyed Low and Alone. Even if their relationship was nowhere near as satisfying as watching Six and Mono grow closer over the span of LN2. I even thought the twist at the end was pretty good, but everything else was just… not it. I definitely don’t recommend buying the game at full price, and I honestly regret purchasing the deluxe version. Tarsier knew when to walk away, and for a good reason.\n\nAt least my boy Tobias never disappoints. The menu soundtrack was an absolute banger, as always!",

It’s extremely short, and for what you pay, it just doesn’t deliver enough substance. The biggest issue is how empty it feels. There are barely any real puzzles, and most of the game comes off like a walk simulator with the occasional basic interaction. The new tools sound promising but barely matter, and nothing really evolves beyond what the first two games already did better. The story feels thin and disconnected, and it seems like a chunk of the lore got pushed into outside media instead of being told in the actual game. Add in some awkward controls, depth-perception problems, and a few rough spots performance-wise, and it becomes hard to stay immersed.\nIt’s easily the weakest entry so far and doesn’t feel worth full price.",

And meh. \n\nWe haven't yet finished Little Nightmares III with my friend (let's call him Bucky-Bob, as it's his actual name - laugh about it, he's still a good samaritan.) that these interjections (onomatopoeiae yeh) feel adequate, referring to the lack of variety of the game, as well as the feeling we're having about it, ending up burnt at each end of session.\n\nThe reasons? A few! First the game's connection is rather unstable in spite of both our respective ones being irreproachable (...), which results in many lags and bugs, often making a simple jump a true hell loop where we get teleported back - speaking of hell loops, this is what Little Nightmares III seems to be about, but in the bad way - it's always more or less the same course of action: rather empty environments to wander, with limited interactions, stealth passages, and running away from enemies - rinse and repeat. It's not that awful per se, but just feels like hell with the buggy mess the game is for us.\n\nAlso, the puzzles aren't very fun or inventive - this last session we played was simply a huge slog, where the bugs were allied to the tedious and uninteresting side of the puzzles, added to this that the controls may feel janky to some as it did for us. More fatigue than amusement in the end.\n\nThe game isn't fully terrible either, there's an ambience and graphics that have a sort of cozy charm to them...but man, I really thought this would be a bit better at the very least. Bucky-Boh had told me, \"LNI & II's team is currently working on Reanimal, so da people don't give a fack about dis shit brah\" yet I didn't care about really hearing out his flowery (and wise) words...this will teach me. So the concept of the game is good, but seems to lack the execution it deserved, failing to honour the two first games. Really too bad, because with more time consecrated to the development of Little Nightmares III, just in order to make it work with more fluidity, variety and environmental interactions, it could have made all the difference.",

The puzzles were meh at best, and IMO it didn't start to get better until close to the end of Carnevale. And then....it ended. I'm also not sure why that's considered the \"most complex\" chapter in the game. I guess you can't beat the Hospital in LN2. Not only did that scare the crap out of me, it was hard. \n\nEverything about this game was easy and unexciting. The last chapter with the \"different lighting\" approach (I don't want to spoil it) was probably the coolest thing about this game. What else I liked: the different \"finds\" for each chapter and the scenery. I was excited when the dolls showed up, but that was short lived. Beating the bosses was pathetic....and included lots of running away from them. \n\nNot sure why Tarsier Studios didn't hook us up with this or tell Supermassive this game would offend the OG fans. I finished this game and I will never play it again. About once a year, I play both LN1 and 2, because despite the fact that I completed both, they were harder, you had more sneaking to do, you weren't just running through tunnels or hallways, the bosses were cooler, they are much scarier, and they are continuously fun. Lastly, you weren't guided on what to do next. What I mean by that, for example, is that all you have to do for this game is hide from the bosses (minus The Institute guy -- at the end ONLY), let them do their thing, and then they leave. \n\nVERY DISAPPOINTED.

It was tolerable with a friend but I can imagine playing this by yourself. Overall if you loved the series you will be disappointed of the empty shell this series has become.

However, the level design is severely lacking: while the first two levels are pleasant and enjoyable, the subsequent ones rapidly become frustrating and suffer from a difficulty that feels entirely artificial. You encounter unpredictable obstacles that kill without warning, continuous running sections where the slightest hesitation or getting snagged on a background element (often due to ambiguous perspective) leads to defeat, and jumps that demand surgical precision. The overall experience, in essence, turns into a nerve-wracking battle with the game itself.

      "review": "Face your adulthood fears as you get an unnecessary and mediocre sequel to an otherwise excellent franchise!\n\nThe game looks and sounds good, the new characters are somewhat charming and there some areas where you might get the feeling you are playing an original Little Nightmares game. But that's about it. Looking great means nothing when there's little to no atmosphere. Only a faint shadow of creepiness and weirdness remain in this game. No goosebumps, no tears and no climax at the end.\n\nThe enemy and boss designs are not so great either, at least compared to the first two games. The new stuff just isn't that exciting or unique. But the most annoying part (for a 5-6 hour long game!) is the copy-paste assets, areas and encounters. At one point I was wondering if there will be some weird tie-in to the previous games as I ran through areas that seemed exactly identical to previous games' levels. We see the same cupboards, tables, rooms, rooftops, etc. as before, just the two main characters differ.\n\nThe co-op thing is also a downer. There are 4-5 situations where you have some interesting game mechanic and must work together to progress but most of the time it's just either one of you break the wall or the other one shoot a rope to clear a superficial obstacle.\n\nEven the music is forgettable :(\n\nSo I'm sorry but this feels like a cash grab even without considering the high price and the cut content delivered much later as a paid DLC. Shame because some areas must have had enormous work put into and there are some exciting parts or enemies here and there.",

      "review": "For the people looking for a review to maybe buy this game read this Overall It was too short, monsters didn't fit the world, not enough monsters, was too easy, world story, not enough high stakes or tension(mentioning the chases and stealth areas of the game), Too high of a cost for it's worth, and need better AI. Just play Little Nightmares I and II instead. For ones who want my almost full thoughts on it then you can read if you like. This is going to be a long review from my experience (SPOILERS ON THE GAME). I been think a while, for it's cost it's not worth the game. It feels too short of a game to be good, most areas in the game felt too short that i can't enjoy it them or got must from it if that makes senses. The gameplay felt really dull a bit and the puzzles felt too easy, not enough high stakes. I think Super Massive tried to play it safe with this which i can understand but with that it also damages the experience and series as a a whole. I think what makes little nightmares is its world and how ruined it is, the story telling isn't telling the telling,  but showing it and only showing. I think they did great with the environments in fact I loved them (except one), I just wish we were there longer, I felt like I was going through the game very quickly unable to appreciate every location.  Speaking of the locations we have Necropolis, the Candy Factory, Carnevale, and The Institute. About Necropolis; it was too short, the boss being a giant baby I felt didn't fit the world, I wish their were more monsters too, because it was just big baby, puzzles and random beetle bugs (which also doesn't fit the world) the monsters are always humanoid in someway, and this state puff marshmallow baby just I think breaks the world, at least for me. Next the Candy Factory; I liked it, I liked the boss and environments, what was the problem? I feel the chases were too easy, \"The SuperVisor\" also getting stuck on some pipe streaming in her face, in the chases I outran her so far i can't even see her at that point why am I even running I could just walk, even when shes just roaming, sneaking past her is really easy no challenge. same problem as the last one their like no other monsters, I guess theirs the bugs but that's it. I wish the workers were a threat like when they saw you they forget about their work just to kill or eat you. I think it needs to feel like the world just hates you. That's what all the monsters does within Little nightmares 1 and 2. This area was also very short just like the last one. Though I do have to say she has a cool death which I loved, a fear of mine is being crushed to death so seeing that was a shiver down my spine. Now to the Carnevale, easily this is my favorite area in the whole game, I love the atmosphere, puzzles were decent, and monsters like the puppets, some of the well... oversized residences and the Boss themselves. (two of them.) i liked this area wasn't a short experience, I got really get a feel of the place and how creepy it is. Now about the boss being The Man in the Purple Suit, and his muppet or puppet I'm not sure but its alive. I liked them a lot they felt scary to go against them and something i haven't mention much is the music, I loved the music in the Carnevale it was scary. Now for the chases i liked them they were good and felt like they were actually close. Now it's cons, The puzzles mainly they were too easy, I did like when they catched us and had to relied on your friend (or AI) to free you from the cages, I wish we got more like that. I wished we got to see The Man in the Purple Suit more often that would of made them more of a threat throughout the whole Carnevale. The ending was fun though I liked exiting and killing the Puppet or muppet whatever. It was far from perfect but I wish more area of the game were like the Carnevale. Finally, The Institute, meant to be a reference to the podcast audio story of The Sounds of Nightmares. This area is like a giant research place, Idk the full story for it but that isn't the point, the point is how was it? It was bad, I liked the Chases I will say, But the boss itself i didn't understand, I later learned it's Otto from The Sound of Nightmares. From the first and second game they usually show an image at the begining of the game that will forshadow the end of the game, like how in  the first game it showed the lady, how we will fight her in the end, or in the second game how it's the door, which you see throughout the game, leading to end how you become the Thin Man and repeating the cycle. This game it just showed a Mirror and yes it lead to the end and how Low got back to the real world. But i felt it wasn't so significant as like example the second game where you fight the Thin Man because he took Six and after also begin hunting you down, feeling like a real threat and purpose. I guess my point is Otto didn't feel like a real boss, just their because The Sound of Nightmares exist, even the final fight wasn't so fun. I just didn't understand, I feel like you need to listening to the podcast/ audio story to somewhat understand, I know this is like a show no tell game as I said But It was put in a bad way. The final area I guess just felt very unsatisfying. last i want to mention is I did like the new mechanizes like the umbrella or the plush that puts you back in time or something. That was really cool but barely got like 30 minutes of use, that sucked. Lastly the AI sucked, Which it was more like Six. It gets Stuck often, It often just watched you as you did part of the puzzle. I have a bit more to say but it's mostly minor things. These are my main thoughts on Little Nightmares 3 as a whole.  Well, I guess thanks for reading.",

      "review": "Not bad, worth a playthrough, but a far cry from the first two games. Supermassive was a strange choice for this one as they clearly don't understand what makes video games unique as a medium. Don't get me wrong, they're visual masters, and LN3 is no exception as it features some of the most visually stunning environments and scenery of the whole series, at least when they're not copying Tarsier's work and reusing assets from the first two games, but everything else is lacking.\n\nHalf the game is spent walking to the right without any purpose or anything interesting going on, while spooky sounds play and bland and uninspired monsters roam about in the background, while the other half is spent on really basic and straightforward gameplay that's only interesting when it's flat out copying scenarios from the first two games. Several times during my playthrough I was like \"wait, they did this in the first game\" or \"this exact hallway full of monsters that I have to sneak though was in the second game.\" It seems Supermassive can't design a compelling gameplay scenario, or even a competent one, if their lives depended on it. Too many visual artists and not enough game designers at the company it seems.\n\nLow and Alone's story is sweet, and I genuinely love their character designs and unique abilities, but ultimately it goes nowhere with little mystery or tension. The allegorical core of Little Nightmares has always drawn from that well of fear that all children feel toward adulthood, the adult world, growing up, and change in general, but Supermassive seems to misunderstand this and instead makes this a tale about mental health and a fear of one's physicians, like a child scared of their doctor simply because they're an unfamiliar adult. Basic, boring, and downright insulting to the legitimate fears of youth.\n\nUltimately, this game just feels like it was an assignment from Bandai Namco to Supermassive and that no one involved really cared about the series beyond just making another entry to keep the franchise alive. Best wait for a sale if you're interested or just skip it so Reanimal hits even harder when it drops.",

Much of this game has been a walking simulator through mostly empty areas with not much caring that you're there.

All of the right ingredients with none of the understanding as to what makes the final product appealing to the player.

      "review": "SPOILERS BELOW:\r\nLittle Nightmares 3 overall is a fine game. The environments are probably its strongest feature as most of them look incredible. The Carnival and final chapter imo contain some of the best visuals in the entire franchise, which make the rest even more painful. The game has so much potential that it utterly wastes. \r\nFirst of all it has less chapters than the previous game. Sure, the chapters are slightly longer and have more variety between them, but I was expecting more. The Factory, which arguably could be the setting for a whole game on its own, felt absurdly short in contrast to all the marketing it recieved before release, same with the Necropolis. The Carnvial and Institute both were pleasant surprises by their lenght even though they did not have many interesting things to do. In any case, it was good to see the final chapter having more work put into it compared to the previous games.\r\nSecond, I'm stilll not sure about what this whole game is even about. Having listened to The Sounds of Nightmares, I have a general understanding of the story, but that's not really the point. Both previous games had a core message and theme that the whole setting was built around. LN1 had the Maw - a manifestation of hunger, greed and gluttony, it really delved deep into the disgusting reality of modern over-consumption and how it corrupts people. LN2 had the Signal Tower and the Pale City, both manifestations of escapism. I was not expecting the depression I felt when playing the Pale City chapter. Seeing this horrible, decayed world where people are so desperately miserable, they seek any form of escape, even if it kills them. It really left an impact on me. LN3 on the other hand just did not have that punch. It's missing this \"anger at modern society\" that you could feel in the writing of the previous games. Apparently the themes were \"illusions and delusions\", but those were explored on such a surface level. Even the final reveal at the ending was predictable and unoriginal, and did not add anything to the core message.\r\nThe Spiral as a place also fails to engage with the core themes. I played the game, and yet I still have no idea on what \"the Spiral\" is. When it was announced, in an interview it was said that it is \"a cluster of dystopian lands\". This to me had always felt as an excuse to have different spooky places without having to really connect them logically and thematically. Unfortunately, after playing the game, I feel like I haven't been proven wrong.\r\nWhat probably baffles me the most is the inclusion of the mirrors. They seemed so important and central to the story in the beginning. Anyone who has been a fan of this franchise for some time would have imediatelly drawn the connection the the Mirror Man from the old comic series. Even the cover art, with a stack of smoke swirling out of a mirror implies the existance of this Resident. Maybe we will find out what was his connection the the Lady in the first game? Maybe Otto is the mirror man - a psychiatrist twisted by his own delusions, where he now gains sadistic joy from revealing the deepest flaws and insecurities in others? No. None of that. I wonder where the writing went wrong in the process, becuause it just feels like these things weren't considered at all, which is just confusing.\r\nAt the very least they could have revealed the most mysterious character of them all - the Ferryman - to the general public who does not engage with secondary media. But that characters seems to be left for comics and podcasts.\r\nIt hurts me to say this as a long-time fan of the franchise, but I just can't recommend anyone buying this game. Not for the price it has, nor the content. I'm hoping this isn't the end and there is a brighter future ahead. because there is fertile soil in this world, one just has to know how to cultivate it.",

I've encountered a few bugs and the most frustrating of them all is the unforgiving window of time to execute certain sequences. Buy it on sale? I guess so.",

This game is simply not worth costing twice as much as LN1 or more than LN2 in it's current incarnation, and that's even before considering the on release season pass.\n\nThe inexperience of the new devs is the second problem and it's the most noticeable in the lack of themeing. The early and final level have a theme of feeling overwhelmingly small against towering presences, while the middle levels have a consumption/consumerism theme that gets abandoned by the end of the game, and neither of them cleanly tie in the mirror and reflection theme that the main characters are going through. \n\nThere are still levels and setpieces that I like in every level, which is why I do think this game is worth a buy if you need more games set in the Little Nightmares universe, but definitely wait for a 50% disscount before doing so, or a bigger one to account for the DLC.",

There are some issues with the game that they could have improved in, for instance, there was a few times when me and my bf was playing, we didn't know what to do in some sequences with some enemies while hiding, and all we had to do is wait for a while and let them leave. I feel like it could have been so much more involved during so many parts of the game, and it just confused us sometimes when we were trying to find something to interact with, but all we needed to do was hide. The chase sequences were very underwhelming as well as the story.\n\nGraphics are absolutely beautiful, I cant lie about that but definitely wait for a good discount, and dont expect going into this thinking it'll be like Little Nightmares \n\nIf steam had a mix option i'd pick that",

If it was like $20 or maybe even $30 then I would've been more okay with it but $40 is too much for not as good of a game as the others. I felt like this game was just a big rage bait because the directions just weren't very clear on what you should do, and I know that the others were kind of like that but it I felt like it gave you more time to figure it out.
