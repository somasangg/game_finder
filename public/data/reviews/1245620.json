The game keeps getting better towards the end game. \n\nTook me 98 hours for my first ever playthrough of the game, but it was in no sense complete, I am still somehow missing an achievement boss! I did a dex/bleed build with a couple of curved greatswords. The late game bosses really don't care about the level of my character. Lady Rot was the hardest boss in the game by a mile. Took me 114 attempts at her. That's the most I have spent, not even Demon of Hatred took that long for me. (shameless plug of me beating her - [url=https://youtu.be/-4glOR36oZw]Video link[/url] ) \n\nTechnically, yes, there are some places where fps drops even after multiple patches, and I had 1 crash in 100 hours of gameplay. Fromsoft games are stuck at 60 fps at most, but this game and its vistas really deserve more imo. \n\nWhether you're a veteran at the genre or new to it, this is a must buy!

      "review": "Elden Ring felt like it’s the culmination of all FromSoftware games that came before it. It’s everything they learned from them and more. If you’ve played other FromSoftware games, you’ll stumble upon a lot of familiar things, scenarios, locations, enemies, bullshit, and they took all that and put it in a huge open world map.\n\nThe map itself is vague. If you like the “zero hands holding” approach, this is your game. Not only do you not know what to do next, but things are hard as they are in your average souls experience, you wander into the wrong neighborhood, and there goes all your runes.\n\nThis is the most polished experience from the series. It’s visually beautiful and beautifully crafted, the world has much variety, some copy pasted landmarks but also lots of unique places with good interiors and architecture. I know some people complain that some enemies repeat, but even with that, there are tons of variety in this aspect as well.\n\nUnlocked new fear of insects, centipedes, ants, fingers? They replaced spiders with fingers, and I don't know which is worse now... \n\nI have mixed feelings about the gameplay. For most people, they nailed the combat in this one, and it's true, but there are some annoying things. \n\nUnlike DS2, you can attack and dodge quite a lot before running out of stamina, which promotes faster gameplay, and that's usually what people seek and enjoy. To balance that, bosses also unleash a fury of successive fast attacks, and sometimes the window during which you can attack without being punished is really small, so the fight ends up with more downtime (defense time) than attacking, and that can be boring. \n\nI'm not talking about op builds and cheeses, those exist, but I'm speaking of a normal first playthrough experience. \n\nIt feels like mobs don't have a stamina bar as u do. That was a nice feature from Nioh, being able to see the enemy's stamina bar. \n\nAnother issue is how huge bosses are, now it's not new, but man, it's becoming ridiculous. I know people loove to fight big bosses, but I use M&K because I like complete camera control, and even then, I don't even see all the boss. Some fights I don't see the hit because it's impossible to have all the boss within the camera frame, neither by locking the view nor by unlocking it. \n\nOther than that, I absolutely love the animations, the weapon variety, the spell effects, the class variety, and mix and matching, all the new features are fun to play with. \n\nOn a more personal note, even though this game has everything, even things from previous souls games, more features, more work into it, I still think that experiencing similar features was more iconic in previous titles. If you're new to the genre, this game is a fantastic place to start. It has everything, and it's modern, but for me, I still find DS1 to be the most iconic and the most beautiful journey, but maybe cause I played it first, we will never know.",

      "review": "Its easily one of the most absorbing and punishing open world RPG game where you play the role of a 'victim' hehe. The Lands Between feels like a mystery full of hidden caves, ruins and half the time I felt like I was discovering things by accident lol.\nCombat is a classic FromSoftware brutality, but with more freedom than ever. I went with a Crit twin-dagger parry build and it honestly felt so cool to learn enemy moves and parry them into a one-shot kill, other times realizing I'd just nerfed myself into oblivion. The bosses were where the real struggle kicked in. I’ll admit it: I got absolutely demolished by Margit the first time, and not in a “haha that was tough” way more like “I think this game hates me personally.” Godrick turned the arena into a tornado of panic rolls. Radahn ? I think I died so many times I started recognizing the shape of each meteor he called down on me.\nExploration was just as chaotic for me. I kept wandering into areas I had no business being in Caelid destroyed me, the underground cities confused me, and I’m pretty sure I fell off cliffs more times than I actually died to enemies.\nThe story, while cryptic, drew me in heavily. The more I played, the more I wanted to piece together the lore and untangle the tragedy of the Lands Between. Even when I was frustrated or exhausted, that curiosity pushed me forward.\nIn the end, Elden Ring made me feel everything - excitement, fear, confusion and pure stubbornness. It challenged me constantly, but that’s exactly what made finally beating its toughest encounters feel so incredible. It’s one of the few games where struggling through it actually deepened my appreciation for just how brilliantly it’s crafted.\n\nDifficulty to 100% -\n(4/5)\nPerfecting this game is extremely challenging, mostly because of how massive it is. You need to defeat every boss, explore every hidden area, and worst of all complete multiple NPC questlines that are easy to break if you progress in the wrong order. Many quests have missable steps and some achievements require finding obscure locations you’d never naturally stumble into. On top of that, you must complete multiple endings, meaning at least 2 (usually 3) full playthroughs unless you rely on backups. Between the sheer size of the map, the difficulty of late game bosses and the number of missable trophies, finishing everything becomes a demanding task. It’s absolutely doable, but definitely one of the tougher platinum hunts out there.",

I think I prefer the smaller more compact maps of the Dark Souls games in a lot of ways, but Elden Ring probably has the best combat of all their souls like games in my opinion.\n\nAtmosphere, world design, and bosses are pretty on point. Very fun fights and combat. Ost is also fantastic but I could say the same about most of their games.\n\nMy favorite build was a Strength/Faith build.\n\nMy only real criticism is that the oversized open world makes it a bit hard to know where you're supposed to go compared to their older games. That, and it can make finding important gear pieces for your intended build is a matter of pure luck, rather than knowing you'll eventually run into what you want. This is a bit of a problem in a first playthrough if you're using no guides. That's my only real 'issue' with the game though. Loved it otherwise.",

Todo o universo, a mitologia, os personagens e os mistérios da trama são muito bem construídos e caprichados. Talvez seja a melhor história da saga Souls.\nA gameplay é, basicamente, o Dark Souls definitivo. Combate, armas, armaduras e magias estão no seu ápice.\nDe novidade, temos as Cinzas de Guerra, que são golpes especiais aplicáveis às armas, e algumas já vêm com as suas próprias.\nTemos também as invocações, que ajudam muito nos chefes (principalmente o Mímico).\nAgora o jogo é mundo aberto, e contamos com Torrente como montaria para nos locomover mais rápido, além da possibilidade de combate montado. E falando do mapa: o design é sensacional, variado e extremamente detalhado, com muuuuuitos tipos de inimigos.\nA progressão é a mesma dos Souls anteriores: derrotamos inimigos e chefes, ganhamos runas e melhoramos nossos status na graça/fogueira. Ao explorar o mapa, completar quests de NPCs, fazer dungeons e derrotar chefes opcionais, ganhamos novos equipamentos para adaptar à nossa build.\nE, claro, há uma avalanche de chefes. Os principais são, de longe, os melhores e mais memoráveis. Já os opcionais, a maioria é ótima, mas muitos são repetidos ou variações.\nQuanto à dificuldade, de fato é o Souls mais de boa da saga, ótimo para iniciantes do gênero — mas claro, não é “de graça”.\nSobre bugs, não tive nenhum; no máximo, raras quedas de FPS.\n\nPor fim: maravilhoso!!!!!!!!\n\n10/10!!!!!!!",

      "review": "There's so much great about this game, and so much terrible!  The great:[list]\n[*]Combat is great!  It's got depth, it's challenging, and mostly it's fair.  There's a big variety of enemies (though they still get a little repetitive thanks to the sheer size of the game) and a huge variety of weapons to kill them with.\n[*]Exploration is about as good as it gets.  Any cliff could have a ledge below it you might jump down to.  A large tree could be hiding a door into a cave.  Illusionary walls seemed a bit cheap at first, but there are often 'tells' like sounds coming from the other side of them.  Entire maps can be hidden away where many players can miss them!  Note that the online option can spoil this badly, though.  It's hardly a secret door when there are half a dozen messages around it telling you it's there.\n[*]Art direction is great, too.  Technically, the graphics don't seem to be using the most advanced technology, but the artists did very well with what they had.\n[*]Boss fights are well done.  When you beat a boss, it typically won't take even five minutes.  Of course, many of them will require some experimentation, which does mean dying and starting again a few times, but there will also be some you're particularly well suited for that will finish on your first try.  Battles against dragons can take longer, but they're also incredibly good fights with the dragons flying off a short distance and breathing fire (or whatever) at you.\n[/list]\n\nOn the not-so-good side:[list]\n[*]Quests.  Yeeesh!  I guess the fun of the quests came in the early days when the game was released, and the community was working together to figure them out.  If you want to follow them yourself, you'll NEED to look up guides because the NPCs have a habit of moving around a lot - and I don't mean just from one side of town to another.  The rewards, if there are any, can be pretty weak or really strong... unless it doesn't fit your build, which it often will not.\n[*]Story.  There IS a story in this game, but you have to dig it out by reading item descriptions and thinking about what you're seeing.  If you're an investigative reporter or historian, you'll like sifting it out.  For everyone else... lots of hassle for very little reward.\n[*]You know how those old JRPGs before, oh, 2005 or so would always make you keep talking to an NPC over and over until their dialog repeats to find out everything they want to say?  FromSoft still thinks it's a good idea.\n[*]There's zero lip syncing, too.  NPCs jaws just flap away until they finish.\n[*]Tone is incredibly bleak.  Could somebody please be happy!?  Preferably not because you ripped off some poor sod's skin.\n[*]Every time you gain a level you get to add one point to one statistic.  You'll likely gain a good 130+ levels over the course of the game so you will definitely advance in power, but every step is tiny.  For me, at least, that takes away some of the fun.  I like to be able to see a difference after gaining a level - maybe not a big one, but something I can at least notice.\n[/list]\n\nThe game's difficulty isn't quite what I thought.  If you die, you drop all your runes.  Runes are money in this game, but keep in mind that gaining levels costs runes.  They will stay roughly where you died and, as long as you come back and pick them up before dying again, there's no penalty except for the time it took you to get from the last save point to that location.  So, when you see a challenge ahead, you're going to very much want to put it off until just after you buy a level or otherwise deplete your rune count.\n\nThe game is a one-save-only style game.  As such, you'll want to back up your save just in case something goes wrong.  I never heard of any game bugs corrupting a save, but computers can do weird things, and it only takes a few seconds.  The game saves itself very often quitting the game will save in that spot.  I wouldn't try doing it in the middle of a boss fight, but those fights almost always end inside of five minutes.  The game won't do well if you need to quit at any second, but if you can get 5 minutes notice, you should be fine.\n\nAll in all, I very much enjoyed the game.  I [b]really[/b] loved the exploration.  (If you're an explorer type gamer, don't worry too much about the difficulty - you'll spend so much time exploring everything that you'll be over-levelled soon enough.)  People that love deep action combat should try the game, too.  If you're more into the stories that RPGs can tell, though, this isn't your game.",

Yes Haligtree. I'm looking at you. And also Farum Azula.\r\n\r\nBut even for all the variety you get, its mostly better on paper, because a lot of the stuff in this game gets reused and spammed for its life. You can only fight so many \"Grave warden duelist but he pisses rot\" now or something before it gets old, but I can excuse this because with the nature of Elden Ring, it'd be nearly impossible to make 230 unique bosses, and the game would be like 200gb.\r\n\r\nThe DLC is also extremely fucking painful, but fun.

      "review": "A spectacular experience the first time, and a good one in subsequent playthroughs. Elden Ring is a masterful demonstration of From Software's formula crafted into the open world. Although, this game is no masterpiece, like any other game, it holds its own significant flaws. To call it a masterpiece detracts from its problems, giving its developers the illusion that they need not make improvements. It is regressive to consider any game perfect but I dare say Elden Ring approaches perfection. However, the game does suffer from major problems. \n\nThe multiplayer component is lackluster. The implementation of limiting gameplay with friends is a mistake. Ideally, cooperative gameplay should be seamless in the exploration of this beautiful world, without the loops and hurdles required to do so. And yes, there is a great mod for that but modders are not responsible for fixing your bad implementation (I'm looking at you Bethesda). \n\nThe weapon upgrade system has confusing dynamics. Often times upgrading base weapons with several smithing stones, in several tiers, is more challenging than upgrading unique weapons with somber smithing stones. Upgrading base weapons takes a total of 12 smithing stones per tier compared to the 1 somber smithing stone for unique weapons. Finding and grinding smithing stones can be its own difficulty, made even easier for unique weapons considering you only need 1. The system is backwards in my opinion and should be reversed. Simply put, the base weapons should be easier to upgrade than the unique ones. \n\nThe most gigantic issue I have with this games design is its restrained style story telling. Giving the player little instruction creates a magnificently quiet atmosphere, unlike any other game, but it's not without trade-offs. While the quite can be breathtaking, it leaves so much to be desired for quest lines. Most of the time you'll find yourself using external resources for quest progression, item locations, weapon locations, etc. While some of those features are fine, its disastrous for story telling. You are nigh-on forced to look up quest progression beyond blind luck which has the effect of utterly ripping you out the experience. You'll be sooner be checking off a guided list of instructions on a YouTube guide or Wiki page than naturally progression the story. The problem is compounded when you need to complete these vague quest lines for different ending. While solutions are something I cannot easily provide, From should look to compromising between the baby mode of Rockstar missions and the quiet restraint that From is known for. \n\nOverall, disagree with my points as you like, but we need to be more critical of games. It's easily to clown on utter failures, but its far worse to relentlessly praise a great game. We cannot give From Software the idea that they are infallible. It's happened before, and now look at Bethesda's output. We should recognize and voice our issues without strictly praising a great game. Consequently, From Software will continue to improve and we will continue to play their great games. I don't want to continue in a market suffocated by underachievement and disappointment. A market that From Software has stood above, time and time again.",

The worldbuilding is profound—every monument, every name carries a story of glory and decay. Accompanied by a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, the game captures both the grandeur and the sorrow of a fallen age. It’s less a game to play than a legend to experience. Still, I find the lack of a clear quest system somewhat frustrating, even though I understand it’s part of the Soulsborne tradition.",

Can't really compare it to other titles, but I think this is probably the best introduction into the genre.\n\n[h2] Combat [/h2]\nCombat is really good. You have so many options to choose and you can be basically everything you want. It can get frustrating from time to time, but sometimes it can also be forgiving. Sometimes some ordinary enemies can be much harder than some bosses.\n\n[h2] Exploration [/h2]\nI really like the freedom exploring the world. You can go basically everywhere whenever you want. So the game let's you explore and get powerful even before you fight your first boss. But sometimes it can be quite overwhelming and you can't decide where to go exactly and you can easily end up in the endgame area within first hours of your playthrough.\n\n[h2] World [/h2]\nThe story doesn't tell you much and story of the world is mainly told through hidden messages, item descriptions or mysterious NPC conversations. This style of storytelling is definitely not for everyone. Maybe I'm spoiled from big AAA RPGs, like The Witcher, Cyberpunk or so on, but even the ending wasn't that satisfying as I thought it would be. Maybe I'm not used to that formula yet.\n\nIt was fun, interesting and sometimes frustrating journey I enjoyed. Right now I want to dive into the DLC, so maybe my opinion will change. Also what helped get through this game is to look at it as big open-world RPG, not souls-borne or FromSoftware game.\n\n[h1] 9/10 [/h1]",

The open world makes it possible to avoid an overly strong opponent and return at a later point in time. There are also so-called ‘ghost ashes’, which represent summonings in battles that can make a difficult fight much easier. This makes the difficulty level more accessible.\n\nThe DLC is good, but a little harder than the base game.\n\nAs usual with FromSoftware games, the story is not very transparent, but rather has to be pieced together bit by bit. However, this results in a moderate story that, while not captivating me personally, did not disappoint me either. \n\nThe graphics and soundtrack are well done and provide a fitting atmosphere for the different areas of the game. The immense size of the world contains many secret areas, items, NPCs and bosses that are a joy to discover. \n\nThe PC controls also worked well.\n\nThe combat system offers many different ways to defeat your opponents, which suits the different preferences of the players. \n\nIt didn't take much grinding to achieve all the achievements, which I found pleasant. \n\nIt has a high replay value and is worth the full price.",

      "review": "Maybe my favorite FromSoft title (in competition with Bloodborne), Elden Ring is the most ambitious of the Soulsborne games and it's an ambition that pays off. The world of the Lands Between is an addicting place and the sheer freedom and variety of combat and builds alone would mark this as one of my favorites. In my opinion, boss design is the best it's ever been in Elden Ring  with all of the main boss fights (and a lot of the optional) being incredibly memorable. Lore wise, Elden Ring has surpassed even Dark Souls with its complexity and depth and I love how it has it's own unique feel and tone just like the original Dark Souls.\r\n\r\nNow that I'm (mostly) done praising it, here are some issues I have. ER reuses a lot of boss assets for optional bosses, to a point where it's very noticeable and feels a bit lazy. This might be a byproduct of this being FromSoft's first open world game and maybe they underestimated the amount of unique bosses they would need. Additionally, ER has this weird obsession of making enemies jump around a corner to attack you. Like a lot, to the point where I always check corners in dungeons and usually find an enemy waiting to spook me. Kind of annoying, not a dealbreaker imo.\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna bother going to Shadow of the Erdtree's actual store page so I'll talk about it here: It is a beautiful, expansive area that is way overtuned in difficulty to the point of being unenjoyable. I've tried on two separate occasions to get through it and there's just something about the pacing and enemies that doesn't make it fun. Even defeating bosses (like Messmer) isn't even satisfying, you're just glad it's over. I don't know what exactly makes the DLC feel this way but the base game just feels better in almost every respect. Boss design and spectacle is great but the time investment for how hard it is just makes it not worth it.\r\n\r\nThat aside, TL;DR Elden Ring is amazing and you should get it.",

In short: this game is a masterpiece and, speaking personally, FromSoftware’s greatest work to date.\n\nA stunning open world offering HUNDREDS (yes, literally hundreds) of hours of exploration. And that’s not even counting the DLC, which has almost as much content as the base game itself. Hundreds of bosses to defeat, mountains of gear to collect, countless builds to try, hidden passages everywhere, secrets behind every corner.\n\nThe game isn’t quite as punishing as some other titles from the studio (yes, Sekiro, I’m looking at you), but you’ll still \"hate\" this game in certain spots (Haligtree, my beloved…).\n\nBoss design is absolutely top-tier. Every fight is a challenge - sometimes mild, sometimes brutal. (Yes, I got my butt handed to me the first time I fought Morgott.) The beauty of it all lies in learning their patterns (*coughMaleniacough*) and reacting properly… or just dumping all your points into Strength and going for the classic \"bonk\" build. There’s something for everyone.\n\nI simply can’t not recommend this game. I cannot wrap my head around it, but there is something about this game, that itch, which makes you just play it again and again and again. Whether you’re a Souls veteran or someone touching the series for the first time: don’t get discouraged by the early stumbles. It’s truly worth it.\n\nPractice makes perfect, so RISE NOW, YE TARNISHED! YE DEAD, WHO YET LIVE!",

From haunting ruins to majestic castles, each location feels handcrafted and alive. The freedom to explore at your own pace makes even the smallest detour feel rewarding.\n\nCombat? It's solid. Bosses are memorable, and classes offer variety. But if you're here only for the challenge of boss fights and tight combat loops, you might find the pacing a bit meandering. The game isn't a boss rush—it’s a pilgrimage.\n\nAnd yes, the runbacks exist. But they’re rarely soul-crushing. Often, they’re scenic, filled with tension and beauty. You’re not just retrying a fight—you’re re-entering a world that wants to tell you something.\n\nIf you crave immersion, mystery, and the joy of getting lost, Elden Ring is everything you hoped for.",

I saw a friend playing Elden Ring for the first time, and he invited me to try it with him through the smooth co-op mode. I went into the game with a preconceived notion of how bad it would be, so I kept noticing flaws simply because I was focused on finding them. But the more I played, the more the game world surprised me.\r\n\r\nThe world feels endless. Every time you think you've reached the end, you stumble across new locations, secret areas, and enemies you've never encountered before. The enemy variety is amazing; each area has its own unique set of foes. The only other game I've seen this level of diversity is Hollow Knight. Furthermore, the landscapes are a masterpiece. The game offers a wide range of weapons, armor, and building options, whether you prefer to be a mage, a fighter, an archer, or anything else entirely, which adds a great deal of depth to the gameplay.\r\n\r\nI finished the game with my friend, but later I replayed it on my own. That's when I started noticing some drawbacks. After my first experience, I tried other games of the same genre, such as Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Dark Souls III, and Dark Souls. Compared to these games, Elden Ring was surprisingly easy, especially after the developers released updates. My second attempt was easier, but not as enjoyable. I defeated the toughest bosses on my first try, but some enemies were able to hit me through walls. Sometimes, even the regular enemies you encountered would attack me the moment I entered the arena, which was frustrating during the entrance scene.\r\n\r\nI also completed the downloadable content, and honestly, I regret buying it. It doesn't offer much for $26. I know it's just an add-on, but at that price, it should have offered something more valuable, especially compared to Silksong, which offered a lot for only $7.\r\n\r\nOverall, I'd rate Elden Ring an 8/10. It's a great game and worth playing, regardless of its DLC. It's a game worth trying.",

Games could ditch this \"extra\" finally, just upload the concept art as they used to (oh wait the web is broken, different story, back to review).\n- LIMIT the map/fast travel to the bonfires, wtf\n- LET ME TURN OFF THAT HUGE COMPASS OCCUPYING THE MIDDLE OF THE SCREEN THANK YOU.\n- I use my own custom reShade gui over the atricious RGB bar of drudgery-red, boring-blue and bore-green.

      "review": "Elden Ring was the first game I ever platinumed, and for a long time I considered it the peak of gaming. After exploring other titles, it has not aged as flawlessly for me, but I still hold it in high regard and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a true open world experience. Unlike games that feel empty or overly curated, Elden Ring delivers scale, density, and meaningful exploration.\r\n\r\nThe world is rich in story, but the game does not convey its narrative in a traditional way. Most of the lore must be pieced together through item descriptions, environmental clues, and supplementary YouTube explanations. Without that extra effort, you are often left unsure of what is happening or why. The absence of quest markers adds to the sense of freedom, but it also makes it very easy to lock quests, miss key items, or unknowingly cut yourself off from certain endings.\r\n\r\nIn terms of difficulty, I never found the game overwhelming. The only encounter that felt significantly demanding was Messmer in the DLC. The game allows you to farm levels freely and exploit a variety of strategies that make many bosses manageable. I am a dexterity-focused player and used one katana (Nagakiba) for most of the game. I parried Malenia on my first attempt, which is why I find it amusing that some content creators dramatize dozens or hundreds of attempts using mage builds.\r\n\r\nThe build system is another point of friction. While the number of options is impressive, it can be stressful to navigate such a wide range of possibilities. A more intuitive structure would have made experimentation less overwhelming.\r\n\r\nGraphically, the game is solid, but it is not exceptional. Older titles like God of War (2018) still surpass it visually, especially on PC.\r\n\r\nDespite its flaws, Elden Ring is absolutely worth playing. It offers a unique sense of discovery and scale that few games achieve. Just avoid turning it into your entire identity. Step away, get some perspective, and enjoy it alongside other great titles.",

      "review": "Incredible World design, absolutely insane lore, cinematics and boss openings from out of this world and edgy anime grade animations for some of the incredibly vast varieties of weapons and weapon arts. Likely the most unique and beautiful scenery I've ever seen in a video game. SO MANY enemy types, all with their own allegiances, lore and attack styles. The soundtrack smacks ass.\nThis game is truly a masterpiece.\n\nBut.. why would I not recommend it?\nThe biggest issue were constant frame stutters and lag spikes despite on 5800X3D with 7900XTX and no problems in any other games. Googled for hours, nothing helped, with 2 different PCs (other one 3800X with 3070 Ti). Then to the other reasons.\nWell, for one, I love the idea of progressing through a game exactly like developers and designers would want you to. Some variation is fine (like in The Witcher or Cyberpunk or even Fallout and Skyrim), but having a completely open world with nothing but utter defeat telling you where not to go and some funny grace lines where to head for the quickest possible end is just not my thing. Those other mentioned games do have open worlds and player decisions as well - but the general branches are longer and supported by great writing and story lines, quests, markers and quality of life features. Elden Ring has only very cryptic quests, the story is mostly lore and irrelevant for the gameplay though written exceptionally. Much lore, story is \"fight the demigods and become Elden Lord\" - wow.\nI always feel like I'm missing out on so much because entire areas can be hidden behind false walls or randomly jumping down some ledge that doesn't look like you should. This is by design so every new run has some fresh nuance to it but I'm a player who wants to play a game once and move on to the next - there are just too many good games out there not to. If I do so, I want to experience everything the game has to offer before moving on which is almost impossible in Elden Ring. You literally miss a plethora of bosses that are super random to get (like one of the coolest - Placidusax.. you have to lay down in a random spot xD)\nI also do not like that the game tells you almost nothing and has very little explanation ingame other than the UI. I bet almost every player regularly has to open the wiki in order to really enjoy playing it.\nThe combat feels incredibly clunky and heavy, playing with projectile ranged weapons viably PvE is basically impossible. Magic feels insanely overpowered, most melee weapons are useless memes, some are overpowered. You never know what level you should be in which area or if enemies are supposed to be tanky. You have to guess how hard the game wants you to fail constantly.\nThen, of course, it's a From Software game and a lot in it is designed for the sole purpose on annoying and tilting you. I have died to fall damage A LOT more than to any boss. Some normal mobs are way harder than a lot of bosses. A lot of \"boss grade\" enemies with large health pools are actually just bs normal enemies (like the dragons in farum azula).\nThe game is way too long for it to be enjoyable, felt like a chore after the first half.\n\nYou should definitely play this game, I just didn't enjoy it enough give a thumbs up here and know there are more with my play style out there. I would have gotten the same enjoyment from just watching someone play and saving 60 bucks.\n\nI've had way more fun with Sekiro.",

I did use multiple controllers, to rule out the input device as a confounding variable, and confirmed it was a game issue.

Combat is sleek, fluid, and holds up very well. \n\nBloodborne has aged a little bit, like a fine wine but also maybe like it wasn't kept fully corked shut.\n\nDemon's Souls is pretty interesting from a setting/lore perspective (and I really wish they'd make a DeS 2, actually!) but it's a mixed bag as far as its experience.\n\nSekiro is... still sitting on my shelf unplayed. Unfortunately.\n\nElden Ring is more technically impressive, visually, thematically, and in its grandiose nature, but it lost a lot of the intrigue and morbid curiosity that the originals had, despite their limitations by today's standards. It is a more new-player-friendly experience, and finally explains some of its systems well. For me personally, I harbor the same disappointments as I did with Breath of the Wild as a Zelda game. The moment-to-moment stuff just wasn't always there. The open world made it into a mile-wide/inch-deep feeling for a lot of the experience, which is a shame because there still ARE locations in this game that are so freaking cool to explore, and have a lot of great enemy experiences and player rewards. It's just all the stuff in between that, beautiful as it may be to look at, which I find so forgettable after I'm done with it. I'm not saying you should never play this game, but I don't feel that the lightning in a bottle from From's earlier games is on display as much here. It's more lightning as a spectacle; still beautiful but less contained, less magical, and less unique. The DLC unfortunately brought more of the same feeling to me, and that really sucks!

You can just turn your brain off and run past every enemy with zero punishment. People still reminisce about their first time in Blight Town or facing those two guys down the well in Bloodborne. There is literally nothing of sort in Elden Ring.\n\nThe small dungeons spread out in the open world sometimes have interesting gimmicks but usually end with you killing a reused boss and being rewarded something you'll never end up using. Bloodborne chalices had random layouts, a decent amount of  enemies/bosses not in the regular game and gave you a reason to do them in Blood gems. All that and most people still skipped them. Ubisoft level bloat for people who don't realize more playtime doesn't make a game better. \n\nLegacy dungeons, you don't even want to explore because after doing a few you realize the only decent content the game has are the bosses. DS1 was praised for the inteconnected world, DS2 and 3 still had shortcuts you could discover by exploring.  The level design once again devolved with ER, with a grace around every corner the shortcuts and the relief from finally finding one are mostly gone. \n\nBosses, I've died to Malenia, Messmer and Radahn dozens of times yet none of them gave me the same dopamine hit from killing Gael or Orphan in maybe one fifth of the tries. It feels like 90% of the challenge with all these big bad bosses are their one or two crazy moves. You'll die over and over to Waterfowl or the big snake combo Messmer has until you figure out when and which way to roll or run. You'll never get that adrenaline rush from getting a boss to 5-10% your first try because these moves solely exist to make older players not whine about everything else by giving the illusion of difficulty while still letting the new \"broader audience\" tank half the combos with their summon. This contrast in difficulty between the world and the bosses also makes the game feel like a boss rush rather than an adventure like the older games.\n\nNarrative, they don't leave things to imagination much compared to the older games. Ranni probably blogs more about the story than the entirety of DS1 dialogue. Around the same amount of NPC questlines in a much bigger world makes the world feel even more barren. Through 3 playthroughs I haven't noticed a Solaire, Lucatiel or Anri. Someone on a similar journey, living their own life you come across multiple times. Maybe they exist but the world isn't interesting enough for me to go find them.\n\nMultiplayer, covenants are gone, invasions are opt-in. All the fun sucked out of it because god forbid the people who already look up everything online would have to look up how to turn invasions off too.\n\nIt's still an okay game but I'm worried where FromSoft is heading. I don't care if some guy who didn't have the dedication to beat the older games now gets to have fun beating bosses with spells/summons/weapon arts as long as it doesn't end up making the game a worse experience but the multiple steps backwards taken in level/world design, narrative, multiplayer are clearly an attempt to make the game more appealing to them, and it affects everyone.\nEven the content people create has gone downhill, from meme videos, challenges and invasions to weapon/spell/x rankings, how to cheese x boss and loreslop (FUCK VAATI)",

The attacks aren't big OR fast, they're big AND fast.\nNavigating detracts from combat. I ended up just racing around with my horse and getting all of the possible waypoints around the map, which seems to be par for the course, but it felt like a waste of my time. Same for walking into a level 40 area at the start, grinding there for a while, and then coming back to all of the bosses dying in 4 hits. Not to mention mounted combat, which has been interesting in concept, and frustrating in practice.\nSpeaking of which, the balance is suboptimal. As a Strength Barbarian, I was fascinated by the stun/knockdown system, but it didn't feel rewarding because you have to keep attacking for so long back-to-back. This incentivized   just gambling on charged heavy attacks and being rewarded for the boss to by chance just use the worst attack on you. It felt gross. I bet other builds like Magic are a lot faster and feel better to play, but I definitely didn't play that build so that's moot to me.\nSo yeah, I can't really recommend it. I wish I could. The game just left me feeling pretty empty and regretful. I think FromSoftware made an okay game, I just don't think it can be justified to recommend others for spending the hours to beat it.

I enjoy learning from my mistakes, improving, dying, trying again, and beating bosses. I defeated 30–40 bosses in Elden Ring without giving up, raging, or complaining about the difficulty.\n\nMy issue is not difficulty, it’s everything else.\n\nStory & Worldbuilding\n\nYes, the world of Elden Ring can be huge, rich, and deep. But a world that big shouldn’t be this vague. The “story” basically consists of a guy shouting at the beginning and a handful of cryptic NPCs who talk like they’re solving riddles. That’s simply not for me.\n\nI want to engage with a story.\nI want an actual script, a main quest that makes sense, something to pull me into the world.\nI shouldn’t have to check item descriptions or chase random weird NPCs across a massive map just to understand the basics of the lore. (Lore of the world, not the story)\n\nSome players enjoy that style and that’s completely fine, but I don’t.\n\nGameplay.....\n\nThis is where the game completely loses me.\n\nElden Ring still uses the same old formula from 2007: slow, clunky, roll–dodge–hit combat that becomes extremely repetitive after a while. After a masterpiece like Sekiro, I genuinely thought FromSoftware would push their combat systems forward. Instead, they went backward.\n\nSure, there are tons of builds and creative options. But at the end of the day, every boss fight ends up feeling like you're just a rolling Pokémon waiting for openings. It’s uninteresting and dull.\n\nVisuals & Exploration\n\nI’ll give credit where it’s due: visually and structurally, the world is stunning. I normally hate getting lost in video games, but Elden Ring’s worldbuilding makes exploration rewarding, every corner has something to discover, and that’s a huge positive.\n\nBut in the end, amazing exploration doesn’t mean much when:\n\n1)The story gives you nothing to hold onto, and\n\n2)The combat system feels boring and outdated.\n\nConclusion\n\nI respect people who love this game, everyone has different tastes. But I genuinely cannot see the appeal. After 42 hours of boredom, I have to drop it midway.\n\nA generous 5/10.",

I think the game would've greatly benefited from being much smaller in scope.\nThere is a lot to love if you like these types of games, especially the DLC which excluding the final boss is my favorite part of the game.",

The trouble with it is that's extremely bloated and far overstays its welcome by drawing things out. It's an enormous kiddie pool with a lot of empty space and not a lot of depth. What you end up with is an experience where you spend most of your time traveling without a lot of action, hit up the necessary bosses and encounters, and make a few pit stops along the way for the things you need while ignoring the roughly 80% of the bland, recycled, and obnoxious filler. There's some 400 weapons and of those weapons maybe 10-20% ever get used. Bosses get repeated often and minor locations are very dull and uninteresting. \n\nThe pacing is also incredibly bi-polar. The first few locations are a breeze, Things pick up a little bit at a time getting into the middle of the game, around the point where you're getting through the capitol. After that things dive off a cliff. Bosses start becoming extremely unforgiving with 9 hit wombo combos, massively inflated damage, and speed and mobility that make them a miserable chore to fight. Regular enemies too gain a jump in health, damage, and poise making them suck considerably more. I've completed this game several times now and every time I want to do a run through I hit a wall right after the capitol where my motivation to continue drops because I remember how unpleasant the last chunk is. There are some exceptions but largely the last third feels rushed and poorly tuned.",

      "review": "I don’t enjoy open world games, so when I saw that Fromsoft was making “open world” dark souls, I feared the worst. My fears were not only met, but surpassed. I don’t foresee myself playing any new title from Fromsoft if they keep trying to take their aging combat system and continue to duct tape Devil May Cry bosses into it. My issues with this game are legion, but I’ll just list off the most poignant ones.\n\n- Enemies can and WILL input read you, and retaliate with frame perfect precision.\n- Enemies can and WILL be put around corners to deal cheap chip damage.\n-Enemies can and WILL do combos that dole out multi hit flurries of attacks that take upwards of 5-8 seconds, that you absolutely CAN’T punish afterwards as the combo actually had another 2-3 hits if you stood near them.\n- Enemies can and WILL use that “ONE” attack, again and again until you die.\n- Quest progression is basically impossible to keep track of without a notepad handy as the game lacks a basic quest log.\n- Progress feels like it resets at the mid-end game due to enemy attacks dealing exponentially more damage.\n- Certain rewards in dungeons can be completely useless for your build (Thanks open world game design!).\n\nThis applies to the DLC as well, but cranked up to 20 as you’ll need to get your Scat-du blessing up to level 20 if you intend to have any fun with this DLC. Gotta love arbitrary difficulty tied directly to world exploration that gets hindered by said enemies blocking your exploration, but hey! Game design is hard.\n\nBest way to play this game is to look up any “How to get OP fast” guide that just tells you where all the OP equipment is and just abuse the broken Ashes of War because, honestly, they’re better than most of the spells you get.",
