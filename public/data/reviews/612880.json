I enjoyed, and am continuing to enjoy, playing it.\r\n\r\nIn my very amateur opinion, the issue has to do with the change in writing tone. The previous game's writing worked because the tone was very much over-the-top oppressive, showcasing incredible suffering and cruelty that was almost cartoonish but played completely straight - and then coupled that with a combination of remarkably tender moments among the main cast, and general wisecracking and quipping to break up the tone and lighten the mood.\r\n\r\nThis game struggles a little more with finding that balance to get the tone just right, for me anyway.",

      "review": "In short, I finished Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus and finally realized it's the best game in the series.\n\nThe first games were a bit of a trial run, but here the guys have really done a great job. The graphics have been improved, and while there are games with better graphics now, the graphics in this game are excellent. The physics and animations have been pumped up when enemies fly apart, it looks incredibly cool.\n\nThe story in Wolfenstein was never a strong point, but here it's interesting. The most memorable mission is the one where you're in a wheelchair... and taking down Nazis. It's simply brilliant.\n\nThe developers have really worked on the gunplay. The weapons feel real, and each gun has its own weight. The enemies aren't just dumb bots; they actually coordinate their actions, shouting at each other, trying to outflank them. They all look different, so you can immediately tell who you're dealing with.\n\nDifficulty wise... Especially on Mein Leben... It's excruciatingly difficult, but doable. By the end, the Destroyer kept killing me, even though I knew how to defeat it. I was just rushing and doing stupid things. On this difficulty level, you have to constantly stealth, which can be tiring at times, but it's so satisfying when you get through the entire location without a hitch.\n\nBJ weapon upgrades and enhancements are thoughtfully crafted. These aren't just stats, they're truly gameplay-changing. Stilts or the squeezing device aren't just new abilities, they're full-fledged mechanics that add incredible variety.\n\nThe most amazing thing is that in 10 hours of play, I experienced more emotions and more memorable moments than in hundreds of hours in some open-world game where all you do is run from marker to marker.\n\nAfter projects like these, you realize that creating games isn't just a business. It's a responsibility. Responsibility for the story, for the atmosphere, for every element of gameplay. And most importantly, there are no cases, donation currency, or mandatory online play. It's a pure gaming experience. Special respect to the developers for this",

      "review": "10/10 – A Brutal, Emotional, and Unforgettable Masterpiece\n\nWolfenstein II: The New Colossus is a triumph of storytelling, action, and pure adrenaline. It’s one of the most thrilling shooters of its generation, combining over-the-top combat, deeply engaging characters, and a narrative that’s surprisingly emotional and thought-provoking.\n\nStepping back into the boots of B.J. Blazkowicz, players lead the resistance against a Nazi-occupied America in an alternate 1960s timeline. The game blends cinematic storytelling with relentless, satisfying combat, offering a variety of weapons, abilities, and tactical approaches. Every encounter feels intense and rewarding, and the sheer scale of set pieces—from stealthy infiltration to all-out firefights—is breathtaking.\n\nThe story is darker, bolder, and more personal than its predecessor. Themes of resistance, family, and identity are explored with nuance, and the character interactions are unforgettable. Voice acting, motion capture, and cutscenes are top-tier, giving the world a cinematic depth rarely seen in shooters.\n\nVisually, the game is stunning: detailed environments, dynamic lighting, and impressive animations bring the alternate-history America to life. The soundtrack and sound design complement the action perfectly, heightening tension and making combat feel impactful.\n\nCompared to other Wolfenstein games:\n\nThe New Order introduced the cinematic storytelling and solid gameplay formula.\n\nThe New Colossus takes everything to the next level with more ambition, emotional depth, and sheer spectacle.\n\nIt’s a perfect blend of narrative, gameplay, and style—a game that entertains, excites, and sticks with you long after the credits roll.\n\n10/10 – Brutal, brilliant, and unforgettable.",

BJ's backstory in particular is quite interesting and tragic. \r\nThe gunplay is still great. Both choices, either stealth or guns blazing are still valid, though I would say that stealth is a bit harder as enemies are more vigilant than the first game. \r\n\r\nLess rigid weapon upgrade and perk system compared to the first game\r\n\r\nGraphics and particle effects are significantly better compared to the first game. The fire effects in particular are mesmerizing even on my old setup. \r\n\r\nCons:\r\nThere are some frustrating parts (like the end of the Venus level) that are essentially instant fail sections if you mess up stealth. \r\nCertain weapons are far more viable than others regardless of playstyle. In the first game you could essentially run around with anything and kill most enemies. In this game armor piercing on the STG or the super charged laser rifle will dispatch basically any enemy with relative ease. The pistol and SMG are better for stealth, and the shotgun honestly kind of sucks compared to how good it was in the first game. The heavy weapons are still fun, but the heavy shotgun kind of blows unless you're pretty close.",

The environments, characters and mechanics are very nice and the story, although extremely linear as usual, does a great job in not only continuing what happened in the last game, but also adding context, worldbuilding and a great ending that doesn't leave you guessing. The places you go to in this game are so interesting that sometimes it's fun to just look around and appreciate all the little details and gags. The characters might be a bit goofy at times, but the game doesn't overdo it and it honestly just adds to the charm the game gives off at times.\n\nOverall, The New Colossus is an amazing sequel that delivers in almost every aspect and can afford to not be too serious when it needs to, yet still retaining that Wolfenstein edge to it.",

      "review": "Played the 2009 episode, The New Order and The Old Blood (and I still remember how very different the latter two were from the former, after all the franchise had been handed to MachineGames) in the mid 2010s but took all these years to get here because of a long hiatus in \"active\" gaming. After hearing disparate things about this game, I think some criticism is fair, other unwarranted.\n\nSo better start from the bottom.\nTNO was good at mixing over the top elements with drama, especially when showing a world mostly fallen under Nazi rule; here, the balance too often tips on the former side, resulting in moments that are too silly and overacted, some truly insufferable characters (who thought Spesh was good to have such a large role in the middle part of the game?), and at least a couple times where I wondered if the story hadn't jumped the shark. Given the theme of the game, expecting for it to not be political is silly and TNO was not subtle but this is far too unsubtle. And the less is said about that infamous scene with Anya near the end, the better.\nOn the gameplay side, damage feedback is really bad and, even with the maps, navigating a level can be quite difficult at times, like correctly identifying crawlspaces. The New York maps are among the most impressive and detailed, even just for the shock and awe of seeing the city reduced to a nuclear wasteland, but turn into the biggest pain after a while. Also for a game where you can also play stealthy, I'm suprised that some traversal abilities are inferior to a not-stealthy game like Doom.\nI don't get why some people said this game was short, it's far from it, but the disappointment likely stems from how anticlimatic the ending feels, even more as the content you can tackle after it (but even before that) is just Ubercommander missions that consist in replaying maps - padding. The sensation may have been further soured by how the following episode turned out, but that's a story for another day.\nI also felt that beside the Venus sections and the always etremely cool tech, the game had nothing to really impress me style-wise but that's a likely consequence of playing the predecessor when it was still new, compared to this one. At least the pop-in issues I saw plenty of times in TNO back then, were rare and small occurrences here.\n\nHowever, excluding the padded content, the experience has been extremely satisfying in the end, to the point of becoming the only game I'd play during its second half, maybe not coincidentally a point where the story, after getting extremely bleak, starts becoming more optimistic and hopeful. \nWhat I recalled most fondly about TNO was that, even if the enemy AI can get quite dumb (something MachineGames seems unable or unwilling to fix, given what I've heard about their recent Indiana Jones game), for most of the time going guns blazing, or stealthy, or a mix of the two was always valid, something that has stayed here. I love going silently, popping heads with the silenced pistol from a distance, to eliminate commanders only to then find a lasergewehr and mow down any remaining resistance in the area. I also like that, at first, you may go without even looking at the perks, and only after a while realize that you're effectively getting the ones that fit your playstyle.\nThere's an impressive number of collectibles, including the return of the records from these alternate early Sixties. So many that, in fact, I could have lived without those Star Cards. Lore items are plenty and I love how they make this world feel more lived-in, like letters and other texts that humanize some Nazi officers and soldiers while not making them necessarily sympathetic, going with the theme that it's an error to think only monsters could do atrocities, it's \"merely\" human beings.\nThe story has embarassing lows but when it reaches highs, it really does. The character of Sigrun Engel and her arc, the unflattering portrayal of an aged Hitler, or the whole part in the town of Roswell - it's in fact one of those games that, in light of the social and political situations ongoing in the mid 2020s, can even leave feeling chills down your spine. Frau Engel has not even that much screen time but also thanks to that, she steals the scene in every apperance.\nAlso ignoring once again the padded content, it's quite replayable not just for the mixing of gameplay styles it allows for the most part, but to experience the differences in the Wyatt and Fergus timelines.\n\nIt stumbles on its way, sometimes badly, but ultimately it succeeds in making killing (super-science) nazis always fun.",

      "review": "It's got a lengthy campaign with an engaging story and great characters and dialogue. While on the whole the gameplay is pretty fun, there were some puzzling decisions with it and some straight up design flaws; if you use a controller to play, certain things have a rumble response but your guns do not, which makes them not feel as punchy. There are also no hit markers for enemies which can be kind of annoying, especially because many maps have environmental effects that reduce visibility. The cover system is also kind of janky. If you aren't hiding behind a perfect geometric shape, you sometimes will pop out to fire your weapon only to be abruptly forced back into position mid-shot (Note: this may just be a controller issue. I don't know if it works better on keyboard and mouse). Luckily(?) cover is of limited use, because like in other Wolfenstein games many enemies will simply run up to you and start firing point-blank. \n\nThere is also an \"issue\" with graphics/performance...kind of. I have an NVIDIA geforce GTX 1080--not exactly a powerhouse, so I did some provisional downgrading of a few video/graphics settings before beginning to play and the game consistently ran at 60fps while still looking good. After a couple hours of playing though the game I got a notification that my memory had been maxed out (I have 32gb RAM) and that I should further reduce my settings or potentially suffer performance issues. So I did this. Still wound up getting the same message, still saw no drop in performance. Once it became apparent I wasn't simply getting lucky avoiding crashes/freezes and was actually running the game fine, I turned settings back up to what they were previously and continued playing without issue despite this notification continuing to come up at the start of each play session. I have no idea what to make of this but the minor inconvenience of having to mute this message every time I loaded in was obviously far better than having actual performance issues. YMMV. Maybe.

I have to applaud Machine Games for this. It lines up with other great developer studios like Arkane, who made Dishonored, for example. Although Arkane has disappointed me now more than once, Machine Games has so far not done that.\n\nWolfenstein is amazing in its style—how gruesome and absurdly evil and ridiculous it is. It's just like a Tarantino movie as a game. Imagine Inglourious Basterds as a game—somewhere in that direction but more ridiculous.\n\nIt has all the ingredients for success. It's portraying Nazis from a somewhat smirking viewpoint about their pompous and ridiculous art and imaginations of what they will become and already are.\n\nThe soundtrack is humorous and ridiculous at the same time and adds to the overall flair of the game.\n\nSince I'm German, I appreciate the perfect German speech done clearly by German voice actors, which is another example of Machine Games putting in the work to make the game more authentic.\n\nIf you want Robotdogs, flying saucers and the Nazi Moon Base or Hitler pissing in a bucket and yelling around as a senile old fuck, this is the game for you and you will love it. :D",

Gradually pour in the water, constantly stirring. Knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic.\nResting the dough: Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or cover it with a towel and let it rest for 30 minutes.\nPreparing the filling:\nBoiling the potatoes: Peel the potatoes, cut them into large pieces, and boil until tender in salted water.\nPreparing the onions: While the potatoes are boiling, finely chop the onions. Sauté the onions in lard or butter until golden brown.\nMaking the potato puree: Drain the potatoes and mash them. Add the sautéed onions, salt, and pepper to taste, and mix well.\nForming the dumplings:\nRolling out the dough: Roll out the dough into a thin sheet about 2-3 mm thick. Use a glass or cutter to cut out circles approximately 7-8 cm in diameter.\nForming the dumplings: Place a spoonful of potato filling on each circle of dough. Fold the dough in half and pinch the edges tightly to seal the dumplings.\nCooking the dumplings:\nBoiling water: Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add salt.\nCooking the dumplings: Gently drop the dumplings into the boiling water, stirring carefully to prevent sticking. Cook until done (approximately 5-7 minutes after they float to the surface).\nServing:\nRemoving the dumplings: Remove the dumplings with a slotted spoon and place them on a plate.\nServing: Serve the dumplings hot, optionally drizzling with melted butter, sour cream, or sautéed onions.\nEnjoy your meal!",

But all this does is floods the level with endlessly respawning enemies, whether the plot justifies it or not (how are infinite enemies fitting inside the limited space of a sealed-off submarine section, exactly?).

It's what to be expected with hyper realistic graphics and clutter and funky wunky lightning, can't see a damn thing.\r\n\r\nThe other criticism is that considering how trigger happy enemies are and how well they can suddenly just flank you I think they hurt you one hell of a lot more than you hurt them, their body shot health pool should have been lowered by 20-40% honestly.",

I actually run a low dpi so anyone with a DPI of 1200+ would most certainly have the same issue I did, which could only be reasolved through a console command (m_sensitivity I think).

      "review": "I don't hate the game, but TNO clearly sets up many good things that felt like a no-brainer for them to return.\n\nMy biggest gripe is the weapons, OG Laserkraftwerk is gone as well as the laser cutting mechanic (you still get an imitation if you gone to Fergus's timeline) the Doom-inspired double barrelled shotgun and the AR Marksman, instead your Assault rifle become a semi-auto sniper though it does comes with a neat armor-piercing mod for armored enemies. Weapon upgrades aren't things you picked up by the places, it's delegated to upgrade kits that you can collect throughout the campaign. Not a bad thing per se, but definitely less enjoyment than TNO. Still boggles my mind the change in weaponary since the game only happened 6 months after the ending of TNO.\n\nStealth like TNO are optional and still affects only one area before you go forward even if the next area is a door's away. Unfortunately, some pesky enemy types will show up and basically forces you to go loud. Some place have 'em, some place doesn't.\n\nI've played both TNO and TNC on the same difficulty that is 'I am Death Incarnate', unfortunately B.J in TNC is much weaker, so you'll have to heavily use the cover/lean system which are jankier than TNO somehow. For that I do not recommend the very difficulty, stick to lower than 'I am Death Incarnate'\n\nThere's no bossfights, game ended abruptly. Many sideplots are abandoned, most characters are side-lined.\n\nVisual clarity, the new engine they use for TNC makes the game alot darker than it should, half the roster of the enemy blend to the background, foggy areas literally makes you blind (enemy's can see fine though).\n\nThe DLCs are 3 short episodes of 3 different characters that use 3 of the mid-game mechanic. I didn't finished as I've lost interest of the whole game after the ending. Also, doesn't help my DLC's were bugged and I can't progress.\n\nThere's still stuffs I enjoy throughout the game,\n- The new base is breathtakingly cool (atleast for me)\n- The new robot guard enemy is terrifying\n- The different mechanic you can pick up mid-game are awesome\n- Finishers are cool\n- Axe instead of Knife\n- Basically Halo 2's dual wield, but feels iffy",

Stop trashing our games. We want men killing nazis not lesbians dancing and being fking gay with an rpg element. Put a chick in it and make her gay. This game was the last wolfenstein with actual good gameplay. Not health bars. But the communist woke slop they threw in ruined it for me. I beat the games story but that was it, deleted it after. Only bought it for like 5$ so for that price I guess its worth it but for full price I wouldve gotten a refund. You literally go rescue a bunch of communists in new orleans and they spout communist propaganda instead of being american resistance its literally like the hicks in new orleans were ussr fanboys, no american flags, literally a sickle and hammer with red and yellow flag. As if the american resistance would be communist of all things. I almost turned off the game when I realized they were pushing an ideology other then what the american resistance and BJ blaskowitz would obviously stand for. Super dumb and just a leftist propaganda push nothing else. The gameplay got me through cus it was honestly just like new order in that sense.

I do not enjoy stealth in any form, so I don't have fun sneaking through levels. So I run and gun in. But all this does is floods the level with endlessly respawning enemies, whether the plot justifies it or not (how are infinite enemies fitting inside the limited space of a sealed-off submarine section, exactly?). In order to make the infinite respawning stop, you have to make a mad dash through the level and follow your compass reading that directly points to the commanders you need to kill in order for the infinite enemies to become finite. So...basically....you can either play stealth, or make a mad dash through EVERY SINGLE LEVEL before you even can get a chance to explore it to track down the f***ing commanders so you can walk around without enemies shooting at you. \n\nLike I said, this idea is great on paper. Players can pick their style of play: stealth, or a mad fire fight. But that fire fight is not a fun alternative to the stealth, because the only way to make the fight not a waste of ammo and health is to madly dash through the level not paying attention to anything but the compass that's tracking the commanders. THEN you get to backtrack through the level you just ran through because the enemies are all scattered behind you...it just feels like a mess and a waste of my time?

They don't fit right and I had no idea when the game (if any) was going to start.\r\n\r\nI sat through about 5 minutes twice because I just wanted 5 minutes of action last night and quite. This morning it started over. My suggestion, if you buy this game, is start it up and go have a cup of tea. come back, make your first selected, go have dinner. Come back, put up the bottle, wait, press the mouse key. Repeat until cut scenes are over.\r\n\r\nPrepare, I am guessing, for lots of keybreaks. Walkthroughs will probably summarise what you didn't see but won't miss not having seen.",

      "review": "The \"kill the commander first\" mechanic is a good idea on paper, but in practice it actually ruins the game for me. Which sucks because *every single encounter* works like this. I do not enjoy stealth in any form, so I don't have fun sneaking through levels. So I run and gun in. But all this does is floods the level with endlessly respawning enemies, whether the plot justifies it or not (how are infinite enemies fitting inside the limited space of a sealed-off submarine section, exactly?). In order to make the infinite respawning stop, you have to make a mad dash through the level and follow your compass reading that directly points to the commanders you need to kill in order for the infinite enemies to become finite. So...basically....you can either play stealth, or make a mad dash through EVERY SINGLE LEVEL before you even can get a chance to explore it to track down the f***ing commanders so you can walk around without enemies shooting at you. \n\nLike I said, this idea is great on paper. Players can pick their style of play: stealth, or a mad fire fight. But that fire fight is not a fun alternative to the stealth, because the only way to make the fight not a waste of ammo and health is to madly dash through the level not paying attention to anything but the compass that's tracking the commanders. THEN you get to backtrack through the level you just ran through because the enemies are all scattered behind you...it just feels like a mess and a waste of my time? I hated this feature in New Blood and I am disappointed it is still in this game. New Order was so much fun, I am bummed they didn't just continue with what worked with that. Oh well, I guess. \n\ni be streaming this and other fun things @ https://www.twitch.tv/crustyoldhuman",

Weapon upgrades aren't things you picked up by the places, it's delegated to upgrade kits that you can collect throughout the campaign. Not a bad thing per se, but definitely less enjoyment than TNO. Still boggles my mind the change in weaponary since the game only happened 6 months after the ending of TNO.\n\nStealth like TNO are optional and still affects only one area before you go forward even if the next area is a door's away. Unfortunately, some pesky enemy types will show up and basically forces you to go loud. Some place have 'em, some place doesn't.\n\nI've played both TNO and TNC on the same difficulty that is 'I am Death Incarnate', unfortunately B.J in TNC is much weaker, so you'll have to heavily use the cover/lean system which are jankier than TNO somehow. For that I do not recommend the very difficulty, stick to lower than 'I am Death Incarnate'\n\nThere's no bossfights, game ended abruptly. Many sideplots are abandoned, most characters are side-lined.\n\nVisual clarity, the new engine they use for TNC makes the game alot darker than it should, half the roster of the enemy blend to the background, foggy areas literally makes you blind (enemy's can see fine though).\n\nThe DLCs are 3 short episodes of 3 different characters that use 3 of the mid-game mechanic. I didn't finished as I've lost interest of the whole game after the ending. Also, doesn't help my DLC's were bugged and I can't progress.\n\nThere's still stuffs I enjoy throughout the game,\n- The new base is breathtakingly cool (atleast for me)\n- The new robot guard enemy is terrifying\n- The different mechanic you can pick up mid-game are awesome\n- Finishers are cool\n- Axe instead of Knife\n- Basically Halo 2's dual wield, but feels iffy",

This game was the last wolfenstein with actual good gameplay. Not health bars. But the communist woke slop they threw in ruined it for me. I beat the games story but that was it, deleted it after. Only bought it for like 5$ so for that price I guess its worth it but for full price I wouldve gotten a refund. You literally go rescue a bunch of communists in new orleans and they spout communist propaganda instead of being american resistance its literally like the hicks in new orleans were ussr fanboys, no american flags, literally a sickle and hammer with red and yellow flag. As if the american resistance would be communist of all things. I almost turned off the game when I realized they were pushing an ideology other then what the american resistance and BJ blaskowitz would obviously stand for. Super dumb and just a leftist propaganda push nothing else. The gameplay got me through cus it was honestly just like new order in that sense.

My biggest gripe has been lack of fundamental control adjustments, like the inability to enable hold to crouch vs toggle.

OH, and for w/e reason this game has an insanely fast mouse speed out the gate even with the lowest setting applied. I actually run a low dpi so anyone with a DPI of 1200+ would most certainly have the same issue I did, which could only be reasolved through a console command (m_sensitivity I think).  I played for an hour or so, and once I encountered some very piculiar and awkward level design elements I decided to cash-out.
