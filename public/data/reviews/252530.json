And guess what? Once you buy the chicago DLC, you cna only drive TWO bus routes, just two, and you can even buy another DLC \"London UK\" where it cost cheaper and has 16 bus routes, and chicago dlc only has 2 and is more expensive, and yet, it cost almost the same price of the main game. And also the omni navigation, it cost 10-15 dollars for a waypoint, I mean sure, i'd say it looks pretty cool, I dont actually have it yet but ive seen it in videos and i think 10-15 dollars is way too much money for such a tiny thing. This game also has medium quality and yet, it cost 40 dollars. The devs really need to fix this game and stop being so damn pricey. And it's not just this. They recently made another game called City Bus Manager about an year ago, and its almost the same price, and it's a game where you just make your own bus routes around the world, as in graphics, its pertty low quality and you can't even drive any busses yourself, the only reason I know this even though I don't have it is because a friend of mine is addicted to it and shows me his gameplay sometimes. And i looked at other games that this company \"Aerosoft\" made, and guess what, most of their other games are like 30-40 dollars. Like what do they need so much money for? And no i dont expect for everything to be free, i think the price is just too high for such a buggy game.",

They recently made another game called City Bus Manager about an year ago, and its almost the same price, and it's a game where you just make your own bus routes around the world, as in graphics, its pertty low quality and you can't even drive any busses yourself, the only reason I know this even though I don't have it is because a friend of mine is addicted to it and shows me his gameplay sometimes. And i looked at other games that this company \"Aerosoft\" made, and guess what, most of their other games are like 30-40 dollars. Like what do they need so much money for? And no i dont expect for everything to be free, i think the price is just too high for such a buggy game.",

OMSI 2 is a 1:1 simulator of being a bus driver but that comes at such a significant cost of practical functionality that the game is just unplayable. Key bindings that just nebulously don't work. Tutorials that soft lock. Graphics that don't render properly. Blurry textures. Settings that make no sense. Clumsy interface. Ridiculous load times. The list goes on and on. This is a simulator in the truest sense and that's not a good thing. The game came out in 2013 but honestly looks and feels like something from at least a decade earlier. The absurd DLC model is just icing on the cake, with almost $2K of payware to fully enjoy the game, including entire maps and new buses.

This game is full of bugs and very complicated, especially the editor and the chicago DLC, the editor is WAY to complicated and the chicago DLC is super buggy, especially when youre making your own bus livery. And guess what? Once you buy the chicago DLC, you cna only drive TWO bus routes, just two, and you can even buy another DLC \"London UK\" where it cost cheaper and has 16 bus routes, and chicago dlc only has 2 and is more expensive, and yet, it cost almost the same price of the main game. And also the omni navigation, it cost 10-15 dollars for a waypoint, I mean sure, i'd say it looks pretty cool, I dont actually have it yet but ive seen it in videos and i think 10-15 dollars is way too much money for such a tiny thing. This game also has medium quality and yet, it cost 40 dollars. The devs really need to fix this game and stop being so damn pricey. And it's not just this.
