Shoot\n\n2. Slide\n\n3. Punch a projectile back into someone’s colon at Mach 3\n\n4. Surf on blood like it’s a morally questionable Slip ‘N Slide\n\n5. Wonder why your heart rate is similar to a nuclear reactor’s\n\nStory? Yes. It exists. It is delivered through environmental details, cryptic messages, and the distinct sensation that Hell has filed a restraining order against you.\n\nBoss fights?\nMy therapist advised me not to talk about them.\n\nSoundtrack?\nMy ceiling fan has been vibrating ever since I turned it up. My neighbor knocked and asked if I was “summoning something.”\n\nGraphics?\nBeautiful. Gorgeous. Like someone took the 1990s, set them on fire, and told you to parkour through the ashes.\n\nOverall, ULTRAKILL has:\n-taught me aggression\n-redefined violence as a form of cardio\n-and replaced my bloodstream with 100% pure adrenaline\n\n10/10.\nBuy it.\nBecome a war crime with legs.",

This means that the \"player expression\" is more of a facade than anything else as it pushes you to vary up your weapons for variety's sake and little else. The ranking is mostly superfluous aside from it helping with your hp regeneration, but even then the stylish part itself is not that engaging, at least in DMC, when you style on something you get to combo and lock down said enemies in the air as a result of your skills, but without significant stagger it loses much of its appeal.\n\nArena and boss design is similarly vapid due to this rigidity. With so little crowd control aside from the techniques to maximize dps, most enemy rooms turn into clusterfucks of projectiles where you spam the blood regen to tank the shots, and the bosses are mostly simplistic pattern memorization fights, where not even parries stops their onslaught, which makes such manoeuvres feel flaccid despite offering a lot of benefits in regenerating your health and dealing damage.\n\nWhile not totally devoid of cool ideas as seen by the coin ricochets and some cool weapons, it is a game that has ridden more on its hype rather than the substance of its mechanics. The mark of amateurish design is to be seen everywhere, like how, for example, the game has secret collectables for you to pick up, but also simultaneously punishes you in your ranking for taking too long to explore the level. It is this lack of attention to detail and messy design that makes Ultrakill a gimmick rather than a true stepping stone for boomer shooters.",

However, this game is VERY STINGY on what counts as \"in melee range\" to the point where it is more frustrating than fun to use for me. It's only really viable against relatively slow projectiles, because trying to parry anything else feels like your trying to hit a bullseye with a blindfold on.
