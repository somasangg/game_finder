I see the immense potential in this game. \r\nBUT! THIS GAME NEED MORE PVE CONTENT!\r\nThe one thing I have issue with so far is the lack of SP content. It is heavily geared towrds MP PVP and I just don´t car efor it because the MP is kinda not that fun imo. \r\nI would LOVE more PVE stuff! This game could honestly be one of the BEST Gundam or mech games on Steam if there was just more SP mission content and PVE stuff tbh.\r\nIf my review of this game can lead to any change or improvement of this game at all. Then PLEASE, MAKE MORE PVE STUFF!\r\nYou have shown that it is possible in all the tutorial missions. They show that there is a possibility to make cool story and senario like missions in the game. You have already made missions that could be perfect. \r\nThey are just too small in scale and too limited. \r\nMake the MP sorties but with full BOT support too. THat would be so much fun tbh. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE do more PVE stuff!",

But someone else got the cooler version with another game.  I'd recommend a better menu. Not sure about the hub world. In my opinion, a simple hangar screen where you accept missions or queue up with other members would be very nice. Just want to clarify, the amount of M O B I L E  S U I T S  is very awesome. I just can't hop on board with the 'loot crate' esque type games.  I'd prefer to work for the gundam I desire obtaining upgrades acquired via a campaign or some kind of plot driven story, so I know what the atmosphere is for the game world, along with multiplayer based challenge system to shake up the meta. which i think is already there.  I know it's different for devs & publishers now, but a skill or achievement based way of obtaining certain items is always nice. along with the \"i saved up for this so i appreciate it more\".  again gameplay is fun.  just couldn't dive deeper.  i'd like to revisit or play an older gundam game.  thank you for the effort and detail that was put into the game.  I learned some tactics that I will carry to other titles as well.  Cheers.",

Nub:5 games on literal life support the only thing keeping the lights on are the whales that spend insane amount of money on this zombie of game that should have died around 2022 it literally released 2018 and games buggy as well. hopefully this helps you choose differently before you ever spand money on this game so it can final die in peace and bandai can put resources on a new gundam project thats better.",

The rock paper scissors match up with the types means you get rewarded for going after the class you counter and maps restricted some play styles while rewarding others encouraging you to use Different Mobile suits each match.\n\nNowdays your facing Mobile suits from like UC 100+ in mobile suits from the Neo Zeon wars era, which have so much more abilities like Flap Boosters, which completely overshadow anything that does not have them, or Mobile suits like the G-cannon or the Den'an Zon, that really don't care about how much ballistic resist you have, and will just decimate your legs with rapid MG fire, or the F90 Gundam's with various gimmicks in like I Type with its flying jousting stick that is ridiculously hard to stagger.\n\nAnd the future does not look any better, with the announcement of 6 monthly additions of Mobile suits from alternate universes, like recent addition of the Wing Gundams for the 30th Anniversary (which were way overpowered), and the recent Crossbone Gundam X-1 which, like the Wing Gundam, seem to be on the way overpowered side and really dont care about the rock paper scissors system, or being punished for mistakes, All of which are easy to get, given that you spend X amount of tokens to 100% get it for those with money.",

      "review": "Mobile Suit Gundam: Battle Operation II was an incredible game when it first released, especially on PlayStation rather than Steam. See, I love Gundam, and I’m willing to bear through the faults of this game because there’s nothing else like it. There’s no other experience where you can engage in skirmishes and direct combat with real opponents in such a unique way.\n\nThe problems I have with this game mostly come from the Steam version. There are simply too many game modes for the current player count. You have three modes for quick play and three for ranked matches, but the lobbies are so barren and devoid of any players that you can end up waiting two hours in a public lobby, only for the timer to run out before it fills.\n\nThe only way I can reliably get a match is by creating my own custom game and waiting for the lobby to fill—but let’s be honest, that’s difficult too. Most players don’t like to wait. If even one person leaves, it starts a chain reaction where everyone else follows, and you end up alone again. The amount of people that come in and leave is frustrating. If players would just wait for others and stay, matches would start in no time. Unfortunately, no one seems to understand this concept.\n\nMSG BO2 is 8–10 years old now. It’s time for a new game—one with smaller cities or towns, with human NPCs, cars, and helicopters flying around. Imagine even being able to see the action from their perspective during the “best play” highlights. For a replayable game, some of the maps just feel too big. They don’t make you feel like you’re in a giant Gundam destroying the landscape, which takes away from the immersion of piloting a massive mobile suit.\n\nThe stagger mechanic also needs to be reworked. Turning is too slow, and Gundams topple over far too easily. All it takes is a Crossbone Gundam X-1 Kai to fly at you, shoot a few times to stagger, and then land three melee hits that deal massive damage. This new meta is so cheesy—everyone uses that Gundam and spams engagements. There shouldn’t even be flying in ground matches; it’s an unfair advantage that gives too much power to burst and retreat.\n\nTo be competitive, you basically need the best component parts to have a worthy Gundam. Personally, the only mobile suits I use are my favorites: Unicorn, Banshee, and Phenex. I can’t be bothered with lower-cost suits—the whole reason I play is to use my favorites and go for wins. Unfortunately, the balancing feels really broken. Some Gundams are just flat-out better than others in terms of movesets, damage, and agility.\n\nSometimes I wonder why I still play. They really need to make an updated version with improved lobbies, where you can walk around and use your Gundam while waiting for the match to fill. The Steam version gets no promotion, and with new games constantly coming out, MSG BO2 feels like the last of a dying breed. Bandai Namco really needs to invest in a new installment.\n\nAll they’d have to do is re-engineer the existing game: update it, import all the suits into the new version, invent new movesets and animations, and make it more user-friendly and easier to understand. And seriously, the sword spam and stagger mechanics have become pathetic, with players just rushing in and spamming sabers. It’s sad to see such a great game weighed down by these issues.",

Nub:5 games on literal life support the only thing keeping the lights on are the whales that spend insane amount of money on this zombie of game that should have died around 2022 it literally released 2018 and games buggy as well. hopefully this helps you choose differently before you ever spand money on this game so it can final die in peace and bandai can put resources on a new gundam project thats better.",

The rock paper scissors match up with the types means you get rewarded for going after the class you counter and maps restricted some play styles while rewarding others encouraging you to use Different Mobile suits each match.\n\nNowdays your facing Mobile suits from like UC 100+ in mobile suits from the Neo Zeon wars era, which have so much more abilities like Flap Boosters, which completely overshadow anything that does not have them, or Mobile suits like the G-cannon or the Den'an Zon, that really don't care about how much ballistic resist you have, and will just decimate your legs with rapid MG fire, or the F90 Gundam's with various gimmicks in like I Type with its flying jousting stick that is ridiculously hard to stagger.\n\nAnd the future does not look any better, with the announcement of 6 monthly additions of Mobile suits from alternate universes, like recent addition of the Wing Gundams for the 30th Anniversary (which were way overpowered), and the recent Crossbone Gundam X-1 which, like the Wing Gundam, seem to be on the way overpowered side and really dont care about the rock paper scissors system, or being punished for mistakes, All of which are easy to get, given that you spend X amount of tokens to 100% get it for those with money.",
