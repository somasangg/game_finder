The landscape in the base game is cool and some DLC's are in a league of its own if it was based on landscape purely. \n\nMe and all my friends have stopped playing, since going a save back in convoy is no longer an option. This was removed in one of the updates a while ago. Now we are forced to pay money to tow and repair our trucks, which takes away the fun for us.

[/h1]\r\n\r\nIt has been 13 years, a full [b][u]DECADE[/u][/b] since ETS\" release, they are no small company anymore, for the last 5 years they grew exponentialy. SCS is a 300+ Employess Game Studio. that REFUSES invest to overhaul and modernize their 20 year old game and physics engine. (YES, Prism is THAT old, if nor older, its a heirloom from 18wos and the companies attatched to that). and don't even try to defend them saying its impossible or very hard, because, with less GREED, it is possible. \r\n\r\nSee raceroom for example, it is as old as ETS2, and had receive a HUMOUNGUS game engine and graphics overhaul in the last 5 years. and they implement things that the community yearns for or  show interest (like the BTCC 1999 series car, man thats a blast!). \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on ETS2, is either a MAP dlc, Trailers and cargo stuck with their elderly game engine and tunning packs. The free trucks are far and few between. the new volvos are the new trucks since the DAF XG. While we still have scania R2009, DAF 106 and 105 with assets straight out 2008. The truck accessories are 13 year old assets with jagged edges. we have squared up wheels... The game most of the time seems like a bootleg of some sort... one minute you're driving the reworked parts of Switzerland, the next minute you're on 13 years old assets roads bound to france. its sad, pathetic and infuriating at the same time.\r\n\r\nLast year, SCS had a net Revenue north of 25 million euros. I Why not implement Rigid Chassis? why not Specialty chassis for the Over sized cargoes DLC? I believe 25 Million its more than enough resources to put people on a task-force to Overhaul the Prism Engine, or even Crate a second Iteration. Why bother rework trucks with high-poly models and high textures if the game struggles to render those on modern hardware? game can only use 1 CPU Core, when on average most people have a at least a 4 core CPU... The game is a fckking stutter fest most of the time. They try to implement these \"features\" of seamless loading, new cargo loading tech and such and praising it as such HUGE tech achievement, but guess what? some dudes fueled by frozen pizza and beers made that years ago as a mod.\r\n\r\nThey're a \"investing\" on a game engine old enough to vote and drink, with no significant overhaul or improvements, and by the rumors, impossible to upgrade or change in a meaningful way without breaking it completely.\r\n\r\nAnd why they keep doing all that? Lack of Competition.\r\n\r\nThey're the only decent truck simulation on the market, so they have 0 incentive or pressure to do any better.\r\n\r\nThey NEED to have competition, the competition benefits US, the consumers. the player base and the industry as a whole.\r\n\r\nI have 700+ hours in it, those hours were possible thanks to the 1500 mods i have spread across multiples careers, without those mods, the game is bland, unfinished, and impossible to play for a long period of time, borderlining on the forever early access limbo scam some games have.\r\n\r\nJust make the Prism Engine BETTER.",

The Polish highway map in 2025 is completely different, much better, in fact, than in 2012. The textures are from a previous era, and the road layout is reminiscent of the PS1 game. This region is in the middle, between the Balkans, the Black Sea, the Baltics, the rest of the base game, and Scandinavia, and anyone wanting to travel there has to go back in time a dozen or so years.

I hate to mix politics with leisure, but have to make an exception in this case.  The optics of releasing a such a product during Russia's ongoing attempted genocide of the Ukrainian people and bloody conquest of sovereign Ukrainian soil could not be worse.\n\nSuch a DLC can easily be (mis)interpreted(?) as promoting Russian imperialism with a blind-eye towards the unjust barbaric massacre of Ukrainians and attempted conquest of their nation.  Especially when its release  has apparently been prioritized over a Ukraine DLC (any takers for a research trip there).   \n\nWhat exactly is the long-term road-map here?  Glorify the \"victorious\" past of Russia's interior, while ignoring any current and future humanitarian atrocities it commits at its borders?  Then wait to see where those borders settle out before making a DLC of Ukraine, assuming it still exists as nation, or release a \"Russia Westward Expansion\" DLC otherwise?\n\nI also contend that my comments are entirely appropriate for a video game review.  All product reviews are subjective to the reviewer's personal experience.  In this case, seeing that a game will eventually include content that egregiously offends my personal sensibilities has now completely negated any enjoyment I can get from it.  \n\nHow can I recommend a game that I no longer enjoy playing as a direct result of future content announced by it's creator?

SCS is a 300+ Employess Game Studio. that REFUSES invest to overhaul and modernize their 20 year old game and physics engine.

The free trucks are far and few between. the new volvos are the new trucks since the DAF XG. While we still have scania R2009, DAF 106 and 105 with assets straight out 2008. The truck accessories are 13 year old assets with jagged edges. we have squared up wheels...

I Why not implement Rigid Chassis? why not Specialty chassis for the Over sized cargoes DLC? I believe 25 Million its more than enough resources to put people on a task-force to Overhaul the Prism Engine, or even Crate a second Iteration. Why bother rework trucks with high-poly models and high textures if the game struggles to render those on modern hardware? game can only use 1 CPU Core, when on average most people have a at least a 4 core CPU... The game is a fckking stutter fest most of the time. They try to implement these \"features\" of seamless loading, new cargo loading tech and such and praising it as such HUGE tech achievement, but guess what? some dudes fueled by frozen pizza and beers made that years ago as a mod.\r\n\r\nThey're a \"investing\" on a game engine old enough to vote and drink, with no significant overhaul or improvements, and by the rumors, impossible to upgrade or change in a meaningful way without breaking it completely.\r\n\r\nAnd why they keep doing all that? Lack of Competition.\r\n\r\nThey're the only decent truck simulation on the market, so they have 0 incentive or pressure to do any better.\r\n\r\nThey NEED to have competition, the competition benefits US, the consumers. the player base and the industry as a whole.\r\n\r\nI have 700+ hours in it, those hours were possible thanks to the 1500 mods i have spread across multiples careers, without those mods, the game is bland, unfinished, and impossible to play for a long period of time, borderlining on the forever early access limbo scam some games have.\r\n\r\nJust make the Prism Engine BETTER.",

I get unmotivated CTDs, full resets and crashes galore. I reinstalled the Game, the redistributables, and even deleted my profile. No other game I own has this frequent crashing problem, and the crash detection of the game is only seeing it every 10 crashes or something. It has gotten worse since 1.50 and with every new version.\nMy PC is up to date, fresh hardware, good windows.\n\nNo Mods\nNo Config-Edits\nNothing custom.\n\nThe crashes are so frustrating that I don't want to play any longer, and this has been my long time favourite game. :(\n\nPS: AI-Drivers in this game are atrocious and keep crashing into you while you have the right of way. I think all the issues are due to the game engine being more than 20 years old by now.\nAVOID for now",

The UI has been streamlined a bit and everything is less clunky than before.\n\nBut: Some DLCs (like the Balkans) are insanely crashy, where a save game with mods etc. just fails to load standard police vehicles and outright crashes.\n\nThat such things haven't been ironed out after 10+ years in it's second iteration is really really frustrating.\n\nI'm torn between giving it a good rating (i mean it is still a good game) but not being able to work around crashes after such a long time is not a game i can recommend. Games need to be fun, not frustrating.",

      "review": "Awesome, top-notch game that is not only a gold-standard for trucking simulators but also for quality gaming software in general.\n\nUnfortunately learning that SCS is currently developing a \"Heart of Russia\" DLC has entirely soured me from playing this game in the future.  I hate to mix politics with leisure, but have to make an exception in this case.  The optics of releasing a such a product during Russia's ongoing attempted genocide of the Ukrainian people and bloody conquest of sovereign Ukrainian soil could not be worse.\n\nSuch a DLC can easily be (mis)interpreted(?) as promoting Russian imperialism with a blind-eye towards the unjust barbaric massacre of Ukrainians and attempted conquest of their nation.  Especially when its release  has apparently been prioritized over a Ukraine DLC (any takers for a research trip there).   \n\nWhat exactly is the long-term road-map here?  Glorify the \"victorious\" past of Russia's interior, while ignoring any current and future humanitarian atrocities it commits at its borders?  Then wait to see where those borders settle out before making a DLC of Ukraine, assuming it still exists as nation, or release a \"Russia Westward Expansion\" DLC otherwise?\n\nI also contend that my comments are entirely appropriate for a video game review.  All product reviews are subjective to the reviewer's personal experience.  In this case, seeing that a game will eventually include content that egregiously offends my personal sensibilities has now completely negated any enjoyment I can get from it.  \n\nHow can I recommend a game that I no longer enjoy playing as a direct result of future content announced by it's creator?  I cannot, and thus the downward thumb.",

One might as well sit before a looking glass and pretend to journey, for all the pleasure it affords. The creators, it seems, have mistaken monotony for realism and tedium for depth.
