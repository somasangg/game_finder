      "review": "Tired of AAA games, tired of Souls clones that can't even get the feeling and pacing right. I'm looking for a simpler experience that doesn't sacrifice depth, glad to find it here.\n\nEdit: Now that I'm finished with the game and got all the achievements, I can confidently say that this is a fantastic game, it's a fantastic game if you see it for what it is and not for what you want it to be. I saw someone complaining about the game looking like a bad tech demo with how undetailed the environment is, which if you're judging this game based on how AAA looks you're missing the point. This is a gameplay focused game that offers a tight gameplay experience, not an interactive movie. If you want to look at the most cutting edge and detailed graphics why go here in the first place.\n\nIf you're thinking about buying this game to play with your friends, I want you to keep in mind the kind of people you're playing with. The kind of people you're playing with will greatly, like I mean greatly change your first experience with the game. I first played with my friends that already had over 100 hours in the game, and I did not have fun. I couldn't keep up simply because of the knowledge gap, they have a better understanding of the map layout and everything while I don't. So when I die, I was never able to catch up. They got overpowered and have a ton of fun while I'm struggling to survive. Which ended up making me dismissed the game by \"This game is not for me I guess.\" (Or \"this shit fucking sucks\" depending on what kind of person you're).\n\nBut I decided to go back solo and really give the game a chance. I'm just gonna play and have fun, which is exactly what I did. I didn't care about the timer, I didn't care about playing fast, I didn't care if I die and I'm just gonna vibe. This time, I had fun, I really had fun and I got the satisfaction of \"The Click\" with the game. The game really just lets you play however you want, it asks you to be efficient, but you will naturally get more efficient the more time you play, so you don't have to be stressed out on playing efficiently. The pacing in this game is great, amazing even.\n\nI love this game, I didn't expect it would make it to my top 8 favorite games but I'm glad it did, I had an amazing time playing it.\n\nAlso I wish that Eclipse 8 is an achievement, something called \"King of Petrichor V, Beat the game on Eclipse 8 with every Survivor.\" I only did one Eclipse 8 win, simply because I don't think that it's worth it unless this is your number one favorite and you love it dearly. But having to play each Survivor 7 times before unlocking the difficulty just feels tedious, I would rather they just make it so you only need to get one Eclipse 8 win to unlock it for any other characters.\n\nBut yea, give this game a try I promise you it's worth it, especially now that it's on discount.",

Nothing gets left out. \r\n\r\nThe lore while taking a backseat in terms of what's happening around you actively, is still surprisingly fun to look into and in depth aswell.\r\n\r\nLast and definitely not the least, the soundtrack for this game, for me is nearing the level of c418's efforts for Minecraft. Every pluck and twang within every track, every whistle, every buildup, has an emotion difficult to put into words.\r\n\r\nPlaying the first version of the final stage, when it was just a long hallway to the end.. listening to the leitmotif from Coalescence creep in, the final stage track for the first game, is an experience I want for anyone who's even remotely into gaming.\r\n\r\n...con lentitud poderosa",

      "review": "This is a cool roguelite with a lot of variety, but you have to give it a decent try before you see any fun in it as your progression is directly tied with your own skill and experience of the game. You're thrown into a level with tooltips as your tutorial, all items are \"???\" until you buy them (and you should so you know what they do in your future runs), and overall it's a big game of trial and error.\r\n\r\nFor the first hour or so of playing RoR2, I was confused why this game had overwhelmingly positive reviews because the gameplay was 'alright', you run around shooting enemies to level up and get money to open crates to get items, ultimately to prepare for the teleporter event which leads you into a boss battle then the next stage where you repeat all of that again. Maybe singleplayer wasn't as good as the multiplayer? But once I got a decent run going I began to see why it is pretty fun, and in that same run I managed to escape and win which was incredibly satisfying. \r\n\r\nThe amount of items you can collect strikes a good balance between too little and too much, as you're able to find new items consistently while also getting already found items to stack your character with. Once you get yourself a bunch of items, you start feeling like an unstoppable in-game boss. I once had 8 of one item (and their stats stack) and every kill rewarded me with 120 temporary health, but then I accidentally scrapped all of them because I didn't know the scrap machine would do that... and that is the only part of the game that frustrates me which is you don't know anything until you do it, and that may end your 2hr run.\r\n\r\nI give this game a 'very positive' rating but I don't know about 'overwhelmingly positive', there isn't much depth to it in terms of just base game content but maybe the DLC offers a lot more. I'll have to sink more hours into it!",

No two runs feel the same; every time you’re wondering, “What kind of build am I going to end up with this time?”\n\nChallenging but fair:\nIt’s not an easy game, but it rarely feels cheap. Most of the time when you die, you know exactly what you did wrong. That makes it very rewarding to improve and push a bit further with each run.\n\nShines in co-op:\nPlaying with friends takes the chaos to another level. The screen fills with enemies, items drop everywhere, and you’re constantly discussing who should pick what. It’s hectic in the best way.\n\nCompact, yet memorable:\nIt’s not a huge AAA title, but it absolutely has that “cult classic” energy. For the price and the amount of hours you can sink into it, it’s an amazing value.\n\nRisk of Rain is a gripping, replayable, and atmospheric roguelike that pulls you into its loop of die–learn–get stronger–repeat in the most satisfying way.

Even though the principal is pretty much the same every time, get items, go to teleporter, and then beat boss, there is so much you can do to make your run incredibly unique! Especially with DLCs like Survivors of the Void and Alloyed Collective, there is so much more to add to your experience with the new maps and new items that each DLC offers. There is a unique variety in the characters you play in ROR2 so each item and map has a whole different feel based on the character you select (this is a good thing). Also, the music in this game is phenomenal, even across all three DLCs too! It's both incredibly upbeat and also very somber at times which makes you appreciate the beautiful world of Petrichor V a whole lot more.

And then majority of the time it never feels like I'm scrambling to get a good build going unless I literally get better at the game since even an overpowered build doesn't mean being invulnerable.\r\nMusic is top notch, making me feel like I'm on top the world while my screen is filled with unimaginable colours and particles, every soundtrack to each and every major boss making so much sense and making me feel desperate the finish the fight in anyway to avoid dying.\r\nCan't even begin to describe how the lore, hidden yet so obvious, makes me feel as it tells such a tragic story over multiple games and how the world came to be in the vision of the developers, making me even tear up in how tragic yet perfect it really is to make everything make sense in terms of why these items are here, why they do what they do, the environments and their storytelling, all to culminate in a final boss that really shows how to do a final boss correctly.\r\nAnd that's all in just the base game alone, the DLC's make the expierence even more enjoyable with expanding even more on items, story, run experience and variation making it so that I never have the same run twice ever.\r\nIn the end Risk of Rain 2 is one of my favourite games of all time and I [b] [u] WILL [/u] [/b] be spending hundrends upon hundreds of hours towards the goal of 100% completion one day.",

Also feels odd that this new DLC adds skin unlocks to all the base game characters based on the new bosses, but doesn't also come with skin unlocks related to that boss for the new character, would be nice if all of the characters had 4* skins, not the base characters have 4, Seekers of the Storm have 3 and Alloyed Collective have the same 2 that the original characters had unlockable on day 1\n\n*One has 5 from the Dead Cells crossover",

There are so many ways to play and enjoy this game, from suffering on eclipse mode to unwinding on drizzle mode, or playing a poison doggo, or alternatively a normal soldier, or you know, a god (DLC Character). Even without all of the expansions that all add so much variety to an already addictive game you can still have the time of your life alone or with friends with the randomness and re-playability. Not to mention the art, OST, and lore (If you know where to look) that add so much to game. Risk of Rain 2 is a truly unique experience that I believe everyone that likes the roguelike genre should try, and then subsequently lose their entire afternoon. I got engulfed in the world of Risk of Rain and I don't think I can stop anymore, and I hope for the sake of the people that made this game so close to my heart that you please buy it, the only regret you'll have is all of the time you've wasted lost on Petrichor V",

This game nails that perfectly, especially with the characters—unlocking each one feels like its own challenge, and I’m fully ready to go through all of it. Plus, the option to play with friends makes it even better; the chaos is way more fun when you’re not dealing with it alone. I’d 100% recommend the Seekers of Hope DLC too. Even though it started off rough, they fixed it up, and now it has some of my favorite maps and characters in the entire game. Risk of Rain 2 honestly turned a genre I usually avoid into something I really enjoy. ( I hope they will keep adding new characters)",

There’s something almost godly about its concept… that perfect blend of chaos, curiosity, progression, and mystery that no other game seems to deliver in the same way. I constantly crave this feeling in other titles, but Risk of Rain stands alone. It’s special.\n\nEvery run feels like a personal journey. Even when I think I’ve mastered something, the game surprises me with a new mechanic, a new synergy, or a new way to approach challenges. It’s wild how a single run can teach me something completely new — sometimes small, sometimes mind-blowing — but always rewarding.\n\nThere’s a sense of growth that doesn’t rely only on the character leveling up, but me leveling up. I learn, adapt, experiment, fail, laugh, and hype myself up all over again. That loop — that constant feeling of discovery — is what makes Risk of Rain feel so incredibly good.\n\nIt’s one of those rare games that isn’t just fun; it becomes a comfort space. A beautiful storm of action, music, atmosphere, and progression that just hits a part of my gamer-heart no other game reaches. And honestly… I adore it for that.\n\nRisk of Rain isn’t just a roguelike. It’s a vibe. A feeling. A little universe I’m always excited to jump back into. And I love it more with every run.",

Surely it's all fixed now right, why the hate?\n\nTo which I direct you to take-two's EULA for not just this game, but everything they have a hand in. Even in absentia of the horrific anti-consumer practices that gearbox themselves are guilty of going back as far as them embezzling funding from SEGA to use on their own projects, if you look at the EULA that Take-Two is now making mandatory on virtually all of their games you will find that they have declared for themselves the rights to access and collect the following information:\n\n-Your name\n-Your Email\n-Your phone number\n-Your photo\n-Your mailing address/zip code\n-payment or purchase info\n-age\n-gender\n-password\n-platform ID\n-Software products played\n-Survey data\n-geolocation\n-and the systems or platforms you play their product on/through.\n\nFurthermore, they also \"share\" (read:sell), your information with the following:\n\n-Vendors that perform services and support for them\n-Take-Two group members\n-Advertisers and third party advertising partners\n-Other third parties\n\nI realize that I'm going to most assuredly get flamed for daring to mention these things, likely by a bunch of addict lobotomites who are perfectly willing to sell their privacy, and any dignity or self-respect under the auspices that no one will actually come to collect on them personally, but as someone who purchased this game and played it for ages long before the IP was unceremoniously sold off and gutted by a company I despise due to their long history of abusing their customers, I cannot overstate how much I despise this entire series of events.\n\nAnd yes, the truth is we're all trapped in this awful market environment, run roughshod over by corporate interests and information brokering thieves, but to have it so blatantly done to a game I loved, and considered one of the best in the genre? To see it literally become unplayable in a proper state for a year before they actually fixed things, and have everything unique and fun about it be dragged out and abused for all it's worth by unscrupulous corporate asshairs who couldn't give a shit less about something that was until that point, crowd funded and beloved by its community? It's like purchasing a car and then a decade later the company changes hands and they break into your house and reengineer every part of your vehicle to function worse so they can sell you back the parts they just stole from you. We aren't renters, we are owners of these things, at least we damn well should be for the amount of money we pay for these products. Enough is enough.\n\nI cannot, and will not support this, and I say if you have any respect for yourself or what this game was before they infested it, cut them off.

When it wants to work (keep that sentiment in mind), messing around with it is incredibly fun, and it can be fascinating to see how broken you can get. So why is this a \"not recommended\" review?\n\nThe answer's quite simple: Gearbox and 2K have their grubby mitts on this game. Between their predatory EULAs and other scummy business practices, not to mention how they've handled the game itself since taking over, Hopoo's legacy and the hard, honest work of those who have worked on Alloyed Collective have effectively been spat on repeatedly. They want control over everything in the IP, and that includes information on those who play it. You're more than welcome to keep going on it if you trust Gearbox and 2K with the stuff on your computer and trust them with every fibre of your being (although why you would want to do that is beyond me). Because, per their EULA, if what they cause via those methods ruins something, you can't hold them liable.\n\nProbably the biggest red flag is that multiplayer itself is completely dysfunctional half of the time. And by \"dysfunctional\", I mean \"it will straight up not load at all, no game for you\". Considering that multiplayer is a pretty major pull for a roguelike such as this one, that's just such a big no-no.

      "review": "This might be the worst roguelight on the market today, and I genuinely regret wasting the time on it I have. Why?\r\n\r\nThe game is sadistic, plain and simple. It oozes out of every pore of the gameplay, EVEN including the hints. The very first lesson you get: \"Take too long, and the enemies will get stronger!\" \"Don't waste time!\" These are lies. You cannot blitz through the game, because RNG will punish you. Have no items? Tanky enemies will spawn and the time it takes you to kill them without damage buffs is so long you would have spent the same time getting BUFFS AND KILLING THEM that you did on just killing them.\r\n\r\nThe most basic enemy, the wisp, can spawn behind you, out of your line of sight, MID-ATTACK ANIMATION and hit you before their audio warning for spawning EVEN FINISHES. These attacks are borderline impossible to dodge without the use of a block or bunny-hop spam. Because some moron gave hitscan to a basic mob.\r\n\r\nBosses \"scale\" over time, but the game intentionally wastes as much of yours as possible. The portals take FOREVER to charge up, so rushing the boss down is meaningless. You get no reward for playing well. Only more of your time wasted.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of RNG: There are two horrific systems in this game that make my eyes roll into the back of my head: Portals and Boss Spawns.\r\n\r\nThe portals can be added to the teleporter by achieving certain small \"goals,\" but most of them are horrible pains in the butt that waste your time to get! In a game about getting loot as fast as possible to scale up with the enemies, it sure would be so FUNNY and WACKY if the game devs hid randomly spawning newt statues in places unreachable for over half the roster! That would be SO WACKY~ So FUNNY~ It would also be funny if those characters would benefit the MOST from getting it!? But also, haha, what if the newt statue doesn't spawn at ALL and you wastes MINUTES looking for it in SUPER HIDDEN spots because you need one of those items!? HAHAHAHAHAHA~\r\n\r\nThere are so painfully few teleporter boss enemies that the Devs could be mistaken for a recycling plant. Do you like TITAN or BEETLE MOM? Too bad! That's ALL you will see 99% of the time. Don't worry, though! You can fight multiples of them AT ONCE so you can visually see the re-used content before your very eyes~! Three expansions in and we can't be bothered to add more variety to the BASE gameplay? No. You need more RNG in your items, of course!! Have 20 more items in the pool!\r\n\r\nBosses start to spawn as basic enemies as the time scales up. Sure would suck if the bosses that do spawn are boring slop that spam laser attacks or mobs. With the ability to spawn as elites. With HP so high they actually become tankier than their non-elite, normal boss counterparts. Haha. And like, imagine if they could spawn as HEALING elites!? That's so funny! Haha! And like, imagine if bosses weren't coded to be unhealable by these elites!? TEEHEE!? Image if the wave of elites that spawn in around the boss were all copies of the boss that are ALL HEALING ELITES!? That would be SO WACKY~?!\r\n\r\nEvery basic game design rule was ignored for this game, and it makes me so sad. There is so much potential in this game to be fun, but I am convinced the game devs were too busy thinking of stupid ways to kill the player. I so painfully want to like the game. It has so much charm and love clearly put into it... but the flaws are so upsetting that it makes me want to eat drywall.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor those looking for a fun read on why I'm writing this? I was 35 minutes deep into a Monsoon run. Half-decent build. Definitely no god run, but good enough to finish with. I do the portal before the 4th world and 7 bosses spawn. Why? I don't know. Mountain wasn't active. Immediately, the game spawns 2 entire waves of elite enemies, over half of them healing elites. The bosses are functionally immortal. I spent 20 minutes kiting and slowly killing the healers, beat the bosses, and went into the blue portal. I clearly needed more items, perhaps even Heretic if it was that rough. Despite LOOKING AT THE BLUE PORTAL, with the text prompt for BLUE PORTAL, it sends me into the gold one behind me. I spawn in and there are already 15 enemies on the ground. 12 of them are Halcyonites, with 3 being healing elite Halcyonites. The other 3 are stone titans. \r\n\r\nGenuinely. What the absolute hell am I supposed to do against 15 bosses that all spam lasers, 3 of which are literally undodgeable, and heal each other? Sure, the healing Halcyonites could be slowly chipped down if I had the mental stamina left, but I JUST left a 20 minute grindfest. I tried for 5 minutes, realized I had about 3 seconds out of every 60 to attack safely, just gave up, and let my character die.\r\n\r\nI don't care if it was \"possible\" to do. I care that it wasn't fun in ANY way. If I so much as touch this game again, I will NEVER be playing without cheat engine. I shouldn't have to cheat to make the game fun, but I have just as little respect for a game willing to waste an hour of my life as it does for me.\r\n\r\nTl;Dr - Go play Crab Champions. It's an infinitely better game that does everything this game does, but without the sheer bullshit that is the poorly thought out \"elite\" system they lazily and poorly implemented in RoR2. A bunch of bosses is one thing: A boss spawning in as an elite that heals %max HP of all nearby allies? No.",

      "review": "A long-standing Risk of Rain 2 controller bug from 2020 has resurfaced. After dropping into a run, the game stops recognizing controller inputs for anything except the pause menu. You become stuck in the escape pod because the interact prompt disappears when switching back to the controller, even though the controller works perfectly in all menus. Keyboard input briefly shows an (E) prompt, but controller actions like X/Square do nothing. After hours of troubleshooting, it's clear the issue isn’t related to bindings or Steam controller settings. The bug prevents movement, aiming, abilities, shooting, and interacting, making the game completely unplayable for controller users",

There’s no real sense of danger or urgency.\r\n\r\nSome thoughts: the teleport event seems pointless—its only function is to move you to another biome, but there’s no meaningful reset or shift in pacing. Boss fights are significantly harder than regular encounters, yet the reward is the same single item, so defeating a boss doesn’t feel genuinely rewarding.\r\n\r\nOpinion: as a roguelike, the game has potential, but it needs substantial rebalancing and a deeper rethink of how builds and progression develop.",

The items are not game-breaking like in other roguelites, you have nearly zero choice in your build, the enemies are incredibly annoying and tedious to fight, and the bosses are not interesting and have way too much health, making it just a slog to fight. The entire game gets boring after 5 minutes, because fighting the same boring basic enemies becomes repetitive, so I am just forced to ignore them; WHICH, FOR SOME REASON, IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE. The enemies' attacks are not strong for the most part, but for some reason they have stupidly inflated health and are just time-wasters. The ONLY good things about this game are the character/enemy design and art.",

Now I go in and get sh*t loot and die within 30 seconds of entering the NULL portal because time no longer stops while there. Even worse, the constant tic of damage while in the void used to be one set number the entire time while there, now it increases every like 30 seconds making it impossible to get to the next void beacon before dying, even with 10 medkits and 10 bunguses you don't heal more than you take damage from the void.
