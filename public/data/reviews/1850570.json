      "review": "[h1] Death Stranding might be the most cooperative game you'll ever play alone. [/h1]\n\nA game everyone should try even though its not for everyone.\n\n\n[h3] Gameplay [/h3]\nDeath Stranding is one of the most uniquely cooperative games I’ve ever played, even without traditional multiplayer. From the moment you take your first steps, you realize it’s about more than just getting from point A to point B. You start to understand that Death Stranding isn’t testing your reflexes but your patience, your planning, and your willingness to keep on keeping on.\n\nAfter getting your bearings, you’ll begin to implement tools to create more efficient routes using ladders, ropes, and structures. Combat in this game is limited, but that’s kind of the point given the story’s context. Along your mission to reconnect America through the Chiral Network, you’ll come across lost cargo, abandoned vehicles, structures, and motivational signs left by other online players in this asynchronous multiplayer world. It’s a type of multiplayer experience unlike anything I’ve played before, and it fits Death Stranding’s themes perfectly.\n\nTo keep things simple (since this borders on spoiler territory): you’ll have a companion, BB, who starts off as more of a tool for detecting BTs (Beached Things). They appear as muck-like monsters ([spoiler] but are actually spirits [/spoiler]).. You can choose to confront or evade BTs; I usually prefer the latter. The roughest patches in the gameplay, for me, were the driving sections and the occasional climbing mishap; for example a jump would trigger accidentally, causing you to drop cargo or injure yourself.\n\n\n[h3] Story [/h3]\n\nWhen this game came out in November 2019, it was not well received by many critics and fans of Kojima's previous games. Why should anyone care about delivering packages in a world where most NPCs are locked inside their homes and remain socially distant via hologram? \n\nWell one pandemic later and Death Stranding became more than just some dumb walking simulator.\n\nThe story isn’t perfect, but it contains some of the most fascinating world-building I’ve experienced in any medium. In the world of Death Stranding, an extinction-level event has reshaped the world. The United States and its people are fractured. As mentioned before, your mission as Sam Porter Bridges is to reconnect America with the Chiral Network and in your time delivering packages you'll unfold a terrorist plot, scientific milestones and deal with Sam's aphenphosmphobia (Fear of being touched). \n\nThe storytelling can be exhausting at times due to its heavy exposition and repetitive dialogue. There were moments when I couldn’t tell if the awkwardness came from the writing or the acting choices; however the performances are strong, especially given the stacked cast featuring Norman Reedus, Léa Seydoux, Margaret Qualley, Mads Mikkelsen, and more.\n\n[h3] Rating [/h3]\n\nFew games capture the feeling of loneliness and hope in the same breath the way Death Stranding does. Its haunting visuals and music by Low Roar turn even the simplest deliveries into reflective, emotional moments. It’s an engaging yet deceptively simple game with an emotionally rich story about reconnection and perseverance through isolation. The act of delivering packages becomes more meaningful through the relationships you build and the quiet victories that come from bridging the gaps between people and places. The COVID-19 pandemic changed how I see this game; what once felt like a strange concept now feels deeply human. I’d give Death Stranding a 4/5.",

      "review": "Fantastically unique experience with a world built on creating moments that define the journey instead of the destination. It is both strategic and cumbersome in how it juggles a theraputic navigation between multiple points and delivering its story beats.\r\n\r\nYou approach the game's plot in a method less akin to Hideo's previous games where the backstories and nuances of each character's motives are made reasonably clear, instead, opting for text based emails and interviews which most players are most likely not interacting with considering only a mere 7.2% of players have read 100 interviews and 19.3% for 100 emails read (time of this review). I've seen players say that you should be able to listen to an audio clip of interviews/ emails while doing deliveries but I believe that would detract from the main gameplay loop. The trips you make allow the player to narrow in on the each moment or use the time to reflect on their current place in the story and understand, wonder, and imagine what is next for Sam and his allies/ enemies. It was purposefully done and it may have sacrificed on overall cohesiveness with how to deliver more of the lore for an America torn apart.\r\n\r\nAssymetric Gameplay also manages to sublty sew in astrange feeling of being alone but not ignored as other players in multiple ways.\r\n\r\nIf you do enjoy reflecting on your ties in your life or have dealt with death in some regard, this may be an interesting game to wade through and reflect on both. It has goofy game moments, a certain clunkiness that gives movement its weight, charm from the characters you meet and pure out of the box ideas in terms of science fiction.\r\n\r\nI would recommend this game to everyone, though I know not everyone would do the same.",

      "review": "Death Stranding is a MASTERPIECE. 130+ hours in with 100% achievements, I'm starting to think nothing will top it for at least a decade. Unequivocally my favourite game ever.\n\n[u]Without spoiling anything:[/u] It starts out as a story about humanity's twisted priorities, in which the world is plagued with unimaginable human suffering and grief, but we've collectively decided Amazon Prime is more important, so get delivering those packages buddy. Everything seems pointless, you are given pittance as reward, and sometimes it almost feels like it's mocking you for persevering. I was already hooked by that initial premise alone, along with the incredible horror in its presentation, but as the game progresses it becomes a profound and captivating story about connecting with people, and the lengths to which humans will go to make those connections in spite of the suffering we endure. \n\nBut what makes this game so compelling is the fact this story simply cannot be told in any other medium than a video game. You [i]need[/i] to rely on the assistance of other players. You will quickly learn to appreciate their assistance and you will feel compelled to help other players in return. A single player game in which you are routinely thinking about how you can either help other players or just try to make them smile. It simply [i]is not[/i] just an interactive movie, it's so much more than that! It is beautiful, tragic, heartwarming, terrifying, and unlike anything I have ever experienced in a video game before.\n\nThe fact so many people dismissed (and [i]continue[/i] to dismiss) this game as just a walking simulator is criminal. Yes, technically it [i]is[/i] a walking sim, but that's [i]really[/i] missing the point. Modern gamers are so hellbent on the notion of \"respecting your time\" that they are unwilling to take any risks or push their boundaries, then wonder why they get served soulless mediocrity so often. \n\nDeath Stranding is completely unashamed to do its own thing, undeterred by an audience that pretends to know what it wants, and I'm so fucking grateful for it. I can't believe it's taken me this long to play it and the moment the sequel is available on PC I will be dedicating the entire week solely to that. I will forever be thankful to be alive at the same time as Hideo Kojima. Easiest 10/10 I could possibly give. [b]PLAY THIS GAME.[/b]",

The journey itself becomes part of the story, and the more time I committed to it, the more its strange beauty revealed itself.\n\nHaving to solve problems, finding ways to make routes more efficient, and being helped by other players through the online feature in times of need made the experience even more memorable. And there were a metric fuckton of those moments.\n\nThe cast was lovable and genuinely interesting. I found myself meticulously going through every email, every interview, every log, because I wanted to know more.\n\nPart of that was because the plot was very difficult for me to follow, which amplified my need to understand the world better. But the fact that I even went the extra mile for that makes me appreciate the game even more.\n\nBenefits of having been recently laid off, I suppose.\n\nStill, traversing its incredibly bleak and beautiful world, hearing the soundtrack swell as a new location appeared on the horizon, made every frustrating delivery worth it.\n\nI’m happy I gave this game a chance, and I can't wait to dive into the next.",

It feels calm and slow, like the game is saying, “Don’t worry, I’ll show you everything.”\n\nBut then things start getting weirder little by little.

Kojima knew not everyone would enjoy it, but he had a vision and stuck with it. \n\nOnce you envelope yourself in the world of Death Stranding, learn the lore, connect with the characters and experience the environment, you can't stop. \n\nIt's indescribable the \"vibe\" this game has and in turn you feel, the only way to feel it is to actually play the game. The only way I CAN describe the game is by saying that it's one of those games you'd play when you're super tired from work or school and you just wanna chill. No SBMM lobbies, no sweats, no challenges, no toxicity. It's just you, Norman Reedus, and his Funky Fetus traversing across a world seemingly devoid of any human life. \n\nAt times I'd find myself playing for hours and hours on end. And the truth is that in those sessions I'd mostly be doing side quests or other unimportant stuff that didn't even progress the story. The vibe and relaxation I experienced playing the game just had such a strong grip on me. \n\nI didn't even mention the story yet. The story is peak storytelling. It had me at tears at times and it got me hooked on anything related to the Death Strandings Universe. It's such an emotion filled story that subtly touches on real world themes and problems that many of us ignore at times. To an extent, the game and it's story can be relatable, therapeutic and alleviating to some. It was certainly a story I personally enjoyed and connected with at times. (I'm not deny however that most of the time you don't know what's going on but that's part of the experience and if you aren't okay, ready or prepared to be confused at times then you might have a negative view towards the story)\n\nI can't wait for whenever they bring Death Stranding 2 to PC, hopefully sometime next year, assuming they will. \n\nThe Death Stranding series, it's characters, it's gameplay, and most importantly it's world is absolute cinema.",

Point: I've played worse game.\n\nThis game is probably going to be a hit or a miss kind of thing for people. Before buying the game, I recommend watching some play through, and not buy game after looking at just screenshot and/or high rating. (Still not sure how it has such high rating).\n\nThis game is more about exploring the world, pick stuff up from one place or ground and delivering to other locations. This game is more realistic than many other games and based on how much you have you can slow down or lose balance. Sort of slow paced, chill kind of game. If you don't like that kind of game, you should avoid this game. You really shouldn't expect exciting battles.\n\nIf you DO end up buying this game though, I recommend playing 15-20 hours at least. I find that things get a bit better as things unlock and as you understand how to play it, but it will take a while to get there. Make sure to plan ahead of your mission, it helps a lot.\n\nAlso if you are battling more than one human enemy, DO NOT even try to fight them using a fist or the Strand (a cord to parry or bind enemy). You will get frustrated since character movement is very clunky/slow. Just use a gun.\n\nHonestly I wish there was a 'Maybe' button, instead of just 'Yes' or 'No'. \n\nThe story isn't the best, and the game pace is a bit too slow for me. Having said that, I found myself not really hating the game as much as I initially thought. Not sure why, but walking around for the most part isn't as boring or frustrating.",

The game's true power lies in its complex and emotional narrative addressing themes like loneliness, connection, and life after death through the eyes of Sam Porter Bridges, combined with the \"Strand\" system, which fosters an invisible, positive sense of solidarity as you utilize bridges and roads left by other players.

The game’s vast world and intricate story were overwhelming, but it started strong, almost like a movie. The opening was cinematic and instantly drew me into the world.  Initially, the gameplay felt confusing, with jokes about it being a UPS or walking simulator. However, as I played and interacted with the characters, it all made sense. This isn’t just a walking simulator; it’s a poignant reflection on life.  It acknowledges life’s destructiveness and challenges, yet also reveals beautiful moments when we learn to accept and navigate them with others.  The game’s difficulty and occasional boredom mirror life’s inherent challenges.  Achieving great things requires perseverance and a long journey, but with each step, understanding deepens and helpful resources become available.  During my playthrough, I found myself reflecting on the game and my own life, particularly with its breathtaking and exhilarating soundtrack. This introspection helped me push through to the end. The ending was arguably the best I’ve experienced in years. It felt like a cinematic masterpiece, evoking tears and inspiring admiration.  For me, Death Stranding was a life lesson that will stay with me. While I understand that some dislike it, I believe everyone should experience it at least once. Thank you, Kojima.",

      "review": "I tried so hard to like this game, yet I failed.\n\nBasically all you do for most of the game is watching the same cutscenes for delivery, listening to the same audio or information about the people already said to you at least 10 times. Doing the same mission. It's really hard to see if it's a filler mission or an actual one. %90 things I've done are just simple meaningless delivery and the dialogue basically goes like \"Chiral delivery connect connect deliver connect america\" with a deeper meaning Kojima is forcing you to take. The basic promise is actually pretty simple and could've been much more effective if the game didn't have an awful writing. It's like teaching a 6 year old kid new words. Sam starts the game as a guy who is trying to interact with people as little as possible while not caring about anything related to connecting the world yet... he does it without any motivation, it just randomly happens right after he rejects everyone and says no I won't help you a minute ago. Characters go on and say please Sam you are the only one who can do this, you are the chosen one, god Norman Reedus you are so cool and here are some rayban glasses go save the world. I really can't bear to explain this further because it really is dumb. \n\nIncredibly bad writing. Don't get me wrong I like the idea and the world itself however, the way Kojima makes the world and characters interact with each other with cringe worthy dialogues with a fucking golden cast like that? Just no.\n\nThe more I try, the worse it gets. I'm going to be bold and say it Konami was right in many situations involving Kojima.\n\nMusic’s good, for some reason you can’t listen to it while walking in a walking simulator but alright I guess.\nThe story’s premise is actually pretty solid.\nThe writing, execution, and pacing are terrible. Explaining same things to a player with different characters for 15 minute straight is a true kojima experience. Every single character is suffering from some kind of mental derangement I am sure of it.\nGameplay isn’t as bad as I expected, but it’s definitely not enjoyable either.\nOverall, a 5/10 at best.\n\nThis game would be crucified if kojimas name werent there.",

I’ve played bad games before, but never one that made me question my life choices this consistently.\n\nThe entire gameplay loop is basically:\n\t•\tPick up boxes\n\t•\tStack boxes\n\t•\tBecome a wobbling human skyscraper\n\t•\tWalk for 40 minutes\n\t•\tTrip because a pebble looked at you funny\n\t•\tWatch half your packages yeet themselves off a cliff\n\t•\tCry\n\t•\tRepeat\n\nIt’s like Kojima asked, “What if we made a triple-A game with the thrilling excitement of delivering mail?” and everyone in the room just said, “Yeah, why not.”\n\nThe world is empty.\nThe gameplay is empty.\nMy soul is empty.\n\nEvery time the game tried to be “deep,” I laughed. Characters speak like they’re reading from a philosophy textbook they didn’t understand. Everyone has names like “Die-Hardman,” which sounds less like a character and more like a rejected WWE gimmick.\n\nThe combat?\nBarely there.\nThe fun?\nMissing.\nThe pacing?\nTrapped in a tar pit somewhere with the ghosts.\n\nEven the ladders feel like they’re judging me.\n\nAnd the baby in a jar?\nI don’t know what to say except it cried more than I did, which is saying something.\n\nNow…\nThe soundtrack.\n\nOh my god, the soundtrack.\n\nThe music is absolutely incredible.

      "review": "TLDR: I dont like this game, I don't think it's very good. If your a PC gamer who doesnt have a PS5, I would argue this game isnt worth your time or money. If you do have a PS5 and can therefore play Death Stranding 2, I think you should get through it as this game reeks of unrealised potential and the excitement of a sequal realising it makes the game worth it.\n\nLets get more in detail. There's a lot to talk about with DS, while I think on the whole and looked at as an individual game this isn't worth your time, there are elements of the game I like and even love. Let's start with some of those.\n\nDeath Stranding is at it's best when it feels like your playing Minecraft. If you can remember playing minecraft, that feeling of working on individual tasks to contribute to a greater whole. I loved when I would return to a safe room, turn on Pop Virus on the radio and just chill, enjoy the animations of Sam taking a shower and drinking, then head off and a trip to deliver some packages, solving the puzzle of how I would route my way there. That gameplay loop is, as wierd as it may sound reading this now, some peak af gaming. I loved it.\n\nSomething else I loved about the game was the progression system. As you play and connect more knots, Sam unlocks more and more equipment he can use. Now is this perfect? No, by far not, unfortunately some equipment makes others redundant and then theres the issue of the online portion I'll discuss later. But even still, I like it. It felt really awesome unlocking my first proper weapon, getting the ability to fabricate my first bike. And mostly, everything you unlock has a use throughout the game.\n\nThe last thing I want to mention that I liked was the very very end of the game. No spoilers, but I thought it was a nice ending. Thank god it was too, because I am going to be really, really harsh on the games story in a second and without that ending, I dont think I would be playing Death Stranding 2.\n\nUnfortunately, those are the only major points of enjoyment I had with the game, that 1 section from end of act 1 i guess to mid act 2. The rest of the time, I did not like this game.\n\nI'm gonna start my grilling with something I feel to be true. This game is pretentious but at the same time treats you like a baby. I think the pretentiousness is born from Hideo Kojima. Now, do I respect the guy for having the first game of his new company be as risky as this game, really the first of a genre? Absolutely. Doesn't mean I have to like what he put out. There is no reason for your name to be in the credits what feels like 10 times. There is no reason to have 2 full sets of unskippable credits. There is no reason to put collectibles in the game that talk about Death Stranding the video game as a \"masterpeice\". There is no reason you have to force the player to press skip (if they can get it to work its a 50/50 on of pressing skip opens the skip menu) 5 times just to take a shower to show off your animation work.\n\nThis game wants really, really, really hard to be considered super immersive, and I think they wanted that so bad they put fun to the side to be immersive. Only a slight issue with that though. My immersion in broken when I take a poo and see an add for normal reedus' show, my immersion is broken when sam cant turn a bike more than 15 degrees a second on a highway, my immersion is broken when out of knowhere for 1 cutscene only Sam breaks the 4th wall, my immersion is broken when same skyrim horses his way up mountains, my immersion is broken when all the characters speak and act like they are dumping exposition on you constantly, my immersion is broken when I drive offroad and the car spasses out. Death Stranding is not immersive games, and considering fun was sacrified for that, thats a major issue.\n\nI've already gone into some of the issues but lets go into some more. The gunplay is horrendus, bullets feel like they take a few seconds to hit a target, and everyone is a bullet sponge. Sam controls like a tank, making him really clunkly to control in tight spaces. The driving is horrible, it only feels good on a highway but even then on a bike you can barely turn. Navigating the world in the later half of Act 2 is a slog due to the horrible routing and material costs of the highway, forcing you to rely and ziplines that loose there appeal after 1 trip there and back. Navigating menus feels very slow and clunky, god knows why you have to watch the same popup every time you recycle something. Theres the online, that without it I doubt I would have finished the game as to play without you would need to meticouly plan every route to avoid having to go back and build more traveral options, build every road from scratch. However with the online, I felt it went to overboard, many routes where already fully build due to online items. It was really a damned if you do, damned if you dont thing.\n\nAll of these though, to be honest, dont loose me to the point I wouldn't reccomend a game. What lost me are 2 things, the games story, and the games characters.\n\nLet's start with characters as its simple. I hated Die-Hardman and Fragile. I'll keep this as spoiler free as possible, but Die-Hardman is the most irritating character I've ever seen. He's like Navi in OOT but 10x worse. His job throughout the game is to either 1. tell Sam again what he just learned in the story or 2. to tell Sam to go to a terminal to continue the main story EVERY MAIN ORDER, something what the player is trained to do from the start. It's quite frankly unbeleivable, I hated his character until mid-ending where he actually became a character. The next issue is Fragile. I have quite a stomach for sexualisation in games, as an anime fan I'm pretty decentisised. But when Fragile, in her major scene in the entire game, the only one she gets, is stripped to her underwear, the camera panning on her ass, her face licked by the main villan, and running through the rain, I felt really gross from that. Unfortunately as well, her acting is easily the worst in the game as well, her actress I felt did a bad job conveying emotion in scenes where there really should have been SOMETHING.\n\nLets end this by talking about the story. Death Stranding is, like a lot of games, a simple story told horribly. This lack of ability to tell a story in a consistently engaging way is due to a few things. An inconsistency of major plot beats and an inconsistent tone are a couple, but the major one is as so. It's, in my opinion, the biggest issue of the entire game. This game does not at all respect your time. If your playing this game for just the story, your time is so flagrantly and blatantly wasted its very very aggravating. I won't get into specifics as we bridge spoiler territory, so I'll vaugely mention the 2 biggest examples of this wasting. 1. The game ends on a roughly 30 to 45 minute cutscene with no breaks for gameplay, about 75% of which is repeating information we already know. 2. You are forced to watch the FULL credits TWICE, both unskipable, one of those instances mid game, where all you have to do gameplay wise is run around in an empty space with nothing to do. It's such a blatant waste of your time, for that alone I'd not reccomend this game, your time is more precious than to be wasted by some pretencious guy who thinks your a baby and doesn't want to make a game for the last few hours of it.\n\nI've been very negative and I think this game deserves it. With what I said in mind, I do want to say though that these issues arent critital for this IP. I can put it into words at the moment but there is a TON of untapped potention in this style of game, its clear after playing this game. \n\nIN CONCLUSION, if you don't have a PS5, don't waste your time and money on this game, it isn't worth it. If you do have a PS5, give it a shot when its on discount and see if the core gameplay loop resonates with you.",

      "review": "I'm a huge Kojima fan, and I really wanted to like this game. I still don't hate it, it just isn't for me, and might not be for you. The story seems good in a big-picture sense, but in terms of one line to the next, the writing could've been much better. The scenes where top brass are desperately begging Sam to come back, because they desperately need \"The Legend,\" and he wants nothing to do with them because he's the rigid loner who doesn't trust anyone anymore...I felt like I was swimming chin-deep in a vat of 90's/2000's action movie redundancy. I also felt like Sam's personality was a clone of Snake from Metal Gear.\n\nBut the big drawback for me was the gameplay. It's basically just fetch quests. That's pretty much it. You go from Point A to Point B, which takes about half an hour, 95% of which is just trying to keep your balance. Sure, the scenery is great, but that doesn't mean I'll be entertained just slogging through it for hours trying not to trip over rocks. As much as Kojima knocks modern games for redundancy and following \"safe\" design, Death Stranding seems to be an archetype for so many of the open world/AAA tropes we've come to know and loathe, such as drawing things out painfully and a needlessly complicated interface (just to give ONE example, you have to go through the Map just to save. Because you have to access a different System menu than the regular one to save or load, and literally the only difference is the regular one doesn't have Save/Load for some reason. And there's a key on the map, but it doesn't tell you how to open the map menu. Nor does it really explain how to properly set a route, and even after you set one, it keeps randomly disappearing, so you keep having to use your map or compass over and over and over).\n\nI can see that this game was going for something deep and artistic, and I respect that. But Kojima seems to be falling into the same traps as all other commercial developers, despite his criticism of them. And that saddens me, because I felt like Kojima was my last gasp of hope for commercial gaming. Guess it's retro, indie or nothing these days.",

Somebody who likes to take their time, likes trial and error, and loves kojima. 90% of the time, your asking \"What is even happening?\" Sometimes its cool, sometimes wacky and sometimes you'll skip cutscenes.\r\n\r\n I thought i would be more invested in the story, but all the concepts presented were so beyond me that i just couldn't get into it no matter how hard i tried. The actors..do their job. Dont expect a five star performance. The script is something, the actors seem awkward or maybe they just understand whats going on anymore than us. \r\n\r\nThe gameplay, feels very clunky. Mind you, i certainly feel the weight they want Sam to carry while i play but it just feels jank. I want Sam to stop running, or move a certain way and it either takes forever, or he is to busy stumbling in another direction, due to the balance you have to keep while walking/running. That same jankness carries over to the combat. Which, more often than not, can be annoying. The weapon wheel is just so slow, switching weapons is slow, everything is slow. Getting to the menus, to swap my gear is slow. 80% of the combat sections, specifically with mads mikkelsen character is just playing pickaboo with him and his squad while constantly looking for health/guns. Its not that fun and take forever. But that is what this game is going for.  And dont even get me started on the actual main enemies, the BTs. Everytime you run into them, your not scared, your frustrated because this is the 5-6 time trying to get past them undetected. If you do get detected, which you will because..jank, spend the next few minutes trogging through mud while running away from a giant whale or lion monster.\r\n\r\nThe praise i will give this game however is it does feel like you the player and everyone online is making an effort to build infrastructure to get from point a to point b. Finding a random bike, left by another player, is a godsend. Or being unable to cross a river to find a bridge someone built to get me across is so helpful. The things you/others build or leave behind is this games saving grace. Because its cool to see those elements help me on my journey. That what i build/leave behind can impact others in a positive way. Other games should build up on this gameplay element.\r\n\r\nIf you dont like the first 3-5 hours, it really doesn't get much better and is alot of the same.

Doing the same mission. It's really hard to see if it's a filler mission or an actual one. %90 things I've done are just simple meaningless delivery and the dialogue basically goes like \"Chiral delivery connect connect deliver connect america\" with a deeper meaning Kojima is forcing you to take. The basic promise is actually pretty simple and could've been much more effective if the game didn't have an awful writing. It's like teaching a 6 year old kid new words. Sam starts the game as a guy who is trying to interact with people as little as possible while not caring about anything related to connecting the world yet... he does it without any motivation, it just randomly happens right after he rejects everyone and says no I won't help you a minute ago. Characters go on and say please Sam you are the only one who can do this, you are the chosen one, god Norman Reedus you are so cool and here are some rayban glasses go save the world. I really can't bear to explain this further because it really is dumb. \n\nIncredibly bad writing. Don't get me wrong I like the idea and the world itself however, the way Kojima makes the world and characters interact with each other with cringe worthy dialogues with a fucking golden cast like that? Just no.\n\nThe more I try, the worse it gets. I'm going to be bold and say it Konami was right in many situations involving Kojima.\n\nMusic’s good, for some reason you can’t listen to it while walking in a walking simulator but alright I guess.\nThe story’s premise is actually pretty solid.\nThe writing, execution, and pacing are terrible. Explaining same things to a player with different characters for 15 minute straight is a true kojima experience. Every single character is suffering from some kind of mental derangement I am sure of it.\nGameplay isn’t as bad as I expected, but it’s definitely not enjoyable either.\nOverall, a 5/10 at best.\n\nThis game would be crucified if kojimas name werent there.",

      "review": "TLDR: I dont like this game, I don't think it's very good. If your a PC gamer who doesnt have a PS5, I would argue this game isnt worth your time or money. If you do have a PS5 and can therefore play Death Stranding 2, I think you should get through it as this game reeks of unrealised potential and the excitement of a sequal realising it makes the game worth it.\n\nLets get more in detail. There's a lot to talk about with DS, while I think on the whole and looked at as an individual game this isn't worth your time, there are elements of the game I like and even love. Let's start with some of those.\n\nDeath Stranding is at it's best when it feels like your playing Minecraft. If you can remember playing minecraft, that feeling of working on individual tasks to contribute to a greater whole. I loved when I would return to a safe room, turn on Pop Virus on the radio and just chill, enjoy the animations of Sam taking a shower and drinking, then head off and a trip to deliver some packages, solving the puzzle of how I would route my way there. That gameplay loop is, as wierd as it may sound reading this now, some peak af gaming. I loved it.\n\nSomething else I loved about the game was the progression system. As you play and connect more knots, Sam unlocks more and more equipment he can use. Now is this perfect? No, by far not, unfortunately some equipment makes others redundant and then theres the issue of the online portion I'll discuss later. But even still, I like it. It felt really awesome unlocking my first proper weapon, getting the ability to fabricate my first bike. And mostly, everything you unlock has a use throughout the game.\n\nThe last thing I want to mention that I liked was the very very end of the game. No spoilers, but I thought it was a nice ending. Thank god it was too, because I am going to be really, really harsh on the games story in a second and without that ending, I dont think I would be playing Death Stranding 2.\n\nUnfortunately, those are the only major points of enjoyment I had with the game, that 1 section from end of act 1 i guess to mid act 2. The rest of the time, I did not like this game.\n\nI'm gonna start my grilling with something I feel to be true. This game is pretentious but at the same time treats you like a baby. I think the pretentiousness is born from Hideo Kojima. Now, do I respect the guy for having the first game of his new company be as risky as this game, really the first of a genre? Absolutely. Doesn't mean I have to like what he put out. There is no reason for your name to be in the credits what feels like 10 times. There is no reason to have 2 full sets of unskippable credits. There is no reason to put collectibles in the game that talk about Death Stranding the video game as a \"masterpeice\". There is no reason you have to force the player to press skip (if they can get it to work its a 50/50 on of pressing skip opens the skip menu) 5 times just to take a shower to show off your animation work.\n\nThis game wants really, really, really hard to be considered super immersive, and I think they wanted that so bad they put fun to the side to be immersive. Only a slight issue with that though. My immersion in broken when I take a poo and see an add for normal reedus' show, my immersion is broken when sam cant turn a bike more than 15 degrees a second on a highway, my immersion is broken when out of knowhere for 1 cutscene only Sam breaks the 4th wall, my immersion is broken when same skyrim horses his way up mountains, my immersion is broken when all the characters speak and act like they are dumping exposition on you constantly, my immersion is broken when I drive offroad and the car spasses out. Death Stranding is not immersive games, and considering fun was sacrified for that, thats a major issue.\n\nI've already gone into some of the issues but lets go into some more. The gunplay is horrendus, bullets feel like they take a few seconds to hit a target, and everyone is a bullet sponge. Sam controls like a tank, making him really clunkly to control in tight spaces. The driving is horrible, it only feels good on a highway but even then on a bike you can barely turn. Navigating the world in the later half of Act 2 is a slog due to the horrible routing and material costs of the highway, forcing you to rely and ziplines that loose there appeal after 1 trip there and back. Navigating menus feels very slow and clunky, god knows why you have to watch the same popup every time you recycle something. Theres the online, that without it I doubt I would have finished the game as to play without you would need to meticouly plan every route to avoid having to go back and build more traveral options, build every road from scratch. However with the online, I felt it went to overboard, many routes where already fully build due to online items. It was really a damned if you do, damned if you dont thing.\n\nAll of these though, to be honest, dont loose me to the point I wouldn't reccomend a game. What lost me are 2 things, the games story, and the games characters.\n\nLet's start with characters as its simple. I hated Die-Hardman and Fragile. I'll keep this as spoiler free as possible, but Die-Hardman is the most irritating character I've ever seen. He's like Navi in OOT but 10x worse. His job throughout the game is to either 1. tell Sam again what he just learned in the story or 2. to tell Sam to go to a terminal to continue the main story EVERY MAIN ORDER, something what the player is trained to do from the start. It's quite frankly unbeleivable, I hated his character until mid-ending where he actually became a character. The next issue is Fragile. I have quite a stomach for sexualisation in games, as an anime fan I'm pretty decentisised. But when Fragile, in her major scene in the entire game, the only one she gets, is stripped to her underwear, the camera panning on her ass, her face licked by the main villan, and running through the rain, I felt really gross from that. Unfortunately as well, her acting is easily the worst in the game as well, her actress I felt did a bad job conveying emotion in scenes where there really should have been SOMETHING.\n\nLets end this by talking about the story. Death Stranding is, like a lot of games, a simple story told horribly. This lack of ability to tell a story in a consistently engaging way is due to a few things. An inconsistency of major plot beats and an inconsistent tone are a couple, but the major one is as so. It's, in my opinion, the biggest issue of the entire game. This game does not at all respect your time. If your playing this game for just the story, your time is so flagrantly and blatantly wasted its very very aggravating. I won't get into specifics as we bridge spoiler territory, so I'll vaugely mention the 2 biggest examples of this wasting. 1. The game ends on a roughly 30 to 45 minute cutscene with no breaks for gameplay, about 75% of which is repeating information we already know. 2. You are forced to watch the FULL credits TWICE, both unskipable, one of those instances mid game, where all you have to do gameplay wise is run around in an empty space with nothing to do. It's such a blatant waste of your time, for that alone I'd not reccomend this game, your time is more precious than to be wasted by some pretencious guy who thinks your a baby and doesn't want to make a game for the last few hours of it.\n\nI've been very negative and I think this game deserves it. With what I said in mind, I do want to say though that these issues arent critital for this IP. I can put it into words at the moment but there is a TON of untapped potention in this style of game, its clear after playing this game. \n\nIN CONCLUSION, if you don't have a PS5, don't waste your time and money on this game, it isn't worth it. If you do have a PS5, give it a shot when its on discount and see if the core gameplay loop resonates with you.",

The story seems good in a big-picture sense, but in terms of one line to the next, the writing could've been much better. The scenes where top brass are desperately begging Sam to come back, because they desperately need \"The Legend,\" and he wants nothing to do with them because he's the rigid loner who doesn't trust anyone anymore...I felt like I was swimming chin-deep in a vat of 90's/2000's action movie redundancy. I also felt like Sam's personality was a clone of Snake from Metal Gear.\n\nBut the big drawback for me was the gameplay. It's basically just fetch quests. That's pretty much it. You go from Point A to Point B, which takes about half an hour, 95% of which is just trying to keep your balance. Sure, the scenery is great, but that doesn't mean I'll be entertained just slogging through it for hours trying not to trip over rocks. As much as Kojima knocks modern games for redundancy and following \"safe\" design, Death Stranding seems to be an archetype for so many of the open world/AAA tropes we've come to know and loathe, such as drawing things out painfully and a needlessly complicated interface (just to give ONE example, you have to go through the Map just to save. Because you have to access a different System menu than the regular one to save or load, and literally the only difference is the regular one doesn't have Save/Load for some reason. And there's a key on the map, but it doesn't tell you how to open the map menu. Nor does it really explain how to properly set a route, and even after you set one, it keeps randomly disappearing, so you keep having to use your map or compass over and over and over).\n\nI can see that this game was going for something deep and artistic, and I respect that. But Kojima seems to be falling into the same traps as all other commercial developers, despite his criticism of them. And that saddens me, because I felt like Kojima was my last gasp of hope for commercial gaming. Guess it's retro, indie or nothing these days.",

I have owned all MS X-Boxes and only recently migrated to the PC.  I still prefer playing with a controller though I have had extensive use of a keyboard in the past.  So far, this game's menu system hasn't been X-Box (Steam) controller friendly. The menu system accompanying the controller has not been intuitive and I've been forced to exit the game in order to research how to do simple things within the game.  Specifically save and exit!  I was faced without any visual indicator as to how to quit the game.  Online assistance hasn't provided, as yet, proper interface explanations, or tutorials.  Therefore I advise doing some hearty research into the game's eccentricities prior to actually attempting to play the game.  However, I'll not rule out the probability of error and continue to attempt to work out a controller scheme that's simple yet intuitive.",

Stealth is virtually nonexistent and unattainable: crouching seems more for maintaining balance. The opening scene implies stealthily sneaking around the hostiles is the correct course of action. In actual game-play, you're better off sprinting loudly than sneaking, because the hostiles will detect you if you try to sneak, as the opening cinematic scene implies you should, but they won't catch you if you straight run.\n\nThe game also has a tendency to load from 'Continue' straight into a blank black screen because there is a known bug that corrupts save files and renders them unrecoverable. Worse yet, when that happens, you're unable to return to the title screen. You have to CLOSE the game, RELAUNCH the game, and try again with loading a DIFFERENT save file.

Somebody who likes to take their time, likes trial and error, and loves kojima. 90% of the time, your asking \"What is even happening?\" Sometimes its cool, sometimes wacky and sometimes you'll skip cutscenes.\r\n\r\n I thought i would be more invested in the story, but all the concepts presented were so beyond me that i just couldn't get into it no matter how hard i tried. The actors..do their job. Dont expect a five star performance. The script is something, the actors seem awkward or maybe they just understand whats going on anymore than us. \r\n\r\nThe gameplay, feels very clunky. Mind you, i certainly feel the weight they want Sam to carry while i play but it just feels jank. I want Sam to stop running, or move a certain way and it either takes forever, or he is to busy stumbling in another direction, due to the balance you have to keep while walking/running. That same jankness carries over to the combat. Which, more often than not, can be annoying. The weapon wheel is just so slow, switching weapons is slow, everything is slow. Getting to the menus, to swap my gear is slow. 80% of the combat sections, specifically with mads mikkelsen character is just playing pickaboo with him and his squad while constantly looking for health/guns. Its not that fun and take forever. But that is what this game is going for.  And dont even get me started on the actual main enemies, the BTs. Everytime you run into them, your not scared, your frustrated because this is the 5-6 time trying to get past them undetected. If you do get detected, which you will because..jank, spend the next few minutes trogging through mud while running away from a giant whale or lion monster.\r\n\r\nThe praise i will give this game however is it does feel like you the player and everyone online is making an effort to build infrastructure to get from point a to point b. Finding a random bike, left by another player, is a godsend. Or being unable to cross a river to find a bridge someone built to get me across is so helpful. The things you/others build or leave behind is this games saving grace. Because its cool to see those elements help me on my journey. That what i build/leave behind can impact others in a positive way. Other games should build up on this gameplay element.\r\n\r\nIf you dont like the first 3-5 hours, it really doesn't get much better and is alot of the same. If you LOVE taking your time with a game, and i mean taking your TIME, then you might like this. It just wasn't for me.",

Doing the same mission. It's really hard to see if it's a filler mission or an actual one. %90 things I've done are just simple meaningless delivery and the dialogue basically goes like \"Chiral delivery connect connect deliver connect america\" with a deeper meaning Kojima is forcing you to take. The basic promise is actually pretty simple and could've been much more effective if the game didn't have an awful writing. It's like teaching a 6 year old kid new words. Sam starts the game as a guy who is trying to interact with people as little as possible while not caring about anything related to connecting the world yet... he does it without any motivation, it just randomly happens right after he rejects everyone and says no I won't help you a minute ago. Characters go on and say please Sam you are the only one who can do this, you are the chosen one, god Norman Reedus you are so cool and here are some rayban glasses go save the world. I really can't bear to explain this further because it really is dumb. \n\nIncredibly bad writing. Don't get me wrong I like the idea and the world itself however, the way Kojima makes the world and characters interact with each other with cringe worthy dialogues with a fucking golden cast like that? Just no.\n\nThe more I try, the worse it gets. I'm going to be bold and say it Konami was right in many situations involving Kojima.\n\nMusic’s good, for some reason you can’t listen to it while walking in a walking simulator but alright I guess.\nThe story’s premise is actually pretty solid.\nThe writing, execution, and pacing are terrible. Explaining same things to a player with different characters for 15 minute straight is a true kojima experience. Every single character is suffering from some kind of mental derangement I am sure of it.\nGameplay isn’t as bad as I expected, but it’s definitely not enjoyable either.\nOverall, a 5/10 at best.\n\nThis game would be crucified if kojimas name werent there.",
