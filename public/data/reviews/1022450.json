One player decides to quit or die and suddenly half of team leave the game, so very often it's pointless to play further as you will often lose by playing current match. Unfortunately recently it's often like that. Other problems are below.\n\n1. Workers going too far from workplace of blocking each other path.\n2. Not balanced nations with OP Italy or USSR.\n3. Slow game development. The game still does not include North American nations, even though plans to add them to the game were made long ago. If you're new player, you won't get bored with unlocking new nations and having fun testing them, because, as I wrote above, each one is quite unique, but old players sometimes could get bored with all or most nations unlocked.\n4. Lack of map variety. I would like to see map types from Age of Empires. But it's a good thing that maps are not manually made and each time they look different, as game include random map generator.\n5. Sometimes it gets laggy, with units teleporting on map (I have very good and stable Internet connection).\n6. Walls building is broken. Often workers leave a gap and you must always watch them.\n7.

      "review": "It's a RTS game with potential, where each nation is somehow different and their soundtrack is good, a game where you start in stone age and go up to industrial age, but at the moment I can't recommend it, mostly because the community is small and still there are many weak players in TDM game mode, destroying the whole experience and leaving other players frustrated. One player decides to quit or die and suddenly half of team leave the game, so very often it's pointless to play further as you will often lose by playing current match. Unfortunately recently it's often like that. Other problems are below.\n\n1. Workers going too far from workplace of blocking each other path.\n2. Not balanced nations with OP Italy or USSR.\n3. Slow game development. The game still does not include North American nations, even though plans to add them to the game were made long ago. If you're new player, you won't get bored with unlocking new nations and having fun testing them, because, as I wrote above, each one is quite unique, but old players sometimes could get bored with all or most nations unlocked.\n4. Lack of map variety. I would like to see map types from Age of Empires. But it's a good thing that maps are not manually made and each time they look different, as game include random map generator.\n5. Sometimes it gets laggy, with units teleporting on map (I have very good and stable Internet connection).\n6. Walls building is broken. Often workers leave a gap and you must always watch them.\n7. This is a minor problem, but they should also add better anti-aliasing option, as game probably use blurry FXAA or TAA. I'm not sure if it's safe to use ReShade with SMAA, to not get banned.\n\nHope that this game will get better in coming years, but right now, sometimes I seriously think about quitting, mostly because of weak players.",

Give new players a token to unlock one country so they can at least see what the game plays like with a country (I understand this is a free game and needs to make money but if people play a match and make all that progress with fun weapon and army types and then have only the option to go abstract basically snatching away all that progress and giving them generic shit then they are more likely to stop playing right then and there.)\r\n\r\n2. Add enemy A.I to the private match so you can play with one other person in a team against A.I and work together\r\n\r\n3. Change the key rebind UI as it will be too confusing for older players and those who don't play much\r\n\r\n4. if there are any differences between countries then hovering over the country in the private match part in the main menu should tell you them.",
