Satisfying to organize the little window boxes for each node such that the lines look nice.\n\nSome notes:\nRatio slider either needs finer control over percentages of the two outputs, or to give the player more agency over choosing the actual ratios. Its job is to be a resource splitter, and it fails at it spectacularly, compared to the built-in splitting of input-to-output connections. \nForcing it to be some multiple of 10% limits its usefulness, when a better implementation would allow for more than 2 outputs with something like an 8:4:1 ratio (which is easier to make with the mergers due to their expanding inputs)\n\nUpgrades need to have an option to dismiss or hide. After I get the permanent 'Antivirus Pro' perk, I don't want to clutter my menu with its inferior version, so I wont buy the upgrade after prestiging. Same thing with obsolete file value upgrades (which I might care about if they improved research output).\nA hide / collapse option would be handy for other menu items, such as the default collector or the part of the node interface of the network limiter / exchanger for whichever internet type I'm not using.\n\nSmall nitpick: the data refiner and pre-analyzer node placers should go in the research tab... otherwise it feels too empty. At least in early-mid game.\n\nAlso, having a different node for each type of file type and coin miner feels clunky and redundant. I could see an implementation of a tool tip based menu / drop down selection thing, with an explanation of how to use it in the tutorial, working quite well...\nThe ability to upgrade my nodes from their construction icons would give them a reason to remain in the menu after placing them. I know certain upgradable nodes can get a second, but like, little orange arrow notification that is bottom center aligned when solo and on each lower corner when duo'd. Same thing would go for the CPU & GPU cores and clock speed.\n\nThe requests tab under achievements needs an indicator that it has unclaimed rewards, ie if you are currently viewing achievements and looking for where the claimables are.\n\nKeyboard shortcuts? (Other than copying / pasting)\no.o\n\nLastly, maybe make the request uploader have a secondary output when throwing things in it that don't fulfill requests? Given that you cant get stuff back out of it... Otherwise it feels a bit useless.\n\nOtherwise, I like this game, and would recommend it if you have enjoyed similar games such as shapez.io or Factorio.

Maybe lean more into requiring optimization to be more important. Instead of having modules auto balance to input, maybe have a hard input cap on modules so you have to figure out the proper ratio of modules to consume a given output of items, sort of factorio like. Also, allocators need finer controls, otherwise you end up having to stack lots to achieve say a 100:1 ratio, whereas if you had decimal granularity you could  handle it with one or two allocators.",

How do you combine them? Well... I have no idea.\r\nI've tried googling it, I've tried doing random ones. I can't work it out.\r\nI know you can use the same one twice, so that makes trial and error take a bit longer.\r\n\r\nIt feels really dumb to have you know how to code to play the game... It's an idle game... gimme a break here, yeah?\r\n\r\nSo I don't pass the IQ test to play the game, that's my main issue with it.\r\n\r\nOther issues include that it's just a complicated mess... I was enjoying sorting it out until I realised there's a prestige mechanic... So you have to spend ages having a nice clean system, putting things together. Which takes quite a long time I'll add... And then you have to... do it again? and again? and again?\r\nThat's not even remotely enjoyable.\r\n\r\nThis is an incremental game, but I wouldn't call it an idle game. Because you have to do a lot to get the numbers to go up.\r\nThere's parts of it where it is essentially just leave it going while you sleep. (Which is why I'm at 9 hours. I don't sleep very long sadly.) Which is fine, it's an idle game with a lot of interaction. I'm okay with that...\r\nBut then you also have to spend ages sorting everything out, then working out what combines with what. In the coding area...\r\nIf the game had a guide to the coding within the game... I wouldn't be so negative on it. Overall, I've enjoyed most of the time I've spent on this.\r\nBut this part of the game really does ruin it for me. Because it feels like there's this weird external knowledge barrier on continuation, and the game doesn't tell you how to play it.\r\nIt'd be like if a game suddenly started speaking French, and just expected you to know how to speak French. Or if Le rédacteur du commentaire s'est soudainement mis à écrire en français et s'attendait simplement à ce que vous suiviez le rythme. (I used google translate, this is probably gibberish. Sorry. I cannot speak enough french to get by. XD)\r\n\r\nThe game does have a guide, what it really should have done is had a link to a bit in the guide where it tells you what the codes are, or said in the tooltip \"Check the guide for details.\"\r\nBut all it does say in the guide is \"Provides code speed based on your contribution level. Contribution level can be upgraded by inserting contribution\" Which is a very weird sentence.\r\nHonestly... I think even if the coding were better explained, I'd still recommend against the game... But less harshly. The prestige mechanic does kill it a bit.\r\n\r\nIt's free though, so even though I recommend against it.... I still recommend you try it for yourself. Because you don't have anything to lose if you don't like it, and chances are you'll enjoy it more than I did if this is the kind of game for you.\r\nSteam asks if I would recommend this game to other players, and my brain takes that literal... I wouldn't... I'd never be in conversation and say \"Oh, you should try Upload labs.\" But here, on this review... Yeah, give it a go, find out for yourself. Good luck. ^_^",

The the addictive part of gameplay without the gameplay.\n\nAs for the actual game? I'll be real, even by Idle game standards this is pretty whatever.\nThe flowchart angle on paper could leave room for nuanced progression, but the reality is that people min-max the fun out of their games for the sake of efficiency, and this game barely has any fun to begin with.\n\nThe progression is slow, and there is no offline progression like most games do to front-load the dopamine spike that gets players engaged for 5 minutes before closing again. If players aim is efficiency and big numbers, their best bet is to have the game open at all times. So if your gameplay loop demands constant computing power from players machines, it better justify itself. And it really doesn't. It takes extremely low effort to make a game like this and them having the gall to expect people to pay for DLC for a game you don't actually playing 90% of the time is absurd.\n\nI'm not sure if it's un-cohesive or too cohesive, I'm just bored. it is surprisingly linear in practice than the Steam page would suggest. If you are deadset on a game like this; there are dozens out there for the very same price of [b]FREE[/b] that are more worth your time.",

Unlike most idle games that have a massive burst of progress and then slow down to a crawl, making you prestige over and over again, Upload labs managed to keep my interest by having more and more mechanics, upgrade paths and things to do. I spent a fair bit of time in organizing everything and setting up proper ratios to make it as efficient as possible. Even without paying I was able to progress a fair bit and get to the portals (which is the prestige mechanic) in a couple of hours.\nThat is where the problems started. The game gives us NO indication that the portals are the version of prestige in this game. It told me it will make my components 100% more efficient, something that a lot of other upgrades state, and proceeded to reset my progress. I didn't even have time to save schematics for the node groups I was using for each file type. It removed any sense of familiarity and ownership I had over the system I'd built. I no longer wanted to invest time into making it more efficient, more organized, better built. I simply wanted to click the button and make number go up since it will reset anyways.\nWhich brings me to the next issue. The schematics system sucks. It doesn't store the connections between the nodes. It simply stores the node types and their relative positions. If your schematic had 10 nodes, you have to hook them up manually every single time. This makes resetting to prestige extremely annoying as you have to manually go through the links again.\nThe game also lacks polish overall. Using the selection tool to select multiple nodes, does not select node groups that you have already created, so if you move your whole system lets say upwards to create more space below, you have to manually set up your node groups again. In the hacking nodes, where you have a limited amount of time to breach them via attack nodes, the hacks can fail if you are playing the game in fast forward but pass if you're playing them at nomal speed if the time is close to running out.\nOverall, 6/10. Good game, but will not recommend investing your time into it.",

I can sell one or billons of crypto and crash the market regardless.\r\n\r\nThe game's mechanics were not balanced, Seemed to me the most optimal money generation was focusing minimal cpu into the biggest task(progams in my case)  processing queue and the smallest (text files)  towards resarch and sell the rest of the cpu usages.   Because you end up bottlenecked by ISP speeds and research speeds. \r\nThe research bottleneck required me to use 4 ratio tasks 9:9:9:1 to put the max files into research without  accumulation and dump the rest of the worthless text files for insignificant cash.\r\n\r\nAudio, images, video...ignored waste of time and money to bother with.  Only the chunkiest and smallest  downloads mattered.\r\n\r\nI think the part that got to me was the concept of compression and \"enhancement\" (ie decompression)\r\n\r\ncompression would reduce filesize and value by 4.\r\nenhancement would increase filesize and value by 4. (and you can see why I called it \"decompression\")\r\n\r\nso what exactly are we enhancing in a text file?  or a program.  it makes no sense.  I added \"enhancement\" to text files to increase their value.  whut?  did it insert make pretend research text like a BS LLM?\r\n\r\nWe can do a checksum after modifying files with the anti virus processes. and it can fail that checksum, and we go back and redownload the same file that magically no longer has a virus?\r\nwhat?\r\n\r\nwouldn't it make more sense to have to download compressed files, and then decompress them, do crc checks, work on them, then make a new  crc, and recompress before uploading them back up ,\r\n\r\nso yea, the pipeline is goofy.  It is  an example of stupidification of games lately.  Like one game I played not to long ago that treated ebony as an ore.  I wanted to slap the developer. People would make arguments like \"its a science fiction game\" or \"its beta\"  \"It's early access\"\r\n\r\nno.....it's stupid.  And kids will play these games and learn and believe that ebony, a wood, is an ore.\r\n\r\nThis game, like the movie \"hackers\".  It is just a dumb form of short lived entertainment full of internet terminology mumbo jumbo. \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmz67ErIRa4\r\n\r\nAnd this game does not allow you to be idle  in this idle game considering the  crypto market design that requires you to sit and wait for the RNG market to go high and click the sell button.\r\n\r\n\r\nin a nutshell, 9 hours in (played it last night for too long)    Take my advice, don't bother. Even free, this is just a waste of time.\r\n\r\nThere are smarter idle games that may  actually teach you something new like \"Cell to Singularity\"",

The only strategy is to put all your resources into creating the latest thing you unlocked.\n\n  [*]Hacking and programming are completely separate and don't interact with the other core mechanics whatsoever, aside from two or three boring multiplier upgrades and a single boost node.\n\n  [*]You can't expand horizontally like you would in a factory builder, because you're hard-capped by your 1-2 network nodes and single CPU+GPU nodes. It's never better to split your resources over multiple generators.\n\n  [*]Resetting is tedious even with schematics, because you need to unlock the nodes you had on your previous prestige before the schematic will create them. You end up rebuilding from scratch either way.\n\n  [*]The reset system only gives you boring resource multipliers. Huge missed opportunity for a skill tree or something that could fix the way that mechanics become obsolete so fast.\n\n  [*]Tedious micromanagement. You're incentivized to never split your resources which means you have to manually disconnect and reconnect your nodes whenever you want to switch file types or outputs.\n\n  [*]Not very good for idle play since progression is so heavily tied to swapping to the next tier of file generation.\n[/list]\n\nI saw some people (with less than two hours played) whining about the microtransactions.

You use these to upload file types and mine cryptocurrency for money. Every upgrade to these using said money is a 100% boost in efficiency flat. With no more of these nodes available, there is no scaling. Upgrading one of them bottlenecks the others, you must then upgrade the others.\n[*] There are 6 file types. They all function exactly the same, they just are a larger size in bytes to upload/download. You start with text and upload until you get the money to unlock the next file type, repeat all 6 types,\n[*] You unlock extra 'refinements' you can do to the file type such as virus scanning to increase its value. The refinements are the same for every file type, operate in the same order.\n[*] You unlock hacking which allows you to get temporary upgrades to increase the speed at which everything moves, but requires you to create an idle loop of increasingly expensive hacking points with no scaling.\n[*] You unlock coding, which works exactly the same as hacking and unlocks upgrades for the current iteration you're on.\n[*] Eventually your progress slows and fails until you 'enter the portal' which gives some multiplicative upgrades and resets everything (think AdVenture Capitalist prestige).\n[*] Restart but w/ the multiplicative upgrades you unlocked.\n[*] Repeat until 100% or bored.\n[/list]\nNow there are some important extra notes to make about this that make me go from \"decent free idle\" to \"no\".\n[list]\n[*] Permanent upgrades are either farmed 5 at a time through rng popups, 20-25 from idle quantity achievements, or hacking popups (increasingly difficult). [b]Or[/b] you can buy $4 daily token option to skip the grind. A lot of the permanent upgrades are necessary for sanity (ex: auto-collectors)\n[*] These tokens are also used to get 2x production boosts that last for a few minutes. [b][i]Or[/i][/b] you can pay [i]$10[/i] to make them permanent. Tthis will just linearly scale everything 2x in an idle game.\n[*] [b][i]This game does not have offline progression.[/i][/b] When you are offline, nothing happens. When you log back on, based on how long you were offline, you earn up to 600 seconds of \"boost time\" where everything goes at 5x speed. You can use tokens to permanently increase the rate of accumulation or the amount by 10%. [b][i][u]Or[/u][/i][/b] you can pay $8 to earn this time while online and increase the total amount you can earn.\n[*] The game is not saved locally. If for whatever reason it shuts down, so do you.\n[/list]\nThe game is decent, but I'd rather have seen it cost a couple dollars and remove the MTX and their push on all 3 for \"level up your supporter badge\".

How do you combine them? Well... I have no idea.\r\nI've tried googling it, I've tried doing random ones. I can't work it out.\r\nI know you can use the same one twice, so that makes trial and error take a bit longer.\r\n\r\nIt feels really dumb to have you know how to code to play the game... It's an idle game... gimme a break here, yeah?\r\n\r\nSo I don't pass the IQ test to play the game, that's my main issue with it.\r\n\r\nOther issues include that it's just a complicated mess... I was enjoying sorting it out until I realised there's a prestige mechanic... So you have to spend ages having a nice clean system, putting things together. Which takes quite a long time I'll add... And then you have to... do it again? and again? and again?\r\nThat's not even remotely enjoyable.\r\n\r\nThis is an incremental game, but I wouldn't call it an idle game. Because you have to do a lot to get the numbers to go up.\r\nThere's parts of it where it is essentially just leave it going while you sleep. (Which is why I'm at 9 hours. I don't sleep very long sadly.) Which is fine, it's an idle game with a lot of interaction. I'm okay with that...\r\nBut then you also have to spend ages sorting everything out, then working out what combines with what. In the coding area...\r\nIf the game had a guide to the coding within the game... I wouldn't be so negative on it. Overall, I've enjoyed most of the time I've spent on this.\r\nBut this part of the game really does ruin it for me. Because it feels like there's this weird external knowledge barrier on continuation, and the game doesn't tell you how to play it.\r\nIt'd be like if a game suddenly started speaking French, and just expected you to know how to speak French. Or if Le rédacteur du commentaire s'est soudainement mis à écrire en français et s'attendait simplement à ce que vous suiviez le rythme. (I used google translate, this is probably gibberish. Sorry. I cannot speak enough french to get by. XD)\r\n\r\nThe game does have a guide, what it really should have done is had a link to a bit in the guide where it tells you what the codes are, or said in the tooltip \"Check the guide for details.\"\r\nBut all it does say in the guide is \"Provides code speed based on your contribution level. Contribution level can be upgraded by inserting contribution\" Which is a very weird sentence.\r\nHonestly... I think even if the coding were better explained, I'd still recommend against the game... But less harshly. The prestige mechanic does kill it a bit.\r\n\r\nIt's free though, so even though I recommend against it.... I still recommend you try it for yourself. Because you don't have anything to lose if you don't like it, and chances are you'll enjoy it more than I did if this is the kind of game for you.\r\nSteam asks if I would recommend this game to other players, and my brain takes that literal... I wouldn't... I'd never be in conversation and say \"Oh, you should try Upload labs.\" But here, on this review... Yeah, give it a go, find out for yourself. Good luck. ^_^",
