The work priority system is limited to \"on\" and \"off\", and you can't say \"make timber from logs whenever I have less than 30 timber\".

      "review": "Okay so I just checked my Steam Review page to see how many reviews I've written, zero...a big fat ZERO! I've got 102 games and had Steam since November 2005, with 1000's of hours of game time across the board. Why have I never written a review? Not sure as there's a number of games I absolutely adore. Medieval Total War 2 - Divide and Conquer especially, Mount & Blade Warband, Kenshi, LOTRO etc etc. \n\nWhy have I decided to review Amazing Cultivation Simulator as my first, with only 21.7 hours playtime? Because IT'S AMAZING, it's fits EVERYTHING that I want in a game and the depth it's phenomenal. I haven't even touched the sides yet. For me, currently, it's perfect!\n\nI stumbled open this game earlier in the week when I was searching for a colony sim I could actually enjoy and get my head around, but what I found was something MUCH MORE than a colony sim. It's perfect, just perfect. And I was told it's insanely complicated. I haven't felt that at all, sure there's so much depth and it will only get deeper and more involved as I progress but it's currently at a slow and manageable pace which is what I love.\n\nI couldn't get my head around Dwarf Fortress, or even Rimworld, after the tutorial I no longer want to play, and I've tried it a number of times. I've wanted to like them but I can't, for some unknown reason. After finding out about ACS on a Colony Sim Reddit post I decided to investigate, and I bought the game. I tried working my way through the MANY tutorials but stopped after a while...there's LOADS explaining many different aspects of ACS interface and systems. There was also an issue a couple of times with translation in English where the tutorial won't progress unless you switch to Chinese and restart, which I did, twice or thrice. THERE IS NO ISSUE IN THE MAIN GAME, only a few short tutorials, but can be over come by using a Translate camera app on your phone and then switching back to English for the next tutorial.\n\nOver the last week I tried playing another 5 or so other games, colony sims too, including Rimworld, but couldn't get into any of them. Lord's and Villains came closest, and Ascent to Ashes even closer, but this is an Early Access game with a number of bugs and not for me at the moment, in the future for sure.\n\nSo switching back and forth and ignoring ACS, not starting a proper game, last night I decided to finally just go ahead and start a proper game without completely all the many tutorials (they are no compulsory obviously). Going in blind they say, no guides, no Wiki's. So I start the game...maybe 8pm last night...I end up logging off at 4:08am - my last save. I couldn't put it down. And yes, this has happened in other games sure, but I've come back on today, and tonight, and only stopped to write this as I've just cooked some food.\n\nI finally created a Sect, my Sect Leader was disappointed in her mood as she had so much shame around being labelled a 'Shit Eater'...yes I got her to eat 'Male Turtle Faeces' not sure why but I did okay. A member of another Sect visited me and sat on the spare cushion in my self made and named 'Cultivation Room'. The temperature exceeded 60 degrees C, not realising he was passed out and dying on the floor next to my Sect Leader, who was still cultivating her Fire Law, hence the heat needed in the room. As he was dying of heatstroke I had two options, interrogate to learn his secrets (apparently that would speed up his death though) or 'Search', I decided to get one of my disciples to search his drying body, and found my first artefact! Lucky me, unlucky for him. He died, and his corresponding Sect became understandably angry with my Sect for letting him die in my care, so I buried him - in a tomb! This was in case they wished to visit him, wanted to pay him at least some respect for kindly gifting me my first artefact.\n\nI got a dog, a puppy, at first I really thought I'd made the wrong decision as he kept biting and wounding my disciples! Then popping in their beds, urinating in the crops, eat all the cooked food and destroying my buildings! But I've trained him, now he can chop trees just by his magic breath! And mine ore the same way too! He can carry things and kill things and break things. But he learns, and I'm sure he will grow too, although I hope not much as I kinda like him at his current \"puppy\" size!\n\nI have not even broken the ice on this game, only have 5 disciples, one died randomly, think he was cooking something and somehow died very early on.  I'm still learning and there's a lot of options still not open to me. But the detail, the little interactions between characters, the Feng Shui, the different minerals and elements and spells and laws etc etc etc. I'm glad I can take this game slow, and I feel it is at my own pace currently. I only have one achievement out of the 401 available. That's for playing over a certain amount of time in a row! The others are apparently only unlocked on the harder difficulty level, which is how it's meant to be played apparently. I await that day! For now I'm still learning, and I'M LOVING IT! \n\nWill update if I feel the need, if I don't, and my hours have increased, then just knows this - THIS MAY WELL JUST BE MY PERFECT GAME! :D :D Welcome to the World of Cultivation! \n\nHare Krishna x",

      "review": "Okay so I just checked my Steam Review page to see how many reviews I've written, zero...a big fat ZERO! I've got 102 games and had Steam since November 2005, with 1000's of hours of game time across the board. Why have I never written a review? Not sure as there's a number of games I absolutely adore. Medieval Total War 2 - Divide and Conquer especially, Mount & Blade Warband, Kenshi, LOTRO etc etc. \n\nWhy have I decided to review Amazing Cultivation Simulator as my first, with only 21.7 hours playtime? Because IT'S AMAZING, it's fits EVERYTHING that I want in a game and the depth it's phenomenal. I haven't even touched the sides yet. For me, currently, it's perfect!\n\nI stumbled open this game earlier in the week when I was searching for a colony sim I could actually enjoy and get my head around, but what I found was something MUCH MORE than a colony sim. It's perfect, just perfect. And I was told it's insanely complicated. I haven't felt that at all, sure there's so much depth and it will only get deeper and more involved as I progress but it's currently at a slow and manageable pace which is what I love.\n\nI couldn't get my head around Dwarf Fortress, or even Rimworld, after the tutorial I no longer want to play, and I've tried it a number of times. I've wanted to like them but I can't, for some unknown reason. After finding out about ACS on a Colony Sim Reddit post I decided to investigate, and I bought the game. I tried working my way through the MANY tutorials but stopped after a while...there's LOADS explaining many different aspects of ACS interface and systems. There was also an issue a couple of times with translation in English where the tutorial won't progress unless you switch to Chinese and restart, which I did, twice or thrice. THERE IS NO ISSUE IN THE MAIN GAME, only a few short tutorials, but can be over come by using a Translate camera app on your phone and then switching back to English for the next tutorial.\n\nOver the last week I tried playing another 5 or so other games, colony sims too, including Rimworld, but couldn't get into any of them. Lord's and Villains came closest, and Ascent to Ashes even closer, but this is an Early Access game with a number of bugs and not for me at the moment, in the future for sure.\n\nSo switching back and forth and ignoring ACS, not starting a proper game, last night I decided to finally just go ahead and start a proper game without completely all the many tutorials (they are no compulsory obviously). Going in blind they say, no guides, no Wiki's. So I start the game...maybe 8pm last night...I end up logging off at 4:08am - my last save. I couldn't put it down. And yes, this has happened in other games sure, but I've come back on today, and tonight, and only stopped to write this as I've just cooked some food.\n\nI finally created a Sect, my Sect Leader was disappointed in her mood as she had so much shame around being labelled a 'Shit Eater'...yes I got her to eat 'Male Turtle Faeces' not sure why but I did okay. A member of another Sect visited me and sat on the spare cushion in my self made and named 'Cultivation Room'. The temperature exceeded 60 degrees C, not realising he was passed out and dying on the floor next to my Sect Leader, who was still cultivating her Fire Law, hence the heat needed in the room. As he was dying of heatstroke I had two options, interrogate to learn his secrets (apparently that would speed up his death though) or 'Search', I decided to get one of my disciples to search his drying body, and found my first artefact! Lucky me, unlucky for him. He died, and his corresponding Sect became understandably angry with my Sect for letting him die in my care, so I buried him - in a tomb! This was in case they wished to visit him, wanted to pay him at least some respect for kindly gifting me my first artefact.\n\nI got a dog, a puppy, at first I really thought I'd made the wrong decision as he kept biting and wounding my disciples! Then popping in their beds, urinating in the crops, eat all the cooked food and destroying my buildings! But I've trained him, now he can chop trees just by his magic breath! And mine ore the same way too! He can carry things and kill things and break things. But he learns, and I'm sure he will grow too, although I hope not much as I kinda like him at his current \"puppy\" size!\n\nI have not even broken the ice on this game, only have 5 disciples, one died randomly, think he was cooking something and somehow died very early on.  I'm still learning and there's a lot of options still not open to me. But the detail, the little interactions between characters, the Feng Shui, the different minerals and elements and spells and laws etc etc etc. I'm glad I can take this game slow, and I feel it is at my own pace currently. I only have one achievement out of the 401 available. That's for playing over a certain amount of time in a row! The others are apparently only unlocked on the harder difficulty level, which is how it's meant to be played apparently. I await that day! For now I'm still learning, and I'M LOVING IT! \n\nWill update if I feel the need, if I don't, and my hours have increased, then just knows this - THIS MAY WELL JUST BE MY PERFECT GAME! :D :D Welcome to the World of Cultivation! \n\nHare Krishna x",

I didnt care much for Rimworld but the mythos was enough to engage me.  \n\nPros: \nIts a game that can be both active and passive, you can sit up and be fully engaged microing everything, or you can play more passively, set things up and leave it running in the background while you do other things, just looking over when a notification pops up\nIt is honestly incredibly indepth on how far it goes down the cultivation development.\n\nCons: \nAll that indepth is pretty poorly explained.  I know is pretty much a meme that strategy games have sucky tutorials, but they dont do a good job of explaining even what they do cover, and some of them dont even work in the english language it gets stuck.  Had to switch to Chinese use one of those translate camera apps, which is kinda ridiculous.  Again, its a problem with the genre as a whole, but having to go through a fan made 100 page guide on a topic the game doesnt even touch is ridiculous (plants awakening intelligence in this specific case)\nAlso, the game is missing a couple convience mechanics Rimworld has.  You can prolly find mods to add them in, but I nvr saw them. Setting a 'maintain order' on keeping food in stock, you couldnt tell them \"make 100 if meals is less than 100\" for example",

      "review": "Recommended, because this game delivers what it promises: A RimWorld-like base game, overlaid with all the classic xianxia tropes: cultivation, warring sects, inner and outer disciples, manuals describing powerful techniques, and popular Daoist-inspired mysticism.\n\nThe RimWorld-like portions of the game are a bit basic. The work priority system is limited to \"on\" and \"off\", and you can't say \"make timber from logs whenever I have less than 30 timber\". But unlike some RimWorld knockoffs, you do need to pay attention to individual disciples, including the outer disciples who actually do the work. As a RimWorld-like game, it's a decent B-tier.\n\nInner disciples require significant individualized attention, because they're your major weapons, your adventurers, and your magic crafters. The game mechanics support the literary tropes here: the main job of your inner disciples is to become ever more powerful.\n\nBut xianxia is all about gaining power through esoteric knowledge. And this game really leans into \"esoteric knowledge\" mechanically: You will need to learn Daoist elementalist interactions. You will need to care about the feng shui of your bedrooms. You will be constantly searching for secret manuals and rare natural treasures. You will care about the cultivation potential of your recruits. You will search for advanced cultivation paths (and each path works differently). The game is full of subsystems and hidden knowledge.\n\nThere are also some things to be aware of. Several of the tutorials have been broken for years. The English-language documentation and wikis only scratch the surface. There are some occasional bugs in actual game play.\n\nBut overall, this is a positive review, because if you want a B-tier RimWorld base with xianxia tropes, and if you want to search for esoteric knowledge in order to gain ridiculous power, the game delivers. It's a very solid match between mechanics and tropes.",
